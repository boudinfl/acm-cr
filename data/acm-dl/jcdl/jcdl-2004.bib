abstract = {The Digital Collection and Archives (DCA) in partnership with Academic Technology (AT) at Tufts University developed a digital library solution for long-term storage and integration of existing digital collections, such as Perseus, TUSK, Bolles and Artifact. In this paper, we describe the Tufts Digital Library (TDL) architecture TDL is an extensible, modular, flexible and scalable architecture that uses Fedora at its core. The extensible nature of the TDL architecture allows for seamless integration of collections that may be developed in the future, while leveraging the extensive tools that are available as part of individual digital library applications at Tufts. We describe the functionality and implementation details of the individual components of TDL. Two applications that have successfully interfaced with TDL are presented. We conclude with some remarks about the future development of TDL.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on the multifaceted use of the OAI-PMH in a repository architecture designed to store digital assets at the Research Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), and to make the stored assets available in a uniform way to various downstream applications. In the architecture, the MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration Language is used as the XML-based format to represent complex digital objects. Upon ingestion, these objects are stored in a multitude of autonomous OAI-PMH repositories An OAI--PMH compliant Repository Index keeps track of the creation and location of all those repositories, whereas an Identifier Resolver keeps track of the location of individual objects. An OAI-PMH Federator is introduced as a single-point-of-access to downstream harvesters. It hides the complexity of the environment to those harvesters, and allows them to obtain transformations of stored objects While the proposed architecture is described in the context of the LANL library, the paper will also touch on its more general applicability.},

The requirements emerged from the definition of the services to support, with a special focus on scalability, and from the decision to give a special attention to community building standards, open solutions, and reusable and cost effective components. The generic bibliographic metadata format in this project is UNIMARC, and the structural metadata is METS. The URN identifiers are processed and resolved as simple but very effective PURL identifiers. The storage for immediate access is provided by the LUSTRE file system, and by ARCO, a locally developed GRID architecture, for long term preservation All these components run on Linux servers, as also the middleware for access based in the FEDORA framework.},

abstract = {There are two main kinds of approach to considering usability of any system: empirical and analytical. Empirical techniques involve testing systems with users, whereas analytical techniques involve usability personnel assessing systems using established theories and methods. We report here on a set of studies in which four different techniques were applied to various digital libraries, focusing on the strengths, limitations and scope of each approach. Two of the techniques, Heuristic Evaluation and Cognitive Walkthrough, were applied in text-book fashion, because there was no obvious way to contextualize them to the Digital Libraries (DL) domain. For the third, Claims Analysis, it was possible to develop a set of re-usable scenarios and personas that relate the approach specifically to DL development. The fourth technique, CASSM, relates explicitly to the DL domain by combining empirical data with an analytical approach. We have found that Heuristic Evaluation and Cognitive Walkthrough only address superficial aspects of interface design (but are good for that), whereas Claims Analysis and CASSM can help identify deeper conceptual difficulties (but demand greater skill of the analyst). However, none fit seamlessly with existing digital library development practices, highlighting an important area for further work to support improved usability.},

abstract = {The Alexandria Digital Earth Prototype (ADEPT) Project (1999--2004) builds upon the Alexandria Digital Library Project (1994--1999) to add functions and services for undergraduate teaching to a digital library of geospatial resources. The 'Digital Learning Environment' (DLE) services are being developed and evaluated iteratively over the course of this research project. In the 2002--2003 academic year, the DLE was implemented during the fall and spring terms in undergraduate geography courses at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). Evaluation of the fall term implementation identified design issues of time and complexity for creating and organizing course domain knowledge. The spring term implementation added new services to integrate course content into class presentation formats. The implementation was evaluated via interviews with the course instructor, development staff, and students, and by observations (in person and videotaped) of the course. Results indicated that usability and functionality for the instructor had increased between the two course offerings Students found classroom presentations to be useful for understanding concepts, and Web access to the presentations useful for study and review. Assessments of student learning suggest modest improvements over time Developers are now applying lessons learned during these implementations to improve the system for subsequent implementation in the 2003--2004 academic year.},

Digital libraries of trails offer advantages over paper guidebooks in that they are more accurate, dynamic and not limited to the experience of the author(s). The basic representation of a trail is a GPS track log, recorded as recreators travel on trails. As users complete trips, the GPS track logs of their trips are submitted to the central library voluntarily. A major problem is that track logs will overlap and intersect each other. We present a method for the combination of overlapping and intersecting GPS track logs to create a network of GPS trails. Each trail segment in the network can then be characterized by automatic and manual means, producing a digital library of trails. We also describe the TopoFusion system which creates, manages and visualizes GPS data, including GPS networks.},

Many physical characteristics of a book-its size, heft, the patina of use on its pages and so on-communicate ambient qualities of the document it represents. In contrast, the experience of accessing and exploring digital library documents is often dull. The emphasis is utilitarian; technophile rather than bibliophile. We have extended the page-turning algorithm we reported at last year's JCDL into a scaleable, systematic approach that allows users to view and interact with realistic visualizations of any textual-based document in a Greenstone collection. Here, we further motivate the approach, illustrate the system in use, discuss the system architecture and present a user evaluation Our work leads us to believe that far from being a whimsical gimmick, physical book models can usefully complement conventional document viewers and increase the perceived value of a digital library system.},

abstract = {Software tools, including Web browsers, e-books, electronic document formats, search engines, and digital libraries are changing the way people read, making it easier for them to find and view documents. However, while these tools provide significant help with short-term reading projects involving small numbers of documents, they provide less help with longer-term reading projects, in which a topic is to be understood in depth by reading many documents. For such projects, readers must find and manage many documents and citations, remember what has been read, and prioritize what to read next. This paper describes three integrated software tools that facilitate in-depth reading. A first tool extracts citation information from documents. A second finds on-line documents from their citations. The last is a document corpus browser that uses a zoomable user interface to show a corpus at multiple granularities while supporting reading tasks that take days, weeks, or longer. We describe these tools and the design principles that motivated them.},

abstract = {Structured or fielded metadata is the basis for many digital library services, including searching and browsing. Yet, little is known about the impact of using structure on the effectiveness of such services. In this paper, we investigate a key research question: do structured queries improve effectiveness in DL searching? To answer this question, we empirically compared the use of unstructured queries to the use of structured queries. We then tested the capability of a simple Bayesian network system, built on top of a DL retrieval engine, to infer the best structured queries from the keywords entered by the user. Experiments performed with 20 subjects working with a DL containing a large collection of computer science literature clearly indicate that structured queries, either manually constructed or automatically generated, perform better than their unstructured counterparts, in the majority of cases. Also, automatic structuring of queries appears to be an effectiveand viable alternative to manual structuring that may significantly reduce the burden on users.},

In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of exploiting the Web as the corpus source to translate unknown query terms for cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) in digital libraries. We propose a Web-based term translation approach to determine effective translations for unknown query terms by mining bilingual search-result pages obtained from a real Web search engine. This approach can enhance the construction of a domain-specific bilingual lexicon and benefit CLIR services in a digital library that only has monolingual document collections Very promising results have been obtained in generating effective translation equivalents for many unknown terms, including proper nouns, technical terms and Web query terms.},

We show by experiment that it is possible to recover readable text from objects without physically opening or damaging them. In handling damaged collections, conservators often face a choice between two frustrating alternatives: indefinite preservation without analysis, or irreversible physical harm for the sake of potential discovery. We believe that this work creates a new opportunity that embraces both the need to preserve and the possibility for complete analysis.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to displaying and browsing a digital library collection, a set of Greek vases in the Perseus digital library. Our design takes advantage of three-dimensional graphics to preserve context even while the user focuses in on a single item. In a typical digital library user interface, a user can either get an overview for context or else see a single selected item, sacrificing the context view. In our 3D Vase Museum, the user can navigate seamlessly from a high level scatterplot-like plan view to a perspective overview of a subset of the collection, to a view of an individual item, to retrieval of data associated with that item, all within the same virtual room and without any mode change or special command. We present this as an example of a solution to the problem of focus-plus-context in information visualization. We developed 3D models from the 2D photographs in the collection and placed them in our 3D virtual room. We evaluated our approach by comparing it to the conventional interface in Perseus using tasks drawn from archaeology courses and found a clear improvement Subjects who used our 3D Vase Museum performed the tasks 33% better and did so nearly three times faster.},

However, because most focused crawlers use local search algorithms to traverse the Web space, they could be easily trapped within a limited sub-graph of the Web that surrounds the starting URLs and build domain-specific collections that are not comprehensive and diverse enough to scientists and researchers. In this study, we investigated the problems of traditional focused crawlers caused by local search algorithms and proposed a new crawling approach, meta-search enhanced focused crawling, to address the problems. We conducted two user evaluation experiments to examine the performance of our proposed approach and the results showed that our approach could build domain-specific collections with higher quality than traditional focused crawling techniques.},

abstract = {A large amount of research, technical and professional documents are available today in digital formats Digital libraries are created to facilitate search and retrieval of information supplied by the documents. These libraries may span an entire area of interest (e.g., computer science) or be limited to documents within a small organization. While tools that index, classify, rank and retrieve documents from such libraries are important, it would be worthwhile to complement these tools with information available on the Web. We propose one such technique that uses a topical crawler driven by the information extracted from a research document. The goal of the crawler is to harvest a collection of Web pages that are focused on the topical subspaces associated with the given document. The collection created through Web crawling is further processed using lexical and linkage analysis. The entire process is automated and uses machine learning techniques to both guide the crawler as well as analyze the collection it fetches. A report is generated at the end that provides visual cues and information to the researcher.},

Second, automatically derived document-concept relationships are a necessary precondition for real-world deployment of many dynamic interfaces. The current study compares concept learning strategies based on three document representations: keywords, titles, and full-text. In statistical and user-based studies, human-created keywords provide significant improvements in concept learning over both title-only and full-text representations.},

Three promising advances in design theory are reviewed - reference tasks, design experiments, and design genres. Each approach advocates the creation of 'intermediate' constructs as vehicles for knowledge building and knowledge sharing across design and research projects. One purpose of an intermediate construct is to formulate finer-grained models that describe and explain the relationship between key design features and the cognitive and social dimensions of the context of use. Three models are proposed and used as thought experiments to analyze the utility of these approaches to educational digital library design and evaluation: digital libraries as cognitive tools, component repositories, and knowledge networks.},

The ADEPT education and evaluation team interviewed professors about their use of geography information as they prepare for class lectures, as compared to their research activities. We found that professors desired the ability to search by concept (erosion, continental drift, etc ) as well as geographic location, and that personal research collections were an important source of instructional materials. Resources in geo-spatial digital libraries are typically described by location, but are rarely described by concept or educational application. This paper presents implications for the design of an educational digital library from our observations of the lecture preparation process. Findings include functionality requirements for digital libraries and implications for the notion of digital libraries as a shared information environment. The functional requirements include definitions and enhancements of searching capabilities, the ability to contribute and to share personal collections of resources, and the capability to manipulate data and images.},

abstract = {As large collections of videos become one key component of digital libraries, there is an urgent need of semantic video classification and feature subset selection to enable more effective video database organization and retrieval. However, most existing techniques for classifier training require a large number of labeled samples to learn correctly and suffer from the problems of context and concept uncertainty when only a limited number of labeled samples are available. To address the problems of context and concept uncertainty, we have proposed a novel framework to achieve incremental classifier training by integrating a limited number of labeled samples with a large number of unlabeled samples. Specifically, the contributions of this paper include: (a) Using the salient objects to achieve a middle-level understanding of video contents and enhance the quality of features on discriminating among different semantic video concepts; (b) Modeling the semantic video concepts by using the finite mixture models to approximate the class distributions of the relevant salient objects; (c) Developing an adaptive EM algorithm to integratethe unlabeled samples to enable incremental classifier training and address the problem of context uncertainty; (d) Proposing a cost-sensitive video classification technique to address the problem of concept uncertainty over time; (e) Supporting automatic video annotation via semantic classification Our experimental results in a certain domain of medical education videos have also been provided a convincing proof of our conclusions.},

abstract = {Automatic generation of semantic metadata describing spatial relations is highly desirable for image digital libraries Relative spatial relations between objects in an image convey important information about the image. Because the perception of spatial relations is subjective, we propose a novel framework for automatic metadata generation based on fuzzy k-NN classification that generates fuzzy semantic metadata describing spatial relations between objects in an image. For each pair of objects of interest, the corresponding R-Histogram is computed and used as input for a set of fuzzy k--NN classifiers. The R-Histogram is a quantitative representation of spatial relations between two objects The outputs of the classifiers are soft class labels for each of the following eight spatial relations: 1) LEFT OF, 2) RIGHT OF, 3) ABOVE, 4) BELOW, 5) NEAR, 6) FAR, 7) INSIDE, 8) OUTSIDE Because the classifier-training stage involves annotating the training images manually, it is desirable to use as few training images as possible. To address this issue, we applied existing prototype selection techniques and also devised two new extensions. We evaluated the performance of different fuzzy k-NN algorithms and prototype selection algorithms empirically on both synthetic and real images. Preliminary experimental results show that our system is able to obtain good annotation accuracy (92%--98% on synthetic images and 82%--93% on real images) using only a small training set (4--5 images).},

Broadcast news has a very stable structure and every segment has its specific purpose. Video classification can support fundamental understanding of the structure of the video and the content. The variety of video content makes it hard to classify; however, it also provides multimodal information Our approach tries to solve two important issues of multimodal classification. The first one is to select few discriminative features from many raw features and the second one is to efficiently combine multiple sources. We applied Fisher's Linear Discriminant (FLD) for feature selection and concatenated the projections into a single synthesized feature vector as the combination strategy. Experimental results on the 2003 TRECVID news video archive show that our approach achieves very robust and accurate performance.},

abstract = {As part of a more extensive study of reading-related practices, we have explored how people share information they encounter in their everyday reading as a complement to the more traditional digital library focus on sharing intentionally retrieved materials. In twenty contextual interviews in home and work place settings, we investigated how people encounter and save published material in the form of paper and electronic clippings. We found that sharing forms a significant use for encountered materials. Furthermore, the function of these clippings extends far beyond a simple exchange of content to inform the recipient; in fact, the content itself may have little immediate value to the recipient. We also found the practice to be ubiquitous: all of our participants had both shared clippings with others and received them themselves. Specifically, this paper reports on: (1) how sharing encountered items fits into the broader spectrum of clipping practices; (2) the function and value of the shared information; and (3) the social role of sharing the encountered information We conclude that from a technological standpoint, we should think beyond an email model for sharing encountered information and, from a social perspective, we should attend to how sharing this sort of material contributes to the strength of social ties outside of a traditional information needs framework.},

In this paper, we present and experiment with hybrid recommender algorithms that combine Collaborative Filtering and Content-based. Filtering to recommend research papers to users. Our hybrid algorithms combine the strengths of each filtering approach to address their individual weaknesses. We evaluated our algorithms through offline experiments on a database of 102, 000 research papers, and through an online experiment with 110 users. For both experiments we used a dataset created from the CiteSeer repository of computer science research papers. We developed separate English and Portuguese versions of the interface and specifically recruited American and Brazilian users to test for cross-cultural effects. Our results show that users value paper recommendations, that the hybrid algorithms can be successfully combined, that different algorithms are more suitable for recommending different kinds of papers, and that users with different levels of experience perceive recommendations differently These results can be applied to develop recommender systems for other types of digital libraries.},

abstract = {With the growth of digital music, content-based music retrieval (CBMR) has attracted increasingly attention. For most CBMR systems, the task is to return music objects similar to query in syntactic properties such as pitch and interval contour sequence. These approaches provide users the capability to look for music that has been heard. However, sometimes, listeners are looking, not for music they have been known, but for music that is new to them. Moreover, people sometimes want to retrieve music that "feels like" another music object or a music style. To the best of our knowledge, no published work investigates the content-based music style retrieval. This paper describes an approach for CBMR by melody style. We proposed four types of query specification for melody style query. The output of the melody style query is a music list ranked by the degree of relevance, in terms of music style, to the query. We developed the melody style mining algorithm to obtain the melody style classification rules. The style ranking is determined by the style classification rules. The experiment showed the proposed approach provides a satisfactory way for query by melody style.},

Projects supported by governments and academics can only cover a small part of the world's heritage in both time and space dimensions. The preservation coverage problem is most serious in domains where sources of intellectual and cultural heritage may diminish or disappear over time. A central notion that helps resolve these issues is to facilitate global reach of digital technology to sources of valuable heritage. We propose an approach to exploit non-institutional resources for wider participation and coverage in digital heritage endeavor. The approach attempts to replicate institutional digital heritage work by teaming up non-institutional resources and providing standard practice.},

By periodically comparing preservation metadata for digital objects in a collection with a software version registry, potential object obsolescence can be detected and a notification message sent to the relevant agent. By making preservation software modules available as Web services and describing them semantically using a machine-processable ontology (OWL-S), the most appropriate preservation service(s) for each object can then be automatically discovered, composed and invoked by software agents (with optional human input at critical decision-making steps). We believe that this approach represents a significant advance towards providing a viable, cost-effective solution to the long term preservation of large-scale collections of digital objects.},

The e-Depot is built according to the recommendations in the OAIS reference model and is dedicated to the long-term storage of and access to large quantities of digital publications. To control safe storage and provide for future rendering of the digital documents, extra functionality was needed. Therefore, at the same time the system was taken into production, a joint KB/IBM project group started with the design, development and implementation of the Preservation Manager. This system provides the functionality for defining and managing the technical environment needed to render the electronic resources stored in DIAS.

abstract = {Due to name abbreviations, identical names, name misspellings, and pseudonyms inpublications or bibliographies (citations), an author may have multiple names and multiple authors may share the same name. Such name ambiguity affects the performance of document retrieval, web search, database integration, and may cause improper attribution to authors. This paper investigates two supervised learning approaches to disambiguate authors in the citations. One approach uses the naive Bayes probability model, a generative model; the other uses Support Vector Machines(SVMs) and the vector space representation of citations, a discriminative model. Both approaches utilize three types of citation attributes: co-author names, the title of the paper, and the title of the journal or proceeding. We illustrate these two approaches on two types of data, one collected from the web, mainly publication lists from homepages, the other collected from the DBLPcitation databases.},

abstract = {Today's web is so huge and diverse that it arguably reflects the real world. For this reason, searching the web is a promising approach to find things in the real world. This paper presents NEXAS, an extension to web search engines that attempts to find real-worldentities relevant to a topic. Its basic idea is to extract proper names from the web pages retrieved for the topic. A main advantage of this approach is that users can query any topic and learn about relevant real-world entities without dedicated databases for the topic. In particular, we focus on an application for finding authoritative people from the web. This application is practically important because once personal names are obtained, they can lead users from the web to managed information stored in digital libraries. To explore effective ways of finding people, we first examine the distribution of Japanese personal names by analyzing about 50 million Japanese web pages. We observe that personal names appear frequently on the web, but the distribution is highly influenced by automatically generated texts. To remedy the bias and find widely acknowledged people accurately, we utilize the number of web servers containing a name instead of the number of web pages. We show its effectiveness by an experiment covering a wide range oftopics. Finally, we demonstrate several examples and suggest possible applications.},

abstract = {We developed two browsers to support large personal photo collections on PDAs. Our first browser is based on a traditional, folder-based layout that utilizes either the user's manually created organization structure, or a system-generated structure. Our second browser uses a novel interface that is based on a vertical, zoomable timeline. This timeline browser does not require users to organize their photos, but instead, relies solely on system-generated structure. Our system creates a hierarchical structure of the user's photos by applying time-based clustering to identify subsets of photos that are likely to be related. In a user experiment, we compared users' searching and browsing performance across these browsers, using each user's own photo collection. Photo collection sizes varied between 500 and 3000 photographs Our results show that our timeline browser is at least as effective for searching and browsing tasks as a traditional browser that requires users to manually organize their photos.},

By using the inherent redundancy of large scale collections, each candidate answer found by the system is triangulated (confirmed or disconfirmed) against other possible answers.

abstract = {Today people typically read and annotate printed documents even if they are obtained from electronic sources like digital libraries If there is a reason for them to share these personal annotations online, they must re-enter them. Given the advent of better computer support for reading and annotation, including tablet interfaces, will people ever share their personal digital ink annotations as is, or will they make substantial changes to them? What can we do to anticipate and support the transition from personal to public annotations? To investigate these questions, we performed a study to characterize and compare students' personal annotations as they read assigned papers with those they shared with each other using an online system. By analyzing over 1, 700 annotations, we confirmed three hypotheses: (1) only a small fraction of annotations made while reading are directly related to those shared in discussion; (2) some types of annotations - those that consist of anchors in the text coupled with margin notes - are more apt to be the basis of public commentary than other types of annotations; and (3) personal annotations undergo dramatic changes when they are shared in discussion, both in content and in how they are anchored to the source document. We then use these findings to explore ways to support the transition from personal to public annotations.},

Users create a visualization of search results while selecting and organizing materials for their current activity. Additionally, metadata applicators have been added to VKB. This interface allows the rapid addition of metadata to documents and aids the user in the extraction of existing metadata for application to other documents. A study was performed to compare the selection and organization of documents in VKB to the commonly used tools ofa Web browser and a word processor. This study shows the value of visual workspaces for such effort but points to the need for subdocument level objects, ephemeral visualizations, and support for moving from visual representations to metadata.},

abstract = {Virtual museums provide ways to capture the content of a real museum in a digital (electronic) form and make this digital form more universally available. This poster describes a novel method for digitally recording not only individual museum pieces, but entire museum exhibits (consisting of one or more rooms or spaces). The methodology allows anyone with access to the internet or a PC to experience anywhere, anytime, any part of the museum's collection or exhibits (past, present and future). Users can explore the museum exhibits in a virtual reality that is both spatially accurate and visually compelling. All objects and 3D scenes are seen in precise full color photographic quality detail. The scene and objects are polygonal meshes representing the surfaces of objects. This permits making measurements directly on the scene with millimeter precision. The methodology, its application to capturing museum exhibits, and examples of exhibits recorded using this technique are described. This work is part of the Virseum project (http://ils unc edu/bmh/virseum) at the School of Information and Library Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC). In addition to the standard capture of items and exhibits for virtual access, this methodology opens the door for many other applications, including the design of virtual (never physically implemented) exhibits and pieces.},

abstract = {New classes of services for digital libraries have been explored in there search community with many now being tested and deployed in real-world settings. Unfortunately, there have been problems, some predicted and some unforeseen, in the development of these services. Moreover, a number of problems have been identified as becoming critical in the future, especially the difficulties as sociated with preservation of archives of digital content when data formats and media both have limited life spans. We have analyzed a number of these services in a research library (personal collection management, annotation, institutional repositories, and learning object repositories) in terms of their user and task requirements for three prototypical users: a researcher, a teacher and a student. Given these, we develop a unified conceptual model of how these services should work together in collaborative situations and some of the requirements for systems and service organizations that might implement them. This model centers around a vision of the digital library as the hub of a personalized, integrated information management environment. In particular we note the importance of: a flexible collection model that encompasses traditional collections managed by librarians, community collections managed by either professionals or users, and private, individual collections; both synchronous and asynchronous interactions between users and data; integration between library services and tools for using the information managed by the library user annotations as metadata associated with documents and document fragments and the integration of this facility with metadata search; a data model that provides universal, granular access to the contents of documents and other resources whether they are structured, semi-structured or unstructured; a data security model that provides full support for a range of private to semi-public to fully public data and metadata for users and user communities; and simple, flexible and integrated control of privacy, security, and integrity of all such data and metadata. Beyond these, one significant observation that deserves greater emphasis is the need to provide direct and sophisticated support for a variety of epistemic communities in any such digital library. In particular, both users and communities need new tools to organize and use the information they are collecting in the context of their personal and collective knowledge. The claim is that for these patterns of use, it is less useful to provide universal ontological models orcategory hierarchies than it is to provide sophisticated tools to allow both automatic and user-directed semantic categories and relations to be defined, refined and adapted for information management in context. Finally, this analysis reveals a set oftechnical requirements that highlight a number of critical gaps in the conceptual integration of the services and in the infrastructure underlying theircurrent implementations. One model for building such set of facilities takes the traditional three-tier enterprise application model and adapts it for use as a layered application model for integrated data-driven applications We then consider current and potential technologies for implementing this model and suggest that the best hope for a solution that meets both user and technical needs lies in a combination of integrated services built on a document modelling and collaboration infrastructure thatwe call NODAL, the Network-Oriented Document Abstraction Language. We illustrate how this model may enable even the most ambitious visions of the potential of the collaborative digital library.},

abstract = {This research used diffusion of innovation theory to explore factors that influence adoption of digital libraries for electronic theses and dissertations (ETD-DL) among members of the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations (NDLTD) Communication channels were categorized as being either interpersonal or mediated, and the perceived importance of these channels was assessed both within and between organizations. A web-based survey collected data from the 133 universities in 26 countries that were NDLTD members in December 2002. Respondents were members of the university's 'ETD Committee' and represented academic administrators, faculty, librarians, and computer systems specialists. Surveys were received from 95 respondents representing 65 universities in 14 countries. Twenty-one of these universities were outside the United States, and represented countries with a wide range of economic development.Results provide insights into university attitudes towards distributed digital libraries. For example, results suggest that interpersonal channels of communication about digital library adoption are more important than mediated channels within the organization. However, mediated channels of communication are more important for those universities that have decided to adopt the ETD-DL but have not yet implemented the DL. There were also significant differences in the importance attributed to these channels by individuals in different jobs. The results suggest strategies that could encourage development of digital libraries within other social systems. The study also illustrates the importance of planning for the human factor in digital library management. Carefully constructed strategies that address all the parties involved in DL adoption and that account for differences in communication style will more readily facilitate successful adoption of distributed digital libraries.},

abstract = {DialogPlus is one of four international projects, supported in the US by the NSF International Collaborative Research Program in Digital Libraries, and in the UK by the Joint Information Systems Committee of the UK Higher Education Funding Councils. The two primary objectives of the project are to develop: a distributed enabling information infrastructure for the support of learning and teaching in Geography; innovative approaches to teaching and learning, based on this infrastructure. Specifically, the project aims to show how: the undergraduate and postgraduate programs of study in Geography in the consortium universities can be enriched and developed through cross--national collaboration and on--line delivery; different virtual learning environments can be supported by a common, open and distributed digital library infrastructure; major geospatial resources relevant for the study of the environment and landscape and for the study of human populations in cities and the countryside can be used in student programs of study; important skills in the analysis of spatial information through use of Geographical Information Science and Earth Observation software and functions can be taught on--line and made available in undergraduate programs. The project plans to deliver shared UK/US electronic resources associated with four courses across four topic areas, namely: Human Geography (based on the Census); Geographical Information Science (applied to retailing); Geomorphology (based on river catchments); and Earth Observation (for land cover and land use inference). The project will capitalize on a variety of rich digital resources which have been created by both official agencies and universities and which can be used to enhance student learning, knowledge and skills in each of these topic areas. These electronic resources will be made available through interoperable digital library technology and integrated directly into course units in undergraduate programs supported by Virtual Learning Environments within each institution. A distributed version of the Alexandria geo--referenced digital library, developed at UCSB within the DLI1 and DLI2 programs of the NSF, will be used as the foundation of the technical infrastructure to support the project. A major aim of the project will be to show that several different pedagogic approaches, and a wide variety of data collections and teaching resources, can be supported and shared within this common infrastructure.},

A custom metadata schema based on the Educause Instructional Management Systems (IMS) standard has been extended by HEAL to include additional health sciences--related elements Intellectual property issues are handled through the use of the Creative Commons set of licenses; most commonly, contributors grant free use of the library's resources for non--commercial purposes with clear attribution. The HEAL project has attracted the interest of over sixty organizational and individual partners, and by February 2004 there were over 4000 registered users. The collection is growing as new partner collections are being added by the end of late 2004, the national multimedia repository/referatory created by the HEAL team at www.healcentral.org will offer health sciences educators access to a large, diverse collection of health science materials appropriate for use in a variety of educational settings.},

The workshop leveraged the expertise of attendees to identify tools and reporting mechanisms, develop strategies and formulate recommendations that will help NSDL projects incorporate, support and grow the communities who use their digital libraries Workshop attendees also provided a rich set of examples of how users are currently involved in building and maintaining NSDL digital libraries and the potential impact of their involvement Participant involvement is a critical factor not only in developing educational digital libraries, but also in sustaining the resources, the technology and most importantly, the communities who use them Without converting casual or one--time users into recurring, involved participants, or even members of a community, educational digital libraries will simply be yet another example of, 'If you build it, will they come'.},

abstract = {Biodiversity information systems (BISs) involve all kinds of heterogeneous data, which include ecological and geographical features However, available information systems offer very limited support for managing such data in an integrated fashion, and such integration is often based on geographic coordinates alone. Furthermore, such systems do not fully support image content management (e.g. photos of landscapes or living organisms), a requirement of many BIS end--users. In order to meet their needs, these users -- e.g. biologists, environmental experts -- often have to alternate between distinct biodiversity and image information systems to combine information extracted from them. This cumbersome operational procedure is forced on users by lack of interoperability among these systems. This hampers the addition of new data sources, as well as cooperation among scientists. The approach provided in this project to meet these issues is based on taking advantage of advances in Digital Library (DL) innovations to integrate networked collections of heterogeneous data. It focuses on creating the basis for a biodiversity information system under the digital library perspective, combining new techniques of content--based image retrieval and database query processing mechanisms. This approach solves the problem of system switching, and provides users with a flexible platform from which to tailor a BIS to their needs. The main contributions of this project are the following: (a) a generic architecture for managing heterogeneous collections, based ondigital library components, to access heterogeneous biodiversity data sources (text and images), that allows combining text--based andcontent--based queries in a seamless way; and (b) a new component, for content--based image search, integrated into that architecture. The proposed architecture has been implemented by using DL components which are mostly new or recently developed. Furthemore, its implementation uses the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) protocol as a basis for interoperability. This architecture is easily extensible, and provides users a considerable degree of flexibility in data management. To illustrate our claim that this architecture can be applied to several domains, we are investigating its application in building a biodiversity information system on fish species. This solution solves many current problems in this kind of system, allowing handling of images and textual information in an integrated fashion. A new Content-Based Image Search Component has been developed to support queries on image collections. Since this component is based onthe OAI principles, it provides an easy-to-install search engine toquery images by content. It can be readily tailored for a particular collection by a trained designer, who carries out a clearly definedset of pilot experiments. It supports the use of different image descriptors, which can be chosen from the pilot experiment, and theneasily combined to yield improved effectiveness. In addition, it encapsulates a multidimensional index structure to speed up the search process, that also can be easily configured for different image collections.},

The most immediate application of this technology is in support of a library of maps, aerial photographs and remote sensing images, and ADL is now run as an operational service by UCSB's Map and Image Library, one of the largest such libraries in the US.But the longer term objective is to provide georeferenced search as an alternative way of accessing conventional libraries i.e. libraries of textual information With the aid of a natural language parser and the ADL gazetteer, the locations (lat, long) of places named in a text can be identified This functionality offers a quantum leap in information retrieval performance in the many cases in which locational information is involved For example, it becomes possible to discover documents about California, even if the name California" does not appear explicitly in the text. It also offers a foundation technology for the concept of the Digital Earth able to answer questions such as: "What information do you have about this place?The primary focus of the ADEPT project, however, is on the development of digital learning environments (DLEs) for undergraduate education There are two particularly innovative strands to this research: first the use of digital library technology to provide curated learning and teaching resources for the DLEs; and second a pedagogic approach based on an explicit concept model of the chosen field of study ADEPT has naturally chosen Geography as the experimental field of study but the approach is quite general and could be applied to any other field A first course using this approach was given at UCSB in Fall 2003".},

In this demonstration we illustrate how the on--line proceedings for the 2003 Dublin Core Conference were implemented by combining traditional and innovative knowledge organization techniques. The 2003 Dublin Core Conference Proceedings served as a test--bed for generating a faceted metadata retrieval interface from instance metadata, ontologies, and controlled vocabularies expressed in RDF and RDF Schema. We share lessons learned in the design and implementation of the proceedings, and in particular focus on emerging best practices for representing and sharing metadata using Dublin Core Metadata recommendations, new interpretations of traditional Library and Information Science information retrieval techniques, and implementations of Semantic Web standards.},

abstract = {Advances in data storage and image acquisition technologies haveenabled the creation of large image datasets In order to deal withthese data, appropriate information systems (e.g. image digital libraries) have been developed to efficiently manage such collections. One of the most common retrieval approaches is to employ so--called Content--Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems. Basically, these systems try to retrieve images similar to auser--defined pattern (e.g. image example). Their goal is to supportimage retrieval based on content properties (e.g. shape, color, or texture), which are often encoded in terms of imagedescriptors This demonstration presents a new CBIR system based on configurable components. The main novelty resides in its Content--Based ImageSearch Component (CBISC) that supports queries on image collections CBISC is based on the OAIprinciples, and thus provides an easy--to--install search engine tosupport querying images by content As with the OAI protocol, queriesare posed via HTTP requests and the responses are encoded in XML CBISC encapsulates multidimensional indexstructures to speed up the searchprocess. Furthermore, it supports the use of different imagedescriptors (metric and non--metric; color, texture, and shapedescriptors; with 1D or 2D feature vectors), which canbe easily combined to yield improved effectiveness. We will show thatthis search component can be tailored for particular image collectionsby a trained designer, who carries out a clearly defined set of pilot experiments to select the appropriate descriptors. Image descriptors are typically domain and usage--dependent Further, agiven image can be associated with very many descriptors However, standard CBIR methods only support a fixed set of descriptors CBISC, instead, allows progressive extension of thedescriptor base Figure 1 presents a screen shotshowing the CBISC Configuration Tool developed to support CBISC designers in the configuration process Basically, this processconcerns the description/definition of both the image descriptors thatwill be used to retrieve images by content, and the image database to which the CBISC is related The XML file generated in thisprocess is used during CBISC execution.},

abstract = {Virtual museums provide ways to capture the content of a real museum in a digital (electronic) form and make this digital form more universally available. This exhibit demonstrates a novel method for digitally recording entire museum exhibits and allowing them to be explored in virtual reality. The methodology allows anyone with access to the Internet or a PC to experience anywhere, anytime, any part of the museum's collection or exhibits (past, present and future). Users can explore the museum exhibits in a virtual reality that is both spatially accurate and visually compelling. All objects and 3D scenes are seen in precise full color photographic quality detail. The scene and objects are polygonal meshes representing the surfaces of objects as recorded by a laser range finder. This permits making measurements directly on the scene with millimeter precision. The methodology, its application to capturing museum exhibits, and examples of exhibits recorded using this technique are demonstrated on a laptop PC. Visitors to the demonstration will be able to: Learn about the process of digitizing 3D environments like museum exhibits and creating virtual reality environments from them; Place themselves in one of three virtual reality exhibits and explore the multiple rooms and artifacts comprising the exhibits (Ackland Art Museum, living room, Clue murder scene).},
