abstract = {Exploring services for digital libraries (DLs) include two major paradigms, browsing and searching, as well as other services such as clustering and visualization. In this paper, we formalize and generalize DL exploring services within a DL theory. We develop theorems to indicate that browsing and searching can be converted or mapped to each other under certain conditions. The theorems guide the design and implementation of exploring services for an integrated archaeological DL, ETANA-DL. Its integrated browsing and searching can support users in moving seamlessly between these operations, minimizing context switching, and keeping users focused. It also integrates browsing and searching into a single visual interface for DL exploration. A user study to evaluate ETANA-DL's exploring services helped validate our hypotheses.},

abstract = {People need to find, work with, and put together information. Diverse activities, such as scholarly research, comparison shopping, and entertainment involve collecting and connecting information resources. We need to represent collections in ways that promote understanding of individual information resources and also their relationships. Representing individual resources with images as well as text makes good use of human cognitive facilities. Composition, an alternative to lists, means putting representations of elements in a collection together using design principles to form a connected whole.We develop combinFormation, a mixed-initiative system for representing collections as compositions of image and text surrogates. The system provides a set of direct manipulation facilities for forming, editing, organizing, and distributing collections as compositions. Additionally, to assist users in sifting through the vast expanse of potentially relevant information resources, the system also includes a generative agent that can proactively engage in processes of collecting information resources and forming image and text surrogates. A generative temporal visual composition agent develops the collection and its visual representation over time, enabling users to see more possibilities. To keep the user in control, we develop interactive techniques that enable the user to direct the agent.For evaluation, we conducted a field study in an undergraduate general education course offered in the architecture department. Alternating groups of students used combinFormation as an aid in preparing one of two major assignments involving information discovery to support processes of invention. The students that used combinFormation were found to perform better.},

abstract = {Identifying record replicas in Digital Libraries and other types of digital repositories is fundamental to improve the quality of their content and services as well as to yield eventual sharing efforts. Several deduplication strategies are available, but most of them rely on manually chosen settings to combine evidence used to identify records as being replicas. In this paper, we present the results of experiments we have carried out with a novel Machine Learning approach we have proposed for the deduplication problem. This approach, based on Genetic Programming (GP), is able to automatically generate similarity functions to identify record replicas in a given repository. The generated similarity functions properly combine and weight the best evidence available among the record fields in order to tell when two distinct records represent the same real-world entity. The results of the experiments show that our approach outperforms the baseline method by Fellegi and Sunter by more than 12% when identifying replicas in a data set containing researcher's personal data, and by more than 7%, in a data set with article citation data.},

In POLAR, the knowledge about digital objects, annotations and their relationships in a digital library repository can be modelled considering certain characteristics of annotations and annotated objects. Insights about these characteristics are gained by an analysis of the annotation models behind existing systems and a discussion of an object-oriented, logical view on relevant objects in a digital library. Retrieval methods applied in a digital library should take annotations into account to satisfy users' information needs. POLAR thus supports a wide range of flexible and powerful annotation-based fact and content queries by making use of knowledge and relevance augmentation. An evaluation of our approach on email discussions shows performance improvements when annotation characteristics are considered.},

Bibliometric indicators have been extensively studied, mostly in the context of journals. However, journal-based metrics poorly capture topical distinctions in fast-moving fields, and are increasingly problematic with the rise of open-access publishing. Recent developments in latent topic models have produced promising results for automatic sub-field discovery. The fine-grained, faceted topics produced by such models provide a clearer view of the topical divisions of a body of research literature and the interactions between those divisions. We demonstrate the usefulness of topic models in measuring impact by applying a new phrase-based topic discovery model to a collection of 300,000 Computer Science publications, collected by the Rexa automatic citation indexing system.},

However, the question remains on whether the same techniques that are used on the Web can be applied to collections of documents containing citations between scientific papers. In this work we present a comparative study of digital library citations and Web links, in the context of automatic text classification. We show that there are in fact differences between citations and links in this context. For the comparison, we run a series of experiments using a digital library of computer science papers and a Web directory. In our reference collections, measures based on co-citation tend to perform better for pages in the Web directory, with gains up to 37% over text based classifiers, while measures based on bibliographic coupling perform better in a digital library. We also propose a simple and effective way of combining a traditional text based classifier with a citation-link based classifier. This combination is based on the notion of classifier reliability and presented gains of up to 14% in micro-averaged F1 in the Web collection. However, no significant gain was obtained in the digital library. Finally, a user study was performed to further investigate the causes for these results. We discovered that misclassifications by the citation-link based classifiers are in fact difficult cases, hard to classify even for humans.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issues associated with building software images to support a collection of archived documents using machine emulators. Emulation has been proposed as a strategy for preservation of digital documents that require their original software for access. The creation of software images is a critical component in archiving documents via emulation. The software images include the operating system, application software, and supporting software artifacts such as fonts and Codecs (Compression-Decompression algorithm). A practical emulation environment to support a digital document requires both an emulator and a software image. This paper considers the issues associated with creating such software images to support Microsoft Office documents. In particular, we discuss a set of software tools and strategies that we developed to automatically analyze the dependencies of Microsoft Office documents on software resources and supporting files. As a proof of concept, the tools and strategies have been applied to establish dependencies of Office documents from a document library containing approximately 200,000 documents and to automatically collect missing resources such as fonts. The software tools are a first step toward an interactive system that aids in the construction of robust emulation environments for preserving digital artifacts. However, they may also be used in other contexts, for example, to support screening of documents for archiving and migration to new platforms to ensure correct visualization.},

abstract = {A number of projects are creating searchable digital libraries of printed books. These include the Million Book Project, the Google Book project and similar efforts from Yahoo and Microsoft. Content-based on line book retrieval usually requires first converting printed text into machine readable (e.g. ASCII) text using an optical character recognition (OCR) engine and then doing full text search on the results. Many of these books are old and there are a variety of processing steps that are required to create an end to end system. Changing any step (including the scanning process) can affect OCR performance and hence a good automatic statistical evaluation of OCR performance on book length material is needed. Evaluating OCR performance on the entire book is non-trivial. The only easily obtainable ground truth (the Gutenberg e-texts) must be automatically aligned with the OCR output over the entire length of a book. This may be viewed as equivalent to the problem of aligning two large (easily a million long) sequences. The problem is further complicated by OCR errors as well as the possibility of large chunks of missing material in one of the sequences. We propose a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based hierarchical alignment algorithm to align OCR output and the ground truth for books. We believe this is the first work to automatically align a whole book without using any book structure information. The alignment process works by breaking up the problem of aligning two long sequences into the problem of aligning many smaller subsequences. This can be rapidly and effectively done. Experimental results show that our hierarchical alignment approach works very well even if OCR output has a high recognition error rate. Finally, we evaluate the performance of a commercial OCR engine over a large dataset of books based on the alignment results.},

abstract = {Figures are very important non-textual information contained in scientific documents. Current digital libraries do not provide users tools to retrieve documents based on the information available within the figures. We propose an architecture for retrieving documents by integrating figures and other information. The initial step in enabling integrated document search is to categorize figures into a set of pre-defined types. We propose several categories of figures based on their functionalities in scholarly articles. We have developed a machine-learning-based approach for automatic categorization of figures. Both global features, such as texture, and part features, such as lines, are utilized in the architecture for discriminating among figure categories. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a testbed document set collected from the CiteSeer scientific literature digital library. Experimental evaluation has demonstrated that our algorithms can produce acceptable results for realworld use. Our tools will be integrated into a scientific document digital library.},

abstract = {Metadata is ordinarily used to describe documents, but it can also constitute a form of infrastructure for access to networked resources and for traversal of those resources. One problematic area for access to digital library resources has been the search for time periods or events. If there is a capability to search for time, it is usually a date search - a standardized and precise form but unfortunately rarely used in common chronological expressions. For example, a user interested in the "Vietnam war", "Clinton Administration" or the "Elizabethan Period" must either know the corresponding dates, or rely on simple keyword matching for those period names. We consider the ability to interpret user statements of periods or eras as ranges of dates and to associate them with particular locations an important feature of an information system. This paper describes the Time Period Directory, a metadata infrastructure for named time periods linking them with their geographic location as well as a canonical time period range.},

The curriculum design and focused teaching areas appear more systematic and comprehensive than in earlier studies. Over half the institutions examined in this study have posted their detailed course information on-line. Most courses offered are now based on a combination of theory and practice, and are available at different levels. There are increasing opportunities for funding for developing new initiatives in digital library education. However, since digital library education is still at an early stage, an optimized model of best practice in digital library education has not yet emerged.},

The selected keyphrases are translated into Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) based on the POS phrase categorization technique for better query refomulation. Furthermore, we study whether ontologies such as WordNet and MeSH improve the retrieval performance in conjunction with the keyphrases. We test our techniques on TREC 5, 6, and 7 as well as a MEDLINE collection. The experimental results show that the use of keyphrases with POS phrase categorization produces the best average precision.},

This paper proposes six fast-feature techniques that use only features available in the search result list, such as title, snippet, and URL, to categorize results into meaningful categories. They use credible knowledge resources, including a US government organizational hierarchy, a thematic hierarchy from the Open Directory Project (ODP) web directory, and personal browse histories, to add valuable metadata to search results. In three tests the percent of results categorized for five representative queries was high enough to suggest practical benefits: general web search (76-90%), government web search (39-100%), and the Bureau of Labor Statistics website (48-94%). An additional test submitted 250 TREC queries to a search engine and successfully categorized 66% of the top 100 using the ODP and 61% of the top 350. Fast-feature techniques have been implemented in a prototype search engine. We propose research directions to improve categorization rates and make suggestions about how web site designers could re-organize their sites to support fast categorization of search results.},

In addition, we apply a domain ontology to document clustering to investigate if the ontology such as MeSH improves clustering qualify for MEDLINE articles. Because an ontology is a formal, explicit specification of a shared conceptualization for a domain of interest, the use of ontologies is a natural way to solve traditional information retrieval problems such as synonym/hypernym/ hyponym problems. We conducted fairly extensive experiments based on different evaluation metrics such as misclassification index, F-measure, cluster purity, and Entropy on very large article sets from MEDLINE, the largest biomedical digital library in biomedicine.},

abstract = {Over three years ago, the Core Integration team of the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) implemented a digital library based on metadata aggregation using Dublin Core and OAI-PMH. The initial expectation was that such low-barrier technologies would be relatively easy to automate and administer. While this architectural choice permitted rapid deployment of a production NSDL, our three years of experience have contradicted our original expectations of easy automation and low people cost. We have learned that alleged "low-barrier" standards are often harder to deploy than expected. In this paper we report on this experience and comment on the general cost, the functionality, and the ultimate effectiveness of this architecture.},

This analysis provides a unique window for understanding how users use resources from multiple digital libraries, and the related issues of resource granularity and context dependence. Analyses suggest that active use and design with online resources is relegated to 'early adopters'. These users designed significantly more instructional projects with more content and more online resources than less-active users. Users in general appeared to value digital library resources, and at a smaller granularity than cataloged.},

Skilled amateurs can assist by contributing observations they make in the field. The challenge with such contributions is their potentially questionable quality. We present our PDA-based application EcoPod, which replaces traditional paper field guides with a mobile computing platform. EcoPod aims both to increase the efficiency of the identification process and its reliability. The application solicits as little information from the user as possible. At the same time it places no restrictions on the sequencing of the identification process. This approach is to make our solution attractive to both skilled amateurs and professionals. The tool creates a record of the identification process, thereby providing an audit trail for quality assurance. EcoPod's user interface driver computes information gain over identification metadata to maximize screen utilization. The tool ingests SDD, an international standard for XML datasets that describe organisms.},

abstract = {Citation matching, or the automatic grouping of bibliographic references that refer to the same document, is a data management problem faced by automatic digital libraries for scientific literature such as CiteSeer and Google Scholar. Although several solutions have been offered for citation matching in large bibliographic databases, these solutions typically require expensive batch clustering operations that must be run offline. Large digital libraries containing citation information can reduce maintenance costs and provide new services through efficient online processing of citation data, resolving document citation relationships as new records become available. Additionally, information found in citations can be used to supplement document metadata, requiring the generation of a canonical citation record from merging variant citation subfields into a unified "best guess" from which to draw information. Citation information must be merged with other information sources in order to provide a complete document record. This paper outlines a system and algorithms for online citation matching and canonical metadata generation. A Bayesian framework is employed to build the ideal citation record for a document that carries the added advantages of fusing information from disparate sources and increasing system resilience to erroneous data.},

abstract = {Currently in document retrieval there are many algorithms each with different strengths and weakness. There is some difficulty, however, in evaluating the impact of the test query set on retrieval results. The traditional evaluation process, the Cranfield evaluation paradigm, which uses a corpus and a set of user queries, focuses on making the queries as re-alistic as possible. Unfortunately such query sets lack the fine grained control necessary to test algorithm properties. We present an approach called Controlled Query Generation (CQG) that creates query sets from documents in the corpus in a way that regulates the theoretic information quality of each query. This allows us to generate reproducible and well defined sets of queries of varying length and term specificity. Imposing this level of control over the query sets used for testing retrieval algorithms enables the rigorous simulation of different query environments to identify specific algorithm properties before introducing user queries. In this work, we demonstrate the usefulness of CQG by generating three dif-ferent query environments to investigate characteristics of two blind relevance feedback approaches.},

In this architecture, OpenURL-compliant linking servers aggregate usage information of a specific user community as it navigates the distributed information environment that it has access to. This usage information is made OAI-PMH harvestable so that usage information exposed by many linking servers can be aggregated to facilitate the creation of value-added services with a reach beyond that of a single community or a single information service. This paper also discusses issues that were encountered when implementing the proposed approach, and it presents preliminary results obtained from analyzing a usage data set containing about 3,500,000 requests aggregated by a federation of linking servers at the California State University system over a 20 month period.},

The records have been created by researchers who are currently digitising a collection of historical archives stored at the Abbaye de Saint-Maurice, Switzerland. The string 'Beatrix, daughter of Johannes Trona, of Saillon' is a typical example of a record. We wish to annotate every term (word and symbol) in our records with a label which describes whether the term is a name (e.g. 'Beatrix'), a place (e.g. 'Saillon'), or a relationship (e.g. 'daughter'). Using this information, we are able to derive both a canonical form for each name (e.g. 'Beatrix Trona'), and the relationships between people. We build upon work developed for the cleaning and standardization of names for record linkage corpora, adding several enhancements to deal with our more difficult data, which contains common name structures of French, Italian and Latin, over hundreds of years. We present an approach to this problem that works interactively with a user to annotate the data set accurately, greatly reducing the human effort required. We do this by learning a Hidden Markov Model representing a record structure, and finding structural patterns in new records. Finally, we present a brief overview of a tool we are developing to help genealogical researchers browse and search the data.},

abstract = {ADL Gazetteer is a digitalized worldwide gazetteer developed in the Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) Project, which contains millions of geographic names (placenames). The placenames are indexed with type terms from the ADL Feature Type Thesaurus (FTT), a hierarchical category scheme. The paper proposes a two-step method to enrich the category scheme automatically: to discover frequent generic terms by detecting phase boundaries with a mutual information-based method, and to correlate the generic terms with the relevant type terms by hierarchical clustering. The correlation pair established can then be used to supplement the FTT with the generic terms found. The extensive experiments conducted on millions of ADLG placenames demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Besides the thesaurus enrichment, the potential applications of this research include: to suggest likely type terms when categorizing new placenames, and to help users choose likely search terms.},

In scholarly articles, they are often used to present the relationships among data and high-light a collection of results obtained from experiments and scientific analysis. In digital libraries, extracting this data automatically and understanding the structure and content of tables are very important to many applications. Automatic identification extraction, and search for the contents of tables can be made more precise with the help of metadata. In this paper, we propose a set of medium-independent table metadata to facilitate the table indexing, searching, and exchanging. To extract the contents of tables and their metadata, an automatic table metadata extraction algorithm is designed and tested on PDF documents.},

As this decade is seeing growth in the number of graduate, undergraduate, and teacher training programs in computational science [7], it is vital that the curriculum and materials to infuse computation into K-12 schools are made avail.Previous studies have shown how interactive learning objects can be incorporated into teaching, allowing teachers to make classrooms more engaging and student active, provided faculty using the resources have adequate training, a willingness to modify their teaching styles, and access to or time to create quality interactive assignments [6]. The Computational Science Education Reference Desk (CSERD), a Pathway project of the National Science Digital Library, collects learning objects for teaching about and teaching with computation, reviewing items in its catalog on the basis of verification, validation, and accreditation to help provide faculty with information regarding the quality of the learning objects [3].This study attempts to determine the effectiveness of a set of interactive learning materials from the CSERD collection in teaching concepts in a freshman Algebra I class. Materials from the CSERD resource Project Interactivate [2] will be used in a series of 4 lessons through February and March 2006 at a parochial school in Northeastern New Jersey. Students will take a pre- and post-test on topics covered in this period. Students and teachers will be surveyed to determine their attitudes towards the use of computation in learning and towards mathematics in general. Additionally, students will submit a daily feedback statement after each augmented lesson.},

abstract = {There has been a recent dramatic shift from analog to digital creation, management and use of video, creating unprecedented opportunities to develop rich, interactive collections, but without proper care, much of this digital video could be inaccessible or incomprehensible in the future. Several projects have explored technical challenges and potential strategies for ensuring long-term access to digital video collections. A number of initiatives have also generated sets of proposed metadata for digital video. Most of the above activities have focused on ensuring that videos can be discovered, accessed and rendered over time.Another active steam of research has examined how users can best navigate, understand, view, interact with and annotate collections of digital video. This research has generated valuable lessons, tools and observations to support current users. However, it has generally not investigated how the components of a digital video collection might support or fail to support future users of videos.The Preserving Video Objects and Context (VidArch) project -- NSF Grant # IIS 0455970, involving the authors, Gary Marchionini and Gary Geisler -- lies at the intersection between the two streams of research described above. We are developing a preservation framework for digital video context. Among other issues, we are considering: Are there interface elements from current collections (e.g. surrogates, navigation aids, behaviors) that should be retained over time, in order to support long-term use and understanding of the videos? How might curators of digital video collections decide which contextual elements are important and then devise strategies for preserving them.According to the glossary of the Society of American Archivists, context is the "organizational, functional, and operational circumstances surrounding materials' creation, receipt, storage, or use, and its relationship to other materials." Documents derive value and meaning from relationships with other documents within the same collection. Rather than treating each item as a discrete entity, archival theory and practice suggests that digital videos should be managed, preserved and presented to users in a way that reflects the social and documentary context in which they were originally embedded.Access systems for text-based collections often rely on surrogates, such as indices, catalogs, and abstracts. In addition to facilitating information navigation, discovery and retrieval, surrogates also provide valuable contextual information about the documents. In archival descriptive practices, attention to context is expressed through the creation of finding aids, which include not only inventories of the contents of collections, but also background information about the actors and activities that generated the materials, and the ways they were organized by their original creators or recipients. Recent research has produced and investigated an analogous set of surrogates for digital video collections. These include textual descriptions, title, captions, and annotations, but they also include surrogates that are themselves still or moving images: video segments, keyframes, slide shows, and fast forwards.VidArch is focused on two collections within the Open Video repository: the complete set of videos that National Aeronautic and Space Administration (NASA) produces and broadcasts to advance learning and appreciation for science; and a set of videos of juried presentations to various annual Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) conferences. The two collections reflect several forms of documentation that may be valuable to preserve in order to convey the context of the videos: text-based surrogates, image-based surrogates (story boards and fast forwards), links to related videos, use history data, and supporting documents (e.g. lesson plans). We have generated archival finding aids to the two collections in order to reflect contextual information that is not readily available within Open Video. Such documentary elements should not simply be treated as part of the current interface to the collection but should also be considered as potential targets of long-term preservation in their own rig.This poster presents an information model for digital video context and places the information model within the context of recent guidance on metadata for digital video, metadata for digital preservation, and the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS).},

abstract = {As part of the NSF-funded Pathways project, we have created an interoperable data model to facilitate object re-use and a broad spectrum of cross-repository services. The resulting Pathways Core data model is designed to be lightweight to implement, and to be widely applicable as a shared profile or as an overlay on data models currently used in repository systems and applications. We consider the data models underlying the Fedora, Dspace and aDORe repository systems, and a number of XML-based formats used for the representation of compound objects, including MPEG-21 DIDL, METS, and IMS/CP.At the heart of the Pathways Core data model (Fig. 1) are the entity and datastream elements. entity elements model the abstract aspects of digital objects and align with works and expressions in FRBR [1]. An entity can model anything from a digital object to a collection of digital objects (other entities), to a node created merely to express abstract properties. Core properties of entities are hasIdentifier, hasProviderInfo, hasLineage, and hasProvider-Persistence. If a repository attaches providerInfo to an entity, it provides a handle to access the entity from the repository, supporting its use and re-use. Persistence of this handle may be indicated with providerPersistence. The hasLineage property is used to indicate the entity (or entities) from which the entity to which the hasLineage is attached was derived. Other properties, such as hasSemantic, that convey the intellectual genre of the entity (i.e. journal article), can be added. datastream elements model the concrete aspects of a digital object; these align with items in FRBR, and can be thought of as aspects at the level of bitstreams. An entity may have any number of datastreams. Two properties of datastream have been defined as part of the Pathways Core: hasLocation conveys a URI that can be resolved to yield a bitstream; and hasFormat conveys the digital format of the bitstream. If a datastream has multiple hasLocation properties, resolution of the conveyed URIs yields bit-equivalent bitstreamsThe Pathways Core data model can be serialized in a variety of ways, and, an RDF serialization as well as a profile of MPEG-21 DIDL have been created as reference implementations. We have also conducted the following experiment to illustrate the power of the Pathways Core. A number of heterogeneous repositories implemented an OpenURL-based obtain interface from which, given the providerInfo of an entity, an RDF serialization of the entity compliant with the Pathways Core could be retrievedUsing this interface, an overlay journal can collect serializations of some entities (scholarly papers) from the different collaborating repositories, and assemble those into a new issue of the journal. The overlay journal then itself implemented the same obtain interface, and as a result, an RDF serialization of the entire journal, an issue, and an article could be extracted. This interface could then, for example, be used by a preservation repository to collect content from the overlay journal for ingest and mirroring. This experiment illustrates how cross-repository services and workflows can be facilitated through support of an interoperable data model (the Pathways Core) and an interoperable service interface (the OpenURL-based obtain interface)},

abstract = {Numerous digital libraries (DLs), electronic archives (EAs) and portal services have been developed. These services allow online structured access to digitised information, facilitating remote access for educators and students. Often, DL users and information are remotely located - so too are their users. The authors can envision numerous circumstances where two remotely located parties may wish to opportunistically examine an online resource - e-learning environments for example. We are particularly interested in assisting users whose collaboration resolves around discussion of a common visual resource (documents and collections of documents in the case under discussion). By providing a single tool for information seeking and multi-user collaboration, we believe that the amount of preparation required for an online session is reduced, while the flexibility allowed to parties to conduct ad-hoc examinations of a resource is increased. This paper proposes a framework to address this functionality deficit by describing a document foraging tool that provides facilities for both visual exploration of a document set and Voiceover-IP (VoIP) based collaborative features.},

abstract = {In a variety of applications such as learning, we need to integrate multimedia information into convenient packages (like presentations). The challenges involved in this process are: Selecting or working with information elements at sub-document level while retaining the original context; describing the integration or packaging of such elements; and making use of minimal storage during this activity.Current multimedia authoring software, like RealProducer (http://www.realnetworks.com/products/producer/), tend to repeatedly copy information, or to limit granularity of information referenced. Although editors for the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (http://www.w3.org/AudioVideo/), such as GRiNS (http://www.oratrix.com/Products/G2E), address some of the aforementioned challenges, they are difficult to use and require considerable training effort before a user can work with them.We developed the Superimposed Multimedia Presentation Editor and Player (SIMPEL), a tool to address these challenges. SIMPEL allows a user to reference information of many types, at varying granularity, without replicating the referenced information. It also allows the user to compose synchronized multimedia presentations. For example, for a specific topic a user can select an audio clip, some images, and some text. He can then "play" (render in specific panes of a window) this information-set in some order. Figure 1 shows a snapshot of a SIMPEL presentation. Pane A contains an audio clip. Panes B, C, and D show selected information within web pages.SIMPEL is in a genre of applications called superimposed applications (SAs), which allow users to superimpose new interpretations over existing or base information [1]. SAs employ "marks", references to selected regions within base information. SIMPEL uses the Superimposed Pluggable Architecture for Contexts and Excerpts (SPARCE), middleware that provides mark management and other services for SAs [2]. SIMPEL has been implemented for Windows in Visual Basic.NET and uses XML for storing presentation data.Future work on SIMPEL will include support for pre-fetching media files (for better performance) and packaging and sharing of SIMPEL presentations. We also plan to index marks and make them searchable, thus facilitating further reuse. A more detailed report on SIMPEL is available at http://pubs.dlib.vt.edu:9090/48/.},

abstract = {With the growing importance of mapping land, regions, and their related features, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) has become an ever important standard in fields where such detailed study of land features is required. Our archaeology digital library, ETANA-DL (http://etana.dlib.vt.edu), contains thousands of records from eight member excavations. Here, we draw on the Space aspect of the 5S meta-model [1] for digital libraries and demonstrate a methodology used to integrate archaeological GIS data with the wealth of information within ETANA-DL. ETANAGIS connects the digital library's textual records with a spatial representation of their original locations, enhancing users' understanding of the find.Using a dataset of the University of Toronto's Tell Madaba excavation project [2], we developed an interactive, Web-based representation of the original ArcGIS document (accessible from ETANA-DL homepage). For dynamic generation of maps from geospatial data, we use the MapServer [3] project, a mature, project which boasts a rich toolset of features for cartographicrelated image generation. MapServer can directly utilize ArcGIS layer resources but some translation and additional authoring must occur for proper image generation. Then, using PHP, the MapScript MapServer API, and navigation tools, the map was ported to an interactive, Web-accessible format. Based on a study of alternatives, the technology we chose for our technique seemed to be the best suited for digital library integration and is also completely open source.To explore the presentation of the map, a user employs the navigation tools displayed in the corner of the main view (see Figure 1). In addition, full control of displayed layers, a smaller map showing overall view and context, as well as a dynamic scale bar are available for use. To integrate the Web-based version of the Tell Madaba GIS map with the existing digital library, the layers depicting archaeological divisions are clickable and labeled for easy identification. Any area queried results in a pop-up box with ETANA-DL's records and artifacts for that area.While this integration connects the digital library with the spatial representation of the region, the unique quality of various GIS maps causes certain difficulties. The lack of standard in denoting spatial divisions in GIS is one hindrance to producing a more automated technique. Future work will include more automation, usability evaluation, and integration of additional excavations. We hope integration of the digital library and GIS greatly aids users' understanding of the spatial organization of the included data.},
