abstract = {Libraries, Archives and Museums now have massive digital holdings. There is tremendous potential for library and information science, computer science and computer engineering researchers to partner with cultural heritage institutions and make our digital cultural record more useful and usable. In particular, there is a significant need to bridge basic research in areas such as computer vision, crowdsourcing, natural language processing, multilingual OCR, and machine learning to make this work directly usable in the practices of cultural heritage institutions. In this talk, I discuss a series of exemplar projects, largely funded through the Institute of Museum and Library Services National Digital Platform initiative, that illustrate some key principles for building applied research partnerships with cultural heritage institutions. Building on Ben Schniderman's The New ABCs of Research: Achieving Breakthrough Collaborations, I focus specifically on why the public purpose and missions of cultural heritage institutions are particularly valuable in establishing new kinds of collaborations that can simultaneously advance basic research and the ability for people of the world to engage with their cultural record.},

abstract = {With the advancements in data driven research ushered in with the "Big Data" era, many research fields from astrophysics to genomics have discovered previously impossible outcomes including exoplanet detection and precision medicine. As with many other rapid changes, challenges are emerging now in extending the reach of these technologies to less computationally savvy fields that often have even more challenging computational problems to address. In this talk, I will explore some of the ways the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) and others are creating environments to simplify onboarding new communities both through simple yet powerful user interfaces that feature the ability to preserve and publish data, computational workflows, and outcomes as linked yet separate entities. By linking, preserving, and making discoverable these entitles, researchers new to these computational capabilities can more easily understand them often in a research context with which they are already familiar. By then seeing the details of how a result came from the data, they can more easily build upon the work of others or even begin new workflows tuned to their own research needs. I will talk out our collaboration with publishers and libraries to not only preserve and expose the links between these digital entities but allow for their recall into computational environments to either reproduce previous results or extend the research through additional data and/or new computational methods.},

abstract = {Digitized document collections often suffer from OCR errors that may impact a document's readability and retrievability. We studied the effects of correcting OCR errors on the retrievability of documents in a historic newspaper corpus of a digital library. We computed retrievability scores for the uncorrected documents using queries from the library's search log, and found that the document OCR character error rate and retrievability score are strongly correlated. We computed retrievability scores for manually corrected versions of the same documents, and report on differences in their total sum, the overall retrievability bias, and the distribution of these changes over the documents, queries and query terms. For large collections, often only a fraction of the corpus is manually corrected. Using a mixed corpus, we assess how this mix affects the retrievability of the corrected and uncorrected documents. The correction of OCR errors increased the number of documents retrieved in all conditions. The increase contributed to a less biased retrieval, even when taking the potential lower ranking of uncorrected documents into account.},

abstract = {The availability of entity linking technologies provides a novel way to organize, categorize, and analyze large textual collections in digital libraries. However, in many situations a link to an entity offers only relatively coarse-grained semantic information. This is problematic especially when the entity is related to several different events, topics, roles, and -- more generally -- when it has different aspects. In this work, we introduce and address the task of entity-aspect linking: given a mention of an entity in a contextual passage, we refine the entity link with respect to the aspect of the entity it refers to. We show that a combination of different features and aspect representations in a learning-to-rank setting correctly predicts the entity-aspect in 70% of the cases. Additionally, we demonstrate significant and consistent improvements using entity-aspect linking on three entity prediction and categorization tasks relevant for the digital library community.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the accuracy and overall suitability of a variety of Entity Linking systems for the task of disambiguating entities in 17th century depositions obtained during the 1641 Irish Rebellion. The depositions are extremely difficult for modern NLP tools to work with due to inconsistent spelling, use of language and archaic references. In order to assess the severity of difficulty faced by Entity Linking systems when working with the depositions we use them to create an evaluation corpus. This corpus is used as an input to the General Entity Annotator Benchmarking Framework a standard benchmarking platform for entity annotation systems. Based on this corpus and the results obtained from General Entity Annotator Benchmarking Framework we observe that the accuracy of existing Entity Linking systems is lacking when applied to content like these depositions. This is due to a number of issues ranging from problems with existing state-of-the-art systems to poor representation of historic entities in modern knowledge bases. We discuss some interesting questions raised by this evaluation and put forward a plan for future work in order to learn more.},

In this paper, we address this lack of empirical studies and provide insights into strategies that users apply when associating information across physical and digital documents.

abstract = {Street names are not only used across the world as part of addresses, but also reveal a lot about a country's identity. Thus, they are subject to analysis in the fields of geography and social science. There, typically, a manual analysis limited to a small region is performed, e.g., focusing on the renaming of streets in a city after a political change in a country. Surprisingly, there have been hardly any automatic, large-scale studies of street names so far, although this might lead to interesting insights regarding the distribution of particular street name phenomena. In this paper, we present an automated, world-wide analysis of street names with date references. Such temporal streets are frequently used to commemorate important events and thus particularly interesting to study. After applying a multilingual temporal tagger to discover such street names, we analyze their temporal and geographic distributions on different levels of granularity. Furthermore, we present an approach to automatically harvest potential explanations why streets in specific regions refer to particular dates. Despite the challenges of the tasks, our evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the street extraction and the explanation harvesting.},

While this is true for a basic query search, the usage of contextual session information during exploratory search especially on the level of browsing has so far been underexposed in research. In this paper, we present two approaches that contextualise browsing on the level of structured metadata in a Digital Library (DL), (1) one variant bases on document similarity and (2) one variant utilises implicit session information, such as queries and different document metadata encountered during the session of a users. We evaluate our approaches in a living lab environment using a DL in the social sciences and compare our contextualisation approaches against a non-contextualised approach. For a period of more than three months we analysed 47,444 unique retrieval sessions that contain search activities on the level of browsing. Our results show that a contextualisation of browsing significantly outperforms our baseline in terms of the position of the first clicked item in the result set. The mean rank of the first clicked document (measured as mean first relevant - MFR) was 4.52 using a non-contextualised ranking compared to 3.04 when re-ranking the result lists based on similarity to the previously viewed document. Furthermore, we observed that both contextual approaches show a noticeably higher click-through rate. A contextualisation based on document similarity leads to almost twice as many document views compared to the non-contextualised ranking.},

abstract = {Bibliographic reference parsing refers to extracting machine-readable metadata, such as the names of the authors, the title, or journal name, from bibliographic reference strings. Many approaches to this problem have been proposed so far, including regular expressions, knowledge bases and supervised machine learning. Many open source reference parsers based on various algorithms are also available. In this paper, we apply, evaluate and compare ten reference parsing tools in a specific business use case. The tools are Anystyle-Parser, Biblio, CERMINE, Citation, Citation-Parser, GROBID, ParsCit, PDFSSA4MET, Reference Tagger and Science Parse, and we compare them in both their out-of-the-box versions and versions tuned to the project-specific data. According to our evaluation, the best performing out-of-the-box tool is GROBID (F1 0.89), followed by CERMINE (F1 0.83) and ParsCit (F1 0.75). We also found that even though machine learning-based tools and tools based on rules or regular expressions achieve on average similar precision (0.77 for ML-based tools vs. 0.76 for non-ML-based tools), applying machine learning-based tools results in a recall three times higher than in the case of non-ML-based tools (0.66 vs. 0.22). Our study also confirms that tuning the models to the task-specific data results in the increase in the quality. The retrained versions of reference parsers are in all cases better than their out-of-the-box counterparts; for GROBID F1 increased by 3% (0.92 vs. 0.89), for CERMINE by 11% (0.92 vs. 0.83), and for ParsCit by 16% (0.87 vs. 0.75).},

The goal is to show that efficiently cataloging citations in libraries using a semi-automatic approach is possible. We specifically describe the current state of the workflow and its implementation. We show that we could significantly improve the automatic reference extraction that is crucial for the subsequent data curation. We further give insights on the curation and linking process and provide evaluation results that not only direct the further development of the project, but also allow us to discuss its overall feasibility.},

abstract = {The provision of digital scholarship services (DSS) in China's university is very unsystematic and fragmented. This paper reports on a literature review that aims to develop a comprehensive theoretical framework, which can serve as a practical guide for the development of DSS in China's university libraries. The framework was developed through systematically searching, screening, assessing, coding and aggregating DSS as reported in the existing body of literature. Academic literature, both in Chinese and English, as well as relevant professional reports are carefully searched, selected and analysed. The analysis of the literature pointed to 25 DSS in six categories: supporting services, formulating research ideas, locating research partners, proposal writing, research process, and publication. This paper focuses on the development of DSS in China's university libraries, but the research findings and the framework developed can provide useful insights and indications that can be shared across international borders.},

However, most of the existing researches on formula retrieval treat each formula within an article equally, while different formulae in the same article have different importance to the article. In this paper, we address the issue to rank formulae within an article based on their importance. To evaluate the importance of each formula within an article, a formula citation graph is firstly built in a large scale corpus. And the inter-articles features of formulae are extracted by the link topology analysis of formulae based on the graph. Then the word embedding model is explored to extract the inner-article features by mining the semantic relevance between a formula and the corresponding article. Finally, we leverage learning to rank technique for formulae ranking within an article based on those features. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed features are helpful for formula ranking and our approach yields better performance compared with other state-of-the-art methods.},

Recently, heterogeneous networks have been used to evaluate papers, authors and venues separately or simultaneously.

In this paper, we propose a new framework, MR-Rank, which ranks papers and venues iteratively in a mutually reinforcing way. Several factors including citation time interval, recent performance of a venue, and contribution of a paper to its venue are considered at the same time. Based on the ACL dataset, our experiments show that MR-Rank outperforms other models in terms of ranking effectiveness and efficiency.},

abstract = {Identifying plagiarized content is a crucial task for educational and research institutions, funding agencies, and academic publishers. Plagiarism detection systems available for productive use reliably identify copied text, or near-copies of text, but often fail to detect disguised forms of academic plagiarism, such as paraphrases, translations, and idea plagiarism. To improve the detection capabilities for disguised forms of academic plagiarism, we analyze the images in academic documents as text-independent features. We propose an adaptive, scalable, and extensible image-based plagiarism detection approach suitable for analyzing a wide range of image similarities that we observed in academic documents. The proposed detection approach integrates established image analysis methods, such as perceptual hashing, with newly developed similarity assessments for images, such as ratio hashing and position-aware OCR text matching. We evaluate our approach using 15 image pairs that are representative of the spectrum of image similarity we observed in alleged and confirmed cases of academic plagiarism. We embed the test cases in a collection of 4,500 related images from academic texts. Our detection approach achieved a recall of 0.73 and a precision of 1. These results indicate that our image-based approach can complement other content-based feature analysis approaches to retrieve potential source documents for suspiciously similar content from large collections. We provide our code as open source to facilitate future research on image-based plagiarism detection.},

abstract = {Multiple diagram navigation (MDN) uses multiple diagrams, maps, or charts to navigate a document collection. To support exploratory search scenarios, MDN provides unconventional overviews for the content and introduces novel navigational queries. In a Diagram-to-Content query, a user clicks on diagram elements to retrieve related collection documents. Diagram-to-Diagram queries allows users to select diagram element(s) to see related elements highlighted in other diagrams. Content-to-Diagram queries highlight diagram elements related to document(s) selected by the user. MDN depends on manually created connections between diagram elements and collection documents. Therefore, only a small portion of the targeted collection might be accessible from the diagrams. In this paper, we extend the domain of MDN diagram-to-content queries to reach related collection documents not directly connected to the diagrams. We focus on Wikipedia as a case study and a class of diagrams with specific characteristics. We exploit the Wikipedia hyperlink graph and internal diagram structures to provide a diagram-influenced ranking of Wikipedia pages. We tested different settings for our ranking algorithm using 12 diagrams from six domains. The results showed the strong influence of diagrams on ranking and reasonably high similarity between diagram elements selected by the user and the top-10-ranked pages.},

abstract = {Archived collections of documents (like newspaper and web archives) serve as important information sources in a variety of disciplines, including Digital Humanities, Historical Science, and Journalism. However, the absence of efficient and meaningful exploration methods still remains a major hurdle in the way of turning them into usable sources of information. A semantic layer is an RDF graph that describes metadata and semantic information about a collection of archived documents, which in turn can be queried through a semantic query language (SPARQL). This allows running advanced queries by combining metadata of the documents (like publication date) and content-based semantic information (like entities mentioned in the documents). However, the results returned by such structured queries can be numerous and moreover they all equally match the query. In this paper, we deal with this problem and formalize the task of ranking archived documents for structured queries on semantic layers. Then, we propose two ranking models for the problem at hand which jointly consider: i) the relativeness of documents to entities, ii) the timeliness of documents, and iii) the temporal relations among the entities. The experimental results on a new evaluation dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed models and allow us to understand their limitations.},

abstract = {For (semi-)automated subject indexing systems in digital libraries, it is often more practical to use metadata such as the title of a publication instead of the full-text or the abstract. Therefore, it is desirable to have good text mining and text classification algorithms that operate well already on the title of a publication. So far, the classification performance on titles is not competitive with the performance on the full-texts if the same number of training samples is used for training. However, it is much easier to obtain title data in large quantities and to use it for training than full-text data. In this paper, we investigate the question how models obtained from training on increasing amounts of title training data compare to models from training on a constant number of full-texts. We evaluate this question on a large-scale dataset from the medical domain (PubMed) and from economics (EconBiz). In these datasets, the titles and annotations of millions of publications are available, and they outnumber the available full-texts by a factor of 20 and 15, respectively. To exploit these large amounts of data to their full potential, we develop three strong deep learning classifiers and evaluate their performance on the two datasets. The results are promising. On the EconBiz dataset, all three classifiers outperform their full-text counterparts by a large margin. The best title-based classifier outperforms the best full-text method by 9.4%. On the PubMed dataset, the best title-based method almost reaches the performance of the best full-text classifier, with a difference of only 2.9%.},

Most of the tags in these narrow folksonomies were created by users when they published a post, but some tags were retroactively created for old posts by a small group of volunteers. Both organic and retroactive tags on MetaFilter and Ask MetaFilter followed a power law distribution, which is expected for folksonomies. Based on tag distribution, use of organization tags, and avoidance of synonyms, however, retroactive taggers did not tag like professional indexers. Instead, they tagged using similar practices to organic taggers, even actively accommodating the broader community's use of synonyms. These findings suggest that folksonomies remain a distinctly different approach to knowledge organization.},

It normally consists of reading and interpreting a large number of carefully selected texts, without however always having a comprehensive knowledge of all the potentially relevant material. Thus, our objective is to design a query algebra to access temporal text corpora. It shall comprehensively allow domain experts to formalize hypotheses on how concepts manifest in large-scale digital text corpora targeting at the complete works of Reinhart Koselleck, a highly prominent researcher in conceptual history. In cooperation with domain experts, we first determine the primary information types used in conceptual history, such as word usage frequency or sentiment. Based on this, we define database operators formalizing these types, which can be combined to formulate arbitrarily complex queries representing hypotheses. The result is a novel query algebra that enables researchers in conceptual history to access large text corpora and extensively analyze word behaviors over time in a comprehensive way. In a proof of concept, we demonstrate how to use our algebra resulting in the first novel insights. This proves the suitability of our algebra.},

We focus on a concise evaluation that shows clearly for which problem setups and at which time during the clustering process our approach works best. In contrast to most other works in this field, we are skeptical towards the performance of author name disambiguation methods in general and compare our approach to the trivial single-cluster baseline. Our results are presented separately for each correct clustering size as we can explain that, when treating all cases together, the trivial baseline and more sophisticated approaches are hardly distinguishable in terms of evaluation results. Our model shows state-of-the-art performance for all correct clustering sizes without any discriminative training and with tuning only one convergence parameter.},

In this paper, we induce high-quality training labels for the task of figure extraction in a large number of scientific documents, with no human intervention. To accomplish this we leverage the auxiliary data provided in two large web collections of scientific documents (arXiv and PubMed) to locate figures and their associated captions in the rasterized PDF. We share the resulting dataset of over 5.5 million induced labels---4,000 times larger than the previous largest figure extraction dataset---with an average precision of 96.8%, to enable the development of modern data-driven methods for this task. We use this dataset to train a deep neural network for end-to-end figure detection, yielding a model that can be more easily extended to new domains compared to previous work. The model was successfully deployed in Semantic Scholar,footnoteurlhttps://www.semanticscholar.org/ a large-scale academic search engine, and used to extract figures in 13 million scientific documents.footnoteA demo of our system is available at urlhttp://labs.semanticscholar.org/deepfigures/,and our dataset of induced labels can be downloaded at urlhttps://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-research-public/deepfigures/jcdl-deepfigures-labels.tar.gz.

Especially in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, mathematical formulae are crucial to communicate information, e.g., in scientific papers, and to perform computations using computer algebra systems. Enabling computers to access the information encoded in mathematical formulae requires machine-readable formats that can represent both the presentation and content, i.e., the semantics, of formulae. Exchanging such information between systems additionally requires conversion methods for mathematical representation formats. We analyze how the semantic enrichment of formulae improves the format conversion process and show that considering the textual context of formulae reduces the error rate of such conversions. Our main contributions are: (1) providing an openly available benchmark dataset for the mathematical format conversion task consisting of a newly created test collection, an extensive, manually curated gold standard and task-specific evaluation metrics; (2) performing a quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art tools for mathematical format conversions; (3) presenting a new approach that considers the textual context of formulae to reduce the error rate for mathematical format conversions. Our benchmark dataset facilitates future research on mathematical format conversions as well as research on many problems in mathematical information retrieval. Because we annotated and linked all components of formulae, e.g., identifiers, operators and other entities, to Wikidata entries, the gold standard can, for instance, be used to train methods for formula concept discovery and recognition. Such methods can then be applied to improve mathematical information retrieval systems, e.g., for semantic formula search, recommendation of mathematical content, or detection of mathematical plagiarism.},

abstract = {Scientific articles usually follow a common pattern of discourse, and their contents can be divided into several facets, such as objective, method, and result. We examine the efficacy of using these discourse facets for citation recommendation. A method for learning multi-vector representations of scientific articles is proposed, in which each vector encodes a discourse facet present in an article. With each facet represented as a separate vector, the similarity of articles can be measured not in their entirety, but facet by facet. The proposed representation method is tested on a new citation recommendation task called context-based co-citation recommendation. This task calls for the evaluation of article similarity in terms of citation contexts, wherein facets help to abstract and generalize the diversity of contexts. The experimental results show that the facet-based representation outperforms the standard monolithic representation of articles.},

Modern biographies have relied on interviews to supplement contemporaneous sources of primary material such as letters, literary drafts, and notebooks, usually held in physical special collections acquired and curated by major research libraries. Will the addition of new digital sources such as records repositories, digital libraries, social media, and collections of ephemera change biographical research practices? I use the construction of a subject-driven collection of over 11,750 discrete digital items as a case study to demonstrate how new digital resources can extend the breadth and depth of biographical description, facilitate the rediscovery of a subject's social network, and enable formerly invisible literary influences to be foregrounded. I also explore the implications of the use of ephemera in tandem with other digital resources to ask what we might want to save in the future-including elements of today's social media platforms-and to discuss the trade-offs in making material that was once ephemeral (and difficult to access) so readily available online.},

abstract = {Event-based collections are often started with a web search, but the search results you find on Day 1 may not be the same as those you find on Day 7. In this paper, we consider collections that originate from extracting URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) from Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs). Specifically, we seek to provide insight about the retrievability of URIs of news stories found on Google, and to answer two main questions: first, can one "refind" the same URI of a news story (for the same query) from Google after a given time? Second, what is the probability of finding a story on Google over a given period of time? To answer these questions, we issued seven queries to Google every day for over seven months (2017-05-25 to 2018-01-12) and collected links from the first five SERPs to generate seven collections for each query. The queries represent public interest stories: "healthcare bill," "manchester bombing," "london terrorism," "trump russia," "travel ban," "hurricane harvey," and "hurricane irma." We tracked each URI in all collections over time to estimate the discoverability of URIs from the first five SERPs. Our results showed that the daily average rate at which stories were replaced on the default Google SERP ranged from 0.21 - 0.54, and a weekly rate of 0.39 - 0.79, suggesting the fast replacement of older stories by newer stories. The probability of finding the same URI of a news story after one day from the initial appearance on the SERP ranged from 0.34 - 0.44. After a week, the probability of finding the same news stories diminishes rapidly to 0.01 - 0.11. In addition to the reporting of these probabilities, we also provide two predictive models for estimating the probability of finding the URI of an arbitrary news story on SERPs as a function of time. The web archiving community considers link rot and content drift important reasons for collection building. Similarly, our findings suggest that due to the difficulty in retrieving the URIs of news stories from Google, collection building that originates from search engines should begin as soon as possible in order to capture the first stages of events, and should persist in order to capture the evolution of the events, because it becomes more difficult to find the same news stories with the same queries on Google, as time progresses.},

We amend Memento syntax and semantics to allow TimeMap enrichment to account for additional attributes to be expressed inclusive of the requirements for dereferencing private Web archive captures. We provide a method to involve the user further in the negotiation of archival captures in dimensions beyond time. We introduce a model for archival querying precedence and short-circuiting, as needed when aggregating private and personal Web archive captures with those from public Web archives through Memento. Negotiation of this sort is novel to Web archiving and allows for the more seamless aggregation of various types of Web archives to convey a more accurate picture of the past Web.},

abstract = {Comparative text mining extends from genre analysis and political bias detection to the revelation of cultural and geographic differences, through to the search for prior art across patents and scientific papers. These applications use cross-collection topic modeling for the exploration, clustering, and comparison of large sets of documents, such as digital libraries. However, topic modeling on documents from different collections is challenging because of domain-specific vocabulary. We present a cross-collection topic model combined with automatic domain term extraction and phrase segmentation. This model distinguishes collection-specific and collection-independent words based on information entropy and reveals commonalities and differences of multiple text collections. We evaluate our model on patents, scientific papers, newspaper articles, forum posts, and Wikipedia articles. In comparison to state-of-the-art cross-collection topic modeling, our model achieves up to 13% higher topic coherence, up to 4% lower perplexity, and up to 31% higher document classification accuracy. More importantly, our approach is the first topic model that ensures disjunct general and specific word distributions, resulting in clear-cut topic representations.},

abstract = {The distributional hypothesis states that similar words tend to have similar contexts in which they occur. Word embedding models exploit this hypothesis by learning word vectors based on the local context of words. Probabilistic topic models on the other hand utilize word co-occurrences across documents to identify topically related words. Due to their complementary nature, these models define different notions of word similarity, which, when combined, can produce better topical representations. In this paper we propose WELDA, a new type of topic model, which combines word embeddings (WE) with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to improve topic quality. We achieve this by estimating topic distributions in the word embedding space and exchanging selected topic words via Gibbs sampling from this space. We present an extensive evaluation showing that WELDA cuts runtime by at least 30% while outperforming other combined approaches with respect to topic coherence and for solving word intrusion tasks.},

abstract = {Being able to rapidly recognise new research trends is strategic for many stakeholders, including universities, institutional funding bodies, academic publishers and companies. The literature presents several approaches to identifying the emergence of new research topics, which rely on the assumption that the topic is already exhibiting a certain degree of popularity and consistently referred to by a community of researchers. However, detecting the emergence of a new research area at an embryonic stage, i.e., before the topic has been consistently labelled by a community of researchers and associated with a number of publications, is still an open challenge. We address this issue by introducing Augur, a novel approach to the early detection of research topics. Augur analyses the diachronic relationships between research areas and is able to detect clusters of topics that exhibit dynamics correlated with the emergence of new research topics. Here we also present the Advanced Clique Percolation Method (ACPM), a new community detection algorithm developed specifically for supporting this task. Augur was evaluated on a gold standard of 1,408 debutant topics in the 2000-2011 interval and outperformed four alternative approaches in terms of both precision and recall.},

As averaging the word vectors from a short text is known to work reasonably well compared to the other comprehensive models utilizing their order, we adopt the averaged word vectors from the lyrics and user's interpretations about them, which are short in general, as the feature for this classification task.

Applying rough co-citation to the task of clustering will be beneficial. This study aims to explore whether rough co-citation can improve the performance of co-citation clustering. A clustering experiment is conducted to evaluate the effects of using rough co-citation.

The deluge of research papers and the huge amount of submissions being made to journals these days makes editorial decision a very challenging task. The current work attempts to investigate certain impact factors that may have a role in the editorial decision making process. The proposed work exhibits potential for the development of an AI-assisted peer review system which could aid the editors as well as the authors in making appropriate decisions in reasonable time and thus accelerate the overall process of scholarly publishing.},

Given a keyword query as an input, we utilize semantic annotations present in the pseudo-relevant set of documents for generating the aspects. Our approach to generate the aspects considers the salience of the annotations by modeling their semantics as well as considering their co-occurrence in the pseudo-relevant set of documents. The generated aspects are also beneficial for representing documents in a structured manner. We show preliminary results on two news archives demonstrating the quality of the generated aspects over a testbed of more than 5,000 aspects derived from Wikipedia.},

abstract = {The identification and extraction of the events that news articles report on is a commonly performed task in the analysis workflow of various projects that analyze news articles. However, due to the lack of universally usable and publicly available methods for news articles, many researchers must redundantly implement methods for event extraction to be used within their projects. Answers to the journalistic five W and one H questions (5W1H) describe the main event of a news story, i.e., who did what, when, where, why, and how. We propose Giveme5W1H, an open-source system that uses syntactic and domain-specific rules to extract phrases answering the 5W1H. In our evaluation, we find that the extraction precision of 5W1H phrases is p=0.64, and p=0.79 for the first four W questions, which discretely describe an event.},

The previous approaches for keyphrase extraction simply rank keyphrases according to statistics-based model or graph-based model, which ignore the influence of external knowledge. In this paper, we take prior knowledge, which contains controlled vocabulary of keyphrases and their prior probability, into consideration to enhance previous methods. First, we build a controlled vocabulary of keyphrases introduced by keyphrases from existing collections and a keyphrase candidate set is filtered from a given document by it. Then, we use prior probability to represent the importance of keyphrases candidate with TF-IDF and TextRank. Finally, a supervised learning algorithm is used to learn optimal weights of these three features. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show the great advantages of prior knowledge on keyphrase extraction. Furthermore, we achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the art methods.},

In this study, we propose a novel solution, cross-language citation recommendation via Publication Content and Citation Representation Fusion (PCCRF). PCCRF can learn a representation function by mapping the publications, from various languages and repositories, to a low-dimensional joint embedding space from both content semantic and citation relation viewpoints. The proposed method can optimize the publication representations by maximizing the likelihood of observing network neighborhoods (which are generated by a semi-supervised random walk algorithm) of publications. Experimental results show that the proposed method can be promising for cross-language citation recommendation.},

We found 3,485 tweets from 419 of the accounts listed as IRA accounts which specifically discussed Brexit and related topics such as the EU and migration. We have been collating an archive of tweets related to Brexit since August 2015 and currently have over 70 million tweets. The Brexit referendum took place on the 23rd June 2016 and the UK voted to leave the European Union. We gathered the data using the Twitter API and a selection of hashtags chosen by a panel of academic experts. Currently we have in excess of fifty different hashtags and we add to the set periodically to accurately represent the evolving conversation. Twitter has closed the accounts that were documented in the Senate list meaning that these tweets are no longer available through the webpage or API. Due to Twitter's terms of service we are unable to share specific tweet text or user profile information but our findings, utilising text and metadata from derived and aggregated data, allows us to provide important insights into the behaviour of these trolls.},

The task is challenging as comparison points in a typical pair of articles tend to be sparse. We presented a multi-level document analysis (viz. document, paragraph and sentence level) for extracting the comparisons. For extracting sentence level comparisons, which is the hardest task among three, we have used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with features extracted around <entity, aspect,="" value=""> triple. Experiments conducted on a small dataset provide encouraging performance.},

We apply grounded theory principles to analyze 75 articles authored by library administrators, librarians with IT expertise, IT professionals, cybersecurity experts, and business consultants engaged in planning, deploying, and maintaining library services in the cloud. Data analysis reveals that a majority of the past literature reports challenges to implementing Software as a Service (SaaS) in libraries. The seven key areas critical to the successful implementation of SaaS in libraries are related to: (1) data, (2) authentication and privacy of patrons, (3) skills and knowledge of library staff and organizational culture, (4) IT infrastructure, (5) features of services, (6) fixed and operational costs associated with data and technology, and (7) policies and contracts. Data issues like access, storage, ownership, curation, security, confidentiality, loss, migration, and redundancy seem to have the most influence on SaaS deployment in libraries.},

abstract = {Large digital libraries often index articles without curating their digital copies in their own repositories. Examples include the National Digital Library of India (NDLI) and ACM Digital Library. Full text view generally requires subscription to libraries that host the contents. The problem is particularly severe for researchers, given high journal subscription charges. However, authors often keep a free copy in preprint servers. Sometimes a conference paper behind a paywall has a closely resembling journal version freely available on the Web. These open access surrogates are immensely valuable to researchers who cannot afford to access the original publications. We present a lightweight tool called Surrogator to automatically identify open access surrogates of access-restricted scholarly papers present in a digital library. Its focus on approximate matches makes it different from many existing applications. In this poster, we describe the design and interface of the tool and our initial experiences of using it on articles indexed in NDLI.},

abstract = {Creating scientific publications is a complex process. It is composed of a number of different activities, such as designing the experiments, analyzing the data, and writing the manuscript. Information about the contributions of individual authors of a paper is important for assessing authors' scientific achievements. Some biomedical publications contain a short section written in natural language, which describes the roles each author played in the process of preparing the article. In this paper, we present a study of authors' roles commonly appearing in these sections, and propose an algorithm for automatic extraction of authors' roles from them. In our study, we used co-clustering techniques, as well as Open Information Extraction, to semi-automatically discover the most popular roles within a corpus of contributions sections. In total 13 roles were discovered, three of which (paper revision, literature review, and interpretation) are not described by existing author role taxonomies. Discovered roles are then used to automatically build a training set for a supervised Na\"{\i}ve Bayes role extractor. The proposed role extractor is able to extract roles from the text with micro-averaged precision 0.68, recall 0.48 and F1 0.57.},

To address this gap, we compared several strategies that can recommend a set of diverse citation contexts by re-ranking extracted citation contexts. Diversification was achieved by combining one of two semantic distance algorithms with one of two re-ranking algorithms. Experimenting with CiteSeerX dataset, our program produced a diverse list of 10 citation contexts that could be recommended to users. We evaluated the experiment results based on a user case study of 15 articles. The case study revealed that a diversity strategy that combined the "ESA" and "MMR" led to a better reading experience for participants compared to other diversity strategies.

Because the majority of studies relevant to smart libraries take a qualitative approach, a meta-synthesis of existing qualitative research on smart libraries has been conducted and analyzed.

A document may not make its greatest impact right after its publication, and some documents' impact can last a long period of time. This study develops a graphical model to capture the temporal dynamics in the impact of latent topics from a corpus of documents. Specifically, we modeled citation counts using Poisson distributions with Gamma priors. We conducted experiments on papers published in (i) D-Lib Magazine and (ii) The Library Quarterly from 2007 to 2017. Comparing with ToT, we found that our model produced more robust results on topical trends over time. The results also showed that prevalence and impact of the same topic are not correlated. Enabling better understanding and modeling of topical impact over time, this model can be used for the design of digital libraries and social media platforms, as well as evaluation of scientific contributions and policies.},

abstract = {Open Access (OA) Repositories provide users with barrier free access to scientific resources and play a significant role in the dissemination of scientific results and the increase of author visibility. Although these repositories are providing free resources, they are not well connected on the level of their metadata. One approach to tackle this issue is to linkup with the scattered pieces of bibliographic and biographic information residing in external sources. In this demonstration, we focus on the contributors of a repository by means of authority data that can be linked to several authority systems (WikiData,DBpedia, VIAF, ORCID, RePEc) to make repository data more diverse, interlinked and visible.},

abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate an online system for historical event retrieval. Our system outputs ranked events according to an input text query, time range and category relevance. It is useful for users searching not just for important past events related to input entities but events that belong to specified subset of general categories. It can be also helpful for creating datasets of events falling into specific categories or for generating specialized timelines.},

abstract = {This tutorial is a thorough and deep introduction to the Digital Libraries (DL) field, providing a firm foundation: covering key concepts and terminology, as well as services, systems, technologies, methods, standards, projects, issues, and practices. It introduces and builds upon a firm theoretical foundation (starting with the '5S' set of intuitive aspects: Streams, Structures, Spaces, Scenarios, Societies), giving careful definitions and explanations of all the key parts of a 'minimal digital library', and expanding from that basis to cover key DL issues. Illustrations come from a set of case studies, including from multiple current projects, including with webpages, tweets, and social networks. Attendees will be exposed to four Morgan and Claypool books that elaborate on 5S, published 2012-2014. Complementing the coverage of '5S' will be an overview of key aspects of the DELOS Reference Model and DL.org activities. Further, use of a Hadoop cluster supporting big data DLs will be described.},

In particular, we will discuss a wide range of keyphrase extraction models ranging from the representative supervised approaches such as KEA and GenEx to more recent ones that make use of the advances in artificial intelligence. Beyond introducing the outstanding approaches in this domain, we will discuss how keyphrases can significantly improve the search and retrieval of information in digital libraries and hence, leads to an improved organization, search, retrieval, and recommendation of scientific documents. Participants will learn about existing approaches, challenges and future trends in the keyphrase extraction task, and how they can be applied to digital library applications.},

This workshop will provide an opportunity for participants to exchange research ideas on image collections, including the creation, organization, access and use (COAU) of various image datasets. We expect to discuss various theories, methods, techniques, challenges, and new research directions as related to image's COAU. Especially we would like to explore innovative ideas on image annotation, retrieval, use behavior &amp;personas, processing of different types of images, and visual image metrics. The workshop will allow researchers to communicate with their peers on projects and develop new ideas through presentation and discussion. We hope to establish a community of researchers from related disciplines and explore questions critical to the future development of image's COAU. Participants of this workshop will be invited to submit a full paper to a special issue at The Electronic Library (http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journal/el) on Image Collections.},
