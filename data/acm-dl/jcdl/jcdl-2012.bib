abstract = {Social media records the thoughts and activities of countless cultures and subcultures around the globe. Yet institutional efforts to archive social media content remain controversial. We report on 988 responses across six surveys of social media users that included questions to explore this controversy. The quantitative and qualitative results show that the way people think about the issue depends on how personal and ephemeral they view the content to be. They use concepts such as creator privacy, content characteristics, technological capabilities, perceived legal rights, and intrinsic social good to reason about the boundaries of institutional social media archiving efforts.},

abstract = {Diverse digital resources are commonly used by different types of users. It is common practice to develop those application having in mind a set of requirements for a specific target category of users. We envisaged and designed the IPSA archive and system using a similar approach: the identification of a set of requirements for researchers in illuminated manuscripts as a target group of domain professional users. The IPSA system has been in use as a research tool by domain professionals. The consideration that the content of the archive managed by the IPSA system could be of interest for other types of users suggested reconsidering its approach to envisage a new system designed around the same archive of illuminated manuscripts for their access by diverse categories of users. The paper reports on the work that was conducted to re-design and re-engineer the system to match requirements and expectations of non-domain users.},

abstract = {Important biomedical information is often recorded, published or archived in unstructured and semi-structured textual form. Artificial intelligence and knowledge discovery techniques may be applied to large volumes of such data to identify and extract useful metadata, not only for providing access to these documents, but also for conducting analyses and uncovering patterns and trends in a field. The System for Preservation of Electronic Resources (SPER), an information management tool developed at the U.S. National Library of Medicine, provides these capabilities by integrating machine learning, data mining and digital preservation techniques. In this paper, we present an overview of SPER and its ability to retrieve information from one such dataset. We show how SPER was applied to the semi-structured records of an international health science program, the 46-year continuous archive of conference publications and related documents from the Joint Cholera Panel of the U.S.-Japan Cooperative Medical Science Program (CMSP). We explain the techniques by which metadata was extracted automatically from the semi-structured document contents to preserve these publications, and show how such data was used to quantitatively describe the activity of a research community toward a preliminary study of a subset of its specific health science program goals.},

abstract = {Usually scientists breed research ideas inspired by previous publications, but they are unlikely to follow all publications in the unbounded literature collection. The volume of literature keeps on expanding extremely fast, whilst not all papers contribute equal impact to the academic society. Being aware of potentially influential literature would put one in an advanced position in choosing important research references. Hence, estimation of potential influence is of great significance. We study a challenging problem of identifying potentially influential literature. We examine a set of hypotheses on what are the fundamental characteristics for highly cited papers and find some interesting patterns. Based on these observations, we learn to identify potentially influential literature via Future Influence Prediction (FIP), which aims to estimate the future influence of literature. The system takes a series of features of a particular publication as input and produces as output the estimated citation counts of that article after a given time period. We consider several regression models to formulate the learning process and evaluate their performance based on the coefficient of determination (R2). Experimental results on a real-large data set show a mean average predictive performance of 83.6% measured in R^2. We apply the learned model to the application of bibliography recommendation and obtain prominent performance improvement in terms of Mean Average Precision (MAP).},

abstract = {Bibliographic documents are basically associated with many entities including authors, venues, affiliations, etc. While bibliographic search engines addressed mainly relevant document ranking according to a query topic, ranking other related relevant bibliographic entities is still challenging. Indeed, document relevance is the primary level that allows inferring the relevance of the other entities regardless of the query topic. In this paper, we propose a novel integrated ranking model, called BibRank, that aims at ranking both document and author entities in bibliographic networks. The underlying algorithm propagates entity scores through the network by means of citation and authorship links. Moreover, we propose to weight these relationships using content-based indicators that estimate the topical relatedness between entities. In particular, we estimate the common similarity between homogeneous entities by analyzing marginal citations. We also compare document and author language models in order to evaluate the level of author's knowledge on the document topic and the document representativeness of author's knowledge. Experiment results on the representative CiteSeerX dataset show that BibRank model outperforms baseline ranking models with a significant improvement.},

abstract = {Recently expertise retrieval has received increasing interests in both academia and industry. Finding experts with demonstrated expertise for a given query is a nontrivial task especially from a large-scale Web 2.0 systems, such as question answering and bibliography data, where users are actively publishing useful content online, interacting with each other, and forming social networks in various ways, leading to heterogeneous networks in addition to the large amounts of textual content information. Many approaches have been proposed and shown to be useful for expertise ranking. However, most of these methods only consider the textual documents while ignoring heterogeneous network structures or can merely integrate with one additional kind of information. None of them can fully exploit the characteristics of heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose a joint regularization framework to enhance expertise retrieval by modeling heterogeneous networks as regularization constraints on top of document-centric model. We argue that multi-typed linking edges reveal valuable information which should be treated differently. Motivated by this intuition, we formulate three hypotheses to capture unique characteristics for different graphs, and mathematically model those hypotheses jointly with the document and other information. To illustrate our methodology, we apply the framework to expert finding applications using a bibliography dataset with 1.1 million papers and 0.7 million authors. The experimental results show that our proposed approach can achieve significantly better results than the baseline and other enhanced models.},

abstract = {The number of channels of digital television is increasing, particularly the number that are free-to-air. However due to the nature of broadcasting, this morass of information is not, for the main part, organized---it is principally a succession of images and sound transmitted as multiplexed streams of data. Compare this deluge that terrestrially bombards our homes with the information available in the digital libraries we access over the Internet---stored using software purpose built to help organize carefully curated sets of documents. This project brings together these two seemingly incompatible concepts to develop a software environment that concurrently captures all the available live television channels---so a user does not need to proactively choose what to record---and segments them into files which are then imported into a digital video library with a user interface designed to work from a multimedia remote control. A shifting time-based "window" of all recordings is maintained---we settled on from the last two weeks so as to be practicably operable on a regular desktop PC. The system leverages off the information contained in the electronic program guide and the video recordings to generate metadata suitable for the digital library. A user evaluation of the developed prototype showed a high level of participant satisfaction across a range of attributes, notably date-based searching.},

abstract = {Digitized physical books offer access to tremendous amounts of knowledge, even for people with print-related disabilities. Various projects and standard activities are underway to make all of our past and present books accessible. However digitizing books requires extensive human efforts such as correcting the results of OCR (optical character recognition) and adding structural information such as headings. Some Asian languages need extra efforts for the OCR errors because of their many and varied character sets. Japanese has used more than 10,000 characters compared with a few hundred in English. This heavy workload is inhibiting the creation of accessible digital books. To facilitate digitization, we are developing a new system for processing physical books. We reduce and disperse the human efforts and accelerate conversions by combining automatic inference and human capabilities. Our system preserves the original page images for the entire digitization process to support gradual refinement and distributes the work as micro-tasks. We conducted trials with the Japanese National Diet Library (NDL) to evaluate the required effort for digitizing books with a variety of layouts and years of publication. The results showed old Japanese books had specific problems when correcting the OCR errors and adding structures. Drawing on our results, we discuss further workload reductions and future directions for international digitization systems.},

The Treatise is the most authoritative compilation of invertebrate fossil records. Unfortunately, the PDF version is simply a clone of paper publications and the content is in no way organized to facilitate search and knowledge discovery. We extracted texts and images from the Treatise, stored them in a database, and built a system for efficient browsing and searching. For image processing in particular, we segmented fossil photos from figures, recognized the embedded labels, and linked the images to the corresponding data entries. The detailed information of each genus, including fossil images, is delivered to users through a web access module. Some external applications (e.g. Google Earth) are acquired through web services APIs to improve user experience. Given the rich information in the Treatise, analyzing, modeling and understanding paleontological data are significant in many areas, such as: understanding evolution; understanding climate change; finding fossil fuels, etc. IPKB builds a general framework that aims to facilitate knowledge discovery activities in invertebrate paleontology, and provides a solid foundation for future explorations. In this article, we report our initial accomplishments. The specific techniques we employed in the project, such as those involved in text parsing, image-label association and meta data extraction, can be insightful and serve as examples for other researchers.},

abstract = {Early Modern emblems combined text and image. Though there were many variants, the archetypical emblem literary form (mid-sixteenth through mid-eighteenth centuries) consisted of an image (the pictura), a text inscription (the inscriptio), and a text epigram (the subscriptio), the last usually in verse. Digitized emblem literature poses interesting challenges as regards content and metadata granularity, the use of interdisciplinary controlled vocabularies, and the need to present digitized primary sources in a complex network of associated sources, derivatives, and contemporaneous context. In this paper, we describe a digital library Web application designed to better support the ways emblem scholars search for and use digitized emblem books, focusing on metadata design, issues of resource granularity and identification, and the use of Linked Data Web services for Iconclass, a multilingual classification system for cultural heritage art and images. Outcomes to date, achieved by emblem scholars and librarians working in collaboration, provide a case study for multi-faceted, interactive approaches to curating mixed text-image digital resources and the use of Linked Data vocabulary services. Lessons learned highlight the value of librarian-scholar collaboration and help to illustrate why digital libraries need to move beyond merely disseminating digitized book surrogates.},

abstract = {Mood is an important access point in music digital libraries and online music repositories, but generating ground truth for evaluating various music mood classification algorithms is a challenging problem. This is because collecting enough human judgments is time-consuming and costly due to the subjectivity of music mood. In this study, we explore the viability of crowdsourcing music mood classification judgments using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Specifically, we compare the mood classification judgments collected for the annual Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX) with judgments collected using MTurk. Our data show that the overall distribution of mood clusters and agreement rates from MIREX and MTurk were comparable. However, Turkers tended to agree less with the pre-labeled mood clusters than MIREX evaluators. The system evaluation results generated using both sets of data were mostly the same except for detecting one statistically significant pair using Friedman's test. We conclude that MTurk can potentially serve as a viable alternative for ground truth collection, with some reservation with regards to particular mood clusters.},

We consider the problem of exploratory search in large DLs of time-oriented data. We propose a novel approach for overview-first exploration of data collections based on user-selected metadata properties. In a 2D layout representing entities of the selected property are laid out based on their similarity with respect to the underlying data content. The display is enhanced by compact summarizations of underlying data elements, and forms the basis for exploratory navigation of users in the data space. The approach is proposed as an interface for visual exploration, leading the user to discover interesting relationships between data items relying on content-based similarity between data items and their respective metadata labels. We apply the method on real data sets from the earth observation community, showing its applicability and usefulness.},

The Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) specification is applied to model the basic structural semantics of HUBzero resources as Nested Aggregations, and data and metadata are mapped to vocabularies such as Dublin Core and published within the web representations of the resources using RDFa. Resource Maps can be harvested using an RDF crawler or an OAI-PMH data provider that were bundled for demonstration purposes. A visualization was produced to browse and navigate the relations among data and metadata from an example hub.},

abstract = {While most digital collections have limited forms of change--primarily creation and deletion of additional resources--there exists a class of digital collections that undergoes additional kinds of change. These collections are made up of resources that are distributed across the Internet and brought together into a collection via hyperlinking. Resources in these collections can be expected to change as time goes on. Part of the difficulty in maintaining these collections is determining if a changed page is still a valid member of the collection. Others have tried to address this problem by measuring change and defining a maximum allowed threshold of change, however, these methods treat all change as a potential problem and treat web content as a static document despite its intrinsically dynamic nature. Instead, we approach the significance of change on the web as a normal part of a web document's life-cycle and determine the difference between what a maintainer expects a page to do and what it actually does. In this work we evaluate the different options for extractors and analyzers in order to determine the best options from a suite of techniques. The evaluation used a human-generated ground-truth set of blog changes. The results of this work showed a statistically significant improvement over a range of traditional threshold techniques when applied to our collection of tagged blog changes.},

abstract = {Information resources in digital libraries are usually described, along with their context, by structured data records, commonly referred as metadata. Those records often contain unstructured information in natural language text, since they typically follow a data model which defines generic semantics for its data elements, or includes data elements modeled to contain free text. The information contained in these data elements, although machine readable, resides in unstructured natural language texts that are difficult to process by computers. This paper addresses a particular task of information extraction, typically called named entity recognition, which deals with the references to entities made by names occurring in the texts. This paper presents the results of a study of how the named entity recognition problem manifests itself in digital library metadata. In particular, we present the main differences between performing named entity recognition in natural language and in the text within metadata. The paper finalizes with a novel approach for named entity recognition in metadata.},

abstract = {One of the hardest problems faced by current scholarly digital libraries is author name ambiguity. This problem occurs when, in a set of citation records, there are records of a same author under distinct names, or citation records belonging to distinct authors with similar names. Among the several proposed methods, the most effective ones seem to be based on the direct assignment of the records to their respective authors by means of the application of supervised machine learning techniques. The effectiveness of such methods is usually directly correlated with the amount of supervised training data available. However, the acquisition of training examples requires skilled human annotators to manually label references. Aiming to reduce the set of examples needed to produce the training data, in this paper we propose a new active sampling strategy based on association rules for the author name disambiguation task. We compare our strategy with state-of-the-art supervised baselines that use the complete labeled training dataset and other active methods and show that very competitive results in terms of disambiguation effectiveness can be obtained with reductions in the training set of up to 71%.},

We describe the architecture of AckSeer and discuss the extraction algorithms that achieve a F1 measure above 83%. We use multiple Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools and propose a method for merging the outcome from different recognizers. The resulting entities are stored in a database then made searchable by adding them to the AckSeer index along with the metadata of the containing paper/book.We build AckSeer on top of the documents in CiteSeerx digital library yielding more than 500,000 acknowledgments and more than 4 million mentioned entities.},

Using a group of ten students and over one thousand crowdsourced judgments, we conducted multiple user studies to evaluate topics and related passages in books, all learned by topic modeling. Using ten books, selected from humanities (e.g. Plato's Republic), social sciences (e.g. Marx's Capital) and sciences (e.g. Einstein's Relativity), and four different evaluation experiments, we show that users agree that the learned topics are coherent and important to the book, and related to the automatically generated passages. We show how crowdsourced evaluations are useful, and can complement more focused evaluations using students who have studied the texts. This work provides a framework for (1) learning topics and related passages in books, and (2) evaluating those learned topics and passages, and moves one step toward automatic annotation to support topic navigation of books.},

The UNESCO City of Literature digital library (referred to internally as "City of Lit") consists of a mobile application for the general public to access the database and a set of web-based interfaces for researcher and content creators to contribute to the database. Members of the research team have developed undergraduate literature courses to study the feasibility of using young scholars for digital content creation, and the pedagogical effect of including digital research in traditional literary courses. Students in the courses were trained to conduct scholarly research and generate a variety of digital resources to be included in the digital collection. This paper reports our experience building the City of Lit digital library and the results from evaluations and studies of the students in the courses.

We need a new culture of intellectual production in which student researchers and citizen scholars play a central role. And we need as a consequence to reorganize the education that we provide in the humanities, stressing participatory learning, and supporting a virtuous cycle where students contribute data as they learn and learn in order to contribute knowledge. We report on five strategies that we have implemented to further this virtuous cycle: (1) reading environments by which learners can work with languages that they have not studied, (2) feedback for those who choose to internalize knowledge about a particular language, (3) methods whereby those with knowledge of different languages can collaborate to develop interpretations and to produce new annotations, (4) dynamic reading lists that allow learners to assess and to document what they have mastered, and (5) general e-portfolios in which learners can track what they have accomplished and document what they have contributed and learned to the public or to particular groups.},

abstract = {Textual data ranging from corpora of digitized historic documents to large collections of news feeds provide a rich source for temporal and geographic information. Such types of information have recently gained a lot of interest in support of different search and exploration tasks, e.g., by organizing news along a timeline or placing the origin of documents on a map. However, for this, temporal and geographic information embedded in documents is often considered in isolation. We claim that through combining such information into (chronologically ordered) event-like features interesting and meaningful search and exploration tasks are possible. In this paper, we present a framework for the extraction, exploration, and visualization of event information in document collections. For this, one has to identify and combine temporal and geographic expressions from documents, thus enriching a document collection by a set of normalized events. Traditional search queries then can be enriched by conditions on the events relevant to the search subject. Most important for our event-centric approach is that a search result consists of a sequence of events relevant to the search terms and not just a document hit-list. Such events can originate from different documents and can be further explored, in particular events relevant to a search query can be ordered chronologically. We demonstrate the utility of our framework by different (multilingual) search and exploration scenarios using a Wikipedia corpus.},

abstract = {Concept taxonomies such as MeSH, the ACM Computing Classification System, and the NY Times Subject Headings are frequently used to help organize data. They typically consist of a set of concept names organized in a hierarchy. However, these names and structure are often not sufficient to fully capture the intended meaning of a taxonomy node, and particularly non-experts may have difficulty navigating and placing data into the taxonomy. This paper introduces two semi-supervised topic models that automatically augment a given taxonomy with many additional keywords by leveraging a corpus of multi-labeled documents. Our experiments show that users find the topics beneficial for taxonomy interpretation, substantially increasing their cataloging accuracy. Furthermore, the models provide a better information rate compared to Labeled LDA.},

abstract = {For most, the web is the first source to answer a question formulated by curiosity, need, or research reasons. This phenomenon is due to the internet's ubiquitous access, ease of use, and the extensive and ever expanding content. The problem is no longer the need to acquire content to encourage use, but to provide organizational tools to support content categorization that will facilitate improved access methods. This paper presents the results of a new text characterization algorithm that combines semantic and linguistic techniques utilizing domain-based ontology background knowledge. It explores the combination of meronym, synonym, and hypernym linguistic relationships to create a set of concept chains used to represent concepts found in a document. The experiments show improved accuracy over bag-of-words based term weighting methods and reveal characteristics of the meronym contribution to document representation.},

abstract = {Multi-faceted book search engine presents diverse category-style options to allow users to refine search results without re-entering a query. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-faceted book search engine that utilizes users' query-related latent intents mined from click-through logs as multiple facets for books. The latent query intents can be effectively and efficiently discovered by applying the Sparse Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) model to users' query and clicking behaviors in the click-through logs. This paper presents the details to improve the multi-faceted book search by incorporating the compact representation of query-intent-book relationships generated by Sparse LSA into the off-line and online processing procedures. The specificity of latent query intents can be flexibly changed by adjusting the sparsity level of projection matrix in the Sparse LSA model. We evaluated our approach on CADAL click-through logs containing 45,892 queries and 164,822 books. The experimental results show the Sparse LSA model with more sparse projection matrix tends to discover the more specific latent query intents. The latent query intents suggested by our approach usually gain the high user satisfaction ratio.},

The performance of the keyphrase indexer is demonstrated on three standard corpora collected from three domains, namely food and agriculture, high energy physics, and biomedical science. Maui is trained using the full texts and denoised texts. The indexer, using its trained models, then extracts keyphrases from test sets comprising full texts, and their denoised and noise parts (i.e., the part of texts that remains after denoising). Experimental findings show that against a gold standard, the denoised-text-trained indexer indexing full texts, performs either better than or as good as its benchmark performance produced by a full-text-trained indexer indexing full texts.},

The best performing microblog retrieval techniques attempt to utilize both semantic and temporal aspects of documents. In this paper, we present an effective approach, including the query modeling, the document modeling and the temporal re-ranking, to discover the most recent but relevant information to the query. For the query modeling, we introduce a two-stage pseudo-relevance feedback query expansion to overcome the severe vocabulary-mismatch problem of short message retrieval in microblog. For the document modeling, we propose two ways to expand document with the help of the shortened URL. For the temporal re-ranking, we suggest several methods to evaluate the temporal aspects of documents. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach obtains significant improvements compared with baseline systems. Specifically, the proposed system gives 26.37% and 9.94% further increases in P@30 and MAP over the best performing result on highrel in the TREC'11 Real-Time Search Task.},

This paper demonstrates that distinguishing different types of citations could rank better for these purposes. We differentiate patent citations along two dimensions (assignees and technologies) into four types, and propose a weighted citation approach for assessing and ranking patents. We investigate five weight learning methods and compare their performance. Our weighted citation method performs consistently better than simple citation counts, in terms of rank correlations with patent renewal status. The estimated weights on different citations are consistent with economic insights on patent citations.

We address these problems by drawing upon suitable knowledge found in the WWW. In particular, we research a two-stage classifier approach, involving multi-class classification with respect to reference styles, and partially solve the problem of parsing surface representations of references.

The existing methods primarily rely on the content analysis of citation text. However, the results from such content-based methods are often unreliable. Moreover, the extracted citation metadata is only a small part of the relevant metadata that spreads across the Internet. As opposed to the content-based CME methods, this paper proposes a Web-based CME approach and a citation enriching system, called as BibAll, which is capable of correcting the parsing results of content-based CME methods and augmenting citation metadata by leveraging relevant bibliographic data from digital repositories and cited-by publications on the Web. BibAll consists of four main components: citation parsing, Web-based bibliographic data retrieval, irrelevant bibliographic data filtering, and relevant bibliographic data integration. The system has been tested on the publicly available FLUX-CIM dataset. Experimental results show that BibAll significantly improves the citation parsing accuracy and augments the metadata of the original citation.},

abstract = {This paper explores photo organization within an event photo stream, i.e. the chronological sequence of photos from a single event. The problem is important: with the advent of inexpensive, easy-to-use photo capture devices, people can take a large number of photos per event. A family trip, for example, may include hundreds of photos. In this work, we have developed a photo browser that uses automatically segmented groups of photos---referred to as chapters---to organize such photos. The photo browser also affords users with a drag-and-drop interface to refine the chapter groupings.We conducted an exploratory study of 23 college students with their 8096 personal photos from 92 events, to understand the role of different spatial organization strategies in our chapter-based photo browser, in performing storytelling, photo search and photo set interpretation tasks. We also report novel insights on how the subjects organized their photos into chapters. We tested three layout strategies: bi-level, grid-stacking and space-filling, against a baseline plain grid layout. We found that subjects value the chronological order of the chapters more than maximizing screen space usage and that they value chapter consistency more than the chronological order of the photos. For automatic chapter groupings, having low chapter boundary misses is more important than having low chapter boundary false alarms; the choice of chapter criteria and granularity for chapter groupings are very subjective; and subjects found that chapter-based photo organization helps in all three tasks of the user study. Users preferred the chapter-based layout strategies to the baseline at a statistically significant level, with the grid-stacking strategy preferred the most.},

By exploiting the information stored in the links between articles, we propose that related companion articles can be automatically generated to help further the reader's understanding of a given topic. This approach to a recommendation system uses tested link analysis techniques to present users with a clear path to related high-level articles, furthering the understanding of low-level topics.},

We propose an unsupervised conceptual terrain model using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for re-ranking search results obtained from a similarity based search system. We connect the sequences of terms under the latent space by the semantic distance between the terms and compute the traversal cost for a document indicating the technical difficulty.

In this respect, this research aims to examine interfaces of three digital libraries that provide collections of digital text. The three digital libraries include Open Library, Google Books, and Hathi Trust. An evaluation matrix was developed to measure usability, aesthetics and interface components. The overall findings of the study showed that the majority of the participants preferred the Open Library interface followed by Google Books. The statistical analysis indicated that Open Library is significantly better than Google Books and Hathi Trust in terms of usability, aesthetics, and interface components. The preference for the Open Library stemmed largely from aesthetic choices. Participants also appreciated the use of elements that are analogous to their physical counterparts.},

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accessibility of websites of public libraries and further identify the association between accessibility and public libraries' budgets. The study selected 20 public library systems that have the highest percentages of the disabled or senior citizen patrons. The study employed the Pearson correlation test in order to investigate the correlation between the accessibility and the budgets of public libraries. Preliminary findings show that most current public library websites do not comply with the Section 508. The findings indicate that public libraries did not consider their users or potential users with physical disabilities when designing their websites. Therefore, the findings suggest that public library websites are not suited to deliver effective information services for underrepresented user populations who need special assistance. Furthermore, this study finds that there is no significant association between the public library websites' accessibility and the budgets.},

In addition, the theory of complex contagion tells us that more spreaders will enhance the indirect influence between two users. Our observation of intensity of indirect influence, propagated by n parallel spreaders and quantified by retweeting probability on Twitter , shows that complex contagion is validated globally but is violated locally. In other words, the retweeting probability increases non-monotonically with some local drops.},

abstract = {Literary reading is an important activity for individuals and can be a long term commitment, making book choice an important task for book lovers and public library users. In this paper, we present a hybrid recommendation system to help readers decide which book to read next. We study book and author recommendations in a hybrid recommendation setting and test our algorithm on the LitRec data set. Our hybrid method combines two item-based collaborative filtering algorithms to predict books and authors that the user will like. Author predictions are expanded into a booklist that is subsequently aggregated with the former book predictions. Finally, the resulting booklist is used to yield the top-n book recommendations. By means of various experiments, we demonstrate that author recommendation can improve overall book recommendation.},

abstract = {Educating the engineering education community in today's digital world requires straightforward yet flexible access to high-quality educational resources. The Teach Engineering and NEEDS (National Engineering Education Delivery System) digital libraries collaborated in 2005 to create and steward the K-Gray Engineering Pathway (EP), a premier portal to comprehensive engineering and computing education resources within the greater National Science Digital Library (NSDL). We collaborated to design navigation, implement features, and find imagery that could effectively address both K-12 and higher education audiences. A system was designed to serve both target audiences, including an expanded simple search on every page to include grade/audience level search fields. This search, on all main pages, also includes a choice of learning resource type and a link to the Advanced Search with expanded search fields. EP tailored many features such as community pages and cataloging to be distinguishable by K-12 versus higher education users. Evaluation studies show that our current strength is a consistent interface with strong usability features. In this paper, we a provide retrospective and summarize our lessons learned and evaluation results, along with our directions for future research and development.},

abstract = {Controlled content quality also in terms of indexing is one of the major advantages of using digital libraries in contrast to general Web sources or Web search engines. However, considering today's information flood the mostly manual effort in acquiring new sources and creating suitable (semantic) metadata for content indexing and retrieval is already prohibitive. A recent solution is given by automatic generation of metadata, where various methods currently become more widespread. But in this case neglecting quality assurance is even more problematic, because heuristic generation often fails and the resulting low-quality metadata will directly diminish the quality of service that a digital library provides. To address this problem, we propose a metadata quality model to determine the overall quality of a metadata set and validate individual requirements imposed on that metadata set. Furthermore, lineage information is provided to trace the quality evolution of a metadata set.},

abstract = {The ACM Computing Classification System (CCS) is a hierarchical classification system used to index and classify all the published literature of ACM. They reflect major areas and topics of the computing field and they often serve as an overview and navigational guide to the field. However, similar to all the traditional classification systems and subject domain thesauri, such an overview and navigational guide is static and sketchy, representing only a top-down representation of a domain. In this paper, we look into a 10-year period of ACM literature and examine how the CCS terms are actually used in the ACM digital library and how the patterns of term usages show different term relationships than those defined in the CCS. By comparing the dynamic statistical patterns of term usage with the static hierarchical structures of the terms, we show that much can be gained by integrating both of them into an interactive interface to provide better overview maps and navigational guides to the domain of computing.},

abstract = {Metadata records are a ubiquitous and foundational feature of contemporary information systems. However, while their simple surface structure may lead us to think that the semantics of a metadata record is unproblematic and easily discerned, our analysis of an example record suggests otherwise. We show three possibilities for the logical form of the proposition expressed by a metadata record. All three are substantially different in the first order constructs utilized, and no two can be recognized as equivalent for the purposes of information organization. The semantics of the common metadata record is elusive. The main source of this problem appears to be the identifier attribute. Although identifier attributes have the syntactic appearance of any other attribute in the metadata vocabulary, this uniformity conceals their potential for assuming a distinctive semantic role, and one which appears to cross the traditional object language / metalanguage boundary, suggesting that translation of colloquial metadata records into logic-based knowledge representations does not take place entirely at a first-order level.},

abstract = {This work illustrates how audio content analysis of music and manually assigned structural temporal metadata can be used to form a digital library designed for musicological exploration. In addition to text-based searching and browsing, the document view is enriched with an interactive structured audio time-line that shows ground-truth data representing the logical segments to the song, and a version that was automatically generated for comparison. A self-similarity "heat" map is also displayed, and is interactive. Clicking within the map at a co-ordinate (x,y) results in the audio being played simultaneous at time offset x and y, panned left and right, respectively, to make it easier for the listener to separate out the differences. The musicologist can also initiate an audio content based query starting at any point in the song. This produces a ranked result set which can be further studied through their respective document views. Alternatively they can perform a musical structure search (for example, for songs that contain the structure b, b, c, b, c).},

abstract = {This demonstration shows the Profiles in Science® digital library. Profiles in Science contains digitized selections from the personal manuscript collections of prominent biomedical researchers, medical practitioners, and those fostering science and health. The Profiles in Science Web site is the delivery mechanism for content derived from the digital library system. The system is designed according to our basic principles for digital library development [1]. The digital library includes the rules and software used for digitizing items, creating and editing database records and performing quality control as well as serving the digital content to the public. Among the types of data managed by the digital library are detailed item-level, collection-level and cross-collection metadata, digitized photographs, papers, audio clips, movies, born-digital electronic files, optical character recognized (OCR) text, and annotations (see Figure 1). The digital library also tracks the status of each item, including digitization quality, sensitivity of content, and copyright. Only items satisfying all required criteria are released to the public through the World Wide Web. External factors have influenced all aspects of the digital library's infrastructure.},

abstract = {The ResultsSpace Collaborative Search Environment is a tool to support asynchronous collaborative information retrieval among a small group of collaborators. It is designed to promote awareness of collaborators' searches and the documents they have rated. Awareness is supported through several mechanisms: an area that shows a history of queries, a summary display of collaborators' ratings next to each search result, and changes in the visual salience of search results based on their aggregate rating from all collaborators. Faceted controls allow users to filter results based on specific ratings (relevant, not relevant, and maybe) and on specific collaborator(s) who have rated an item. We describe features of the system, how they are implemented, and give insights into the design rationale.},

abstract = {The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine is the most common way that typical users interact with web archives. The Internet Archive uses the Heritrix web crawler to transform pages on the publicly available web into Web ARChive (WARC) files, which can then be accessed using the Wayback Machine. Because Heritrix can only access the publicly available web, many personal pages (e.g. password-protected pages, social media pages) cannot be easily archived into the standard WARC format. We have created a Google Chrome extension, WARCreate, that allows a user to create a WARC file from any webpage. Using this tool, content that might have been otherwise lost in time can be archived in a standard format by any user. This tool provides a way for casual users to easily create archives of personal online content. This is one of the first steps in resolving issues of "long term storage, maintenance, and access of personal digital assets that have emotional, intellectual, and historical value to individuals".},
