Preliminary findings are presented from a survey of 300 historians studying American History from leading institutions of higher education in the U.S. Tentative conclusions indicate the need to provide multiple pathways of access to historical research materials including paper-based approaches and newer digital ones. The need for user education, especially in regard to electronic search methodologies is indicated.},

abstract = {TXTRACTOR is a tool that uses established sentence-selection heuristics to rank text segments, producing summaries that contain a user-defined number of sentences. The purpose of identifying text segments is to maximize topic diversity, which is an adaptation of the Maximal Marginal Relevance criterion used by Carbonell and Goldstein [5]. Sentence selection heuristics are then used to rank the segments. We hypothesize that ranking text segments via traditional sentence-selection heuristics produces a balanced summary with more useful information than one produced by using segmentation alone. The proposed summary is created in a three-step process, which includes 1) sentence evaluation 2) segment identification and 3) segment ranking. As the required length of the summary changes, low-ranking segments can then be dropped from (or higher ranking segments added to) the summary. We compare the output of TXTRACTOR to the output of a segmentation tool based on the TextTiling algorithm to validate the approach.},

Our goal is to answer factual questions by exploiting the structure inherent in documents found on the World Wide Web (WWW). Based on this structure, documents are indexed into smaller units and associated with metadata. Transforming table cells into smaller units associated with metadata is an important part of this task. In addition, we report on work to improve question classification using language models. The domain used to develop this system is documents retrieved from a crawl of www.fedstats.gov.},

We investigated this question by performing a field study based on a university library's technology deployment: two classes were conducted using materials that were available in e-book format on Pocket PCs in addition to other electronic and paper formats. The handheld devices, the course materials, and technical support were all provided to students in the courses to use as they saw fit. We found that the handhelds were a good platform for reading secondary materials, excerpts, and shorter readings; they were used in a variety of circumstances where portability is important, including collaborative situations such as the classroom. We also discuss the effectiveness of annotation, search, and navigation functionality on the small form factor devices. We conclude by defining a set of focal areas and issues for digital library efforts designed for access by handheld computers.},

While most existing recommender systems rely either on a content-based approach or a collaborative approach to make recommendations, there is potential to improve recommendation quality by using a combination of both approaches (a hybrid approach). In this paper, we report how we tested the idea of using a graph-based recommender system that naturally combines the content-based and collaborative approaches. Due to the similarity between our problem and a concept retrieval task, a Hopfield net algorithm was used to exploit high-degree book-book, user-user and book-user associations. Sample hold-out testing and preliminary subject testing were conducted to evaluate the system, by which it was found that the system gained improvement with respect to both precision and recall by combining content-based and collaborative approaches. However, no significant improvement was observed by exploiting high-degree associations.},

abstract = {There are many advantages for Digital Libraries in indexing with classifications or thesauri, but some current disincentive in the lack of flexible retrieval tools that deal with compound descriptors. This paper discusses a matching function for compound descriptors, or multi-concept subject headings, that does not rely on exact matching but incorporates term expansion via thesaurus semantic relationships to produce ranked results that take account of missing and partially matching terms. The matching function is based on a measure of semantic closeness between terms, which has the potential to help with recall problems. The work reported is part of the ongoing FACET project in collaboration with the National Museum of Science and Industry and its collections database. The architecture of the prototype system and its interface are outlined. The matching problem for compound descriptors is reviewed and the FACET implementation described. Results are discussed from scenarios using the faceted Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus. We argue that automatic traversal of thesaurus relationships can augment the user's browsing possibilities. The techniques can be applied both to unstructured multi-concept subject headings and potentially to more syntactically structured strings. The notion of a focus term is used by the matching function to model AAT modified descriptors (noun phrases). The relevance of the approach to precoordinated indexing and matching faceted strings is discussed.},

This paper reports on a project carried out at the Grainger Engineering Library at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to provide web-based asynchronous simultaneous searching of multiple secondary information resources and integrated reference linking between bibliographic resources.The project has tested two different approaches to simultaneous broadcast searching. One approach utilizes custom distributed searchbots and shared blackboard databases. The other approach uses event-driven asynchronous HTTP queries within a single web script.The reference linking implementation is built around the application of OpenURL and Digital Object Identifier (DOI) technologies and the CrossRef metadata database within a proxy server environment.},

SDARTS combines two complementary existing protocols, SDLIP and STARTS, to define a uniform interface that collections should support for searching and exporting metasearch-related metadata. SDARTS also includes a toolkit with wrappers that are easily customized to make both local and remote document collections SDARTS-compliant. This paper describes two significant ways in which we have extended the SDARTS toolkit. First, we have added a tool that automatically builds rich content summaries for remote web collections bym probing the collections with appropriate queries. These content summaries can then be used by a metasearcher to select over which collections to evaluate a given query. Second, we have enhanced the SDARTS toolkit so that all SDARTS-compliant collections export their metadata under the emerging Open Archives Initiative (OAI) protocol. Conversely, the SDARTS toolkit now also allows all OAI-compliant collections to be made SDARTS-compliant with minimal effort. As a result, we implemented a bridge between SDARTS and OAI, which will facilitate easy interoperability among a potentially large number of collections. The SDARTS toolkit, with all related documentation and source code, is publicly available at http://sdarts.cs.columbia.edu.},

While EAD and OAI may appear to be incompatible, a mapping would be both useful and technically feasible. The authors suggest that it will be necessary to create numerous OAI records from one EAD file. In addition, the findings indicate that further standardization of EAD markup practices would enhance interoperability.},

We will describe a multilingual conceptual mapping resource with broad coverage (over 100 written languages can be supported) that is truly multilingual as opposed to bilingual parings usually derived from machine translation. This resource is derived from the 10+ million title online library catalog of the University of California. It is created statistically via maximum likelihood associations from word and phrases in book titles of many languages to human assigned subject headings in English. The 150,000 subject headings can form interlingua mappings between pairs of languages or from one language to several languages. While our current demonstration prototype maps between ten languages (English, Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish), extensions to additional languages are straightforward. We also describe how this resource is being expanded for languages where linguistic coverage is limited in our initial database, by automatically harvesting new information from international online library catalogs using the Z39.50 networked library search protocol.},

abstract = {Digital libraries have the potential to not only duplicate many of the services provided by traditional libraries but to extend them. Basic finding aids such as search and browse are common in most of today's digital libraries. But just as a traditional library provides more than a card catalog and browseable shelves of books, an effective digital library should offer a wider range of services. Using the traditional library concept of special collections as a model, in this paper we propose that explicitly defining sub-collections in the digital library-virtual collections-can benefit both the library's users and contributors and increase its viability. We first introduce the concept of a virtual collection, outline the costs and benefits for defining such collections, and describe an implementation of collection-level metadata to create virtual collections for two different digital libraries. We conclude by discussing the implications of virtual collections for enhancing interoperability and sharing across digital libraries, such as those that are part of the National SMETE Digital Library.},

We present a framework that separates digital object experience, or rendering, from digital object storage and manipulation, so the rendering can be tailored to particular communities of users. Our framework also accommodates extensible digital object behaviors and interoperability. The two key components of our approach are 1) exposing structural metadata associated with digital objects - metadata about labeled access points within a digital object and 2) information intermediaries called context brokers that match structural characteristics of digital objects with mechanisms that produce behaviors. These context brokers allow for localized rendering of digital information stored externally.},

abstract = {Digital libraries (DLs) are among the most complex kinds of information systems, due in part to their intrinsic multi disciplinary nature. Nowadays DLs are built within monolithic, tightly integrated, and generally inflexible systems -- or by assembling disparate components together in an ad-hoc way, with resulting problems in interoperability and adaptability. More importantly, conceptual modeling, requirements analysis, and software engineering approaches are rarely supported, making it extremely difficult to tailor DL content and behavior to the interests, needs, and preferences of particular communities. In this paper, we address these problems. In particular, we present 5SL, a declarative language for specifying and generating domain-specific digital libraries. 5SL is based on the 5S formal theory for digital libraries and enables high-level specification of DLs in five complementary dimensions, including: the kinds of multimedia information the DL supports (Stream Model); how that information is structured and organized (Structural Model); different logical and presentational properties and operations of DL components (Spatial Model); the behavior of the DL (Scenario Model); and the different societies of actors and managers of services that act together to carry out the DL behavior (Societal Model). The practical feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by the presentation of a 5SL digital library generator for the MARIAN digital library system.},

abstract = {The Open Archives Initiative (OAI) promotes interoperability among digital libraries and has created a protocol for data providers to easily export their metadata. One problem with this approach is that some of the more popular servers quickly become heavily loaded. The obvious solution is replication. Fortunately, the Internet-2 Distributed Storage Infrastructure (I2-DSI) has begun to develop technology for highly distributed transparent replication of servers. This paper presents our solution for transparent mirroring of OAI repositories within the I2-DSI.},

The query is treated as an observation sequence and a piece is judged similar to the query if its HMM has a high likelihood of generating the query. The top pieces are returned to the user in rank-order. This paper reports the basic approach for the construction of the target database of themes, encoding and transcription of user queries, and the results of initial experimentation with a small set of sung queries.},

abstract = {The goal of the Lester S. Levy Sheet Music Collection, Phase Two project is to develop tools, processes, and systems that facilitate collection ingestion through automated processes that reduce, but not necessarily eliminate human intervention[1]. One of the major components of this project is an optical music recognition (OMR) system[2] that extracts musical information and lyric text from the page images that comprise each piece in a collection. It is often the case, as it is with the Levy Collection, that lyrics embedded in music notation are written in a syllabicated form so that each syllable lines up with the note or notes to which it corresponds. Searching the syllabicated form of words, however, would be counterintuitive and cumbersome for end-users. This paper describes the evolution of a tool that, using a simple algorithm, rebuilds complete words from lyric syllables and, in ambiguous cases, provides feedback to the collection builder. This system will be integrated into the workflow of the Levy Sheet Music Collection, but has broad applicability for any project ingesting musical scores with lyrics.},

The browsers differ in how users navigate and view the structured collections. We conducted user studies to compare the two browsers and an un-summarized image browser. Our results show that exploiting the time dimension and appropriately summarizing collections can lead to significant improvements. For example, for one task category, one of our browsers enabled a 33% improvement in speed of finding given images compared to the commercial browser. Similarly, users were able to complete 29% more tasks when using this same browser.},

An Ipaq palmtop version of the Informedia Digital Video Library interface has already been developed at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. For these displays, the desktop technique of showing a large grid of images in parallel is not feasible. Perceptual psychology experiments suggest that time-multiplexing may be as effective as space-multiplexing for this kind of primed recognition task. In fact, it has been specifically suggested that image retrieval interfaces using Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) may perform significantly better than parallel presentation even on a desktop computer [2]. In our experiments, we did not find this to be true. An important difference between previous RSVP experiments and our own is that image search engines rank retrievals, and correct answers are more likely to occur early in the list of results. Thus we found that scrolling (and low RSVP presentation rates) led to better recognition of answers that occur early, but worse for answers that occur far down the list. This split confounded the global effects that we hypothesized, yet in itself is an important consideration for future interface designs, which must adapt as search technology improves.},

abstract = {Biological science is one of the top ten social trends and the twenty-first Century has been defined as "The Age of Biology" [1]. One of the central themes of this age is biodiversity. Biodiversity is the richness of life. Biodiversity includes the variety of genes within one species through the complex interconnection of all life within an environment. One of the grand challenges of the twenty-first century is to document and understand the world's natural heritage. The management of the many kinds of information associated with this endeavor is "Biodiversity Informatics." There are many efforts developing worldwide to collect and distribute this information in digital collections. Some of these efforts are complementary; some efforts are in conflict and are just independent. There is a great need to integrate this information to increate its usefulness and value. Unfortunately, this integration is extremely difficult because of the diversity of the use and users of the information and the diversity of the information itself. The panelists will discuss different perspectives on the construction of global biodiversity digital libraries from the perspective of different goals and uses.},

abstract = {Digital information in any form is at risk. Software and hardware become obsolete, and versions and file formats change, making data inaccessible. Data stored in even the simplest form are in danger due to computer media degradation and obsolescence. On-line information such as e-journals and databases are susceptible. They may become partially or entirely unreadable, and may not be recoverable by the time the problem is detected. Preservation strategies such as emulation (keeping alive the software and hardware needed to access a digital object), migration (converting the digital object to new versions and formats), and other long-term archival methods have been proposed [1-7]. Models such as the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) provide an architecture for conducting digital preservation research and experimentation [8-10]. The importance of preservation metadata has been recognized by a number of groups and efforts to develop and deploy metadata standards are underway [11-14].As more and more digital information is created, attention must be paid to what information should be preserved and how it can be preserved most economically and effectively. It is clear that for preservation to be successful, we need to pay attention not only to the format of digital objects, but also to the commitment we make to providing long-term access to the information. Thus, decisions about digital preservation will involve technical issues as well as economic, legal, social, and organizational ones. Is it possible or feasible to preserve all digital data automatically and in a cost effective way? How much functionality can or must be preserved? What type of metadata will be needed to ensure both access and preservation? What metrics do we use to evaluate whether our methods will be successful.Panelists will make short presentations about work in which they have been involved and which reflect a variety of aspects of digital preservation. Reagan Moore will discuss the levels of abstraction that are needed to create infrastructure independent representations for data, information, and knowledge, and he will discuss a prototype persistent digital archive. The persistent archive infrastructure has been developed for use by the National Archives and Records Administration and other Federal agencies. William Underwood will report on lessons learned in preserving digital records created on personal computers. The records being examined are the digital records created on personal computers during the administration of President George Bush (1988-1992). Vicky Reich will present work on the LOCKSS (Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe) project, which is a permanent web publishing and access system. LOCKSS software allows libraries to retain local collection control of materials delivered through the web while preserving the functionality of the original web based content. Robin Dale will report on activities of the preservation program of the Research Libraries Group (RLG). She will focus on the joint work of RLG and OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) on preservation metadata. Following the presentations by the four panelists, Alexa McCray will provide brief comments and then open the discussion for audience participation.},

abstract = {A core subject in the undergraduate education of application scientists and engineers is the use of mathematical software to solve computational problems. To make effective use of mathematical software, application developers need a basic understanding of the underlying numerical methods and enough knowledge to be able to choose an appropriate solver, parameterize it correctly, and validate the computed results. Correct results are of course required, but good computational performance is desired as well. Most application scientists have neither the time nor the interest to read the current literature in numerical analysis. They solve numerical problems by relying on the methods and programs they learned about in previous coursework. This tendency has the unfortunate consequence that new methods with improved functionality and/or efficiency may go unused by practicing engineers. Application engineers need enough understanding of the underlying numerical methods to be able to detect and diagnose problems that occur and to modify or customize the methods if necessary.A large amount of mathematical software is both commercially and freely available. However, not all the software that is available is of high quality. It can also be difficult to locate the appropriate software by using web search engines, since the descriptions available for searching may be lacking or may not match the vocabulary used by the searcher. A good solution to these problems is to have experts in the field of numerical analysis maintain a moderated collection of high quality software which is organized and cataloged with appropriate metadata to enable easy searching. The Netlib mathematical software repository is such a collection that has been contributed to and managed by the numerical analysis community for the past fifteen years.Active Netlib provides an active collection of high-quality mathematical software resources in the context of an inquiry-based learning environment for computational science and engineering education. The Netlib collection is being extended in a number of ways to support the goals of this project. The NetSolve client-server system for accessing hardware and software resources over a network provides an active interface to the contents of Netlib. NetSolve essentially constructs network-accessible objects with executable content from the software packages in Netlib.By making the subroutines housed in Netlib available over the network on computational servers, NetSolve enables access to up-to-date mathematical software from a variety of client interfaces running on users' workstations, without requiring the users to download and install the software themselves.This demonstration will illustrate the following digital library technology:Searching and browsing the active mathematical software collection using the Repository In a Box (RIB) interface; once relevant software is located, it can be dynamically installed on demand on a computational server.Invoking executable content on NetSolve computational servers from the MATLAB client interfaceUse of an interactive adaptive user interface to guiding the user in learning about iterative methods for solving large sparse linear systemsFor more information, see the Active-Netlib home page at http://icl.cs.utk.edu/active-netlib/.},

abstract = {The Recent work of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy
project http://plato.stanford.edu/ has been focused on fostering
and managing the growth of a dynamic reference work. Our particular
project is to produce an authoritative and comprehensive dynamic
reference work devoted to the academic discipline of philosophy
that will be kept up to date dynamically so as to remain
useful to those in academia and the general public.Our concept of a dynamic reference work is defined in a
way which distinguishes it from other online publishing projects,
namely: (1) it is published in a continuously revisable electronic
medium, (2) it offers a comprehensive set of entries on topics in a
target discipline, (3) it provides the authors of the entries
with electronic access to the reference work's central web
server, so that they can remotely edit and update private copies of
their entries and submit them for publication according to a
regular update schedule and at any other time it becomes necessary
to revise, (4) it maintains quality by way of a distinguished Board
of Editors, the members of which commission the entries and referee
both the initial versions of the entries and subsequent substantive
modifications, prior to publication on the web, and (5) it
creates, and makes publicly available, archives of the entries on
at least a quarterly basis (i.e., these contain fixed versions of
the entries, which can be cited in scholarly publications). A
dynamic reference work based on this model constantly evolves and
becomes responsive to new research.Thus, a dynamic reference work is not merely a revisable work or
one that is published online. Successful implementation of the
dynamic aspects of this definition depend upon the ease with which
the authors, subject editors, and the principal editor have access
to the tools and information that allow entries at all stages of
the work flow to be managed asynchronously. In such an environment,
each entry has its own deadlines and it is necessary to track
electronically the location of every entry in the work flow and
provide automated reminders to individuals with work pending.Over the past two years, the number of authors attached to our
project has grown considerably -- from about 350 to 600. As a
result, the number of entries which are being submitted, reviewed,
published, and updated at any given moment has grown rapidly. In
the past year, the average rate at which we publish new entries
rose from approximately 2 entries per month to 10 entries per
month.In this context of rapid development, our work on managing and
fostering growth means: (1) working to insure that the asynchronous
publication schedule for the entries is met even though there is no
pre-determined publication date, (2) working to enable a small
support staff on a small budget (compared to traditional reference
work publishing) to manage the project in the face of rapid growth,
and (3) working to help our users more quickly access and navigate
the growing reference work as more entries become available.We will demonstrate how our password-protected web interfaces,
back-end processing system, and new front-end features, work
together to facilitate the collaborative effort of creating and
managing the dynamic reference work. We will highlight the newest
parts of the system which are centered on growth. These include:
(1) enhanced automation of email reminders that is sensitive to
author and board member responsiveness and (2) an automated
link-rot detection and notification system. Also, new and improved
ways to navigate the encyclopedia including: (1) an automated
dynamic re-cross-referencing system which enables users to more
easily navigate the encyclopedia thematically, (2) a dynamically
generated "What's New" page that summarizes the changes for updated
entries, and (3) a system which allows users to view the changes in
the updated versions of entries.When compared to other online publishing efforts of similar
scale, we face some unique technical challenges. For example, most
serial publications do not require re-cross-referencing of their
documents as new articles are published. People who want to
navigate thematically do so through searches which can return
irrelevant results that are easily ignored. Because our documents
contain links to the related entries, we must maintain those links
properly -- lest the irrelevant links become part of the document
itself.A more in-depth discussion of the concept of a dynamic reference
work, our implementation of it, and a discussion of the current
state and future of our project is available in our recent paper 'The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: A Developed Dynamic
Reference Work', by the present authors, forthcoming

abstract = {There are many advantages for Digital Libraries in indexing with classifications or thesauri, but some current disincentive in the lack of flexible retrieval tools that deal with compound descriptors. This demonstration of a research prototype illustrates a matching function for compound descriptors, or multi-concept subject headings, that does not rely on exact matching but incorporates term expansion via thesaurus semantic relationships to produce ranked results that take account of missing and partially matching terms [5]. The matching function is based on a measure of semantic closeness between terms [4].The work is part of the EPSRC funded FACET project [2] in collaboration with the UK National Museum of Science and Industry (NMSI) which includes the National Railway Museum [3]. An export of NMSI's Collections Database is used as the dataset for the research. The J. Paul Getty Trust's Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) [1] is the main thesaurus in the project. The AAT is a widely used thesaurus (over 120,000 terms). Descriptors are organised in 7 facets representing separate conceptual classes of terms.The FACET application is a multi tiered architecture accessing a SQL Server database, with an OLE DB connection. The thesauri are stored as relational tables in the Server's database. However, a key component of the system is a parallel representation of the underlying semantic network as an in-memory structure of thesaurus concepts (corresponding to preferred terms). The structure models the hierarchical and associative interrelationships of thesaurus concepts via weighted poly-hierarchical links. Its primary purpose is real-time semantic expansion of query terms, achieved by a spreading activation semantic closeness algorithm. Queries with associated results are stored persistently using XML format data. A Visual Basic interface combines a thesaurus browser and an initial term search facility that takes into account equivalence relationships. Terms are dragged to a direct manipulation Query Builder which maintains the facet structure.},

abstract = {Virtual Oregon is a new data coordination center established at Oregon State University (OSU) in order to: (1) archive environmental and other place-based data on Oregon and associated areas; (2) make those data accessible to a broad spectrum of agencies and individuals via innovative web interfaces; (3) identify key data sets that are not yet available and encourage their collection and dissemination; and (4) facilitate development of statewide standards for archiving, documenting, and disseminating data. Rather than co-locating researchers and data in a physical center, Virtual Oregon employs a distributed architecture that occupies multiple locations while users are presented with the illusion of a single, centralized facility. This approach was selected not just to maximize the impact on campus students, faculty, and staff but also toservice broader interactions with extension agents and other members of OSU's statewide community.Virtual Oregon builds on regional GIS centers and databanks in a wide range of disciplines, providing decades of research data on topics as varied as climate, biodiversity, land ownership, water quality, wildfire, and agricultural production. Our proximity to agencies such as the Oregon Climate Service, Oregon Natural Heritage Program, Oregon Flora Project, OSU Herbarium, EPA, and Forest Service adds breadth to data type and availability. Designed as a distributed architecture, Virtual Oregon has four nodes, each of which serves as a center and clearinghouse for distinct types of information and services: Department of Geosciences (College of Science): geospatial coverages, digital aerial and orthoimagery and associated base dataForestry Sciences Laboratory (USDA Forest Service and College of Forestry): ecological and resource management databases; data analyses; data from computational simulationsNorthwest Alliance for Computational Science and Engineering (NACSE): databases based on specimen collections, field observation, images, or analysis of historical documents; user interface designValley Library: published maps, books and archival publications, gray literature, photographs and video.Data are harvested from a variety of individuals and research centers and maintained in the distributed nodes using enterprise RDBMS products (Oracle, Sybase, and Microsoft SQL Server) residing on UNIX and Windows platforms. Query Markup Language (QML, a middleware product developed at NACSE) supports database-to-Web interactions by transparently performing queries across multiple RDBMSs and displaying the results as though from a single source. Web-based mapping interfaces (powered by ESRI's Internet Map Server and Spatial Database Engine products) can also be used to explore data visually.As the demonstration will show, users currently have the option of beginning with either the "thematic" or "place-based" interfaces. Ultimately, users will be able to move freely back and forth between the two paradigms, for example initially narrowing the scope of inquiry based on discipline or attributes, moving to the visual interface to refine the search based on location or some set of geospatial characteristics, then moving back to query-based exploration to delve to fine levels of detail. Usability engineering methodologies are being applied so that all navigation and query mechanisms are both maximally productive and easily learned by novices.},

abstract = {The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and public broadcasters consider Media Asset Management (MAM) of critical importance since without a concerted and cooperative plan to manage their vast library of content, broadcasters are unable to reach their potential for service in the digital age.The concerns for Media Asset Management, which are the Digital Libraries for broadcasters, human and technical, are myriad. Media Asset Management is the framework upon which many of the largest technology projects will be built, including the future interconnection system between and among CPB member stations. It is CPB's hope that its licensees and their partners in university, museum, and library communities, will work together to contribute to Media Asset Management solutions.This poster will present some of the complex issues around Media Asset Management and possible solutions to the problems as well as show the breath of research projects in the area. The issues include metadata, indexing, controlled vocabularies, storage and access methods, rights management, technological infrastructure requirements, and interoperability.To highlight these issues we will use as an example the Media Asset Retrieval System (MARS) project. The goal of this project is to create a model for representing, organizing, storing, and facilitating access to public audio (radio) and audiovisual (television) broadcast material via the Internet. The immediate goal for MARS is to produce a digital online resource that will provide access to material produced by public broadcasters in the Puget Sound Region (KUOW and KCTS). The material will be made available to students, teachers, media, and the general public through the King County Library System and Seattle Public Library System. The mission of the Convergence Consortium guides the MARS project. The Convergence Consortium is a working collaborative between public broadcasters, public libraries, K-12 schools and the Information School of the University of Washington that meet to assess the needs of their constituents and propose solutions that will be developed to meet those need.The MARS project is funded by a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Television Future Fund and it falls within the context of major decisions about Media Asset Management in public broadcasting. It is the intent that the MARS project will produce a reference document that will help public broadcast stations make decisions about media asset management as it relates to audio and audiovisual access as a community resource.The MARS team will analyze the current systems and their contexts and design a digital library system for the KUOW and KCTS broadcasters that will facilitate access to the broadcast material. The digital library will support advanced knowledge organization techniques and search algorithms to facilitate retrieval of the broadcast material. The MARS project ties together some of the critical issues in Digital Libraries and approaches these problems from a user-centered perspective.},

abstract = {The Marine Realms Information Bank (MRIB) is a prototype web-based distributed geolibrary that organizes, indexes, and delivers online information about the oceanic and coastal environments. The improvement of computer power and connectivity of the 1990s, by enabling very fast exchange of data online, has shown that effective information management does not automatically result from quicker connection or large broadband. Millions of web sites have been setup to provide information on every subject, and various information-gathering systems have been developed to locate information online. Unfortunately, these search engines often produce exhaustive bibliographic lists that mix first-quality scientific knowledge with irrelevant materials. To be really useful, information banks require not only quality control but also classification systems that integrate and organize the information. In 1999 the National Research Council proposed the concept of distributed geolibraries, which are online digital libraries able to provide a simple mechanism for searching and retrieving information in response to topical and geographically defined needs. Distributed geolibraries are beneficial for various reasons, the most important of which is the authoritative role they would come to assume as subject gateways. To be referenced through a scientific geolibrary, information sources must meet quality standards set by the library gatekeeper. Another important benefit of a distributed geolibrary comes from its "distributed" attribute. Without the need to collect information in one physical location, local curators can serve and update online information without the requirement of maintaining consistency among multiple copies. The MRIB prototype implements the distributed geolibrary concept to organize, index, and deliver online information about the oceanic and coastal environments. MRIB provides access to information, but it is not an information repository. It incorporates information that exists in remote sources, without modifying formats or content. This system succeeds by building a central index that consists of Electronic Index Cards containing metadata about the information sources, their geographical areas, and their network locations. The ontology of MRIB is expressed in the classification system through which users can explore the available information. MRIB currently classifies information with 13 types of categories (facets): Location, Geologic Time, Features, Biota, Discipline, Scientific Method, Hot Topics, Project Name, Agency Name, Author, Class, Format, and Audience. Classifying information is not automatic but is performed by a librarian, which is both the major benefit and the major operating cost of MRIB. The significance of MRIB lies both in the utility of the information bank and in the implementation of the distributed geolibraries concept. Distributed information banks, such as MRIB, can be applied widely as unifying portals for extensive or rapidly developing information bases, for which a centralized repository would be impractical. In addition, MRIB has a modular structure that allows a classification system to be easily modified, to expedite the development and testing of suitable classification systems for existing information bases.},

abstract = {A core subject in the undergraduate education of application
scientists and engineers is the use of mathematical software to
solve computational problems. To make effective use of mathematical
software, application developers need a basic understanding of the
underlying numerical methods and enough knowledge to be able to
choose an appropriate solver, parameterize it correctly, and
validate the computed results. Correct results are of course
required, but good computational performance is desired as
well.Most application scientists have neither the time nor the
interest to read the current literature in numerical analysis. They
solve numerical problems by relying on the methods and programs
they learned about in previous coursework. This tendency has the
unfortunate consequence that new methods with improved
functionality and/or efficiency may go unused by practicing
engineers. Mathematical subroutine libraries can be highly complex.
Few application scientists understand how they really work, and the
usual practice is to treat the subroutines as "black boxes". A
black box is a piece of software that can be used without knowledge
of its inner working; the user supplies the input, and the output
is more or less assumed to be correct. However, there are a number
of pitfalls in numerical computation (e.g., roundoff error,
ill-conditioning, non-convergence). Application engineers need
enough understanding of the underlying numerical methods to be able
to detect and diagnose problems that occur and to modify or
customize the methods if necessary. This need is especially crucial
in the use of iterative methods to solve large sparse linear
systems, where the problem may need to be properly preconditioned
in order for convergence to occur and where the appropriate method
to employ depends on the nature of the problem being solved.A large amount of mathematical software is both commercially and
freely available. However, not all the software that is available
is of high quality. It can also be difficult to locate the
appropriate software by using web search engines, since the
descriptions available for searching may be lacking or may not
match the vocabulary used by the searcher. A good solution to these
problems is to have experts in the field of numerical analysis
maintain a moderated collection of high quality software which is
organized and cataloged with appropriate metadata to enable easy
searching.The Netlib mathematical software repository is such a collection
that has been contributed to and managed by the numerical analysis
community for the past fifteen years.To address the aforementioned problems, Active Netlib provides
an active collection of high-quality mathematical software
resources in the context of an inquiry-based learning environment
for computational science and engineering education. The Netlib
collection is being extended in a number of ways to support the
goals of this project. The NetSolve client-server system for
accessing hardware and software resources over a network provides
an active interface to the contents of Netlib. By making the
subroutines housed in Netlib available over the network on
computational servers, NetSolve enables access to up-to-date
mathematical software from a variety of client interfaces running
on users' workstations, without requiring the users to download and
install the software themselves. Use of NetSolve seamlessly
maintains the currency and usability of the content as the
underlying hardware, operating systems, and software evolve.
Furthermore, the NetSolve adaptive solver interface guides the user
in selecting appropriate software, in setting parameters correctly,
and in interpreting numerical results.The Netlib collection is being further extended through use of
the Repository in a Box (RIB) toolkit, which enables an individual
or organization to set up and maintain a repository that interacts
with other RIB repositories. RIB will allow the Netlib collection
to be selectively mirrored and contributed to by all project
participants.In summary, the goals of the Active Netlib project are the
following:For more information, see the Active-Netlib home page at

abstract = {The usefulness of the World Wide Web as a digital library of
precise and reliable information is reduced by the increasing
presence of advertising on Web pages. But no one is required to
read or see advertising, and this cognitive censorship can be
automated by software. Such filters can be useful to the U.S.
government which must permit its employees to use the Web but which
is prohibited by law from endorsing commercial products. While the
task would seem at first simpler than filtering of pornography or
general firewalls, subtleties in recognizing advertising make full
success daunting.Our work is evaluating the quality of methods and products for
automatic ad censorship. Commercial products include AdKiller
(www.adkiller.com), Ad Subtract Pro (www.adsubtract.com),
Advertising Killer (www.buypin.com), AdWiper (www.adwiper.com),
FilterGate (www.adscience .co.uk), and WebWasher
(www.webwasher.com). Other products prevent the annoying popup
windows that are usually ads. Things these products do include
removal of ad-like images embedded in the page, prevention of popup
windows and Javascript alert boxes, prevention of blinking text,
and prevention of playing of embedded audio. Or so the vendors
claim. Not a single one provides any statistics on the accuracy of
their product (e.g. recall and precision) to support their grand
claims of removing ads.We are experimenting to determine how effective various
techniques are in ad censoring. We constructed a censor of our own
("Big Head") with manipulable features. We use Java servlet
software to implement a page server that fetches HTML source text
and edits it to create a modified page for display. The modified
page has blanks in the places of inferred ads, and substitutes
local links for remote links to permit further censoring. Blanks
are made the same shape as the censored ads so that meaningful page
layout can be preserved.We initially examined a variety of Web sites to develop a set of
clue properties for both image ads and their associated text,
considering the text within a fixed-size window around the HTML
image reference. We defined ads as information intended to arouse a
desire to purchase or patronize something. It became clear that
identification methods need to include both logical and
probabilistic methods to achieve high recall (fraction of ads
removed from pages), although high precision (fraction of ads among
the items eliminated) was easy by simply picking the popup windows
and narrow banner-size images. Certain image dimensions are strong
clues for ads, especially 480 by 60 banners and 150 by 500, 120 by
600, and 160 by 600 images along the sides of the page. Images
stored on sites different from the page's site (i.e. with different
first part of their URL) were also very likely to be ads, as were
images whose file names contained long integers. These criteria are
sufficiently strong to give 95% precision in identifying image
ads.Additional weaker criteria used included the words of the image
file name (the image URL), words of any directly associated text
("alt" string), and other words within a fixed-size window around
the image reference. Good clue words and phrases were obtained from
a study of random commercial Web pages. Examples are "ad", "buy",
"shop", "free", "join", "click", and "now". The strength of each
clue was estimated as the fraction of the time that the image was
an ad when the word was associated with it. In addition, image ads
were usually larger than 2500 pixels, and "alt" text for ads was
usually less than 100 characters long; both tendencies can be
modeled by probability distributions derived from statistics from
example pages. Evidence from these weaker clues was combined using
a linear model (or weighted average), and items were eliminated if
their weighted sum exceeded a fixed threshold. In a quick test, our
program examined representative pages, and correctly recognized 19
of 20 ads and 153 of 156 non-ads where ads were manually identified
in advance. Public access is from
http://triton.cs.nps.navy.mil:8080/rowe/rowedemos.html.Text ads also have exploitable syntax. Analogously to what we
developed for finding image captions in our MARIE-4 Web crawler,
incitements to purchase typically use a limited range of
grammatical expressions recognizable by a partial parser. Good
examples are expressions of the imperative form of verb indicating
acquiring ("buy", "get", "join", "click", etc. followed by a noun
indicating a purchasable quantity (a physical object or a service),
with optionally a qualifying adjective on the noun or an adverb
indicating a desirable property of the acquisition ("now", "free",
"soon", etc.) Such a parser can approach semantic understanding of
advertising text and improve precision of ad identification.Our research is ongoing. Future work will obtain more reliable
performance statistics on representative Web pages, and will
investigate methods of identifying more difficult kinds of ads.
Though we did not consider it yet, elimination of popup windows and
Javascript applets is usually straightforward from analysis of the
HTML source code. We hope to publish performance comparisons of
different methods and different vendor products soon.},

abstract = {Concepts and their interrelationships are the fundamental building blocks for representing the phenomena investigated in mathematics, science, and engineering (MSE). The knowledge represented in learning materials for the sciences is typically organized around term-based or "weakly-structured" models of concepts and their interrelationships. We introduce a "strongly-structured" model of scientific concepts that provides the foundation for a knowledge base (KB) of concept representations. It focuses on such attributes as the objective representations, operational semantics, use, and interrelationships of concepts, all of which play important roles in constructing representations of phenomena that further understanding of MSE domains of knowledge.We have developed a strongly-structured model of concepts for SME domains in terms of a frame-based KRS with slots and attribute-value fillers. The model, whose framework is shown in Figure 1, is implemented as an XML schema. This schema is used as the basis for creating domain-specific KBs containing XML records of concepts.The Alexandria Digital Library (ADL) Digital Earth Testbed system (http://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu) has been extended with: (1) a KB of scientific concepts, from the domain of physical geography, that are represented in terms of our XML schema for concept representation; (2) a collection of heterogeneous learning materials exemplifying the concepts and their properties in various contexts; and (3) services that provide a variety of views of the content of the KB and associated collection. (Please refer to the JCDL paper "The ADEPT Digital Library Architecture" by Janee and Frew.) This extension to ADL is being deployed in teaching an introductory course in physical geography in Fall, 2002.},

abstract = {The goal of our two year NSF National Science Digital Library-funded project is to develop Natural Language Processing technology that will automatically produce metadata values that correlate individual educational resources in digital libraries to content standards. The goal is to assign this metadata to the descriptive metadata records for resources in support of standards-based discovery and retrieval. The project will utilize the Achieve/McREL Compendix, a comprehensive knowledgebase of K-12 content standards derived from over 137 state, national and international content standards documents. The test collection of educational resources being analyzed is drawn from the more than 400 Web-based collections represented in the Gateway to Educational Materials catalog.The significance of this project in terms of the Digital Library movement is that high-quality automatic correlation of educational resources to content standards is essential to meet the demands for searching and retrieving such resources based on those correlations. This demand will increase as the national focus on greater accountability in our K-12 institutions increases. While human correlations of resources to content standards characterize current practice, it is clear that the scale of the need for such correlations calls for sophisticated means for automatic mapping. This project is intended to provide an NLP-based solution to the problem.Briefly, our NLP approach in this project is to analyze language utilizing all the levels through which humans extract meaning-morphological, lexical, syntactic, semantic, discourse, and pragmatic. The extent to which an individual technology includes these levels, particularly the higher-level ones determines the capability and sophistication of the resultant application. Having incorporated each of these levels into our baseline NLP document-processing module, we are extending the system's capabilities in this project to the task of learning the linguistic features that can be relied on to indicate what content standard an educational resource supports.We are applying a sublanguage analysis framework to automatically identify clues that can be recognized in the mathematics and science educational materials to indicate to which standards the resources apply. Based on the discourse model, the system learns from recognizing these linguistic clues in the training set. The system will then be able to process new resources as they are added to the digital library and appropriately assign to the metadata for those resources the learning standards to which they are applicable.This work is a continuation of our NSF NSDL project "Breaking the Metadata Generation Bottleneck" where we were successful in processing text to automatically assign metadata tags for the descriptive and subject aspects of educational resources.},

abstract = {Online social interactions are useful in information seeking
from digital libraries, but how to measure their influence on the
user's information access actions has not yet been revealed.
Studies on this problem give us interesting insights into the
workings of human dynamics in the context of information access
from digital libraries. On the basis, we wish to improve the
technological supports to provide more intelligent services in the
ongoing China-America Million Books Digital Library so that it can
reach its potential in serving human needs.Our research aims at developing a common framework to model
online social interaction process in community-assisted digital
libraries. The underlying philosophy of our work is that the online
social interaction can be viewed as a dynamic process, and the next
state of each participant in this process (e.g., personal
information access competency) depends on the value of the previous
states of all participants involving interactions in the period.
Hence, considering the dynamics of interaction process, we model
each participant with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) chain and then
employ the Influence Model, which was developed by C.
Asavathiratham as a Dynamic Bayes Net (DBN) of representing the
influences a number of Markov chains have on each other, to analyze
the effects of participants influencing each other. Therefore, one
can think of the entire interaction process as a DBN framework
having two levels of structure: the local level and the network
level. Each participant i has a local HMM chain
&amp;Ggr;(A) which characterizes the transition of his
internal states in the interaction process with state-transition
probability
∑overjdijP(Sit|
Sjt-1) (Here states are his
personal information access competence in different periods, while
observations are his information access actions). Meanwhile, the
network level, which is described by a network graph
&amp;Ggr;(DT) where
D={dij} is the influence factor
matrix, represents the interacting relations between
participants. The strength of each connection,
dij, describes the influence factor of the
participant j at its begin on the one i at its end.
Hence, this model describes the dynamic inter-influence process of
the internal states of all participants involving online
interactions.To automatically build the model, we need firstly to extract
observed features from the data of online social interactions and
information access actions. Obviously, the effects of interactions
are stronger if messages are exchanged more frequently, or the
participants access more information in the online digital
libraries during the period of time. Based on this consideration,
we select the interaction measure
IMi,jt and the amount of
information IAjt as the estimation
features of xit. The interaction
measure IAit and the amount of
information parameterize the features calculated automatically from
the data of online social interactions between the participants
i and j, and the features calculated from the data of
information access actions respectively. Secondly, we need to
develop a mechanism for learning the parameters
dij and
P(Sit|Sjt-1.
Given sequences of observations {xit}
for each chain i, we may easily utilize the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm or the gradient-based learning
algorithm to get their estimation equations.We ran our experiments in the online digital library of W3C
Consortium (www.w3c.org), which contains a mass of news, electronic
papers or other materials related to web technologies. Users may
access and download any information and materials in this digital
library, and also may free discuss on any related technological
problems by means of its mailing lists. Six users were selected in
our experiments to collaboratively perform paper -gathering tasks
related to four given topics. Any user might call for help from the
others through the mailing lists when had difficulties in this
process. All participants were required to record subjective
evaluations of the effects that the others influenced his tasks.
Each experiment was scheduled by ten phases. And in each phase, we
sampled IMi,jt and
IAit for each participant and then fed
them into the learning algorithms to automatically build the
influence model. By comparing with the subjective influence graphs,
the experimental results show that the influence model can estimate
approximately the influences of online social interactions.},

abstract = {There are four major digital library projects in East Asia that publish digital versions of parts of the vast pre-modern Chinese corpus on the World Wide Web. All of these are targeted at professional sinologists, with no accommodation for the user who is not expertly proficient in Chinese. As a result, anyone interested in seriously engaging Chinese thought must either set aside a few years to learn Classical Chinese or remain beholden to the sinologist for both information and interpretation. At Shuhai Wenyuan, a project funded by the National Science Foundation's Digital Libraries Initiative (Phase II), we strive to capitalize on the advantages of digitization to allow the non-sinologist entry into the conceptual world of ancient Chinese thought.Begun in October of 2000, Shuhai Wenyuan will offer a set of Chinese classics, English translations of these classics, a hyperlinked lexicon, a grammar, a philosophical resource, and a search engine for rapidly viewing the full contexts of important terms in a variety a texts. The aim is access--most immediately for scholars and students to be able to read Classical Chinese texts with enough resources that they will be able to reach their own conclusions about interpretation and then employ the texts in original scholarly pursuits; and in the longer term for teachers to be able to provide courses in Chinese Philosophy, either online or in the classroom, without having to be concerned about the availability of appropriate resources.There are four salient features of Shuhai Wenyuan that we will present in our poster:   SOFTWARE: As a project developed by humanists rather than computer scientists, and as a project intended to be replicated by other humanists, Shuhai Wenyuan employs powerful off-the-shelf database software called 4D. We will demonstrate how this results in streamlined and cost-effective administration and modular replicability without compromising design flexibility, expandability, or data integrity.WORKTABLE: Our user interface employs frames to replicate the scholar's worktable on which one may have open several books at once for simultaneous perusal. We will demonstrate how side-by-side textual viewing enhances the research usability and how the Worktable can be customized by individual users in a variety of ways.TOOLS: A portion of the Worktable is devoted to textual viewing and another to viewing research tools, specifically, a grammar, an encyclopedic lexicon, and a search engine. We will demonstrate how each of these tools is easily put to work using hyperlinks between the texts and tools and among tools.PHILOSOPHY: One of the most difficult parts of working with foreign language texts is that philosophically-laden terms lose their conceptual contexts in translation and acquire misleading conceptual contexts in the target language, so that a term such as tian in Chinese inevitably becomes Heaven in English, capitalized and with built-in Judeo-Christian connotations of an omnipotent, anthropomorphic deity and the promise of salvation.One of the most significant features of Shuhai Wenyuan is our work organizing and presenting secondary literature on key philosophical terms. If one were to research the term tian in an analog library, it would take days of paging through book and periodical indexes to find significant treatments of it in the secondary literature. We are bringing these resources into our own library, digitizing them, and culling the relevant passages for inclusion under individual entries in the lexicon. The textual tools and texts themselves, when combined with our philosophical resource, allow the novice reader of Chinese thought unprecedented access to this important body of texts. Instead of providing the reader with a single limited interpretation of a text, we offer users the entire conceptual universe of Chinese thought at their fingertips, allowing them to work creatively from it.},

abstract = {The goal of our 2-year Robert Wood Johnson-funded project is to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology to improve access and use of the digitalized public health "grey" literature. Much public health information, such as meeting notes, think-tank reports, policy statements, and data sets, is not available through traditional commercial pathways and is considered grey or fugitive literature. Although grey literature documents are increasingly posted in digital archives on the Web, the unstructured and varied nature of grey literature makes accessing useful content difficult at best.In an effort to help make the content of public health digital collections more accessible to public health providers, we will use proven NLP techniques to identify and extract key elements of digital documents. NLP techniques can be used to identify and tag key elements from full-text documents. Once tagged, the content of various documents can be extracted and summarized in tables and charts for comparison and review. The ability of NLP to recognize and represent both the explicit and implicit content of full text documents makes it a powerful technique for interpreting the language of text documents. Our NLP information access system has been used in other domains to extract individual entities and events, as well as draw relationships between entities and events to build a content representation.The goal is to develop a model of public health interventions and identify key entities and events from these digital archives. Key elements may include type of study and population demographics as well as more traditional bibliographic elements such as author, title and publication date.NLP technology will be used to search, identify and extract key elements based on the user's request. Key elements can be extracted across multiple documents for summary and comparison. For example, the user can extract key elements from annual reports about "teenage smoking cessation programs" to compare method of intervention, demographic population, and outcome. Such comparisons will help public health professionals to determine how a particular intervention fits with similar interventions reported in the grey literature. This system holds great promise for improving access to public health information through digital archives.},

This foundation prepares for the impending incorporation of more complex born_digital formats such as XML, audio and video.Legislative Information System (LIS) clients are those who have access to Capitol Hill intranet systems. (The public version is the THOMAS site http://thomas.loc.gov.) LIS adds value to public domain legislative data with advanced text retrieval tools and the benefit of a portal site.The content of LIS is composed of several collections of documents. The House of Representatives and the Senate create and update legislative information, which is the bulk of LIS. The Government Printing Office publishes text and PDF formats of congressional documents, building up LIS's catalog of full_text documents. The CRS Bill Digest section, established by law in 1935 to index and summarize bills, adds additional metadata. In partnership with the user community, a high degree of data quality control is actively maintained.The primary entry point is a database called Bill Summary and Status. From there, links are available into the full text collections: text of bills, committee reports and the Congressional Record. These are large_scale collections. LIS maintains every published bill version since 1989. This session, Congress already has introduced more than 6000 bills and important bills often have up to five versions. The search pages have been carefully crafted to accommodate both novice and advanced users. A number of prepared searches are built underneath the search page interface. These gather bills on nebulous topics such as "national security.LIS's primary role is as a prompt deliverer of legislative events and documents. For instance, a senator needs a current list of all co-sponsors on her bill. A staffer needs to read yesterday's floor debate. Legislative events in LIS are updated regularly to accommodate this fast_paced need for data. Searchers are able to specify narrowly defined legislative status steps in order to track current legislation. The LIS alert service sends out email notification when selected legislation is updated.LIS data is also used retrospectively to piece together a legislative history. A legislative history attempts to establish the intent of a current law by compiling documents created during the legislative process. A legislative history could include conference reports, congressional hearings, debates and early drafts of bills. All of these documents are available in electronic format in LIS. Each legislative step has embedded links to LIS full_text documents, creating an easy_to_maintain web of legislative history. In addition, a text analysis tool has been developed which allows paragraph level comparison of legislation. This tool allows us to closely track the evolution of legislative language.Future developments of LIS involve displaying full-text documents in XML, linking to video of congressional proceedings, and completing a retrospective conversion of past congressional content.The prompt recording of current legislative events provides the key to long_term access into our growing digital archive of legislative documents. Our primary designated community is the congressional staff, but the results benefit individual citizens, the courts and businesses who are trying to interpret the rules that govern how we live.},

abstract = {The Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) [1] is a relatively new interoperability standard that is gaining much attention from existing and new digital libraries. It is currently advocated by many communities (including NDLTD, NCSTRL, and NSDL) to fulfill their metadata interoperability requirements.This tutorial is aimed at introducing individuals to the concepts underlying the OAI and the harvesting protocol, as well as providing sufficient information to allow attendees to almost immediately implement the current standard (OAI-PMH v2.0) on their own archives or in their own communities. Attendees will be introduced to both organizational and technical issues that need to be addressed when building new systems or extending existing systems, either in the capacity of being providers of data, users of data, or both. Wherever appropriate, references will be made to best practices that have emerged in the community of OAI implementers since the initial release of the protocol. Attendees will also be familiarized with tools developed within the OAI community to support the implementation of the protocol.},

abstract = {This introductory tutorial is intended for anyone concerned with subject access to digital libraries. It provides a bridge by presenting methods of subject access as treated in an information studies program for those coming to digital libraries from other fields. It will elucidate through examples the conceptual and vocabulary problems users face when searching digital libraries. It will then show how a well-structured thesaurus / ontology can be used as the knowledge base for an interface that can assist users with search topic clarification (for example through browsing well-structured hierarchies and guided facet analysis) and with finding good search terms (through query term mapping and query term expansion - synonyms and hierarchic inclusion). It will touch on cross-database and cross-language searching as natural extensions of these functions. The workshop will cover the thesaurus structure needed to support these functions: Concept-term relationships for vocabulary control and synonym expansion, conceptual structure (semantic analysis, facets, and hierarchy) for topic clarification and hierarchic query term expansion). It will introduce a few sample thesauri and some thesaurus-supported digital libraries and Web sites to illustrate these principles.},

abstract = {As the universe of documents has enlarged from those available via the online catalog to a larger cluster of databases and web-accessible resources, interfaces are being created that can search multiple document collections simultaneously. Also, searching for document surrogates is losing favor as more documents are digitized and distributed in full-text form. Availability of full-text makes it possible for document components such as tables, illustrations, citations, and references -- components that traditionally remained outside the scope of document searching -- to be considered and exploited by search interface designers. Additionally, due to the popularity of web-hyperlinking people are beginning to expect linking of documents across different collections based on common semantic or non-semantic attributes. Increased research activity on artificial intelligence techniques for document access is leading to more fundamental changes in document searching. It is now possible to delegate 100% of the search effort to online search agents. Agents have been also created for performing tasks such as selecting appropriate collections, refining queries, and sorting results to assist with searches conducted in distributed environments. The broad scope of the workshop is on the impact of above technological changes on search interface design.},
