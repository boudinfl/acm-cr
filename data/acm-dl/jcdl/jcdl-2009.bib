abstract = {A three-part study of teachers' use of online resources and of the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) was conducted from 2004 through summer 2006. The first two phases were qualitative and informed a survey administered to 622 science teachers across the U.S., one-fifth of whom had used DLESE. The findings present a profile of teachers and their access to Internet-connected computers and other hardware/electronic media devices in their classrooms; and teachers' preferences for resource formats (e.g., customizability) and educational web site features (e.g., tagged reading level). Analysis of variance showed that teachers with more than one working computer and teachers with more other devices valued the Internet more highly for teaching than did their less equipped peers. DLESE users valued the Internet more highly for their teaching, had more years teaching experience, and valued customizable resources more than their non-DLESE using peers. Most believed that resources catalogued in DLESE were scientifically accurate. Teachers used DLESE most often for finding hands-on activities, still images and other visual aids, and hand-outs; they were least likely to seek people, games, or assessment tools. The findings provide guidance for developers of K12 educational resources.},

In the context of K-12 educational libraries this means that we must understand how K-12 teachers interact with such libraries and how they assess the relevance of documents found or encountered. This paper presents the results of an experiment in which K-12 teachers scored the relevance of curriculum they found themselves and the relevance of documents their colleagues found and recommended. We found that teachers apply a significantly more detailed notion of relevance, both qualitatively and quantitatively, when searching for as compared to evaluating recommended curricula. Differences were observed in both relevance judgments and system interaction logs. These variations may be useful in identifying user intent and in dynamically adapting the behavior of digital libraries of educational material.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen the rise of subject-themed digital libraries, such as the NSDL pathways and the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE). These libraries often need to manually verify that contributed resources cover topics that fit within the theme of the library. We show that such scope judgments can be automated using a combination of text classification techniques and topic modeling. Our models address two significant challenges in making scope judgments: only a small number of out-of-scope resources are typically available, and the topic distinctions required for digital libraries are much more subtle than classic text classification problems. To meet these challenges, our models combine support vector machine learners optimized to different performance metrics and semantic topics induced by unsupervised statistical topic models. Our best model is able to distinguish resources that belong in DLESE from resources that don't with an accuracy of around 70%. We see these models as the first steps towards increasing the scalability of digital libraries and dramatically reducing the workload required to maintain them.},

abstract = {A major challenge for content management in intranets and other large scale document storage and retrieval services is the generation of high quality metadata. Manual generation of metadata is resource demanding and is often viewed by collection managers and document authors as inefficient use of their time, and there is a desire for other ways to create the needed metadata. Automatic Metadata Generation (AMG) is methods for generating metadata without manual interaction using computer program(s) to interpret the document and possibly the document context. Current AMG research has been limited to collection of similarly formatted documents. The research presented in this paper expands the field of AMG by presenting an approach that is independent of a common visualization scheme; AMG based on document code analysis. This is done by showing AMG possibilities from Latex, Word and PowerPoint documents and how this approach can significantly increase the quality of the generated metadata. This by avoiding common quality reducing factors as missing completeness, low accuracy, logical consistency and coherence and timeliness by giving AMG algorithms direct access to the user specified intellectual content and the file formatting. This research shows how this AMG approach can be combined with other AMG approaches, drawing on their strengths in order to achieve the desired high quality metadata entities.},

abstract = {Users of digital libraries usually want to know the exact author or authors of an article. But different authors may share the same names, either as full names or as initials and last names (complete name change examples are not considered here). In such a case, the user would like the digital library to differentiate among these authors. Name disambiguation can help in many cases; one being a user in a search of all articles written by a particular author. Disambiguation also enables better bibliometric analysis by allowing a more accurate counting and grouping of publications and citations. In this paper, we describe an algorithm for pair-wise disambiguation of author names based on a machine learning classification algorithm, random forests. We define a set of similarity profile features to assist in author disambiguation. Our experiments on the Medline database show that the random forest model outperforms other previously proposed techniques such as those using support-vector machines (SVM). In addition, we demonstrate that the variable importance produced by the random forest model can be used in feature selection with little degradation in the disambiguation accuracy. In particular, the inverse document frequency of author last name and the middle name's similarity alone achieves an accuracy of almost 90%.},

abstract = {In digital libraries, ambiguous author names may occur due to the existence of multiple authors with the same name (polysemes) or different name variations for the same author (synonyms). We proposed here a new method that uses information available on the Web to deal with both problems at the same time. Our idea consists of gathering information from input citations and submitting queries to a Web search engine, aiming at finding curricula vitae and Web pages containing publications of the ambiguous authors. From the content of documents in the answer sets returned by the Web search engine, useful information that can help in the disambiguation process is extracted. Using this information, author names are disambiguated by leveraging a hierarchical clustering method that groups citations in the same document together in a bottom-up fashion. Experimental results show that the our method yields results that outperform those of two state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and are statistically comparable with those of a supervised one, but requiring no training. We observe gains of up to 65.2% in the pairwise F1 metric when compared with our best unsupervised baseline method.},

abstract = {The amount of scientific material available electronically is forever increasing. This makes reading the published literature, whether to stay up-to-date on a topic or to get up to speed on a new topic, a difficult task. Yet, this is an activity in which all researchers must be engaged on a regular basis. Based on a user requirements analysis, we developed a new research tool, called the Citation-Sensitive In-Browser Summariser (CSIBS), which supports researchers in this browsing task. CSIBS enables readers to obtain information about a citation at the point at which they encounter it. This information is aimed at enabling the reader to determine whether or not to invest the time in exploring the cited article further, thus alleviating information overload. CSIBS builds a summary of the cited document, bringing together meta-data about the document and a citation-sensitive preview that exploits the citation context to retrieve the sentences from the cited document that are relevant at this point. This paper briefly presents our user requirements analysis, then describes the system and, finally, discusses the observations from an initial pilot study. We found that CSIBS facilitates the relevancy judgment task, by increasing the users' self-reported confidence in making such judgements.},

And bibliographic data extraction has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years. In this paper, we address the problem of automatic extraction of bibliographic data in Chinese electronic book and propose a tool called CEBBIP* for the task, which includes three main systems: data preprocessing, data parsing and data postprocessing. In the data preprocessing system, the tool adopts a rules-based method to locate citation data in a book and to segment citation data into citation strings of individual referencing literature. And a learning-based approach, Conditional Random Fields (CRF), is employed to parse citation strings in the data parsing system. Finally, the tool takes advantage of document intrinsic local format consistency to enhance citation data segmentation and parsing through clustering techniques. CEBBIP has been used in a commercial E-book production system. Experimental results show that CEBBIP's precision rate is very high. More specially, adopting the document intrinsic local format consistency obviously improves the citation data segmenting and parsing accuracy.},

In this way users are able to visualise and conceptualise many aspects of their search tasks and carry out a localised search in order to solve a more global search problem. The main objective of this work is to aid users while carrying out explorative video retrieval tasks; these tasks can be often ambiguous and multi-faceted. Two user evaluations were carried out in order to evaluate the usefulness of this grouping paradigm for assisting users. The first evaluation involved users carrying out broad tasks on YouTube, and gave insights into the application of our interface to a vast online video collection. The second evaluation involved users carrying out focused tasks on the TRECVID 2007 video collection, allowing a comparison over a local collection, on which we could extract a number of content-based features. The results of our evaluations show that the use of the ViGOR system results in an increase in user performance and user satisfaction, showing the potential of a grouping paradigm for video search for various tasks in a variety of diverse video collections.},

Most existing retrieval systems only take into account melodies. Melody comparison may induce errors since two musical pieces can be very similar whereas their melodies may differ in a significant way. In this paper, we propose to investigate and experiment a retrieval system based on the comparison of chord progressions. The definition of chords may be ambiguous but their properties can be precisely described and represented. We detail the adaptations of alignment algorithms, successfully applied for the estimation of symbolic melodic similarity, for chord progression retrieval. Several experiments, performed on symbolic databases, show that the system described is robust to variations and outperforms a recent chord retrieval system.},

Due to the lack of query keywords, it becomes hard to return relevant search results that satisfy the demands of each user. Because digital documents, in contrast to queries, are generally composed of many kinds of keywords, it is also difficult to estimate the main topic or grasp the inherent intentions of the documents. In this paper, we present techniques to represent users' search intentions and the intentions that digital documents can satisfy by making use of clicked titles and snippets acquired from a click log analysis. We then present a method to match these intentions to boost search result rankings. Through experiments that use click logs and indexes of a commercial search engine, we verified our method's capability of significantly improving search precision.},

abstract = {A lot of future-related information is available in news articles or Web pages. This information can however differ to large extent and may fluctuate over time. It is therefore difficult for users to manually compare and aggregate it, and to re-construct the most probable course of future events. In this paper we approach a problem of automatically generating summaries of future events related to queries using data obtained from news archive collections or from the Web. We propose two methods, explicit and implicit future-related information detection. The former is based on analyzing the context of future temporal expressions in documents, while the latter relies on detecting periodical patterns in historical document collections. We present a graph-based visualization of future-related information and demonstrate its usefulness through several examples.},

We contribute formal entity-relationship (ER) and relational data models that explain that organization and relational query models that explain systems' browsing functionality. We use these types of models since they are widely used to conceptualize data and to model back-end data stores.

But some characters in the tablet or the calligraphic work hadn't been written by the calligraphist or though were ever written but are hard to read because of long time weathering. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed to synthesize Chinese calligraphic characters which are in the same style of some calligraphist, and a corresponding system is developed for calligraphy works generation and tablets design.Calligraphic character is represented by a three-level hierarchical model. A novel approach for determining the character structure is proposed, which takes advantage of both the structure of the same characters of different styles and the structure of similar characters of the same style. A style evaluation model (SEM) is presented to evaluate whether the calligraphic character generated is in the same style of the specified calligraphist and to adjust the calligraphic character generated. Our experiments show that this system is effective.},

abstract = {"Data fusion" refers to the problem in information retrieval (IR) where several lists of documents ranked against a query are to be merged into a single ranked list for presentation to a user. Data fusion is also known as "metasearch." In a digital library setting data fusion may support operations such as federated search based on multiple repository representations. This paper presents a novel approach to the fusion problem: generative model-based Metasearch (GeM). We suggest viewing the appearance of documents in a return set as the outcome of a probabilistic process; some documents are likely to occur in the model, while others are unlikely. Using Bayesian parameter estimation to fit a multinomial distribution based on the return sets to be merged, GeM achieves a final ranking by listing documents in decreasing probability of generation under the induced model. We also introduce what we call "the impatient reader" approach to normalizing document ranks in service to the fusion operation. We report results from several experiments on TREC data suggesting that GeM, informed with impatient reader document scores, operates at state-of-the-art levels of effectiveness.},

Two different contexts were explored: tagging by readers of a digital collection and tagging by authors in an institutional repository; also two different controlled vocabularies were examined, Dewey Decimal Classification and ACM Computing Classification Scheme. For each context a separate demonstrator was developed and a user study conducted. The results showed the importance of controlled vocabulary suggestions for both indexing and retrieval: to help produce ideas of tags to use, to make it easier to find focus for the tagging, as well as to ensure consistency and increase the number of access points in retrieval. The value and usefulness of the suggestions proved to be dependent on the quality of the suggestions, both in terms of conceptual relevance to the user and in appropriateness of the terminology. The participants themselves could also see the advantages of controlled vocabulary terms for retrieval if the terms used were from an authoritative source.},

TLEF exploits implementations of existing technologies to "time-lock" data using timed-release cryptology so that TLEF can be deployed as digital resources encoded in a complex object format suitable for metadata harvesting. The framework successfully demonstrates dynamic record identification, time-lock puzzle encryption, encapsulation and dissemination as XML documents. We implement TLEF and provide a quantitative analysis of its successful data harvest of time-locked embargoed data with minimum time overhead without compromising data security and integrity.},

This is specially true for fields such as Computer Science and Electric Engineering, where conference publications are crucial. However, the majority of the existing approaches for assessing the quality of publication venues has been proposed for journals. In this paper, we characterize a large number of features that can be used as criteria to assess the quality of scientific conferences and study how these several features can be automatically combined by means of machine learning techniques to effectively perform this task. Within the features studied are citations, submission and acceptance rates, tradition of the conference, and reputation of the program committee members. Among our several findings, we can cite that: (1) separating high quality conferences from medium and low quality ones can be performed quite effectively, but separating the last two types is a much harder task; and (2) citation features followed by those associated with the tradition of the conference are the most important ones for the task.},

Most recommender systems using collaborative filtering approaches leverage the explicit user ratings to make personalized recommendations. However, many users are reluctant to provide explicit ratings, so ratings-oriented recommender systems do not work well. In this paper, we present a recommender system for CADAL digital library, namely CARES, which makes recommendations using a ranking-oriented collaborative filtering approach based on users' access logs, avoiding the problem of the lack of user ratings. Our approach employs mean AP correlation coefficients for computing similarities among users' implicit preference models and a random walk based algorithm for generating a book ranking personalized for the individual. Experimental results on real access logs from the CADAL web site show the effectiveness of our system and the impact of different values of parameters on the recommendation performance.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have demonstrated commercial success in multiple industries. In digital libraries they have the potential to be used as a support tool for traditional information retrieval functions. Among the major recommendation algorithms, the successful collaborative filtering (CF) methods explore the use of user-item interactions to infer user interests. Based on the finding that transitive user-item associations can alleviate the data sparsity problem in CF, multiple heuristic algorithms were designed to take advantage of the user-item interaction networks with both direct and indirect interactions. However, the use of such graph representation was still limited in learning-based algorithms. In this paper, we propose a graph kernel-based recommendation framework. For each user-item pair, we inspect its associative interaction graph (AIG) that contains the users, items, and interactions n steps away from the pair. We design a novel graph kernel to capture the AIG structures and use them to predict possible user-item interactions. The framework demonstrates improved performance on an online bookstore dataset, especially when a large number of suggestions are needed.},

abstract = {Interactive Query Expansion (IQE) presents suggested terms to the user during their search to enable better Information Retrieval (IR). However, IQE terms are poorly used, and tend to lack information meaningful to the user. The lack of cognitive and functional support during query refinement is a well documented problem, and despite the work carried out, it is still an under researched area. This stagnation in progress has been partly due to the long held belief that users are able to make good IQE term selections, and that the de facto way IQE terms are presented is effective. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to improve the presentation of IQE terms by providing supplementary information alongside them. We describe a user study that compared our novel polyrepresentational approach to IQE against a conventional IQE system and a baseline system. Our findings have shown that a polyrepresentational approach to IQE can address the ambiguity and uncertainty surrounding IQE, and improve the perceived usefulness of the terms.},

We demonstrate how identifying concrete factors of quality for web-based educational resources can make machine learning approaches to automating quality characterization tractable. Using data from several previous studies of quality, we gathered a set of key dimensions and indicators of quality that were commonly identified by educators. We then performed a mixed-method study of digital library curation experts, showing that our characterization of quality captured the subjective processes used by the experts when assessing resource quality for classroom use. Using key indicators of quality selected from a statistical analysis of our expert study data, we developed a set of annotation guidelines and annotated a corpus of 1000 digital resources for the presence or absence of these key quality indicators. Agreement among annotators was high, and initial machine learning models trained from this corpus were able to identify some indicators of quality with as much as an 18% improvement over the baseline.},

By aligning the output of multiple OCR engines and taking advantage of the differences between them, the error rate based on the aligned lattice of recognized words is significantly lower than the individual OCR word error rates. This lattice error rate constitutes a lower bound among aligned alternatives from the OCR output. Results from a collection of poor quality mid-twentieth century typewritten documents demonstrate an average reduction of 55.0% in the error rate of the lattice of alternatives and a realized word error rate (WER) reduction of 35.8% in a dictionary-based selection process. As an important precursor, an innovative admissible heuristic for the A* algorithm is developed, which results in a significant reduction in state space exploration to identify all optimal alignments of the OCR text output, a necessary step toward the construction of the word hypothesis lattice. On average 0.0079% of the state space is explored to identify all optimal alignments of the documents.},

The study also examines how photographers use peoples' names to personalize the different types of metadata and how they tell stories across short sequences of images.

abstract = {Web users are spending more of their time and creative energies within online social networking systems. While many of these networks allow users to export their personal data or expose themselves to third-party web archiving, some do not. Facebook, one of the most popular social networking websites, is one example of a "walled garden" where users' activities are trapped. We examine a variety of techniques for extracting users' activities from Facebook (and by extension, other social networking systems) for the personal archive and for the third-party archiver. Our framework could be applied to any walled garden where personal user data is being locked.},

abstract = {Journals, letters, and other writings are of great value to historians and those who research their own family history; however, it can be difficult to find writings by specific people, and even harder to find what others wrote about them. We present a prototype web-based system that enables users to discover information about historical people (including their own ancestors) by linking digital library content to unique PersonIDs from a genealogical database. Users can contribute content such as scanned journals or information about where items can be found. They can also transcribe content and tag it with PersonIDs to identify who it is about. Additional features provide tools for users to explore historical contexts and relationships. These include the ability to tag places and to create a historical social network by specifying non-family relationships or by using a mechanism we call rosters to imply participation in some group or event.},

abstract = {The utility of an enterprise search system is determined by three key players: the information retrieval (IR) system (the search engine), the enterprise users, and the service provider who delivers the tailored IR service to its designated enterprise users. Currently, evaluations of enterprise search have been focused largely on the IR system effectiveness and efficiency, only a relatively small amount of effort on the user's involvement, and hardly any effort on the service provider's role. This paper will investigate the role of the service provider. We propose a method that evaluates the cost and benefit for a service provider of using a mediated search engine - in particular, where domain experts intervene on the ranking of the search results from a search engine. We test our cost and benefit evaluation method in a case study and conduct user experiments to demonstrate it. Our study shows that: 1) by making use of domain experts' relevance assessments in search result ranking, the precision and the discount cumulated gain of ranked lists have been improved significantly (144% and 40% respectively); 2) the service provider gains substantial return on investment and higher search success rate by investing in domain experts' relevance assessments; and 3) the cost and benefit evaluation also indicates the type of queries to be selected from a query log for evaluating an enterprise search engine.},

In this paper, term distribution analysis using Fourier series expansion as a novel approach for calculating an abstract representation of term positions in a document corpus is introduced. Based on this approach, two methods for improving the evaluation of document relevance are proposed: (a) a function-based ranking optimization representing a user defined document region, and (b) a query expansion technique based on overlapping the term distributions in the top-ranked documents. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing new possibilities for optimizing the retrieval process.},

abstract = {Web 2.0 enables information sharing, collaboration among users and most notably supports active participation and creativity of the users. As a result, a huge amount of manually created metadata describing all kinds of resources is now available. Such semantically rich user generated annotations are especially valuable for digital libraries covering multimedia resources such as music, where these metadata enable retrieval relying not only on content-based (low level) features, but also on the textual descriptions represented by tags. However, if we analyze the annotations users generate for music tracks, we find them heavily biased towards genre. Previous work investigating the types of user provided annotations for music tracks showed that the types of tags which would be really beneficial for supporting retrieval - usage (theme) and opinion (mood) tags - are often neglected by users in the annotation rocess. In this paper we address exactly this problem: in order to support users in tagging and to fill these gaps in the tag space, we develop algorithms for recommending mood and theme annotations. Our methods exploit the available user annotations, the lyrics of music tracks, as well as combinations of both. We also compare the results for our recommended mood / theme annotations against genre and style recommendations - a much easier and already studied task. Besides evaluating against an expert (AllMusic.com) ground truth, we evaluate the quality of our recommended tags through a Facebook-based user study. Our results are very promising both in comparison to experts as well as users and provide interesting insights into possible extensions for music tagging systems to support music search.},

Moreover, this is happening with the direct collaborative, participation of people. Wikipedia is a great example. It is an enormous repository of information with free access and edition, created by the community in a collaborative manner. However, this large amount of information, made available democratically and virtually without any control, raises questions about its relative quality. In this work we explore a significant number of quality indicators, some of them proposed by us and used here for the first time, and study their capability to assess the quality of Wikipedia articles. Furthermore, we explore machine learning techniques to combine these quality indicators into one single assessment judgment. Through experiments, we show that the most important quality indicators are the easiest ones to extract, namely, textual features related to length, structure and style. We were also able to determine which indicators did not contribute significantly to the quality assessment. These were, coincidentally, the most complex features, such as those based on link analysis. Finally, we compare our combination method with state-of-the-art solution and show significant improvements in terms of effective quality prediction.},

It yielded empirical data that will be useful for both practitioners (e.g., for improving search interface designs), and researchers (e.g., to inform models of search behavior). Results of the study show that participants spent about 50 seconds per task looking at (fixating on) the results, about 25 seconds looking at the facets, and only about 6 seconds looking at the query itself.

abstract = {The World Wide Web has become a key source of knowledge pertaining to almost every walk of life. Unfortunately, much of data on the Web is highly ephemeral in nature, with more than 50-80% of content estimated to be changing within a short time. Continuing the pioneering efforts of many national (digital) libraries, organizations such as the International Internet Preservation Consortium (IIPC), the Internet Archive (IA) and the European Archive (EA) have been tirelessly working towards preserving the ever changing Web.However, while these web archiving efforts have paid significant attention towards long term preservation of Web data, they have paid little attention to developing an global-scale infrastructure for collecting, archiving, and performing historical analyzes on the collected data. Based on insights from our recent work on building text analytics for Web Archives, we propose EverLast, a scalable distributed framework for next generation Web archival and temporal text analytics over the archive. Our system is built on a loosely-coupled distributed architecture that can be deployed over large-scale peer-to-peer networks. In this way, we allow the integration of many archival efforts taken mainly at a national level by national digital libraries. Key features of EverLast include support of time-based text search &amp; analysis and the use of human-assisted archive gathering. In this paper, we outline the overall architecture of EverLast, and present some promising preliminary results.},

In particular, data produced in e-Science domains could be reliably stored in today's data grids, taking advantage of the natural properties of this kind of infrastructure to support redundancy. However, to achieve reliability we must take into account failure interdependency. Taking into account the fact that correlated failures can affect multiple components and potentially cause complete loss of data, we propose a solution to evaluate redundancy strategies in the context of heterogeneous environments such as data grids. This solution is based on a simulation engine that can be used not only to support the process of designing the preservation environment and related policies, but also later on to observe and control the deployed system.},

Such projects are a luxury, suitable only for limited collections of known importance and requiring significant institutional commitment for sustainability. In previous research, we have shown the web infrastructure (i.e., search engine caches, web archives) refreshes and migrates web content in bulk as side-effects of their user-services, and these results can be mined as a useful, but passive preservation service. Our current research involves a number of questions resulting from removing the implicit assumption that web-based data objects must passively await curatorial services: What if data objects were not tethered to repositories? What are the implications if the content were actively seeking out and injecting itself into the web infrastructure (i.e., search engine caches, web archives)? All of this leads to our primary research question: Can we create objects that preserve themselves more effectively than repositories or web infrastructure can?},

Our long-term goal is to understand the data practices and data management requirements of virtual organizations and their implications for the design and development of data digital libraries. We have constructed our own virtual organization as a participant-observer approach to the research. Results to date suggest that collaborative technologies are emergent and that defining and scoping the data products of collaborations continues to be problematic.},

The study employed a web-based survey to collect data from 123 participants in 20 countries as well as a semi-structured, follow-up telephone interview with a smaller sample of the survey respondents. Roger's diffusion of innovation theory was used as a theoretical framework. The main constructs considered for the study were relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, observability, and institution readiness. The study yielded both qualitative and quantitative data, and preliminary analysis showed that all six factors influence the adoption of PREMIS in varying degrees.},

Historical societies, museums, and archives also increasingly collect ephemera as records of social and cultural history. This presentation argues that the digitized flea market, as epitomized by eBay, replaces in-person sales while also providing a stream of rich information about a previously invisible, unquantifiable marketplace. Furthermore, identifying factors that influence collectibles buyers' behavior in online auction sales can also shed light on factors affecting user behaviors in digital libraries. Data from a survey of over 1,000 recent home movie auction listings on eBay suggest how eBay may be used as a data source by collectors, as well as the users and designers of digital libraries.},

The evaluation process began with the development of the prototype of PLMs management system to implement the PLMM. Then, more than 200 metadata records describing all types of sample PLMs (with variations in sizes, scripts, languages, titles, and number of content subjects contained in a fascicle) were provided in Extensible Markup Language (XML) format, while system interfaces and queries were developed with Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). This was followed by the trials with end users and staff in their workplace in order to evaluate the usefulness of PLMM in user tasks according to the FRBR tasks: find, identify, select, and obtain; and collection development tasks. The research found that 'somewhat high' efficiency of the PLMM was perceived among the participants in the two tasks. The finding also suggests that perceived efficiency of the PLMM was significantly higher with more years of users' experience with the PLMs. The status of users is another factor which positively affected the perceived efficiency of the PLMM.},

abstract = {In the life sciences one of the pronounced problems is the deluge of new results and data that are produced on a daily basis. This data can take many different forms, e.g. microarray probes, gene sequences, protein structures and is added by hundreds of research centers world-wide in a largely uncoordinated fashion. Thus integration of life science data is growing in importance. Unfortunately, most research centers do not have particular incentive to spend efforts on integrating their data with data produced by others. This task is largely left to large publicly-sponsored institutions like the US National Library of Medicine and similar institutions in other countries. Unfortunately, despite their work in this area, the integration of web-based life science resources is still an open issue (and one ever growing in importance) as these organizations cannot cope with the information deluge that is happening on a daily basis in the life sciences. Thus it becomes essential that as many as possible third parties are engaged in the process. Here we demonstrate a simple prototype of a browser plugin that creates a platform for third parties to contribute to cross-linking related online life science data resources and thus improving the search experience and the productivity of the life science community. The plugin creates a convenient programming interface that minimizes the effort that arises for such third-party contributors. We have provided reference implementations using the plugin that cross-link life science literature resources and illustrate the potential for third parties to create mashups that could be applied also in areas other than the life sciences.},

abstract = {Among many practical and domain-specific tasks, expertise retrieval (ER) has recently gained increasing attention in the information retrieval and knowledge management communities. This paper describes our ongoing project to design and implement an expert retrieval system with the scope on researchers who work in Thailand. In our current system prototype, we assume that the areas of expertise among researchers can be extracted from bibliographic databases. We use the Science Citation Index (SCI) database to provide the information for representing the expert profiles. From the SCI database, we queried and retrieved publications covering from the year 2001 to 2008 by specifying the affiliation equal to "Thailand". The results contain a set of approximately 23,000 publications. We downloaded and extracted four related fields including authors (denoted by AU), controlled terms (denoted by ID), keywords (denoted by DE) and subject category (denoted by SC). To build a researcher network, we consider two types of relationships: direct and indirect. The direct (or social) relationship is defined as the co-authoring degree between one researcher to others. The co-authoring degree between two researchers, co-authoring(A,B), can be calculated based on the co-occurrence frequency between A and B found in the field AU of 23,000 retrieved records. The indirect (or topical relationship is defined when two researchers have publications under the same topics. The topical degree between two researchers, topical(A,B), can be calculated based on the similarity measure between two sets of extracted keywords, keyword(A) and keyword(B), representing researcher A and B, respectively. The keyword set can be extracted from the fields ID, DE and SC. An author with high frequencies on particular keywords is considered an expert in the corresponding research topics.},

OLAC uses a community-specific refinement of qualified Dublin Core [http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/metadata.htm] along with a community-specific refinement of the OAI Protocol for Metadata Harvesting [http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/repositories.htm] to maintain an aggregated catalog of the holdings of the 35 participating archives. OLAC recognizes that the language resources of interest to the community come not only from sources within the community but also from many sources outside the community. This poster describes one approach we have developed for addressing this issue, namely, a crosswalk that transforms the MARC21 catalog for a library or archive into an OAI static repository that holds an OLAC metadata record for each MARC record identified as describing a language resource.},

Justifications for the development of scientific digital libraries include the desire to preserve science data and the promises of information interconnectedness, correlative science, and system interoperability. Research [1] suggests single shared ontologies are fundamental to fulfilling these promises. We present a tool framework, a set of principles, and a real world case study where shared ontologies are used to develop and manage science information models and subsequently guide the implementation of scientific digital libraries. The tool framework, based on an ontology modeling tool as illustrated in Figure 1, was configured to develop, manage, and keep shared ontologies relevant within changing domains and to promote the interoperability, interconnectedness, and correlation desired by scientists.},

abstract = {Much has been written about the lifecycle of digital objects. This study is instead concerned with the lifecycle of collections and associated services. Online collection environments are built to fulfill specific collecting objectives and constraints. If a collection proves useful within its original hosting environment, it will often be necessary or desirable to move the collection to new environments, in order to support new forms of use and re-aggregation or extract resources from legacy data environments. Such a transformation can be extremely expensive, challenging and prone to error, especially if the collections include complex internal structures and services. When "services make the repository" [1], moving raw data from one location to another will often not be sufficient. Digital curators can pre-empt costly and problematic system migration efforts by integrating collections into environments specifically designed to support long-term preservation, scalability and interoperability [2]. We report on an integration of content and functionality of a feature-rich collecting environment (ContextMiner) into a robust data curation environment (iRODS).ContextMiner is a web-based service for building collections, through the execution and management of "campaigns" (i.e. sets of associated queries and parameters to harvest content over time). As a part of the VidArch project, we have been using the ContextMiner framework and services for harvesting YouTube videos and associated contextual information on a variety of topics. In July 2008, we released a public beta of ContextMiner, allowing anyone to run similar crawls. There are now more than 100 users. The current implementation - based on a single MySQL database and associated code - has served its intended purposes very well, but it is not a scalable or sustainable basis for offering wide-scale collecting services in support of the diverse array of potential users and use cases.iRODS (integrated Rule-Oriented Data System), is adaptive policy-driven data grid middleware, which addresses aspects of growth, evolution, openness, and closure - fundamental requirements for digital preservation [3]. iRODS currently scales to hundreds of millions of files, tens of thousands of users, and petabytes of data. It operates in a highly distributed environment with heterogeneous storage resources and allows for growth through federation. It supports evolution through the virtualization of the underlying technology and supports changing business requirements through customization of repository behaviors. It supports openness through a data type agnostic treatment of content. iRODS can be instrumented with policies that support the management of the lifecycle of digital assets and will serve as a unique platform to study repository integration. One key feature is the automation of policy enforcement across distributed data that have been organized into a shared collection. The coupling of other open repositories and iRODS can create greater efficiencies and new types of repository services.We discuss various repository integration scenarios, their potential benefits, and implications for collection life cycles. The approaches co-locate metadata and content in varied ways and rely on efficiencies found in one repository only, or on the ability to combine policies in both spaces: (1) iRODS to ContexMiner data migration, (2) Policy-based data management for ContextMiner collections, and (3) Policy interchange between ContextMiner and iRODS collections.},

abstract = {Biomedical researchers depend on on-line databases and digital libraries for up to date information. We introduce a pilot project aimed at characterizing adjustments made to biomedical queries that improve search results. Specifically we focus on queries submitted to PubMed®, a large sophisticated search engine that facilitates Web access to abstracts of articles in over 5,200 biomedical journals. On average 2 million users search PubMed each day. During their search, nearly 20% will experience a result page from one of their queries that has zero results. In some cases there really is no document or abstract that will satisfy a particular query. However, in analyzing one month of queries submitted to PubMed, we find that more often than not, queries that retrieved no results are queries that would retrieve something relevant if they were constructed differently. This paper describes a new effort to identify some of the characteristics of a query that produces zero results, and the changes that users most often apply in constructing new, "corrected" queries. Zero-result queries afford us an opportunity to examine changes made to queries that we know did not return relevant data, because they did not return any data. An investigation of the changes users make under these circumstances can yield insight into users' search processes.},

abstract = {This extended abstract describes a digital music stand integrated with the Greenstone digital library software. It features text annotation and an animated fast-to-slow page wipe. Figure 1 illustrates both these features, although it is best appreciated in a live demonstration. Digital annotation provides a non-destructive alternative to a musician's habit of penciling in notes. In Figure 1, slightly over half way down the page, there is a note to watch the fingering. A user can have as many of these as they like, positioned anywhere on the page.The animated page wipe alleviates (somewhat) the issue of when to turn to the next page. Unlike its physical counterpart, where turning to the next page means you can no longer see the current page, with a digital music stand the next page can gradually be overlaid. The page transition occurring in Figure 1 can be seen as a marked horizontal bar not quite half-way down the page. The speed of the wipe is initially fast, but when it reaches the point where the scroll-bar marker is on the right-hand side of the page, it slows down significantly. This is to give the musician time to finishing playing the last line of the current page. In the event they have already finished playing that line, they will have naturally moved on to playing the top of the next page (which is already displayed).Rather than adopt a traditional client-side "helper" application for the digital music stand, we have integrated it within Greenstone using AJAX. For instance: next and previous pages are asynchronously loaded in the background; when generating a page, the dimensions of the user's screen is sent to the DL server so it can produce a version that maximizes the available space; and interactions such as adding an annotation, or altering the position of the animation-break are immediately stored as metadata associated with that document. Initially the animated page breaks are set to be between the last two staff systems. This is accomplished as part of the DL ingest process, leveraging off the staff detection step of Optical Music Recognition software.},

abstract = {We propose a new document container format (XEB, eXtensible Electronic Book) based on block mechanism to efficiently process markup language documents in handheld devices. And random document access is also supported in the format through a pagination mechanism. The format has already been applied to a number of handheld devices' Chinese E-book readersand XEB documents can be downloaded from a Chinese E-book store.},
