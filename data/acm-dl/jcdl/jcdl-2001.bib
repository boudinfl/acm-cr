abstract = {With the number and types of documents in digital library systems incr easing, tools for automatically organizing and presenting the content have to be found. While many approaches focus on topic-based organization and structuring, hardly any system incorporates automatic structural analysis and representation. Yet, genre information (unconsciously) forms one of the most distinguishing features in conventional libraries and in information searches. In this paper we present an approach to automatically analyze the structure of documents and to integrate this information into an automatically created content-based organization. In the resulting visualization, documents on similar topics, yet representing different genres, are depicted as books in differing colors. This representation supports users intuitively in locating relevant information presented in a relevant form.},

abstract = {Text categorization is typically formulated as a concept learning prob lem where each instance is a single isolated document. In this paper we are interested in a more general formulation where documents are organized as page sequences, as naturally occurring in digital libraries of scanned books and magazines. We describe a method for classifying pages of sequential OCR text documents into one of several assigned categories and suggest that taking into account contextual information provided by the whole page sequence can significantly improve classification accuracy. The proposed architecture relies on hidden Markov models whose emissions are bag-of-words according to a multinomial word event model, as in the generative portion of the Naive Bayes classifier. Our results on a collection of scanned journals from the Making of America project confirm the importance of using whole page sequences. Empirical evaluation indicates that the error rate (as obtained by running a plain Naive Bayes classifier on isolated page) can be roughly reduced by half if contextual information is incorporated.},

The goal is to redefine the line between those activities that fall within the domain of computer programming and those that fall within the domain of content authoring. The current location of this line, as defined by web technologies, is such that far too much of the design and development process is in the domain of software creation. This paper explores the definition and use of “linked active content”, which builds on the hypertext paradigm by extending it to support active content. This concept has community development advantages, since it provides an authoring paradigm that supports  contributions from a more diverse audience, including especially those who have substantial classroom and pedagogical expertise but lack programming expertise.  It also promotes the extraction of content from software so that collections may be better organized and more easily repurposed to meet the needs of a diverse audience of educators and students.},

Such environments have proved extraordinarily time-consuming and difficult to produce, however, threatening the goals of widespread creation and use. One proposed solution for accelerating production has been the creation of repositories of reusable software components or learning objects. Programmers would use such components to rapidly assemble larger-scale environments. Although many agree on the value of this approach, few repositories of such components have been successfully created. We suggest some reasons for the lack of expected results and propose two strategies for developing such repositories. We report on a case study that provides a proof of concept of these strategies.},

We first characterize a work setting in which we expected an e-book to be a useful interface for reading and otherwise using a mix of physical and digital library materials, and explore what kinds of reading-related functionality would bring value to this setting. We do this by describing important aspects of legal research in a heterogeneous information environment, including mobility, reading, annotation, link following and writing practices, and their general implications for design. We then discuss how our work with a user community and an evolving e-book prototype allowed us to examine tandem issues of usability and utility, and to redesign an existing e-book user interface to suit the needs of law students. The study caused us to move away from the notion of a stand-alone reading device and toward the concept of a document laptop, a platform that would provide wireless access to information resources, as well as support a fuller spectrum of reading-related activities.},

In early 2001, at meetings in the U.S. and Europe, the version of the protocol to be used for beta testing was announced. The HTTP-based protocol uses URLs for queries and XML for responses. The default metadata record structure is unqualified Dublin Core using a specified XML Schema. This simple metadata record form is intended to support cross-domain discovery; other record structures for which XML Schemas are defined can also be made available. Developments during the beta test should include the creation of OAI-compliant repositories (data providers) and harvesters (service providers). This panel will explore the purpose and evolution of the Open Archives Initiative from the point of view of various stakeholders, with emphasis on developments during 2001.},

abstract = {Silver is an authoring tool that aims to allow novice users to edit di gital video. The goal is to make editing of digital video as easy as text editing. Silver provides multiple coordinated views, including project, source, outline, subject, storyboard, textual transcript and timeline views. Selections and edits in any view are synchronized with all other views. A variety of recognition algorithms are applied to the video and audio content and then are used to aid in the editing tasks. The Informedia Digital Library supplies the recognition algorithms and metadata used to support intelligent editing, and Informedia also provides search and a repository. The metadata includes shot boundaries and a time-synchronized transcript, which are used to support intelligent selection and intelligent cut/copy/paste.},

The goal of ADEPT is to build a distributed digital library (DL) of personalized collections of geospatially referenced information.  This DL is characterized by: (1) services for building, searching, and using personalized collections; (2) collections of georeferenced multimedia information, including dynamic simulation models of spatially distributed processes; and (3) user interfaces employing the concept of a “Digital Earth”.  Important near-term objectives for ADEPT are to build prototype collections that support  undergraduate learning in physical, human, and cultural geography and related disciplines, and then to evaluate whether using such resources helps students learn to reason scientifically.  Collections and services developed by ADEPT researchers will migrate to ADL as they mature.},

abstract = {The potential of automatically generated indexes for information acces s has been recognized for several decades (e.g., Bush 1945 [2], Edmundson and Wyllys 1961 [4]), but the quantity of text and the ambiguity of natural language processing have made progress at this task more difficult than was originally foreseen. Recently, a body of work on development of interactive systems to support phrase browsing has begun to emerge (e.g., Anick and Vaithyanathan 1997 [1], Gutwin et al. [10], Nevill-Manning et al. 1997 [17], Godby and Reighart 1998 [9]). In this paper, we consider two issues related to the use of automatically identified phrases as index terms in a dynamic text browser (DTB), a user-centered system for navigating and browsing index terms: 1) What criteria are useful for assessing the usefulness of automatically identified index terms? and 2) Is the quality of the terms identified by automatic indexing such that they provide useful access to document content? The terms that we focus on have been identified by LinkIT, a software tool for identifying significant topics in text [7]. Over 90% of the terms identified by LinkIT are coherent and therefore merit inclusion in the dynamic text browser. Terms identified by LinkIT are input to Intell-Index, a prototype DTB that supports interactive navigation of index terms. The distinction between phrasal heads (the most important words in a coherent term) and modifiers serves as the basis for a hierarchical organization of terms. This linguistically motivated structure helps users to efficiently browsing and disambiguate terms. We conclude that the approach to information access discussed in this paper is very promising, and also that there is much room for further research. In the meantime, this research is a contribution to the establishment of a solid foundation for assessing the usability of terms in phrase browsing applications.},

abstract = {The Internet has considerably empowered libraries and changed common p erception of what they entail. Public libraries, in particular, are using technological advancements to expand their range of services and enhance their civic roles. Providing community information (CI) in innovative, digital forms via community networks is one way in which public libraries are facilitating everyday information needs. These networks have been lauded for their potential to strengthen physical communities through increasing information flow about local services and events, and through facilitating civic interaction. However, little is known about how the public uses such digital services and what barriers they encounter. This paper presents findings about how digital CI systems benefit physical communities based on extensive case studies in three states. At each site, rich data were collected using online surveys, field observation, in-depth interviews and focus groups with Internet users, human service providers and library staff. Both the online survey and the follow-up interviews with respondents were based on sense-making theory. In our paper we discuss our findings regarding: (1) how the public is using digital CI systems for daily problem solving, and (2) the types of barriers they encounter. Suggestions for improving digital CI systems are provided.},

Tools that automatically identify keyphrases are desirable because document keyphrases have numerous applications in digital library systems, but are costly and time consuming to manually assign. Keyphrase extraction algorithms are usually evaluated by comparison to author-specified keywords, but this methodology has several well-known shortcomings. The results presented in this paper are based on subjective evaluations of the quality and appropriateness of keyphrases by human assessors, and make a number of contributions. First, they validate previous evaluations of Kea that rely on author keywords. Second, they show Kea's performance is comparable to that of similar systems that have been  evaluated by human assessors. Finally, they justify the use of author keyphrases as a performance metric by showing that authors generally choose good keywords.},

A distinctive feature of DLESE as a digital library is the “DLESE community”, composed of voluntary members who contribute metadata and resource reviews to DLESE. As the DLESE community is open, the question of how to evaluate community contributions is a crucial part of the review policy design process. In this paper, technological frames theory is used to analyse this design process by looking at how the designers work with two differing definitions of the “peer reviewer”, (a) peer reviewer as arbiter or editor, and (b) peer reviewer as colleague. Content analysis of DLESE documents shows that these frames can in turn be related to two definitions that DLESE offers of itself: DLESE as a library, and DLESE as a digital artifact. The implications of the presence of divergent technological frames for the design process are summarised, and some suggestions for future research are outlined.},

abstract = {In developing recommendation services for a new digital library called  iLumina (www.ilumina-project.org), we are faced with several challenges related to the nature of the data we have available.  The availability and consistency of data associated with iLumina is likely to be highly variable.  Any recommendation strategy we develop must be able to cope with this fact, while also being robust enough to adapt to additional types of data available over time as the digital library develops.  In this paper we describe the challenges we are faced with in developing a system that can provide our users with good, consistent recommendations under changing and uncertain conditions.},

abstract = {In this paper we present DEFINDER, a rule-based system that mines cons umer-oriented full text articles in order to extract definitions and the terms they define. This research is part of Digital Library Project at Columbia University, entitled PERSIVAL (PErsonalized Retrieval and Summarization of Image, Video and Language resources) [5]. One goal of the project is to present information to patients in language they can understand.  A key component of this stage is to provide accurate and readable lay definitions for technical terms, which may be present in articles of intermediate complexity. The focus of this short paper is on quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the DEFINDER system [3]. Our basis for comparison was definitions from Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), On-line Medical Dictionary (OMD) and Glossary of Popular and Technical Medical Terms (GPTMT). Quantitative evaluations show that DEFINDER obtained 87% precision and 75% recall and reveal the incompleteness of existing resources and the ability of DEFINDER to address gaps. Qualitative evaluation shows that the definitions extracted by our system are ranked higher in terms of user-based criteria of usability and readability than definitions from on-line specialized dictionaries. Thus the output of DEFINDER can be used to enhance existing specialized dictionaries, and also as a key feature in summarizing technical articles for non-specialist users.},

We also report on our experience building three SDARTS-compliant wrappers: for locally available plain-text document collections, for locally available XML document collections, and for external web-accessible collections. These wrappers were developed to be easily customizable for new collections.

Since speaker-independent speech recognition technology results in a significantly lower recognition rate than that found when the recognizer is trained for a particular speaker, we applied a number of post-processing algorithms to the output of the recognizer to render it suitable for the Textract text mining system. We indexed the call transcripts using a search engine and used Textract and associated Java technologies to place the relevant terms for each document in a relational database. Following a search query, we generated a thumbnail display of the results of each call with the salient terms highlighted. We illustrate these results and discuss their utility. We took the results of these experiments and continued this analysis on a set of talks and presentations.We describe a distinct document genre based on the note-taking concept of document content, and propose a significant new method for measuring speech recognition accuracy. This procedure is generally relevant to the problem of capturing meetings and talks and providing a searchable index of these presentations on the web.},

The results of a 7-fold cross validation on a corpus of some 3,500 entries with a 5-level index are hit ratios in the range of 89-95%, and most of the misclassifications are indeed ambiguous to begin with.},

The method uses statistical clustering on region features and IRM (Integrated Region Matching), a measure developed to evaluate overall similarity between images that incorporates properties of all the regions in the images by a region-matching scheme.  Compared with retrieval based on individual regions, our overall similarity approach (a) reduces the influence of inaccurate segmentation, (b) helps to clarify the semantics of a particular region, and (c) enables a simple querying interface for region-based image retrieval systems.  The algorithm has been implemented as a part of our experimental SIMPLIcity image retrieval system and tested on large-scale image databases of both general-purpose images and pathology slides. Experiments have demonstrated that this technique maintains the accuracy and robustness of the original system while reducing the matching time significantly.},

abstract = {In this paper, we focus on a user driven approach to improve video ind exing. It consists in cumulating the large amount of small, individual efforts done by the users who access information, and to provide a community management mechanism to let users share the elicited knowledge. This technique is currently being developed in the “OPALES” environment and tuned up at the “Institut National de l'Audiovisuel”(INA), a National Video Library in Paris, to increase the value of its patrimonial video archive collections. It relies on a portal providing private workspaces to end users, so that a large part of their work can be shared between them. The effort for interpreting documents is directly done by the expert users who work for their own job on the archives. OPALES provides an original notion of “point of view” to enable the elicitation and the sharing of knowledge between communities of users, without leading to messy structures. The overall result consists in linking exportable private metadata to archive documents and managing the sharing of the elicited knowledge between users communities.},

abstract = {This paper is focused on a central aspect in the design of our planned  digital library for human movement, i.e. on the aspect of representation and recognition of human activity from video data. The method of representation is important since it has a major impact on the design of all the other building blocks of our system such as the user interface/query block or the activity recognition/storage block. In this paper we evaluate a representation method for human movement that is based on sequences of angular poses and angular velocities of the human skeletal joints, for storage and retrieval of human actions in video databases. The choice of a representation method plays an important role in the database structure, search methods, storage efficiency etc.. For this representation, we develop a novel approach for complex human activity recognition by employing multidimensional indexing combined with temporal or sequential correlation. This scheme is then evaluated with respect to its efficiency in storage and retrieval.For the indexing we use postures of humans in videos that are decomposed into a set of multidimensional tuples which represent the poses/velocities of human body parts such as arms, legs and torso. Three novel methods for human activity recognition are theoretically and experimentally compared. The methods require only a few sparsely sampled human postures. We also achieve speed invariant recognition of activities by eliminating the time factor and replacing it with sequence information. The indexing approach also provides robust recognition and an efficient storage/retrieval of all the activities in a small set of hash tables.},

abstract = {This implementation paper introduces principles for the information
architecture of an educational digital library, principles that address the distinction between designing digital libraries for education and designing digital libraries for information retrieval in general.  Design is a key element of any successful product. Good designers and their designs, put technology into the hands of the user, making the products focus comprehensible and tangible through design.  As straightforward as this may appear, the design of learning technologies is often masked by the enabling technology.  In fact, they often lack an explicitly stated instructional design methodology.  While the technologies are important hurdles to overcome, we advocate learning systems that empower education-driven  experiences rather than technology-driven experiences.  This work describes a concept for a digital library for science, mathematics, engineering and technology education (SMETE), a library with an information architecture designed to meet learners and educators needs.  Utilizing a constructivist model of learning, the authors present practical approaches to implementing the information architecture and its technology underpinnings.  The authors propose the specifications for the information architecture and a visual design of a digital library for communicating learning to the audience.  The design methodology indicates that a scenario-driven design technique sensitive to the contextual nature of learning offers a useful framework for tailoring technologies that help empower, not hinder,  the educational sector.},

abstract = {We describe a model of self-administering data. In this model, a
declarative description of how a data object should behave is attached to the object, either by a user or by a data input device. A widespread infrastructure of self-administering data handlers is presumed to exist; these handlers are responsible for carrying out the specifications attached to the data. Typically, the specifications express how and to whom the data should be transferred, how it should be incorporated when it is received, what rights recipients of the data will have with respect to it, and the kind of relation that should exist between distributed copies of the object. Functions such as distributed version control can be implemented on top of the basic handler functions. We suggest that this  model can provide superior support for common cooperative functions. Because the model is declarative, users need only express their intentions once in creating a self-administering description, and need not be concerned with manually performing subsequent repetitious operations. Because the model is peer-to-peer, users are less dependent on additional, perhaps costly resources, at least when these are not critical.An initial implementation of the model has been created. We are experimenting with the model both as a tool to aid in digital library functions, and as a possible replacement for some server oriented functions.},

The technical challenge is to ensure that the information, generated today, can survive long term changes in storage media, devices and data formats. This paper presents a novel approach to the problem. It distinguishes between archiving of data files and archiving of programs (so that their behavior may be reenacted in the future).For the archiving of a data file, the proposal consists of specifying the processing that needs to be performed on the data (as physically stored) in order to return the information to a future client (according to a logical view of the data). The process specification and the logical view definition are archived with the data.For the archiving of a program behavior, the proposal consists of saving the original executable object code together with the specification of the processing that needs to be performed for each machine instruction of the original computer (emulation).In both cases, the processing specification is based on a Universal Virtual Computer that is general, yet basic enough as to remain relevant in the future.},

We introduce the Hermes alerting service, a service that integrates a variety of different information providers making their heterogeneity transparent for the users. Hermes offers sophisticated filtering capabilities preventing the user from drowning in a flood of irrelevant information. From the user's point of view it integrates the providers into a single source.  Its simple provider interface makes it easy for publishers to join the service and thus reaching the potential readers directly.This paper presents the architecture of the Hermes service and discusses the issues of heterogeneity of information sources.  Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and disadvantages of message-oriented middleware for implementing such a service for digital libraries.},

In particular, going from the current system of journal publication to one of self-distributed documents offers significant cost and timeliness advantages.  A major concern with such alternatives is how to provide the value currently afforded by the peer review system.Here we propose a mechanism that could plausibly supply such value.  In the peer review system, papers are judged meritorious if good reviewers give them good reviews.  In its place, we propose a collaborative filtering algorithm which automatically rates reviewers, and incorporates the quality of the reviewer into the metric of merit for the paper.  Such a system seems to provide all the benefits of the current peer review system, while at the same time being much more flexible.We have implemented a number of parameterized variations of this algorithm, and tested them on data available from a quite different application.  Our initial experiments suggest that the algorithm is in fact ranking reviewers reasonably.},

abstract = {The needs of society have long been addressed through government resea rch support for new technologies-the Internet representing one example.  Today, under the rubric of digital government, federal agencies as well as state and local units of governments at all levels have begun to leverage the fruits of these research investments to better serve the needs of their constituencies.  Government agencies apply these technologies in a variety of settings including emergency response, health and safety regulation, financial management, data gathering, and hosts of information dissemination needs. In addition, governments are investigating ways to use technology to encourage citizen participation.  There is a growing digital government community of practice that strongly parallels the evolving digital library community.  These parallel developments are not surprising because libraries and governments share service missions for their overlapping constituencies.Governments at all levels create enormous volumes of information for use by citizens and have long depended on libraries to organize, disseminate, and preserve this public information.  There is an inextricable link between democratic government and libraries stemming from the 19th century creation of public libraries as democracys offer to citizens to learn, to grow, and to participate.  The idea of sharing knowledge to enable good citizenship engenders many cross-currents inherent in social-political policy, and today this idea is given new incarnation in the global Internet environment.  Digital library projects in national and local libraries were in many ways the precursors of digital government initiatives and it is particularly instructive to examine a selection of digital government projects through the lens of digital libraries.

abstract = {As more information resources become accessible using computers,
our digital interfaces to those resources need to be appropriate for all people.  However when it comes to digital libraries, the interfaces have typically been designed for older children or adults.  Therefore, we have begun to develop a digital library interface developmentally appropriate for young children (ages 5-10 years old).  Our prototype system we now call SearchKids offers a graphical interface for querying, browsing and reviewing search results.  This paper describes our motivation for the research, the design partnership we established between children and adults, our design process, the technology outcomes of our current work, and the lessons we have learned.},

A truly participatory process was used, and observational study was used as a means of refinement to the initial design of the DL prototype. In contrast with current DLs, the childrens DL provides both a static as well as a dynamic environment to encourage active engagement of children in using it.

abstract = {The need for information systems to support the dissemination and reus e of educational resources has sparked a number of large-scale digital library efforts. This article describes usability findings from one such project - the Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) - focusing on its role in the process of educational resource reuse. Drawing upon a reuse model developed in the domain of software engineering, the reuse cycle is broken down into five stages: formulation of a reuse intention, location, comprehension, modification, and sharing. Using this model to analyze user studies in the DLESE project, several implications for library system design and library outreach activities are highlighted. One finding is that resource reuse occurs at different stages in the educational design process, and each stage imposes different and possibly conflicting requirements on digital library design. Another finding is that reuse is a distributed process across several artifacts, both within and outside of the library itself. In order for reuse to be successful, a usability line cannot be drawn at the library boundary, but instead must encompass both the library system and the educational resources themselves.},

abstract = {This paper describes the creation of a new humanities digital library  collection: 11,000,000 words and 10,000 images representing books, images and maps on pre-twentieth century London and its environs. The London collection contained far more dense and precise information than the materials from the Greco-Roman world on which we had previously concentrated. The London collection thus allowed us to explore new problems of data structure, manipulation, and visualization. This paper contrasts our model for how humanities digital libraries are best used with the assumptions that underlie many academic digital libraries on the one hand and more literary hypertexts on the other. Since encoding guidelines such as those from the TEI provide collection designers with far more options than any one project can realize, this paper describes what structures we used to organize the collection and why. We particularly emphasize the importance of mining historical authority lists (encyclopedias, gazetteers, etc.) and then generating automatic span-to-span links within the collection.},

We show how these 3-D facsimiles can be analyzed and manipulated in ways that are tedious or even impossible if confined to the physical manuscript.  In particular, we present results from a restoration framework we have developed for "flattening" the 3-D representation of badly warped manuscripts.  We expect these research directions to give scholars more sophisticated methods to preserve, restore, and better understand the physical objects they study.},

abstract = {An online exhibition of a digital museum often consists of a variety
of multimedia objects such as webpages, animation, and video clips.  Ideally, there should be different exhibitions on the same topic for users with different needs. The difficulty is that it is time-consuming to produce illustrative and intriguing online exhibitions. In this paper, we present a content management system for producing exhibitions. This framework is a novel approach for organizing digital collections and for quickly selecting, integrating, and composing objects from the collection to produce exhibitions of different presentation styles, one for each user group. A prototype based on our framework has been implemented and successfully used in the production of a Lanyu digital museum. Using our method,  the Lanyu Digital Museum online exhibition has several features:  (1) It provides an easy way to compose artifacts extracted from the digital collection into exhibitions.  (2) It provides an easy way to create different presentations of the same exhibition content that are catered to users with different needs. (3) It provides easy-to-use film-editing capability to re-arrange an exhibition and to produce new exhibitions from existing ones.},

The first stage is a retrieval system that matches user queries with relevant multimedia data in the library.  The second stage is a visualization system that processes the multimedia data matched by the first stage for display.Our demonstration focuses on the second stage of PERSIVAL's processing pipeline.  Given a set of relevant documents for certain predefined queries, our integrated demonstration seeks to give a tailored response for either physicians or patients, featuring textual summaries, as well as relevant medical definitions.  To visualize the summaries and definitions, we employ automated constraint-based layout of the user interface that allows for rich interaction between summaries and definitions.PERSIVAL's natural language processing and user interface modules make up the visualization portion of the system and illustrate state-of-the-art digital library technology.  Following are the modules presented in our demonstration.},

The user can choose to view low or high resolution page images or text for each page or search the text. Authenticated users with little or no training can correct the text on-line, and the corrections are incorporated in the document.

abstract = {The problem of annotating unstructured images is labor intensive and d ifficult to automate. Linking is a type of annotation where an image region is tagged by representing a correspondence between the region and other information. Any serious effort at creating a digital edition of a manuscript from nothing but images and their associated information, such as transcripts and editorial remarks, must include the task of creating a large number of links between image regions and the related information. We present an approach to the problem of image linking, which concentrates on the fundamental and labor-intensive task of associating image regions with their textual counterparts. We assume the input to the system is a set of images representing a manuscript, and that associated data, such as a transcript, is available to provide guidance to the automated portion of the system. Our approach targets collections that are damaged and difficult-to-read, such as manuscripts that require intensive editorial annotation.  It is essentially impossible to perform fully automated techniques, such as optical character recognition (OCR) or accurate handwriting analysis [2], on these kinds of manuscripts.We approach the problem with a semi-automatic solution that involves a document analysis (DA) module and a graphical user interface. The role of the DA module is to assist the user in formulating an algorithm that will automatically detect and rank regions of interest in the image. We provide the user with the capability to configure the parameters and steps of the analysis algorithm and thereby tune it to the task of identifying and ranking candidate regions for linking. With a graphical user interface, the user can interactively establish correspondences between image regions and other data, refine the correspondences detected by the DA module, and supply simple yet critical cues to the DA module to improve the result of subsequent automated processing.

abstract = {The primary goal of the National Digital Library for Undergraduate Mat hematics and Science Teacher Preparation and Professional Development, funded through the NSF Division of Undergraduate Education National Science Digital Libraries Initiative, is to increase the use of best teaching practices by faculty by providing the resources - tools, training, and data - needed to build inquiry and discovery into all undergraduate science and mathematics courses.  Improving the math and science education of future and in-service K-12 teachers is one of the most important challenges facing college and university faculties.The preparation of future teachers is a fundamental element in the improvement of the learning experience of all students, from grades K-16. As teachers know, it is natural to teach as we have been taught ourselves. The standards in mathematics and science call for greater integration of inquiry-based techniques and more rigorous mathematical and science content. Teachers at all levels will be better equipped to meet these standards if they are taught using these approaches during their own education.The resources of this collection target two-year and four-year Colleges of Arts and Sciences faculty members and College of Education faculty that teach mathematics and science content courses.  The collection focuses primarily on those resources that can be accessed electronically, whether they be web-based text or data resources, software or video that can be downloaded via the web or other electronic means, or emerging technology applications.  Resources are reviewed and selected by mathematics and science content experts before they are made available to online users.  This review ensures that the resources are accurate, pedagogically effective, and that this digital library is an efficient source of quality materials.

abstract = {To meet the information needs of isolated primary care providers and t heir patients in the United States (U.S.) Navy, a digital health sciences library - Virtual Naval Hospital (http://www.vnh.org) - was created through a unique partnership between academia and government. The creation of the digital library was heavily influenced by the principles of user-centered design, and made allowances for the nomadic nature of the digital librarys patrons and the heterogeneous access they have to Internet bandwidth. The result is a digital library that has been in operation since 1997, that continues to expand in size, that is heavily used, and that is highly regarded by its patrons. Over time, the digital library has evolved into a knowledge-management system for the U.S. Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. A number of valuable technical, personal, and political lessons have been learned about delivering digital library and knowledge management services to nomadic patrons. They can be summarized by stating that to succeed in the design and implementation of a digital library that serves as a knowledge management tool, regardless of the field of endeavor, one must focus initially and then consistently on the population served and what their mission is, and tailor the digital library to their needs. If this is done, the result will be a tool that is heavily used and sincerely appreciated. These lessons learned will become increasingly valuable as society moves towards a ubiquitous computing environment.},

A wide range of approaches have been developed from a diverse spectrum of perspectives that focus on users and tasks to be supported, data to be modeled, and the efficiency of algorithms. Information visualization aims to exploit the human visual information processing system, especially with non-spatial data (such as documents and images typically found in digital libraries). Generally, information visualization examines semantic relationships intrinsic to an abstract information space and how they can be spatially navigated and memorized using similar cognitive processes to those that would apply during interactions with the real world. This workshop promotes the convergence of information visualization and digital libraries. It brings together researchers and practitioners in the areas of information visualization, digital libraries, human-computer interaction, library and information science, and computer science to identify the most important issues in the past and the present, and what should be done in the future.},
