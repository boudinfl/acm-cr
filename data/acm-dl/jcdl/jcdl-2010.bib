abstract = {As Digital Libraries (DL) become more aligned with the web architecture, their functional components need to be fundamentally rethought in terms of URIs and HTTP. Annotation, a core scholarly activity enabled by many DL solutions, exhibits a clearly unacceptable characteristic when existing models are applied to the web: due to the representations of web resources changing over time, an annotation made about a web resource today may no longer be relevant to the representation that is served from that same resource tomorrow.We assume the existence of archived versions of resources, and combine the temporal features of the emerging Open Annotation data model with the capability offered by the Memento framework that allows seamless navigation from the URI of a resource to archived versions of that resource, and arrive at a solution that provides guarantees regarding the persistence of web annotations over time. More specifically, we provide theoretical solutions and proof-of-concept experimental evaluations for two problems: reconstructing an existing annotation so that the correct archived version is displayed for all resources involved in the annotation, and retrieving all annotations that involve a given archived version of a web resource.},

We evaluate this technique on two datasets, one containing perfectly transcribed texts and one containing errorful OCR, and achieve an accuracy rate of 88.2% projecting 13,023 XML tags from source documents to their transcribed translations, with an 83.6% accuracy rate when projecting to texts containing uncorrected OCR. This approach has the potential to allow a highly granular multilingual digital library to be bootstrapped by applying the knowledge contained in a small, heavily curated collection to a much larger but unstructured one.},

abstract = {Digitizing legacy documents and marking them up with XML is important for many scientific domains. However, creating comprehensive semantic markup of high quality is challenging. Respective processes consist of many steps, with automated markup generation and intermediate manual correction. These corrections are extremely laborious. To reduce this effort, this paper makes two contributions: First, it proposes ProcessTron, a lightweight markup-process-control mechanism. ProcessTron assists users in two ways: It ensures that the steps are executed in the appropriate order, and it points the user to possible errors during manual correction. Second, ProcessTron has been deployed in real-world projects, and this paper reports on our experiences. A core observation is that ProcessTron more than halves the time users need to mark up a document. Results from laboratory experiments, which we have conducted as well, confirm this finding.},

In our experiments, we differentiate between junior researchers that have only published one paper and senior researchers that have multiple publications.

abstract = {Name ambiguity in the context of bibliographic citation records is a hard problem that affects the quality of services and content in digital libraries and similar systems. Supervised methods that exploit training examples in order to distinguish ambiguous author names are among the most effective solutions for the problem, but they require skilled human annotators in a laborious and continuous process of manually labeling citations in order to provide enough training examples. Thus, addressing the issues of (i) automatic acquisition of examples and (ii) highly effective disambiguation even when only few examples are available, are the need of the hour for such systems. In this paper, we propose a novel two-step disambiguation method, SAND (Self-training Associative Name Disambiguator), that deals with these two issues. The first step eliminates the need of any manual labeling effort by automatically acquiring examples using a clustering method that groups citation records based on the similarity among coauthor names. The second step uses a supervised disambiguation method that is able to detect unseen authors not included in any of the given training examples. Experiments conducted with standard public collections, using the minimum set of attributes present in a citation (i.e., author names, work title and publication venue), demonstrated that our proposed method outperforms representative unsupervised disambiguation methods that exploit similarities between citation records and is as effective as, and in some cases superior to, supervised ones, without manually labeling any training example.},

While general citation patterns have been widely studied in the literature we develop the notion of citation projection graphs by investigating the citations among the publications that a given paper cites. We investigate how patterns of citations vary between various scientific disciplines and how such patterns reflect the scientific impact of the paper. We find that idiosyncratic citation patterns are characteristic for low impact papers; while narrow, discipline-focused citation patterns are common for medium impact papers. Our results show that crossing-community, or bridging citation patters are high risk and high reward since such patterns are characteristic for both low and high impact papers. Last, we observe that recently citation networks are trending toward more bridging and interdisciplinary forms.},

We use the output of all methods to query Internet search engines and analyze their retrieval performance. Our results show that both LSs and titles perform fairly well with over 60% URIs returned top ranked from Yahoo!. However, the combination of methods improves the retrieval performance. Considering the complexity of the LS generation, querying the title first and in case of insufficient results querying the LSs second is the preferable setup. This combination accounts for more than 75% top ranked URIs.},

Task types have been shown to influence search behaviors including usefulness judgments. This paper reports on an investigation of user behaviors associated with different task types. Twenty-two undergraduate journalism students participated in a controlled lab experiment, each searching on four tasks which varied on four dimensions: complexity, task product, task goal and task level. Results indicate regular differences associated with different task characteristics in several search behaviors, including task completion time, decision time (the time taken to decide whether a document is useful or not), and eye fixations, etc. We suggest these behaviors can be used as implicit indicators of the user's task type.},

A peculiarity of named entities compared to other vocabulary terms is that they are very dynamic in appearance, and synonym relationships between terms change with time. In this paper, we present an approach to extracting synonyms of named entities over time from the whole history of Wikipedia. In addition, we will use their temporal patterns as a feature in ranking and classifying them into two types, i.e., time-independent or time-dependent. Time-independent synonyms are invariant to time, while time-dependent synonyms are relevant to a particular time period, i.e., the synonym relationships change over time. Further, we describe how to make use of both types of synonyms to increase the retrieval effectiveness, i.e., query expansion with time-independent synonyms for an ordinary search, and query expansion with time-dependent synonyms for a search wrt. temporal criteria. Finally, through an evaluation based on TREC collections, we demonstrate how retrieval performance of queries consisting of named entities can be improved using our approach.},

By comparing the found word senses over time, we can reveal and use important information that will improve understanding and accessibility of a digital archive. Algorithms for word sense discrimination have been developed while keeping today's language in mind and have thus been evaluated on well selected, modern datasets. The quality of the word senses found in the discrimination step has a large impact on the detection of language evolution. Therefore, as a first step, we verify that word sense discrimination can successfully be applied to digitized historic documents and that the results correctly correspond to word senses. Because accessibility of digitized historic collections is influenced also by the quality of the optical character recognition (OCR), as a second step we investigate the effects of OCR errors on word sense discrimination results. All evaluations in this paper are performed on The Times Archive, a collection of newspaper articles from 1785 - 1985.},

abstract = {Wikipedia is one of the most successful online knowledge bases, attracting millions of visits daily. Not surprisingly, its huge success has in turn led to immense research interest for a better understanding of the collaborative knowledge building process. In this paper, we performed a (terrorism) domain-specific case study, comparing and contrasting the knowledge evolution in Wikipedia with a knowledge base created by domain experts. Specifically, we used the Terrorism Knowledge Base (TKB) developed by experts at MIPT. We identified 409 Wikipedia articles matching TKB records, and went ahead to study them from three aspects: creation, revision, and link evolution. We found that the knowledge building in Wikipedia had largely been independent, and did not follow TKB - despite the open and online availability of the latter, as well as awareness of at least some of the Wikipedia contributors about the TKB source. In an attempt to identify possible reasons, we conducted a detailed analysis of contribution behavior demonstrated by Wikipedians. It was found that most Wikipedians contribute to a relatively small set of articles each. Their contribution was biased towards one or very few article(s). At the same time, each article's contributions are often championed by very few active contributors including the article's creator. We finally arrive at a conjecture that the contributions in Wikipedia are more to cover knowledge at the article level rather than at the domain level.},

One such task is the construction of thesauri and other types of concept hierarchies. Human expert feedback on the relatedness and relative generality of terms, however, can be aggregated to dynamically construct evolving concept hierarchies. The InPhO (Indiana Philosophy Ontology) project bootstraps feedback from volunteer users unskilled in ontology design into a precise representation of a specific domain. The approach combines statistical text processing methods with expert feedback and logic programming to create a dynamic semantic representation of the discipline of philosophy.In this paper, we show that results of comparable quality can be achieved by leveraging the workforce of crowdsourcing services such as the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). In an extensive empirical study, we compare the feedback obtained from AMT's workers with that from the InPhO volunteer users providing an insight into qualitative differences of the two groups. Furthermore, we present a set of strategies for assessing the quality of different users when gold standards are missing. We finally use these methods to construct a concept hierarchy based on the feedback acquired from AMT workers.},

The target user group is musicians who primarily use audio and text for composition and arrangement, rather than with formal music notation. Using the principle of user-centered design, the software implementation was guided by a diary study involving nine musicians which suggested five requirements for the software to support: capturing, overdubbing, developing, storing, and organizing. Moreover, the underlying spatial data-model was exploited to give raw audio compositions a hierarchical structure, and - to aid musicians in retrieving previous ideas - a search facility is available to support both query by humming and text-based queries. A user evaluation of the completed design with eleven subjects indicated that musicians, in general, would find the hypermedia environment useful for capturing and managing their moments of musical creativity and exploration. More specifically they would make use of the query by humming facility and the hierarchical track organization, but not the overdubbing facility as implemented.},

In this study, we present a comprehensive investigation of the usefulness of lyrics in music mood classification by evaluating and comparing a wide range of lyric text features including linguistic and text stylistic features. We then combine the best lyric features with features extracted from music audio using two fusion methods. The results show that combining lyrics and audio significantly outperformed systems using audio-only features. In addition, the examination of learning curves shows that the hybrid lyric + audio system needed fewer training samples to achieve the same or better classification accuracies than systems using lyrics or audio singularly. These experiments were conducted on a unique large-scale dataset of 5,296 songs (with both audio and lyrics for each) representing 18 mood categories derived from social tags. The findings push forward the state-of-the-art on lyric sentiment analysis and automatic music mood classification and will help make mood a practical access point in music digital libraries.},

abstract = {Digital libraries must support assistive technologies that allow people with disabilities such as blindness to use, navigate and understand their documents. Increasingly, many documents are Web-based and present their contents using complex layouts. However, approaches that translate two-dimensional layouts to one-dimensional speech produce a very different user experience and loss of information. To address this issue, we conducted a study of how blind people navigate and interpret layouts of news and shopping Web pages using current assistive technology. The study revealed that blind people do not parse Web pages fully during their first visit, and that they can miss important parts. The study also provided insights for improving assistive technologies.},

abstract = {For open-ended information tasks, users must sift through many potentially relevant documents, a practice we refer to as document triage. Normally, people perform triage using multiple applications in concert: a search engine interface presents lists of potentially relevant documents; a document reader displays their contents; and a third tool--a text editor or personal information management application--is used to record notes and assessments. To support document triage, we have developed an extensible multi-application architecture that initially includes an information workspace and a document reader. An Interest Profile Manager infers users' interests from their interactions with the triage applications, coupled with the characteristics of the documents they are interacting with. The resulting interest profile is used to generate visualizations that direct users' attention to documents or parts of documents that match their inferred interests. The novelty of our approach lies in the aggregation of activity records across applications to generate fine-grained models of user interest.},

It uses attributes such as visual appearance, GPS locations, user-assigned tags, and dates to filter and group photos. An automatic layout algorithm positions photos with similar attributes near each other to support users in serendipitously finding multiple relevant photos. In addition, the system can explicitly select photos similar to specified photos. We conducted a user evaluation to determine the benefit provided by similarity layout and the relative advantages offered by the different layout similarity criteria and attribute filters. Study participants had to locate photos matching probe statements. In some tasks, participants were restricted to a single layout similarity criterion and filter option. Participants used multiple attributes to filter photos. Layout by similarity without additional filters turned out to be one of the most used strategies and was especially beneficial for geographical similarity. Lastly, the relative appropriateness of the single similarity criterion to the probe significantly affected retrieval performance.},

However, much remains to be done to tap this potential, and empirically evaluate the true value of a given topic model to humans. In this work, we sketch out some sub-tasks that we suggest pave the way towards this goal, and present methods for assessing the coherence and interpretability of topics learned by topic models. Our large-scale user study includes over 70 human subjects evaluating and scoring almost 500 topics learned from collections from a wide range of genres and domains. We show how scoring model -- based on pointwise mutual information of word-pair using Wikipedia, Google and MEDLINE as external data sources - performs well at predicting human scores. This automated scoring of topics is an important first step to integrating topic modeling into digital libraries},

abstract = {In recent years, the vast amount of digitally available content has lead to the creation of many topic-centered digital libraries. Also in the domain of chemistry more and more digital collections are available, but the complex query formulation still hampers their intuitive adoption. This is because information seeking in chemical documents is focused on chemical entities, for which current standard search relies on complex structures which are hard to extract from documents. Moreover, although simple keyword searches would often be sufficient, current collections simply cannot be indexed by Web search providers due to the ambiguity of chemical substance names. In this paper we present a framework for automatically generating metadata-enriched index pages for all documents in a given chemical collection. All information is then linked to the respective documents and thus provides an easy to crawl metadata repository promising to open up digital chemical libraries. Our experiments, indexing an open access journal, show that not only the documents can be found using a simple Google search via the automatically created index pages, but also that the quality of the search is much more efficient than fulltext indexing in terms of both precision/recall and performance. Finally, we compare our indexing against a classical structure search and figured out that keyword-based search can indeed solve at least some of the daily tasks in chemical workflows. To use our framework thus promises to expose a large part of the currently still hidden chemical Web, making the techniques employed interesting for chemical information providers like digital libraries and open access journals.},

abstract = {Representing the semantics of unstructured scientific publications will certainly facilitate access and search and hopefully lead to new discoveries. However, current digital libraries are usually limited to classic flat structured metadata even for scientific publications that potentially contain rich semantic metadata. In addition, how to search the scientific literature of linked semantic metadata is an open problem. We have developed a semantic digital library oreChem ChemxSeer that models chemistry papers with semantic metadata. It stores and indexes extracted metadata from a chemistry paper repository Chemx Seer using "compound objects".We use the Open Archives Initiative Object Reuse and Exchange (OAI-ORE) (http://www.openarchives.org/ore/ standard to define a compound object that aggregates metadata fields related to a digital object. Aggregated metadata can be managed and retrieved easily as one unit resulting in improved ease-of-use and has the potential to improve the semantic interpretation of shared data. We show how metadata can be extracted from documents and aggregated using OAI-ORE. ORE objects are created on demand; thus, we are able to search for a set of linked metadata with one query.We were also able to model new types of metadata easily. For example, chemists are especially interested in finding information related to experiments in documents. We show how paragraphs containing experiment information in chemistry papers can be extracted and tagged based on a chemistry ontology with 470 classes, and then represented in ORE along with other document-related metadata. Our algorithm uses a classifier with features that are words that are typically only used to describe experiments, such as "apparatus", "prepare", etc. Using a dataset comprised of documents from the Royal Society of Chemistry digital library, we show that the our proposed methodperforms well in extracting experiment-related paragraphs from chemistry documents.},

For these challenging documents, user assistance can be advantageous in directing the binarization procedure. Many existing algorithms, however, are poorly designed to incorporate user assistance. In this paper, we discuss a software framework, BinarizationShop, that combines a series of binarization approaches that have been tailored to exploit user assistance.

abstract = {Access to materials in digital collections has been extensively studied within digital libraries. Exploring a collection requires customized indices and novel interfaces to allow users new exploration mechanisms. Materials or objects can then be found by way of full-text, faceted, or thematic indexes. There has been a marked interest not only in finding objects in a collection, but in discovering relationships and properties. For example, multiple representations of the same object enable the use of visual aids to augment collection exploration. Depending on the domain and characteristics of the objects in a collection, relationships among components can be used to enrich the process of understanding their contents. In this context, the Nautical Archaeology Digital Library (NADL) includes multilingual textual- and visual-rich objects (shipbuilding treatises, illustrations, photographs, and drawings). In this paper we describe an approach for enhancing access to a collection of ancient technical documents, illustrations, and photographs documenting archaeological excavations. Because of the nature of our collection, we exploit a multilingual glossary along with an ontology. Preliminary tests of our prototype suggest the feasibility of our method for enhancing access to the collection.},

Thus applications integrated with digital map have attracted much attention. But no offtheshelf systems or services could we use if the time span of maps be extended to historical ones. There are a large number of valuable ancient atlases in CADAL digital library. However, they are seldom made use of because the ones which are in image format are not convenient for users to read or search. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach to utilizing these atlases directly and constructing some applications based on ancient maps. We call it CAMAME which means Chinese Ancient Maps Automatic Marking and Extraction. We create a gazetteer to store the geographic information of sites which will be project on the map, then use kernel method to do the regression and correct the estimated results with image processing and local regression methods. The empirical results show that CAMAME is effective and efficient, by which most valuable data in the map images is marked and identified. Some Chinese literary chronicle applications that exhibit ancient literary and related historical information over those digitized atlas resources in CADAL digital library were developed.},

Instead, scholars study source materials as an integral part of a complex ecosystem of inquiry that seeks to understand both the text being studied and the context in which that text was created, transmitted and used. Drawing examples from our interviews, we address critical questions of why scholars use source documents and what information they hope to gain by studying them. We also briefly summarize key note-taking practices as a means for assessing the potential to design user interfaces that support scholarly work-practices.},

Specifically, we focus on sentences in related work sections in research articles. Based on a generic rhetorical pattern, a framework for modelling the sequential flow in these sections is proposed. Adopting a generalization strategy, each of these sentences is transformed into a set of features, which forms our dataset. We distinguish between two kinds of features for each of these sentences viz., citation features and sentence features. While an overall accuracy of 96.51% is achieved by using a combination of both citation and sentence features, the use of sentence features alone yields an accuracy of 93.22%. The results also show F-Scores ranging from 0.99 to 0.90 for various classes indicating the robustness of our application.},

A common approach is to use manual annotations, although generating annotations can be expensive in terms of time and money, and therefore may not be justified in many situations. Content-based search techniques which extract visual features from image data can be used, but users are typically forced to express their information need using example images, or through sketching interfaces. This can be difficult if no visual example of the information need is available, or when the information need cannot be easily drawn.In this paper, we consider an alternative approach which allows a user to search for images through an intermediate database. In this approach, a user can search using text in the intermediate database as a way of finding visual examples of their information need. The visual examples can then be used to search a database that lacks annotations. Three experiments are presented which investigate this process. The first experiment automatically selects the image queries from the intermediary database; the second instead uses images which have been hand-picked by users. A third experiment, an interactive study, is then presented this study compares the intermediary interface to text search, where we consider text as an upper bound of performance. For this last study, an interface which supports the intermediary search process is described. Results show that while performance does not match manual annotations, users are able to find relevant material without requiring collection annotations.},

abstract = {In search engines, ranking algorithms measure the importance and relevance of documents mainly based on the contents and relationships between documents. User attributes are usually not considered in ranking. This user-neutral approach, however, may not meet the diverse interests of users, who may demand different documents even with the same queries. To satisfy this need for more personalized ranking, we propose a ranking framework. Social Network Document Rank (SNDocRank), that considers both document contents and the relationship between a searched and document owners in a social network. This method combined the traditional tf-idf ranking for document contents with out Multi-level Actor Similarity (MAS) algorithm to measure to what extent document owners and the searcher are structurally similar in a social network. We implemented our ranking method in simulated video social network based on data extracted from YouTube and tested its effectiveness on video search. The results show that compared with the traditional ranking method like tf-idfs the SNDocRank algorithm returns more relevant documents. More specifically, a searcher can get significantly better results be being in a larger social network, having more friends, and being associated with larger local communities in a social network.},

abstract = {File format obsolescence has so far been considered the major risk in long-term storage of digital objects. There are, however, growing indications that file transfer may be a real threat as the migration time, i.e., the time required to migrate Petabytes of data, may easily spend years. However, hardware support is usually limited to 3-4 years and a situation can emerge when a new migration has to be started although the previous one is still not finished yet. This paper chooses a process modeling approach to obtain estimates of upper and lower bounds for the required migration time. The advantage is that information about potential bottlenecks can be acquired. Our theoretical considerations are validated by migration tests at the National Library of Norway (NB) as well as at our department.},

Digital libraries provide a means to capture, manage, and access the data deluge that results from these research enterprises. We have conducted research on data practices and participated in developing data management services for the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing since its founding in 2002 as a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center. Over the course of eight years, our digital library strategy has shifted dramatically in response to changing technologies, practices, and policies. We report on the development of several DL systems and on the lessons learned, which include the difficulty of anticipating data requirements from nascent technologies, building systems for highly diverse work practices and data types, the need to bind together multiple single-purpose systems, the lack of incentives to manage and share data, the complementary nature of research and development in understanding practices, and sustainability.},

Ensemble has shaped its activities according to principles related to design, development, implementation, and operation of distributed portals. Here we articulate 8 key principles for distributed portals (PDPs). While our focus is on education and pedagogy, we expect that our experiences will generalize to other digital library application domains. These principles inform, facilitate, and enhance the Ensemble R&amp;D and production activities. They allow us to provide a broad range of services, from personalization to coordination across communities. The eight PDPs can be briefly summarized as: (1) Articulation across communities using ontologies. (2) Browsing tailored to collections. (3) Integration across interfaces and virtual environments. (4) Metadata interoperability and integration. (5) Social graph construction using logging and metrics. (6) Superimposed information and annotation integrated across distributed systems. (7) Streamlined user access with IDs. (8) Web 2.0 multiple social network system interconnection.},

We explore how to meet ad hoc needs that cannot easily be supported by a disciplinary ontology, and argue that web pages that describe data collections with rich links and rich text are valuable. We describe the approach followed by the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) in making such pages available. Finally, we discuss how we plan to evaluate this approach.},

To answer the question, we look at the biomedical literature and begin with examining basic statistics of social tags from CiteULike in comparison with Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) annotated in the Medline bibliographic database. Then, using the data, we conduct various experiments in an IR setting, which reveals that social tags work complementarily with MeSH and that retrieval performance would improve as the coverage of CiteULike grows.},

However, implementing a common metadata format among multiple digital libraries is not always a straightforward exercise. This paper reviews some of the metadata issues that arose during the merger of two digital libraries, the Internet Public Library and the Librarian's Internet Index. As part of the merger, each library's metadata was crosswalked to Dublin Core. This required considerable work. A sociotechnical analysis suggests that the metadata for each library had been shaped in complex ways over time by local factors, and that this complexity negatively impacted the efficiency of the crosswalk. Some implications of this finding for digital library interoperability are discussed.},

Archiving and preservation organizations are posed with large amounts of such objects of various types. At some point they will need to process these automatically to make them available to their users or convert them to a commonly used format. A substantial problem is to provide a wide range of different users with access to ancient environments and to allow using the original environment for a given object. We propose an abstract architecture for emulation services in digital preservation to provide remote user interfaces to emulation over computer networks without the need to install additional software components. Furthermore, we describe how these ideas can be integrated in a framework of web services for common preservation tasks like viewing or migrating digital objects.},

abstract = {This poster describes the architecture of a new kind of digital repository service that includes components that run on desktop computers, designed to close the gap between Institutional Repositories (IRs) and the day-to-day electronic work environment used by researchers, and to address the too-often heard cry from repository managers of "we built it but they didn't come.The team at the Australian Digital Futures Institute are working with researchers to provide software that can (a) index and expose the research data content on their hard disks (b) extract metadata from files (c) automatically process data according to highly configurable workflows including producing web-ready renditions of research objects including documents, domain specific data visualizations (such as chemical molecules) and converting video and images so that they may be easily previewed.The architecture is inspired by the success of consumer software in two ways; the way entertainment programs organize content via faceted browse and search interfaces using embedded metadata, and the way photographic software allows content to be grouped into collections and pushed to online services, which are essentially repositories.},

abstract = {Important words, which usually exist in part of Title, Subject and Keywords, can briefly reflect the main topic of a document. In recent years, it is a common practice to exploit the semantic topic of documents and utilize important words to achieve document clustering, especially for short texts such as news articles. This paper proposes a novel method to extract important words from Subject and Keywords of articles, and then partition documents only with those important words. Considering the fact that frequencies of important words are usually low and the scale matrix dataset for important words is small, a normalization method is then proposed to normalize the scale dataset so that more accurate results can be achieved by sufficiently exploiting the limited information. The experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.},

abstract = {In this demo we introduce a platform and a model of journal in the age of the Web called liquid journal. The goal of the model (and of the supporting platform) is to disseminate knowledge in the best possible way while also supporting scientists in the credit attribution. In a nutshell, liquid journals are collections of "interesting" links to scientific contributions, such as papers, blogs, datasets, that are related to certain topics. The content gets to the journal either by querying both conventional and non conventional sources on the Web or manually by the group of editors. Liquid journals combines depth and breath in bringing a wider spectrum of scientific contributions from different communities, while also focusing editors' and readers' attention on the things they care about. The demo illustrates the features and benefits of the proposed platform.},

abstract = {Verifiability and reproducibility are core tenets of the scholarly communication process. For many scientific publications, however, it is often the case that supporting datasets are not preserved, even when the article text is. And when they are, it is usually as a collection of files without relationships amongst one another or to the articles with which they are associated. There are some existing approaches that attempt to link datasets with articles after the fact (e.g.,NED ), but they are relatively few and involve substantial human intervention.The Digital Research and Curation Center in the Johns Hopkins University Sheridan Libraries, in conjunction with its partners has developed a proof-of-concept system that demonstrates an approach to capturing datasets during the process of submitting the associated article. As part of this process, linkages are established between the datasets and the article.},
