abstract = {This article presents findings from approximately 150 users who created instructional projects using educational digital library resources. One hundred of these users were teachers participating in professional development workshops on the topic of digital libraries. Our iterative approach to tool and workshop development and implementation was based on a framework that characterizes several input, output, and process variables affecting dissemination of such technologies in educational contexts. Data sources involved a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods, including electronic surveys, interviews, participant observations, and server log file and artifact analyses. These multiple and complementary levels of analyses reveal that despite teachers reporting great value in learning resources and educational digital libraries, significant and lasting impact on teaching practice remains difficult to obtain.},

abstract = {This paper explores two ways to help students locate most relevant resources in educational digital libraries. One method gives a more comprehensive access to educational resources, through multiple pathways of information access, including browsing and information visualization. The second method is to access personalized information through social navigation support. This paper presents the details of the Knowledge Sea II system for comprehensive personalized access to educational resources and also presents the results of a classroom study. The study delivered a convincing argument for the importance of providing multiple information presentations modes, showing that only about 10% of all resource accesses were made through the traditional search interface. We have also collected some solid evidence in favor of the social navigation support.},

The redesign capitalizes on the best ideas from the existing system, which have been refined and developed to open new avenues through which digital librarians can tailor their collections.

To demonstrate this approach, we have developed the Multi-User, Information Extraction for Information Synthesis (METIS) System.

The study shows that satisfaction is greater and performance is significantly better on specific and generic information retrieval tasks from news broadcasts when transcripts are available for search. Additional runs with 7 expert users reveal different novice and expert interaction patterns with the video library interface, helping explain the novices' lack of success with image search and visual feature browsing for visual information needs. Analysis of TRECVID visual features well suited for particular tasks provides additional insights into the role of automated feature classification for digital image and video libraries.},

As known item queries search for specific resources, it is important to manage them differently from other search types, such as area searches. We study how to identify known item queries in the context of a large academic institution's online public access catalog (OPAC), in which queries are issued via a simple keyword interface. We also examine how to recognize when a known item query has retrieved the item in question. Our approach combines techniques in machine learning, language modeling and machine translation evaluation metrics to build a classifier capable of distinguishing known item queries and correctly classifies titles for whether they are the known item sought with an 80% and 95% correlation to human performance, respectively on each task. To our knowledge, this is the first report of such work, which has the potential to streamline the user interface of both OPACs and digital libraries in support of known item searches.},

abstract = {An ever-increasing amount of information on the Web today is available only through search interfaces: the users have to type in a set of keywords in a search form in order to access the pages from certain Web sites. These pages are often referred to as the Hidden Web or the Deep Web. Since there are no static links to the Hidden Web pages, search engines cannot discover and index such pages and thus do not return them in the results. However, according to recent studies, the content provided by many Hidden Web sites is often of very high quality and can be extremely valuable to many users.In this paper, we study how we can build an effective Hidden Web crawler that can autonomously discover and download pages from the Hidden Web. Since the only "entry point" to a Hidden Web site is a query interface, the main challenge that a Hidden Web crawler has to face is how to automatically generate meaningful queries to issue to the site. Here, we provide a theoretical framework to investigate the query generation problem for the Hidden Web and we propose effective policies for generating queries automatically. Our policies proceed iteratively, issuing a different query in every iteration. We experimentally evaluate the effectiveness of these policies on 4 real Hidden Web sites and our results are very promising. For instance, in one experiment, one of our policies downloaded more than 90% of a Hidden Web site (that contains 14 million documents) after issuing fewer than 100 queries.},

The project's technical architecture and unique publishing model create a teaching context where students move easily between primary and secondary source material and between authored environments and independent research, and raise specific issues with regard to metadata, object referral, rights, and exporting content. The model also addresses the loss of provenance and catalog information for digital objects embedded in "born-digital" publications. The DART project presents a practical methodology to combine repository and publication that is both exportable and discipline-neutral.},

According to the results on a study of user requirements, we have designed tools to provide researchers with innovative ways for accessing the digital manuscripts, sharing, and transferring knowledge in a collaborative environment. We have found that the results of scientific research on the relationships between images of manuscripts produced over the centuries can be rendered explicit by using annotations. For this purpose, a taxonomy for linking annotation is introduced, together with a conceptual schema which represents annotations and links them to digital objects.},

abstract = {Users of modern digital libraries (DLs) can keep themselves up-to-date by searching and browsing their favorite collections, or more conveniently by resorting to an alerting service. The alerting service notifies its clients about new or changed documents. Proprietary and mediating alerting services fail to fluidly integrate information from differing collections. This paper analyses the conceptual requirements of this much-sought after service for digital libraries. We demonstrate that the differing concepts of digital libraries and its underlying technical design has extensive influence (a) the expectations, needs and interests of users regarding an alerting service, and (b) on the technical possibilities of the implementation of the service. Our findings will show that the range of issues surrounding alerting services for digital libraries, their design and use is greater than one may anticipate. We also show that, conversely, the requirements for an alerting service have considerable impact on the concepts of DL design. Our findings should be of interest for librarians as well as system designers. We highlight and discuss the far-reaching implications for the design of, and interaction with, libraries. This paper discusses the lessons learned from building such a distributed alerting service. We present our prototype implementation as a proof-of-concept for an alerting service for open DL software.},

abstract = {Recommender systems can provide valuable services in a digital library environment, as demonstrated by its commercial success in book, movie, and music industries. One of the most commonly-used and successful recommendation algorithms is collaborative filtering, which explores the correlations within user-item interactions to infer user interests and preferences. However, the recommendation quality of collaborative filtering approaches is greatly limited by the data sparsity problem. To alleviate this problem we have previously proposed graph-based algorithms to explore transitive user-item associations. In this paper, we extend the idea of analyzing user-item interactions as graphs and employ link prediction approaches proposed in the recent network modeling literature for making collaborative filtering recommendations. We have adapted a wide range of linkage measures for making recommendations. Our preliminary experimental results based on a book recommendation dataset show that some of these measures achieved significantly better performance than standard collaborative filtering algorithms.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a machine learning approach to title extraction from general documents. By general documents, we mean documents that can belong to any one of a number of specific genres, including presentations, book chapters, technical papers, brochures, reports, and letters. Previously, methods have been proposed mainly for title extraction from research papers. It has not been clear whether it could be possible to conduct automatic title extraction from general documents. As a case study, we consider extraction from Office including Word and PowerPoint. In our approach, we annotate titles in sample documents (for Word and PowerPoint respectively) and take them as training data, train machine learning models, and perform title extraction using the trained models. Our method is unique in that we mainly utilize formatting information such as font size as features in the models. It turns out that the use of formatting information can lead to quite accurate extraction from general documents. Precision and recall for title extraction from Word is 0.810 and 0.837 respectively, and precision and recall for title extraction from PowerPoint is 0.875 and 0.895 respectively in an experiment on intranet data. Other important new findings in this work include that we can train models in one domain and apply them to another domain, and more surprisingly we can even train models in one language and apply them to another language. Moreover, we can significantly improve search ranking results in document retrieval by using the extracted titles.},

We present a de-centralized approach and system implementation (named MACCI) for text classification using a multi-agent framework. Experiments are conducted to compare our multi-agent approach with a centralized approach. The results show multi-agent classification can achieve promising classification results while maintaining its other advantages.},

No sooner have users' needs been identified and supported than they change. This paper evaluates the changing information requirements of users through their 'information journey' in two different domains (health and academia). In-depth analysis of findings from interviews, focus groups and observations of 150 users have identified three stages to this journey: information initiation, facilitation (or gathering) and interpretation. The study shows that, although digital libraries are supporting aspects of users' information facilitation, there are still requirements for them to better support users' overall information work in context. Users are poorly supported in the initiation phase, as they recognize their information needs, especially with regard to resource awareness; in this context, interactive press-alerts are discussed. Some users (especially clinicians and patients) also require support in the interpretation of information, both satisfying themselves that the information is trustworthy and understanding what it means for a particular individual.},

Instead of using face recognition techniques, the system leverages automatically available context, like the time and location where the photos were taken.Based on time and location, the system automatically computes event and location groupings of photos. As the user annotates some of the identities of people in their collection, patterns of re-occurrence and co-occurrence of different people in different locations and events emerge. The system uses these patterns to generate label suggestions for identities that were not yet annotated. These suggestions can greatly accelerate the process of manual annotation and improve the quality of retrieval from the collection.We obtained ground-truth identity annotation for four different photo albums, and used them to test our system. The system proved effective, making very accurate label suggestions, even when the number of suggestions for each photo was limited to five names, and even when only a small subset of the photos was annotated.},

abstract = {Searching photo libraries can be made more satisfying and successful if search results are presented in a way that allows users to gain an overview of the photo categories. Since photo layouts on computer displays are the primary way that users get an overview, we propose a novel approach to show more photos in meaningful groupings. Photo layouts can be linear strips, or zoomable three dimensional arrangements, but the most common form is the two-dimensional grid. This paper introduces a novel bi-level hierarchical layout with motivating examples. In a bi-level hierarchy, one region is designated for primary content - an image, text, or combination. Adjacent to that region, groups of photos are placed radially in an ordered fashion, such that the relationship of the single primary region to its many secondary regions is apparent. A compelling aspect is the interactive experience in which the layout is dynamically resized, allowing users to rapidly, incrementally, and reversibly alter the dimensions and content. It can accommodate hundreds of photos in dozens of regions, can be customized in a corner or center layout, and can scale from an element on a web page to a large poster size. On typical displays (1024 x 1280 or 1200 x 1600 pixels), bi-level radial quantum layouts can conveniently accommodate 2-20 regions with tens or hundreds of photos per region.},

The DWEL project involved formal and informal educators in the development of its collection, and experienced problems at the start of the project with getting these educators to complete their cataloguing tasks. The research showed that despite having spent several days in face-to-face workshops, the project's PIs and the educators had different tacit understandings of what digital libraries were, that were impeding the project's organizational communication and workflow. I describe how these differences were identified and analyzed, and subsequently addressed and mediated through the design and development of online tools that acted as boundary objects between the PIs and the educators.},

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the findings of an in-depth observational study of reading and within-document navigation and add to these findings the results of a second analysis of how people read comparable digital materials on the screen, given limited navigational functionality. We chose periodicals as our initial foil since they represent a type of material that invites many different kinds of reading and strategies for navigation. Using multiple sources of evidence from the data, we first characterize readers' navigation strategies and specific practices as they make their way through the magazines. We then focus on two observed phenomena that occur when people read paper magazines, but are absent in their digital equivalents: the lightweight navigation that readers use unselfconsciously when they are reading a particular article and the approximate navigation readers engage in when they flip multiple pages at a time. Because page-turning is so basic and seems deceptively simple, we dissect the turn of a page, and use it to illustrate the importance and invisibility of lightweight navigation. Finally, we explore the significance of our results for navigational interfaces to digital library materials.},

abstract = {Most digital libraries (DLs) necessarily focus on the complex issues that arise when library collections are freed from their physical anchors in buildings and on paper. Typical investigations look at supporting adults in work settings, such as school or research. Much less attention has been paid to younger generations of readers. As ever more digital venues cater to youngsters' attentions, a role for the DL as a catalyst of social interactions around traditional literacy practices begins to take shape. Based on prior research on annotation systems, constructive hypertexts, and computer support for cooperative work coupled with our contextual inquiries with children, we have developed a prototype for a digital book that supports social interactions through annotations. By placing and sharing notes, groups of readers transform the book from an artifact into a living record of communal experience. A system of support for marks and notes in the context of reading for pleasure can turn the digital library book into a "practiced place," a location that is not only accessible, but also welcoming, engaging and supportive of the activities children are interested in and therefore likely to engage in. Our experience with Alph, a prototype book-reader supporting a range of rhetorical marks and note-writing, suggests that future DLs need to look beyond augmenting work-based literacy practices by creating dynamic and social reading environments.},

At the same time, well-structured full-text XML transcriptions of printed works are becoming increasingly available.

This paper revisits the article in light of current technological and social trends. It notes that Bush's argument centered around the problem of information overload and observes that in the intervening years, despite massive technological innovation, the problem has only become more extreme. It goes on to argue that today's manifestation of information overload will require not just better management of information but the creation of space and time for thinking and reflection, an objective that is consonant with Bush's original aims.},

The evaluation tool is based on and informed by the metadata created and maintained by librarian experts at the INFOMINE Project, and uses different metrics to evaluate different metadata fields. In this paper, we describe the form and function of common metadata fields, and identify appropriate performance measures for these fields. The automatic metadata assignment tools in the iVia virtual library software are described, and their performance is measured. Finally, we discuss the limitations of automatic metadata evaluation, and cases where we choose to ignore its evidence in favor of human judgment.},

abstract = {Some large scale topical digital libraries, such as CiteSeer, harvest online academic documents by crawling open-access archives, university and author homepages, and authors' self-submissions. While these approaches have so far built reasonable size libraries, they can suffer from having only a portion of the documents from specific publishing venues. We propose to use alternative online resources and techniques that maximally exploit other resources to build the complete document collection of any given publication venue.We investigate the feasibility of using publication metadata to guide the crawler towards authors' homepages to harvest what is missing from a digital library collection. We collect a real-world dataset from two Computer Science publishing venues, involving a total of 593 unique authors over a time frame of 1998 to 2004. We then identify the missing papers that are not indexed by CiteSeer. Using a fully automatic heuristic-based system that has the capability of locating authors' homepages and then using focused crawling to download the desired papers, we demonstrate that it is practical to harvest using a focused crawler academic papers that are missing from our digital library. Our harvester achieves a performance with an average recall level of 0.82 overall and 0.75 for those missing documents. Evaluation of the crawler's performance based on the harvest rate shows definite advantages over other crawling approaches and consistently outperforms a defined baseline crawler on a number of measures.},

abstract = {Constructing a Chinese digital library, especially for a historical article archiving, is often bothered by the small character sets supported by the current computer systems. This paper is aimed at resolving the unencoded character problem with a practical and composite approach for Chinese digital libraries. The proposed approach consists of the glyph expression model, the glyph structure database, and supporting tools. With this approach, the following problems can be resolved. First, the extensibility of Chinese characters can be preserved. Second, it would be as easy to generate, input, display, and search unencoded characters as existing ones. Third, it is compatible with existing encoding schemes that most computers use.This approach has been utilized by organizations and projects in various application domains including archeology, linguistics, ancient texts, calligraphy and paintings, and stone and bronze rubbings. For example, in Academia Sinica, a very large full-text database of ancient texts called Scripta Sinica has been created using this approach. The Union Catalog of National Digital Archives Project (NDAP) dealt with the unencoded characters encountered when merging the metadata of 12 different thematic domains from various organizations. Also, in Bronze Inscriptions Research Team (BIRT) of Academia Sinica, 3,459 Bronze Inscriptions were added, which is very helpful to the education and research in historic linguistics.},

This can produce name ambiguity which can affect the performance of document retrieval, web search, and database integration, and may cause improper attribution of credit. Proposed here is an unsupervised learning approach using K-way spectral clustering that disambiguates authors in citations. The approach utilizes three types of citation attributes: co-author names, paper titles, and publication venue titles 2. The approach is illustrated with 16 name datasets with citations collected from the DBLP database bibliography and author home pages and shows that name disambiguation can be achieved using these citation attributes.},

Vush"). Our study is based on a scalable two-step framework, where step 1 is to substantially reduce the number of candidates via blocking, and step 2 is to measure the distance of two names via coauthor information. Combining four blocking methods and seven distance measures on four data sets, we present extensive experimental results, and identify combinations that are scalable and effective to disambiguate author names in citations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we attempt to give spatial semantics to web pages by assigning them place names. The entire assignment task is divided into three sub-problems, namely place name extraction, place name disambiguation and place name assignment. We propose our approaches to address these sub-problems. In particular, we have modified GATE, a well-known named entity extraction software, to perform place name extraction using a US Census gazetteer. A rule-based place name disambiguation method and a place name assignment method capable of assigning place names to web page segments have also been proposed. We have evaluated our proposed disambiguation and assignment methods on a web page collection referenced by the DLESE metadata collection. The results returned by our methods are compared with manually disambiguated place names and place name assignment. It is shown that our proposed place name disambiguation method works well for geo/geo ambiguities. The preliminary results of our place name assignment method indicate promising results given the existence of geo/non-geo ambiguities among place names.},

abstract = {In 1999, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR) Programs and Science's Signal Transduction Knowledge Environment (STKE) --- with 11 other professional societies and coalitions for biological sciences -established the BiosciEdNet (BEN) Collaborative with limited funding from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) National Sciences Education Digital Library Program (NSDL). Since its inception, BEN has grown from its original 11 to 24 Collaborators.Currently, the digital library collections of BEN Collaborators provide a rich array of materials for undergraduate biological sciences educators, including ones that prepare K-12 teachers. The materials that users find via the BEN portal are unique in several ways.First, BEN resources have been reviewed by the individual societies for standards of quality and accuracy. Although each BEN collaborator has unique review criteria, overall users find resources that are scientifically accurate and educationally sound.Second, the BEN portal provides an extended set of search parameters to allow more productive searches by users.Finally, due to the collaborative establishment of its metadata structure, the user can easily conduct productive interdisciplinary searches across the diverse biological sciences topics covered by the BEN Collaborators.In general contributors can submit resources through the digital library of a BEN collaborator or directly to the BEN portal. Submissions to the BEN portal are sent to the Collaborators that are maintaining discipline specific resources. AAAS catalogs submissions that do not fit discipline specific Collaborators. Contributors enter the cataloging information at the time of submission and a BEN digital library provider or AAAS validates the metadata.Biological sciences educators, particularly in high schools and community colleges and regional comprehensive institutions, have student bodies diverse in every respect - learning styles and ability, geography, economics, race, gender, physical disabilities, and experience. To this end, BEN Collaborators are building digital collections that are inclusive of all educators and students.Biological sciences educators, particularly in high schools and community colleges and regional comprehensive institutions, have student bodies diverse in every respect - learning styles and ability, geography, economics, race, gender, physical disabilities, and experience. To this end, BEN Collaborators are building digital collections that are inclusive of all educators and students. In summary, BEN has already developed tools and services that can be shared to leverage technologies across societies, coalitions, and collections affilaites. BEN has a documentation site --- http://www.biosciednet.org/project_site/ that includes all its technical standards and specifications:BEN metadata Repository Database Specification;XML specification and schema for transferring BEN LOM metadata; Search Engine Specifications;Metadata Harvester Software Specifications using the OAI Protocol; andCataloging Software Specifications.For long-term sustainability the BEN Collaborative goal is to design and develop digital library collections that are valued by the members of professional societies, thereby eventually ensuring inclusion in the ongoing operating budgets of societies. Some societies are already providing in- kind support for staff and dollars for development.},

abstract = {The Digital Library for Earth System Education (DLESE) Evaluation Services Core (ESC) team has been established to:Provide evaluation support for DLESE core team activities.Establish pilot studies with key user audiences (e.g. K-12 teachers and undergraduate faculty),Implement studies designed to better characterize DLESE users and user needs.Offer evaluation support and opportunities for the DLESE community through workshops and grant opportunities.This poster is intended to describe the breadth and depth of our work; selected aspects of our work are described in accompanying posters.One of the key roles for the DLESE Evaluation Services team is to provide evaluation support for major DLESE activities and initiatives. The Evaluation team focuses upon major activities such as conference-based outreach, the DLESE Ambassadors program, DLESE Data Workshops, state-based digital teaching units, and the developing scientific accuracy review process. Work within these projects allows us to not only provide needed formative evaluation information to DLESE teams, but offer study sites to better understand user needs. For example, the California pilot study to develop state-based digital teaching units provides information to support that project, but also gives us insight into how teachers choose resources, what challenges exist for teachers using digital units, and what opportunities exist for DLESE to further an Earth system perspective.The DLESE vision is to serve a broad and diverse group of users; however, our initial pilot work is focused upon two key intended audiences: undergraduate faculty and K-12 teachers. Tom Reeves and students seek to understand the needs of undergraduate students and faculty who use DLESE. Their work has brought new immediacy to the development of hybrid search mechanisms within DLESE that will accommodate not only novice learner search terms but specialized scientific terms used by more advanced learners.Pilot studies within K-12 classrooms are providing new understanding of the ways DLESE can contribute to K-12 teachers' needs. In addition to the digital teaching unit study mentioned previously, the ATLAS team seeks to understand the ways in which a reviewed collection, the Digital Water Education Library (DWEL), enables instruction in Jamestown, VA classrooms and what opportunities exist to increase the utility of such collections.For the first time, all users of the DLESE search and browse system are being asked to voluntarily state the purpose of their visit, their user role and their geographic location. Many choose to offer more detail on the nature of their search and their experiences with DLESE. Results from this survey are described in a separate poster. Over time, this survey will be used to ask different questions of users about their experiences with DLESE.The DLESE ESC seeks to build the evaluation capacity of the DLESE community through several means. Evaluation workshops are offered at scientific conferences and DLESE meetings, team members review and comment on the evaluation components of geoscience education proposals, and the Evaluation Toolkit thematic collection for geoscience education evaluation is available in DLESE. A new minigrants program is under development, to provide seed funds for evaluation projects of interest to DLESE.},

abstract = {The benefits of digitizing library collections are important and diverse. Patrons outside traditional geographic boundaries can be served along side local patrons. Access to local history, a vibrant part of many library holdings, and original, rare, and/or valuable materials can be greatly expanded. However, the practice of digitization can fall short of its promise due to poor planning and a lack of digitization skills. Moreover, quality digitization training is not always accessible or feasible given the time, expense, and staff limitations for many institutions.The Basics and Beyond digitization training program offers a novel solution for this problem. Funded by an Institute of Museum and Library Services National Leadership grant and administered by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Library, the Illinois State Library, and the Illinois Heritage Association, Basics and Beyond offers three digitization training options to cultural heritage institutions: one-day on-site workshops, three-week online training, and three-week online training followed by a hands-on workshop.The content of the workshops provides participants with an overview of the digitization process. Topics presented include: project planning, equipment selection, metadata, and standards and best practices for digitizing materials. The online courses expand greatly on the material covered in the workshops and provide the participants with an in-depth look at the digitization process. They cover material such as using digitization as a preservation practice, selection of materials for digitization, project planning, metadata schemes, equipment needs, and standards and best practices. The online courses are accessible to anyone with a Web connection and provide institutions around the world with access to innovative digitization training. The online training is affordable to most organizations, and its asynchronous format allows librarians and staff to easily fit the course into their work schedules.The effectiveness of the workshops and courses has been determined by participant evaluations conducted both during the workshops and courses and several months after completion. Evaluations include pre- and post-course surveys, essay questions, and quizzes as well as follow-up telephone interviews conducted several months after course or workshop completion. Evaluations are designed to determine the quality of training and to what degree the training assisted in the implementation and practice of newly formed or revamped digital projects.Evaluation results have been overwhelmingly positive for all courses and workshops. Over 200 people have taken the one-day workshop. A nine-question pre-workshop quiz indicates that 80% of participants missed three or more questions before being exposed to the workshop material. As expected, participants score significantly higher when given the same quiz after the workshop-only 14% missed more than two questions. Over 130 people have taken one of the online courses. In addition to quizzes, objective evaluation is also done in the online courses and show that students are able to apply the information they learn in "real world" situations, such as equipment purchases and metadata creation. Evaluations and participants' comments indicate that the workshops and courses are highly successful and have accomplished the chief goal of the project-to educate cultural heritage institution professionals on the best practices for digitization to ensure the success and longevity of their digitized collections.},

abstract = {The Digital Reference Electronic Warehouse (DREW) project is a collection of digital reference transactions from different services and different communication channels that live in a single space. Reference services work with DREW to submit transactions using the DREW schema, which is conceptually similar to the MARC record format for bibliographic materials. Researchers can then receive records from DREW to improve our knowledge of digital reference. These researchers then use the results of their research to create tools, reports, and models based on the DREW schema, and place those items into a management information system (MIS). The services can then access the MIS and apply those tools to their own archives. The result is that services can benefit directly and rapidly from research, and are then more likely to continue their involvement with the project. This infrastructure creates a collaborative space where researchers and practitioners can benefit from the work of each other and aid us in advancing the field of digital reference.},

abstract = {University Archives and museums traditional haven't been viewed as a bastion for innovative technology development, but for a number of years now, it has been university archives and museums that have made the most significant moves towards adopting and utilizing XML-based metadata schemas for bibliographic description. Unlike the general library profession, which has been able to rely on MARC throughout the years as its primary vehicle for bibliographic description, museums and archives have traditionally had no formal metadata structure to create portable metadata records. It is likely that for this reason that museums and archives were quick to embrace EAD (Encoded Archival Description) as the defacto method for creating portable finding aids. However, while EAD has provided a vehicle for portability, institutions have found that actually using these finding aids within a database or for display can be quite daunting. Often times, individual institutions creating finding aids have no idea how to make use of them within their institution's current infrastructure - often relying on larger organizations like the California Digital Library or the Northwest Digital Archive (NWDA) to provide a vehicle for distributing their materials. And while the consortia method of distribution offers a number of benefits, it does come at a cost of individual institutional identity.Oregon State University currently is one of the participating libraries in the NWDA. This has been a tremendous relationship in terms of creating a resource that provides exposure to a wide number of collections at OSU in relation to other archive collections at other participating NWDA libraries. However, the cost has been a loss of identity in regards to how OSU presents its finding aids to its own user community. As a result, the OSU Archives was creating multiple finding aids - an EAD record for use within the NWDA and a static HTML page for use at OSU.In January 2005, OSU Valley Library started work on a lite-weight EAD repository with the following goals in mind: 1) that the solution be portable to other NWDA institutions, 2) be built on top of current open source technologies (like MySQL, PHP, etc.), 3) provided a method for federated searching of the repository and 4) that it be flexible enough to eventually include other metadata schemas. This lite-weight EAD repository is the first product of this development, which uses PHP, MySQL and Saxon to produce an easily replicable database environment for querying and serving EAD records on the web. Likewise, by building SRU functionality into the EAD repository - this lite-weight solution can also expose it's own resources to the outside world through a standard query and retrieval language.This poster session will discuss the method used to generate a lite-weight search and discovery solution and demonstrate the resulting finished product. This poster session will also discuss the implications of this type of repository solution - particularly the ability for institutions to quickly move EAD elements into a searchable, web-based environment as well as the ability for institutions to include their EAD repositories in a federated search infrastructure using a standard search and retrieval language.},

abstract = {As the size of data and files increases, digital repositories face a growing problem in content distribution. High quality multimedia and research data sets can range from 100's of megabytes to over a terabyte. Web-based digital repositories may exper ience a substantial increase in operating and bandwidth costs when providing materials to the public. Peer-to-peer networks are sometimes suggested as an alternative to traditional centralized repositories [2]. However, critical issues such as data inte grity, access control, and content availability exist when using peer-to-peer technologies [1].Osprey (http://osprey.ibiblio.org) addresses these problems by combining a flexible metadata management system with the BitTorrent peer-to-peer protocol. A Web database application provides searching and browsing of collection objects, and the peer-to-peer component lowers the bandwidth costs by employing distributed downloading. The Permaseed application supplies reliable, persistent peer-to-peer access to files in the digital repository.},

abstract = {Many have suggested the use of genres to ameliorate the problem of web search, e.g. [1,3,4,5,6,7]. A central issue in the implementation of this idea is the choice of genres to be used as web page descriptors. Several studies have explored user terminology for and recognition of several types of digital documents, e.g., various types of office documents [8], personal homepages [2], and pages returned by user web searches [4,6]. This poster reports on a series of three user studies with the purpose of developing a genre "palette" for use in web retrieval. Pages viewed by participants in these studies were limited to the edu domain, as in [5].In the first study, three participants, an information technology professional, an oncology social worker and a computer science professor, in separate sessions, were given a stack of 102 web page printouts, and were asked to separate the pages into piles according to genre. They were also asked to name the genres by writing the names on sticky notes and placing them on the piles. After the piles were complete, participants were asked to provide a short, one or two sentence, description of each genre, and then to describe the page characteristics that led them to place a page in that genre.A list of 49 genre names and definitions was developed from the work of the three participants, keeping the terminology as similar as possible to the original, while combining definitions which were nearly identical in wording. In a second user study, each of ten participants was given this list of genre name/definition pairs, the same stack of 102 printed web pages (arranged in a different random order for each participant), and a data collection form on which he/she recorded a genre for each web page. For each of the 102 web pages, the participant was given the option to either write a number from the list corresponding to a genre/definition pair which best described the page; or to provide his/her own suggestion for a genre name and definition, if none of those in the list seemed adequate. The participants were drawn from a convenience sample of approximately 10 college graduates of various occupations. Given that participants chose genres from a list of 48, many of which were extremely similar in nature, the resulting level of agreement (half or more of the participants agreeing on one genre for a given page in 60% of the instances) is quite acceptable. A set of five principles for creating a genre palette from individuals' sortings was developed. Based on those principles, the original list was trimmed down to 18 genres.The third study was an online experiment in which 257 college, faculty, students, and staff from two schools categorized a new set of 55 pages using the 18 genres. On average, over 70% agreed on the genre of each page. No study of this scale is known to report user recognition of web genres. This user validation is necessary to set upper bounds for machine categorization efforts. Also, because genre is usually considered to be "socially defined", genre studies using researcher-defined a priori categories (e.g., [5]) may not be able to show genres' usefulness for web search.Interestingly, the genres in this palette, although developed independently, are similar to 7 of 8 Internet-wide genres based on user input reported in [7], and similar to 8 of 11 Internet-wide genres as reported in [3]. Based on these observations, one might infer that some substantial amount of genre knowledge exists among users, even from different cultures (in this case, the United States, Germany, and Sweden).},

abstract = {The field of ethnomusicology depends heavily on ethnographic research or "fieldwork" by researchers that often involves the capture and subsequent analysis of audio and video information, to help document and understand the musical practices of people all over the world. Ethnomusicologists have used a variety of recording technologies over the years to capture film and video, and much of this footage lies in researchers' offices and home basements. No systematic mechanism exists for preserving and providing access to this video for other students and scholars.The Ethnomusicological Video for Instruction and Analysis Digital Archive (EVIADA) [1] is a multi-year collaborative project between Indiana University and the University of Michigan to create a digital archive for field video recordings captured by ethnomusicology researchers. This digital archive will serve both to preserve this content for future generations of scholars and also to provide a resource to support teaching and learning in ethnomusicology, anthropology, and related disciplines. The creation of EVIADA has involved a unique collaboration between ethnomusicologists, librarians, archivists, and technologists in carrying out all stages of the project, including video digitization, metadata creation, and system and user interface design.As part of the project, we are developing several software tools: The Segmentation/Annotation Tool is a Java Swing application written using Apple's QuickTime for Java API. It allows an ethnomusicologist who is contributing a video collection to the archive to divide that video into a hierarchy of segments, attach free-text descriptions and controlled vocabulary terms to each segment, and output this information in the form of a METS [3] XML document incorporating MODS [2] descriptive metadata records. This METS document can then be ingested into downstream archival and delivery systems. We hope to evolve this software into a more general-purpose tool for the creation of METS documents for video objects.We are also building a web-based user interface on top of the Fedora digital repository system to allow users to search and browse video content in the collection via the descriptive metadata and annotations, making appropriate use of controlled vocabulary thesauri to increase search recall.},

abstract = {The problem of overlapping markup hierarchies, first mentioned in the context of SGML, often occurs in XML text encoding applications for humanities. Previous solutions to the problem rely on manual maintenance of the markup and address only the problem of representing overlapping features in XML, leaving the issues of automated maintenance and querying open. As a consequence, traditional XML tools are of little practical use when dealing with overlapping markup. In this work we demonstrate the implementation of our framework for management of concurrent XML hierarchies from a computer science perspective. We propose an underlying model, data structures, APIs, and algorithms so that the most of the burden of managing concurrent XML hierarchies would be born by the software.},

It has come to the fore in recent years; there are important applications like database schema integration and, more recently, digital library merging of heterogeneous data. Previous studies have approached the schema mapping process either from algorithmic or visualization perspectives, with few integrating both. With Schema Mapper we demonstrate a semi-automatic tool for schema integration that combines a novel visual interface with an algorithm-based recommendation engine. Schemas are visualized as hyperbolic trees (see Fig. 1), thus allowing more schema nodes to be displayed at one time. Matches to selections are recommended to the user, which makes the mapping operation easier and faster.},

Carrying out valid evaluations of digital libraries in a timely and efficient manner is the focus of this tutorial. Why is evaluation of digital libraries so important? Each year sees the introduction of new digital libraries promoted as valuable resources for education and other needs. Yet systematic evaluation of the implementation and efficacy of these digital library systems is often lacking. This tutorial is specifically designed to establish evaluation as a key strategy throughout the design, development, and implementation of digital libraries. The tutorial focuses on a decision-oriented model for evaluating digital libraries using multiple methods such as: service evaluation, usability evaluation, information retrieval, biometrics evaluation, transaction log analysis survey methods, interviews and focus groups, observations, and experimental methods. Participants in this tutorial will learn how to implement models and procedures for evaluating digital libraries at all levels of education. The tutorial includes presentations with actual case studies that are focused on a variety of digital library evaluation strategies. Participants will also receive a copy of Evaluating Digital Libraries: A User-Friendly Guide.},

abstract = {Concerns about intellectual property rights are a significant barrier to the practice of scholarly self-archiving in institutional and other types of digital repositories. This introductory level, half-day tutorial will demystify the journal copyright transfer agreements (CTAs) that often are the source of these rights concerns of scholars. In addition, participants will be introduced to the deposit processes of self-archiving in an interdisciplinary repository and open access archive (OAA), such as DLIST, Digital Library for Information Science and Technology.},

abstract = {This tutorial will cover a set of Standards and defacto Standards that can play a role in the design and development of Digital Library applications. The Standards that will be discussed are the ISO MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration, the ISO MPEG-21 Digital Item Identification, the ISO MPEG-21 Digital Item Processing, the Open Archives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting, the Internet Archive ARC file format, the NISO OpenURL Framework for Context-Sensitive Services, and the proposed info URI scheme. The tutorial will discuss these Standards by illustrating how they have been used in the context of the aDORe Digital Object repository. aDORe [8] has been designed and implemented for ingesting, storing, and accessing a vast collection of Digital Objects at the Research Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Since aDORe is not a product, the tutorial is not a product advertisement. Rather, it is an opportunity for designers and developers to learn about Standards that can help addressing real-life challenges in DL design and development, and help increase interoperability across systems. The presenters are actively involved in all of the standardization efforts that are discussed.},

abstract = {The preservation of digital entities requires data management technologies that are provided by digital libraries and data grids. Digital libraries provide standard data organization and presentation mechanisms. Data grids provide support for infrastructure independence, the ability to incorporate new technology as it becomes available. Preservation environments integrate these technologies to assure the authenticity and integrity of digital entities. We will describe the concepts behind preservation and illustrate the concepts with three data preservation environments based on the NARA research prototype persistent archive, the NHPRC Persistent Archive Testbed, and the NSF NSDL persistent archive.},

abstract = {This year's Networked Knowledge Organization Systems (NKOS) workshop built on seven years of workshops in the U.S. and Europe on issues regarding enabling networked knowledge organization systems (KOS), such as classification systems, thesauri, gazetteers, taxonomies, and ontologies, to support the description, retrieval, and use of diverse information resources. Now, many efforts are underway to research the issues and implement solutions to the challenges of networking and integrating KOS across somewhat isolated domains: indexing services and thesaurus builders; computer scientists and systems integrators; ontologists; taxonomists; and others. In many cases, requirements to solve these integration issues have become mission critical; the need to support computational, programmatic integration to handle masses of data from independent sources is pushing the research and development agenda. The need to move forward to meet these challenges while at the same time applying the best practices and "wisdom" developed through years of practical experience is acute.The JCDL-NKOS workshop for 2005 brought together researchers and implementers from diverse international communities who are developing new models, conducting research, and implementing practical solutions for networking KOS and integrating the associated information and data resources.},
