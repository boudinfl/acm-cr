abstract = {Every time a system places an ad, presents a search ranking, or makes a recommendation, we can think about this as an intervention for which we can observe the user's response (e.g. click, dwell time, purchase). Such logged intervention data is one of the most plentiful types of data available, as it can be recorded from a variety of systems (e.g., search engines, recommender systems, ad placement) at little cost. However, this data provides only partial-information feedback -- aka "bandit feedback" -- limited to the particular intervention chosen by the system. We don't get to see how the user would have responded, if we had chosen a different intervention. This makes learning from logged bandit feedback substantially different from conventional supervised learning, where "correct" predictions together with a loss function provide full-information feedback. It is also different from online learning in the bandit setting, since the algorithm does not assume interactive control of the interventions. In this talk, I will explore learning methods for batch learning from logged bandit feedback (BLBF). Following the inductive principle of Counterfactual Risk Minimization for BLBF, this talk presents an approach to training linear models and deep networks from propensity-scored bandit feedback.},

abstract = {In this talk, I'll cover three areas our team at DeepMind have been working on in recommender systems. First, in recommender systems often we observed delayed signals such as longer term user engagement, user conversions, and delays may simply result from logging/data pipeline issues in online learning models. How do we learn from these delayed signals efficiently? Finally, due to positional, contextual biases, top-k ranking may not give us the optimal slate for a user. How do we learn the joint distribution of slates and user responses so that we can directly generate the slate?},

abstract = {Recommender systems have been studied extensively due to their practical use in real-world scenarios. Despite this, generating effective recommendations with sparse user ratings remains a challenge. Side information has been widely utilized to address rating sparsity Existing recommendation models that use side information are linear and, hence, have restricted expressiveness. Deep learning has been used to capture non-linearities by learning deep item representations from side information but as side information is high-dimensional, existing deep models tend to have large input dimensionality, which dominates their overall size. This makes them difficult to train, especially with insufficient inputs.Rather than learning item representations, in this paper, we propose to learn feature representations through deep learning from side information. Learning feature representations ensures a sufficient number of inputs to train a deep network. To achieve this, we propose to simultaneously recover user ratings and side information, by using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Specifically, user ratings and side information are encoded and decoded collectively through the same inference network and generation network. This is possible as both user ratings and side information are associated with items. To account for the heterogeneity of user ratings and side information, the final layer of the generation network follows different distributions. The proposed model is easy to implement and efficient to optimize and is shown to outperform state-of-the-art top-N recommendation methods that use side information.},

abstract = {In recent years, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been shown to be highly effective in both standard collaborative filtering applications and extensions such as incorporation of implicit feedback. We extend VAEs to collaborative filtering with side information, for instance when ratings are combined with explicit text feedback from the user. Instead of using a user-agnostic standard Gaussian prior, we incorporate user-dependent priors in the latent VAE space to encode users' preferences as functions of the review text. Taking into account both the rating and the text information to represent users in this multimodal latent space is promising to improve recommendation quality. Our proposed model is shown to outperform the existing VAE models for collaborative filtering (up to 29.41% relative improvement in ranking metric) along with other baselines that incorporate both user ratings and text for item recommendation.},

abstract = {News recommender systems are aimed to personalize users experiences and help them to discover relevant articles from a large and dynamic search space. Therefore, news domain is a challenging scenario for recommendations, due to its sparse user profiling, fast growing number of items, accelerated item's value decay, and users preferences dynamic shift.Some promising results have been recently achieved by the usage of Deep Learning techniques on Recommender Systems, specially for item's feature extraction and for session-based recommendations with Recurrent Neural Networks.In this paper, it is proposed an instantiation of the CHAMELEON -- a Deep Learning Meta-Architecture for News Recommender Systems. This architecture is composed of two modules, the first responsible to learn news articles representations, based on their text and metadata, and the second module aimed to provide session-based recommendations using Recurrent Neural Networks.The recommendation task addressed in this work is next-item prediction for users sessions: "what is the next most likely article a user might read in a session?"Users sessions context is leveraged by the architecture to provide additional information in such extreme cold-start scenario of news recommendation. Users' behavior and item features are both merged in an hybrid recommendation approach.A temporal offline evaluation method is also proposed as a complementary contribution, for a more realistic evaluation of such task, considering dynamic factors that affect global readership interests like popularity, recency, and seasonality.Experiments with an extensive number of session-based recommendation methods were performed and the proposed instantiation of CHAMELEON meta-architecture obtained a significant relative improvement in top-n accuracy and ranking metrics (10% on Hit Rate and 13% on MRR) over the best benchmark methods.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems have been widely used to help users in finding what they are looking for thus tackling the information overload problem. After several years of research and industrial findings looking after better algorithms to improve accuracy and diversity metrics, explanation services for recommendation are gaining momentum as a tool to provide a human-understandable feedback to results computed, in most of the cases, by black-box machine learning techniques. As a matter of fact, explanations may guarantee users satisfaction, trust, and loyalty in a system. In this paper, we evaluate how different information encoded in a Knowledge Graph are perceived by users when they are adopted to show them an explanation. More precisely, we compare how the use of categorical information, factual one or a mixture of them both in building explanations, affect explanatory criteria for a recommender system. Experimental results are validated through an A/B testing platform which uses a recommendation engine based on a Semantics-Aware Autoencoder to build users profiles which are in turn exploited to compute recommendation lists and to provide an explanation.},
