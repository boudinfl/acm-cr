abstract = {While deep learning models have achieved unprecedented success in some challenging perception tasks, probabilistic graphical models are still preferred for many other tasks that require more complex inference mechanisms. To get the best of both worlds, we have been exploring a research direction called Bayesian deep learning (BDL) which seeks to tightly integrate deep learning and probabilistic graphical models within a principled probabilistic framework. In this talk, some BDL models which we have proposed recently for recommendation applications will be presented. Some follow-up work and outstanding research issues for BDL models will also be discussed.},

abstract = {Recommendations can greatly benefit from good representations of the user state at recommendation time. Recent approaches that leverage Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for session-based recommendations have shown that Deep Learning models can provide useful user representations for recommendation. However, current RNN modeling approaches summarize the user state by only taking into account the sequence of items that the user has interacted with in the past, without taking into account other essential types of context information such as the associated types of user-item interactions, the time gaps between events and the time of day for each interaction. To address this, we propose a new class of Contextual Recurrent Neural Networks for Recommendation (CRNNs) that can take into account the contextual information both in the input and output layers and modifying the behavior of the RNN by combining the context embedding with the item embedding and more explicitly, in the model dynamics, by parametrizing the hidden unit transitions as a function of context information. We compare our CRNNs approach with RNNs and non-sequential baselines and show good improvements on the next event prediction task.},

To this end, we introduce a new way to fuse modality-specific product embeddings into a joint product embedding, in order to leverage both product content information, such as textual descriptions and images, and product collaborative filtering signal. By introducing the fusion step at the very end of our architecture, we are able to train each modality separately, allowing us to keep a modular architecture that is preferable in real-world recommendation deployments. We analyze our performance on normal and hard recommendation setups such as cold-start and cross-category recommendations and achieve good performance on a large product shopping dataset.},

abstract = {Photo lineups play a significant role in the eyewitness identification process. This method is used to provide evidence in the prosecution and subsequent conviction of suspects. Unfortunately, there are many cases where lineups have led to the conviction of an innocent suspect. One of the key factors affecting the incorrect identification of a suspect is the lack of lineup fairness, i.e. that the suspect differs significantly from all other candidates. Although the process of assembling fair lineup is both highly important and time-consuming, only a handful of tools are available to simplify the task.In this paper, we describe our work towards using recommender systems for the photo lineup assembling task. We propose and evaluate two complementary methods for item-based recommendation: one based on the visual descriptors of the deep neural network, the other based on the content-based attributes of persons.The initial evaluation made by forensic technicians shows that although results favored visual descriptors over attribute-based similarity, both approaches are functional and highly diverse in terms of recommended objects. Thus, future work should involve incorporating both approaches in a single prediction method, preference learning based on the feedback from forensic technicians and recommendation of assembled lineups instead of single candidates.},

abstract = {In recent years, research has been done on applying Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) as recommender systems. Results have been promising, especially in the session-based setting where RNNs have been shown to outperform state-of-the-art models. In many of these experiments, the RNN could potentially improve the recommendations by utilizing information about the user's past sessions, in addition to its own interactions in the current session. A problem for session-based recommendation, is how to produce accurate recommendations at the start of a session, before the system has learned much about the user's current interests. We propose a novel approach that extends an RNN recommender to be able to process the user's recent sessions, in order to improve recommendations. This is done by using a second RNN to learn from recent sessions, and predict the user's interest in the current session. By feeding this information to the original RNN, it is able to improve its recommendations. Our experiments on two different datasets show that the proposed approach can significantly improve recommendations throughout the sessions, compared to a single RNN working only on the current session. The proposed model especially improves recommendations at the start of sessions, and is therefore able to deal with the cold start problem within sessions.},

abstract = {An increasing amount of digital music is being published daily. Music streaming services often ingest all available music, but this poses a challenge: how to recommend new artists for which prior knowledge is scarce? In this work we aim to address this so-called cold-start problem by combining text and audio information with user feedback data using deep network architectures. Our method is divided into three steps. First, artist embeddings are learned from biographies by combining semantics, text features, and aggregated usage data. Second, track embeddings are learned from the audio signal and available feedback data. Finally, artist and track embeddings are combined in a multimodal network. Results suggest that both splitting the recommendation problem between feature levels (i.e., artist metadata and audio track), and merging feature embeddings in a multimodal approach improve the accuracy of the recommendations.},

abstract = {In this work, we attempt to ameliorate the impact of data sparsity in the context of session-based recommendation. Specifically, we seek to devise a machine learning mechanism capable of extracting subtle and complex underlying temporal dynamics in the observed session data, so as to inform the recommendation algorithm. To this end, we improve upon systems that utilize deep learning techniques with recurrently connected units; we do so by adopting concepts from the field of Bayesian statistics, namely variational inference. Our proposed approach consists in treating the network recurrent units as stochastic latent variables with a prior distribution imposed over them. On this basis, we proceed to infer corresponding posteriors; these can be used for prediction and recommendation generation, in a way that accounts for the uncertainty in the available sparse training data. To allow for our approach to easily scale to large real-world datasets, we perform inference under an approximate amortized variational inference (AVI) setup, whereby the learned posteriors are parameterized via (conventional) neural networks. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation of our approach using challenging benchmark datasets, and illustrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art techniques.},

abstract = {Automated music playlist generation is a specific form of music recommendation. Generally stated, the user receives a set of song suggestions defining a coherent listening session. We hypothesize that the best way to convey such playlist coherence to new recommendations is by learning it from actual curated examples, in contrast to imposing ad hoc constraints. Collaborative filtering methods can be used to capture underlying patterns in hand-curated playlists. However, the scarcity of thoroughly curated playlists and the bias towards popular songs result in the vast majority of songs occurring in very few playlists and thus being poorly recommended. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative model based on a song-to-playlist classifier, which learns the underlying structure from actual playlists while leveraging song features derived from audio, social tags and independent listening logs. Experiments on two datasets of hand-curated playlists show competitive performance compared to collaborative filtering when sufficient training data is available and more robust performance when recommending rare and out-of-set songs. For example, both approaches achieve a recall@100 of roughly 35% for songs occurring in 5 or more training playists, whereas the proposed model achieves a recall@100 of roughly 15% for songs occurring in 4 or less training playlists, compared to the 3% achieved by collaborative filtering.},

abstract = {Advances in image processing and computer vision in the latest years have brought about the use of visual features in artwork recommendation. Recent works have shown that visual features obtained from pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) perform extremely well for recommending digital art. Other recent works have shown that explicit visual features (EVF) based on attractiveness can perform well in preference prediction tasks, but no previous work has compared DNN features versus specific attractiveness-based visual features (e.g. brightness, texture) in terms of recommendation performance. In this work, we study and compare the performance of DNN and EVF features for the purpose of physical artwork recommendation using transactional data from UGallery, an online store of physical paintings. In addition, we perform an exploratory analysis to understand if DNN embedded features have some relation with certain EVF. Our results show that DNN features outperform EVF, that certain EVF features are more suited for physical artwork recommendation and, finally, we show evidence that certain neurons in the DNN might be partially encoding visual features such as brightness, providing an opportunity for explaining recommendations based on visual neural models.},

abstract = {In the last decade, driven also by the availability of an unprecedented computational power and storage capabilities in cloud environments, we assisted to the proliferation of new algorithms, methods, and approaches in two areas of artificial intelligence: knowledge representation and machine learning. On the one side, the generation of a high rate of structured data on the Web led to the creation and publication of the so-called knowledge graphs. On the other side, deep learning emerged as one of the most promising approaches in the generation and training of models that can be applied to a wide variety of application fields. More recently, autoencoders have proven their strength in various scenarios, playing a fundamental role in unsupervised learning. In this paper, we instigate how to exploit the semantic information encoded in a knowledge graph to build connections between units in a Neural Network, thus leading to a new method, SEM-AUTO, to extract and weight semantic features that can eventually be used to build a recommender system. As adding content-based side information may mitigate the cold user problems, we tested how our approach behaves in the presence of a few ratings from a user on the Movielens 1M dataset and compare results with BPRSLIM.},
