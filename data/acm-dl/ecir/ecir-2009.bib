abstract = {Search engine queries have evolved over the past 30 years from complex Boolean formulations to short lists of "keywords." Despite the apparent simplicity of short queries, choosing the right keywords can be difficult, and understanding user intentions is a major challenge. Techniques such as query expansion and context-based profiles have been developed to address these problems, but with limited success. Rather than trying to infer user intentions from very short queries, another approach is to improve query processing and retrieval models for long queries. In particular, query transformation is a new approach to improving search that appears to have considerable potential. In this approach, queries are transformed into one or more new queries using probabilistic models for generation or search of query archives. I will describe various transformation models and the role of a retrieval model in using these transformations. Examples will be given from applications such as collaborative question answering and forum search.},

abstract = {In recent years, blog search has received a lot of attention. Since the launch of dedicated evaluation efforts and the release of blog data sets, our understanding of blog search has deepened considerably. But there's more to user generated content than blogs and there's more to searching user generated content than looking for material that is relevant or opinionated or highly rated by readers or authors. In this talk, a number of user generated content search scenarios from the media analysis and intelligence domains will be detailed. From these, recurring themes such as credibility, people finding, impact prediction, unusual event detection, report and summary generation--all on user generated content--will be identified as highly relevant research directions.},

Whereas internet browsing can sometimes be seen as a form of entertainment, enterprise search involves activities in which search is mainly a tool. People have work they want to get done. In this context, the idea of relevance in documents is different. Community can become as important as content in search. Work-related search engines of the future will provide much greater analysis and structuring of documents at index time, and searchers will have more powerful tools at retrieval time. We will discuss these and other trends, and show what new methods and techniques should be targeted to improve enterprise search.},

abstract = {This paper concerns document ranking in information retrieval. In information retrieval systems, the widely accepted probability ranking principle (PRP) suggests that, for optimal retrieval, documents should be ranked in order of decreasing probability of relevance. In this paper, we present a new document ranking paradigm, arguing that a better, more general solution is to optimize top-<em>n</em> ranked documents as a whole, rather than ranking them independently. Inspired by the Modern Portfolio Theory in finance, we quantify a ranked list of documents on the basis of its expected overall relevance (mean) and its variance; the latter serves as a measure of risk, which was rarely studied for document ranking in the past. Through the analysis of the mean and variance, we show that an optimal rank order is the one that maximizes the overall relevance (mean) of the ranked list at a given risk level (variance). Based on this principle, we then derive an efficient document ranking algorithm. It extends the PRP by considering both the uncertainty of relevance predictions and correlations between retrieved documents. Furthermore, we quantify the benefits of diversification, and theoretically show that diversifying documents is an effective way to reduce the risk of document ranking. Experimental results on the collaborative filtering problem confirms the theoretical insights with improved recommendation performance, e.g., achieved over 300% performance gain over the PRP-based ranking on the user-based recommendation.},

abstract = {Probabilistic retrieval models usually rank documents based on a scalar quantity. However, such models lack any estimate for the uncertainty associated with a document's rank. Further, such models seldom have an explicit utility (or cost) that is optimized when ranking documents. To address these issues, we take a Bayesian perspective that explicitly considers the uncertainty associated with the estimation of the probability of relevance, and propose an asymmetric cost function for document ranking. Our cost function has the advantage of adjusting the risk in document retrieval via a single parameter for any probabilistic retrieval model. We use the <em>logit</em> model to transform the document posterior distribution with probability space [0,1] into a normal distribution with variable space ( *** *** , + *** ). We apply our risk adjustment approach to a language modelling framework for risk adjustable document ranking. Our experimental results show that our risk-aware model can significantly improve the performance of language models, both with and without background smoothing. When our method is applied to a language model without background smoothing, it can perform as well as the Dirichlet smoothing approach.},

abstract = {Synchronous Collaborative Information Retrieval refers to systems that support multiple users searching together at the same time in order to satisfy a shared information need. To date most SCIR systems have focussed on providing various awareness tools in order to enable collaborating users to coordinate the search task. However, requiring users to both search and coordinate the group activity may prove too demanding. On the other hand without effective coordination policies the group search may not be effective. In this paper we propose and evaluate novel system-mediated techniques for coordinating a group search. These techniques allow for an effective <em>division of labour</em> across the group whereby each group member can explore a subset of the search space. We also propose and evaluate techniques to support automated <em>sharing of knowledge</em> across searchers in SCIR, through novel <em>collaborative</em> and <em>complementary</em> relevance feedback techniques. In order to evaluate these techniques, we propose a framework for SCIR evaluation based on simulations. To populate these simulations we extract data from TREC interactive search logs. This work represent the first simulations of SCIR to date and the first such use of this TREC data.},

abstract = {Learning ranking functions is crucial for solving many problems, ranging from document retrieval to building recommendation systems based on an individual user's preferences or on collaborative filtering. Learning-to-rank is particularly necessary for adaptive or personalizable tasks, including email prioritization, individualized recommendation systems, personalized news clipping services and so on. Whereas the learning-to-rank challenge has been addressed in the literature, little work has been done in an active-learning framework, where requisite user feedback is minimized by selecting only the most informative instances to train the rank learner. This paper addresses active rank-learning head on, proposing a new sampling strategy based on minimizing hinge rank loss, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the active sampling method for rankSVM on two standard rank-learning datasets. The proposed method shows convincing results in optimizing three performance metrics, as well as improvement against four baselines including entropy-based, divergence- based, uncertainty-based and random sampling methods.},

Research on active learning in text classification has so far concentrated on single-label classification; active learning for multi-label classification, instead, has either been tackled in a simulated (and, we contend, non-realistic) way, or neglected <em>tout court</em> . In this paper we aim to fill this gap by examining a number of realistic strategies for tackling active learning for multi-label classification. Each such strategy consists of a rule for combining the outputs returned by the individual binary classifiers as a result of classifying a given unlabeled document. We present the results of extensive experiments in which we test these strategies on two standard text classification datasets.},

abstract = {Ranking for multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) is a task to rank documents of different languages solely based on their relevancy to the query regardless of query's language. Existing approaches are focused on combining relevance scores of different retrieval settings, but do not learn the ranking function directly. We approach Web MLIR ranking within the learning-to-rank (L2R) framework. Besides adopting popular L2R algorithms to MLIR, a joint ranking model is created to exploit the correlations among documents, and induce the joint relevance probability for all the documents. Using this method, the relevant documents of one language can be leveraged to improve the relevance estimation for documents of different languages. A probabilistic graphical model is trained for the joint relevance estimation. Especially, a hidden layer of nodes is introduced to represent the salient topics among the retrieved documents, and the ranks of the relevant documents and topics are determined collaboratively while the model approaching to its thermal equilibrium. Furthermore, the model parameters are trained under two settings: (1) optimize the accuracy of identifying relevant documents; (2) directly optimize information retrieval evaluation measures, such as mean average precision. Benchmarks show that our model significantly outperforms the existing approaches for MLIR tasks.},

abstract = {Maps are an important source of information in archaeology and other sciences. Users want to search for historical maps to determine recorded history of the political geography of regions at different eras, to find out where exactly archaeological artifacts were discovered, etc. Currently, they have to use a generic search engine and add the term map along with other keywords to search for maps. This crude method will generate a significant number of false positives that the user will need to cull through to get the desired results. To reduce their manual effort, we propose an automatic map identification, indexing, and retrieval system that enables users to search and retrieve maps appearing in a large corpus of digital documents using simple keyword queries. We identify features that can help in distinguishing maps from other figures in digital documents and show how a Support-Vector-Machine-based classifier can be used to identify maps. We propose map-level-metadata e.g., captions, references to the maps in text, etc. and document-level metadata, e.g., title, abstract, citations, how recent the publication is, etc. and show how they can be automatically extracted and indexed. Our novel ranking algorithm weights different metadata fields differently and also uses the document-level metadata to help rank retrieved maps. Empirical evaluations show which features should be selected and which metadata fields should be weighted more. We also demonstrate improved retrieval results in comparison to adaptations of existing methods for map retrieval. Our map search engine has been deployed in an online map-search system that is part of the Blind-Review digital library system.},

abstract = {Entity Ranking has recently become an important search task in Information Retrieval. The goal is not to find documents matching query terms, but, instead, finding entities. In this paper we propose a formal model to search entities as well as a complete Entity Ranking system, providing examples of its application to the enterprise context. We experimentally evaluate our system on the Expert Search task in order to show how it can be adapted to different scenarios. The results show that combining simple IR techniques we improve of 53% in terms of P@10 over our baseline.},

abstract = {Web advertising (Online advertising) is a form of promotion that uses the World Wide Web for the expressed purpose of delivering marketing messages to attract customers. This paper addresses the mechanism of Content-Oriented advertising (Contextual advertising), which refers to the assignment of relevant ads within the content of a generic web page, e.g. blogs. As blogs become a platform for expressing personal opinion, they naturally contain various kinds of expressions, including both facts and comments of both a positive and negative nature. In this paper, we propose the utilization of sentiment detection to improve Web-based contextual advertising. The proposed SOCA (Sentiment-Oriented Contextual Advertising) framework aims to combine contextual advertising matching with sentiment analysis to select ads that are related to the positive (and neutral) aspects of a blog and rank them according to their relevance. We experimentally validate our approach using a set of data that includes both real ads and actual blog pages. The results clearly indicate that our proposed method can effectively identify those ads that are positively correlated with the given blog pages.},

In this work, we study the problem of recommending a small set of ads to a user based solely on the currently viewed web page, often referred to as content-targeted advertising. Matching ads with web pages is a challenging task for traditional information retrieval systems due to the brevity and sparsity of advertising text, which leads to the widely recognized <em>vocabulary impedance</em> problem. To this end, we propose the use of lexical graphs created from web corpora as a means of computing improved content similarity metrics between ads and web pages. The results of our experimental study provide evidence of significant improvement in the perceived relevance of the recommended ads.},

In this framework, documents and queries are represented by fuzzy sets, which are paired with operations like fuzzy implications and T-norms. Through different experiments, it is shown that only some among the wide range of fuzzy operations are relevant for information retrieval. When appropriate settings are chosen, it is possible to mimic classical systems, thus yielding results rivaling those of state-of-the-art systems. These positive results validate the proposed approach, while negative ones give some insights on the properties needed by such a model. Moreover, this paper shows the added-value of this graded inclusion-based model, which gives new and theoretically grounded ways for a user to easily weight his query terms, to include negative information in his queries, or to expand them with related terms.},

In the paper, the proposed aggregation operator is applied to define a model for personalized Information Retrieval (IR), in which four criteria are considered in order to assess document relevance: <em>aboutness</em> , <em>coverage</em> , <em>appropriateness</em> and <em>reliability</em> .The originality of this approach lies in the aggregation of the considered criteria in a prioritized way, by considering the existence of a prioritization relationship over the criteria. Such a prioritization is modeled by making the weights associated with a criterion dependent upon the satisfaction of the higher-priority criteria. This way, it is possible to take into account the fact that the weight of a less important criterion should be proportional to the satisfaction degree of the more important criterion.In the paper, some preliminary experimental results are also reported.},

To address this, we extend the current evaluation methodology to include cross validation, report a more intuitive and descriptive statistic, and apply statistical testing to determine significant differences. During the course of a comprehensive empirical study over several TREC collections, we evaluate nineteen pre-retrieval predictors and three combination methods.},

abstract = {Blog post opinion retrieval is the problem of identifying posts which express an opinion about a particular topic. Usually the problem is solved using a 3 step process in which relevant posts are first retrieved, then opinion scores are generated for each document, and finally the opinion and relevance scores are combined to produce a single ranking. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of classification and rank learning techniques for solving the blog post opinion retrieval problem. We have chosen not to rely on external lexicons of opinionated terms, but investigate to what extent the list of opinionated terms can be mined from the same corpus of relevance/opionion assessments that are used to train the retrieval system. We compare popular feature selection methods such as the <em>weighted log likelihood ratio</em> and <em>mutual information</em> for use both in selecting terms for training an opinionated document classifier and also as term weights for generating simpler (not learning based) aggregate opinion scores for documents. We thereby analyze what performance gains result from learning in the opinion detection phase. Furthermore we compare different learning and not learning based methods for combining relevance and opinion information in order to generate a ranked list of opinionated posts, thereby investigating the effect of learning on the ranking phase.},

abstract = {Opinion finding is a challenging retrieval task, where it has been shown that it is especially difficult to improve over a strongly performing topic-relevance baseline. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for opinion finding, which takes into account the proximity of query terms to subjective sentences in a document. We adapt two state-of-the-art opinion detection techniques to identify subjective sentences from the retrieved documents. Our first technique uses the OpinionFinder toolkit to classify the subjectiveness of sentences in a document. Our second technique uses an automatically generated dictionary of subjective terms derived from the document collection itself to identify the most subjective sentences in a document. We extend the Divergence From Randomness (DFR) proximity model to integrate the proximity of query terms to the subjective sentences identified by either of the proposed techniques. We evaluate these techniques on five different strong baselines across two different query datasets from the TREC Blog track. We show that we can significantly improve over the baselines and that, in several settings, our proposed techniques can at least match the top performing systems at the TREC Blog track.},

In this work, we attempt to attack this problem by making the maximum use of both the old-domain data and the unlabeled new-domain data. To leverage knowledge from the old-domain data, we proposed an effective measure, i.e., Frequently Co-occurring Entropy (FCE), to pick out generalizable features that occur frequently in both domains and have similar occurring probability. To gain knowledge from the new-domain data, we proposed Adapted Na\"{\i}ve Bayes (ANB), a weighted transfer version of Naive Bayes Classifier. The experimental results indicate that proposed approach could improve the performance of base classifier dramatically, and even provide much better performance than the transfer-learning baseline, i.e. the Na\"{\i}ve Bayes Transfer Classifier (NTBC).},

Use of hyperlinks to enhance page ranking has been widely studied. The underlying assumption is that hyperlinks convey recommendations. Although this technique has been used successfully in global web search, it produces poor results for website search, because the majority of the hyperlinks in local websites are used to organize information and convey no recommendations. This paper defines the Hierarchical Navigation Path (HNP) as a new resource to exploit these hyperlinks for improved web search. HNP is composed of multi-step hyperlinks in visitors' website navigation. It provides indications of the content of the destination page. The HierPathExt algorithm is given to extract HNPs in local websites. Then, the PathRank algorithm is created to use HNPs for web page retrieval. The experiments show that our approach results in significant improvements over existing solutions.},

For example, pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) assumes that the top retrieved documents are relevant, and uses the terms extracted from those documents for query expansion. However, there are other sources of evidence that can be used for expansion, some of which may give better search results with greater efficiency at query time. In this paper, we use the external evidence, especially the hints obtained from external web search engines to expand the original query. We explore 6 different methods using search engine query log, snippets and search result documents. We conduct extensive experiments, with state of the art PRF baselines and careful parameter tuning, on three TREC collections: AP, WT10g, GOV2. Log-based methods do not show consistent significant gains, despite being very efficient at query-time. Snippet-based expansion, using the summaries provided by an external search engine, provides significant effectiveness gains with good efficiency at query-time.},

In some previous works, a query-independent feature is uniformly applied to all queries. Other works predict the most useful feature based on the query type. However, the accuracy of the current query type prediction methods is not high. In this paper, we investigate a novel approach that applies the most appropriate query-independent feature on a per-query basis, and does not require the knowledge of the query type. The approach is based on an estimate of the divergence between the retrieved document scores' distributions prior to, and after the integration of a query-independent feature. We evaluate our approach on the TREC .GOV Web test collection and the mixed topic sets from TREC 2003 &amp; 2004 Web search tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the selective application of a query-independent feature on a per-query basis is very effective and robust. In particular, it outperforms a query type prediction-based method, even when this method is simulated with a 100% query type prediction accuracy.},

Having observed that NDCG@100 (measured over a set of reference queries) begins to plateau in the initial stages of the crawl, we investigate a number of possible reasons for this behaviour.

We explore the use of thread, mailing list, and community content levels, by expanding our original query with term from these sources. We find that query models based on contextual information improve retrieval effectiveness. Second, email is a relatively informal genre, and therefore offers scope for incorporating techniques previously shown useful in searching user-generated content. Indeed, our experiments show that using query-independent features (email length, thread size, and text quality), implemented as priors, results in further improvements.},

abstract = {Automatic language processing tools typically assign to terms so-called `weights' corresponding to the contribution of terms to information content. Traditionally, term weights are computed from lexical statistics, e.g., term frequencies. We propose a new type of term weight that is computed from part of speech (POS) n-gram statistics. The proposed POS-based term weight represents how informative a term is in general, based on the `POS contexts' in which it generally occurs in language. We suggest five different computations of POS-based term weights by extending existing statistical approximations of term information measures. We apply these POS-based term weights to information retrieval, by integrating them into the model that matches documents to queries. Experiments with two TREC collections and 300 queries, using TF-IDF &amp; BM25 as baselines, show that integrating our POS-based term weights to retrieval always leads to gains (up to +33.7% from the baseline). Additional experiments with a different retrieval model as baseline (Language Model with Dirichlet priors smoothing) and our best performing POS-based term weight, show retrieval gains always and consistently across the whole smoothing range of the baseline.},

abstract = {Document retrieval systems conventionally use words as the basic unit of representation, a natural choice since words are primary carriers of semantic information. In this paper we propose the use of a different, phonetically defined unit of representation that we call "particles". Particles are phonetic sequences that do not possess meaning. Both documents and queries are converted from their standard word-based form into sequences of particles. Indexing and retrieval is performed with particles. Experiments show that this scheme is capable of achieving retrieval performance that is comparable to that from words when the text in the documents and queries are clean, and can result in significantly improved retrieval when they are noisy.},

abstract = {It is well known that the use of a good Machine Transliteration system improves the retrieval performance of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems when the query and document languages have different orthography and phonetic alphabets. However, the effectiveness of a Machine Transliteration system in CLIR is limited by its ability to produce relevant transliterations, i.e. those transliterations which are actually present in the relevant documents. In this work, we propose a new approach to the problem of finding transliterations for out-of-vocabulary query terms. Instead of "generating" the transliterations using a Machine Transliteration system, we "mine" them, using a transliteration similarity model, from the top CLIR results for the query. We treat the query and each of the top results as "comparable" documents and search for transliterations in these comparable document pairs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using queries in two languages from two different linguistic families to retrieve English documents from two standard CLEF collections. We also compare our results with those of a state-of-the-art Machine Transliteration system.},

This forms the basis of a classification process which detects potentially harmful phishing messages. We introduce various new features for identifying phishing messages and rank established as well as newly introduced features according to their significance for this classification problem. Moreover, in contrast to classical binary classification approaches (spam vs. not spam), a more refined ternary classification approach for filtering e-mail data is investigated which automatically distinguishes three message types: ham (solicited e-mail), spam, and phishing.Experiments with representative data sets illustrate that our approach yields better classification results than existing phishing detection methods. Moreover, the direct ternary classification proposed is compared to a sequence of two binary classification processes. Direct one-step ternary classification is not only more efficient, but is also shown to achieve better accuracy than repeated binary classification.},

abstract = {Online product reviews are becoming increasingly available, and are being used more and more frequently by consumers in order to choose among competing products. Tools that rank competing products in terms of the satisfaction of consumers that have purchased the product before, are thus also becoming popular. We tackle the problem of rating (i.e., attributing a numerical score of satisfaction to) consumer reviews based on their textual content. We here focus on <em>multi-facet</em> review rating, i.e., on the case in which the review of a product (e.g., a hotel) must be rated several times, according to several aspects of the product (for a hotel: cleanliness, centrality of location, etc.). We explore several aspects of the problem, with special emphasis on how to generate vectorial representations of the text by means of POS tagging, sentiment analysis, and feature selection for ordinal regression learning. We present the results of experiments conducted on a dataset of more than 15,000 reviews that we have crawled from a popular hotel review site.},

We report on work that uses easily extractable surface features of podcasts in order to achieve solid performance on two podcast preference prediction tasks: classification of preferred vs. non-preferred podcasts and ranking podcasts by level of preference. We identify features with good discriminative potential by carrying out manual data analysis, resulting in a refinement of the indicators of an existent podcast preference framework. Our preference prediction is useful for topic-independent ranking of podcasts, and can be used to support download suggestion or collection browsing.},

abstract = {The aim of query-based sampling is to obtain a sufficient, representative sample of an underlying (text) collection. Current measures for assessing sample quality are too coarse grain to be informative. This paper outlines a measure of finer granularity based on probabilistic topic models of text. The assumption we make is that a representative sample should capture the broad themes of the underlying text collection. If these themes are not captured, then resource selection will be affected in terms of performance, coverage and reliability. For example, resource selection algorithms that require extrapolation from a small sample of indexed documents to determine which collections are most likely to hold relevant documents may be affected by samples which do not reflect the topical density of a collection. To address this issue we propose to measure the relative entropy between topics obtained in a sample with respect to the complete collection. Topics are both modelled from the collection and inferred in the sample using latent Dirichlet allocation. The paper outlines an analysis and evaluation of this methodology across a number of collections and sampling algorithms.},

abstract = {Source selection deals with the problem of selecting the most appropriate information sources from the set of, usually non-intersecting, available document collections. On the other hand, data fusion techniques (also known as metasearch techniques) deal with the problem of aggregating the results from multiple, usually completely or partly intersecting, document sources in order to provide a wider coverage and a more effective retrieval result. In this paper we study some simple adaptations to traditional data fusion algorithms for the task of source selection in uncooperative distributed information retrieval environments. The experiments demonstrate that the performance of data fusion techniques at source selection tasks is comparable with that of state-of-the-art source selection algorithms and they are often able to surpass them.},

abstract = {Current web search engines return query-biased snippets for each document they list in a result set. For efficiency, search engines operating on large collections need to cache snippets for common queries, and to cache documents to allow fast generation of snippets for uncached queries. To improve the hit rate on a document cache during snippet generation, we propose and evaluate several schemes for reducing document size, hence increasing the number of documents in the cache. In particular, we argue against further improvements to document compression, and argue for schemes that prune documents based on the <em>a priori</em> likelihood that a sentence will be used as part of a snippet for a given document. Our experiments show that if documents are reduced to less than half their original size, 80% of snippets generated are identical to those generated from the original documents. Moreover, as the pruned, compressed surrogates are smaller, 3-4 times as many documents can be cached.},

Users found <em>Group</em> organization more appropriate for location names from TGN, while <em>Alphabetical</em> works better for object names from WordNet. In Study 2, we compared three different organization strategies (<em>Alphabetical</em> , <em>Group</em> and <em>Composite</em> ) for location name search tasks. The results indicate that for TGN autocompletion interfaces help improve the quality of keywords, <em>Group</em> and <em>Composite</em> organization help users search faster, and is perceived easier to understand and to use than <em>Alphabetical</em> .},

Multi-site search engines that perform distributed query processing represent one way to overcome such constraints. Each site processes locally as many queries as possible, keeping latency low without contacting remote sites. Forwarding a query to remote sites depends on the document collection of remote sites. Multi-site search engines pose several new challenges. When a site updates its index, it has to inform other sites. The updates, however, are not instantaneous due to the volume of data exchanged or possible network failures. During the period of time that there are index inconsistencies across sites, queries may not be forwarded optimally. In this work, we investigate the impact of index inconsistencies on a distributed query processing algorithm, when there are index updates, and we observe that delayed index information propagation reduces the effectiveness of query processing, because queries are less likely to be routed optimally.},

However, query expansion can also fail, leading to a degradation of the retrieval performance. In this paper, we aim to provide a better understanding of query expansion by an empirical study on what factors can affect query expansion, and how these factors affect query expansion. We examine how the quality of the query, measured by the first-pass retrieval performance, is related to the effectiveness of query expansion. Our experimental results only show a moderate relation between them, indicating that the first-pass retrieval has only a moderate impact on the effectiveness of query expansion. Our results also show that the feedback documents should not only be relevant, but should also have a dedicated interest in the topic.},

abstract = {For bounded datasets such as the TREC Web Track (WT10g) the computation of term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF) is not difficult. However, when the corpus is the entire web, direct IDF calculation is impossible and values must instead be estimated. Most available datasets provide values for <em>term count (TC)</em> meaning the number of times a certain term occurs in the entire corpus. Intuitively this value is different from <em>document frequency (DF)</em> , the number of documents (e.g., web pages) a certain term occurs in. We investigate the relationship between <em>TC</em> and <em>DF</em> values of terms occurring in the Web as Corpus (WaC) and also the similarity between <em>TC</em> values obtained from the WaC and the Google N-gram dataset. A strong correlation between the two would gives us confidence in using the Google N-grams to estimate accurate IDF values which for example is the foundation to generate well performing lexical signatures based on the TF-IDF scheme. Our results show a very strong correlation between <em>TC</em> and <em>DF</em> within the WaC with Spearman's <em>ρ</em> *** 0.8 (<em>p</em> ≤ 2.2\texttimes{}10*** 16) and a high similarity between <em>TC</em> values from the WaC and the Google N-grams.},

In this paper we show that repeated submissions of the same query provides a means to estimate the computational fraction of overall query execution time. The advantage of separate measurements is exemplified for a particular optimization that is, as it turns out, reducing computational costs only. Finally, by exchange of repeated query terms with surrogates that have similar document-frequency, we are able to measure the natural caching effects that arise as a consequence of term repetitions in query logs.},

Language pair of our evaluation is English *** German, because MT metrics still do not offer very many language pairs for comparison. We evaluated translations of CLEF 2003 topics of four different MT programs with MT metrics and compare the metrics evaluation results to results of CLIR runs. Our results show, that for long topics the correlations between achieved MAPs and MT metrics is high (0.85-0.94), and for short topics lower but still clear (0.63-0.72). Overall it seems that MT metrics can easily distinguish the worst MT programs from the best ones, but smaller differences are not so clearly shown. Some of the intrinsic properties of MT metrics do not also suit for CLIR resource evaluation purposes, because some properties of translation metrics, especially evaluation of word order, are not significant in CLIR.},

abstract = {We propose a new entropy-based algorithm for static index pruning. The algorithm computes an importance score for each document in the collection based on the entropy of each term. A threshold is set according to the desired level of pruning and all postings associated with documents that score below this threshold are removed from the index, i.e. documents are removed from the collection. We compare this entropy-based approach with previous work by Carmel <em>et al.</em> [1], for both the Financial Times (FT) and Los Angeles Times (LA) collections. Experimental results reveal that the entropy-based approach has superior performance on the FT collection, for both precision at 10 (P@10) and mean average precision (MAP). However, for the LA collection, Carmel's method is generally superior with MAP. The variation in performance across collections suggests that a hybrid algorithm that incorporates elements of both methods might have more stable performance across collections. A simple hybrid method is tested, in which a first 10% pruning is performed using the entropy-based method, and further pruning is performed by Carmel's method. Experimental results show that the hybird algorithm can slightly improve that of Carmel's, but performs significantly worse than the entropy-based method on the FT collection.},

abstract = {The Opinion Detection from blogs has always been a challenge for researchers. One of the challenges faced is to find such documents that specifically contain opinion on users' information need. This requires text processing on sentence level rather than on document level. In this paper, we have proposed an opinion detection approach. The proposed approach focuses on above problem by processing documents on sentence level using different semantic similarity relations of WordNet between sentence words and list of weighted query words expanded through encyclopedia Wikipedia. According to initial results, our approach performs well with MAP of 0.28 and P@10 of 0.64 with improvement of 27% over baseline results. TREC Blog 2006 data is used as test data collection.},

This paper proposes simple feedback-style learning for query-specific opinion lexicon using the set of top-retrieved documents in response to a query. The proposed learning starts from the initial domain-independent general lexicon and creates a query-specific lexicon by re-updating the opinion probability of the initial lexicon based on top-retrieved documents. Experimental results on recent TREC test sets show that the query-specific lexicon provides a significant improvement over previous approaches, especially in BLOG-06 topics.},

abstract = {CBIR has been a challenging problem and its performance relies on the underlying image similarity (distance) metric. Most existing metrics evaluate pairwise image similarity based only on image content, which is denoted as <em>content similarity</em> . In this study we propose a novel similarity metric to make use of the image contexts in an image collection. The context of an image is built by constructing a vector with each dimension representing the content similarity between the image and any image in the image collection. The <em>context similarity</em> between two images is obtained by computing the similarity between the corresponding context vectors using the vector similarity functions. The content similarity and the context similarity are then combined to evaluate the overall image similarity. Experimental results demonstrate that the use of the context similarity can significantly improve the retrieval performance.},

We propose a Global Semantic Distortion (GSD) metric that measures the collection-wide impact of speech recognition error on spoken content retrieval in a query-independent manner. We deploy our metric to examine the effects of speech recognition substitution errors. First, we investigate frequent substitutions, cases in which the recognizer habitually mis-transcribes one word as another. Although habitual mistakes have a large global impact, the long tail of rare substitutions has a more damaging effect. Second, we investigate semantically similar substitutions, cases in which the word spoken and the word recognized do not diverge radically in meaning. Similar substitutions are shown to have slightly less global impact than semantically dissimilar substitutions.},

abstract = {Representations of geographic regions play a decisive role in geographic information retrieval, where the query is specified by a conceptual part and a geographic part. One aspect is to use them as query footprint which is then applied for the geographic ranking of documents. Users often specify textual descriptions of geographic regions that are not contained in the underlying gazetteer or geographic database. Approaches that automatically determine a geographic footprint for those locations have a strong need for measuring the quality of this footprint, for evaluation as well as for automatical parameter learning. This quality is determined by the 'similarity' between the footprint and a correct representation of that region.In this paper we introduce three domain-specific points of view for measuring the similarity between representations of geographic regions for geographic information retrieval. For each point of view (strict similarity, visual similarity and similarity in ranking) we introduce a dedicated measure, two of which are novel measures that we propose in this paper.},

In practice, this extraction process is confronted with many non-relevant contents in the original blog post, such as menu, banner, site description, etc, causing the ranking be less-effective. The problem is that these non-relevant contents are not encoded in a unified way but encoded in many different ways between blog sites. Thus, the commercial vendor of blog sites should consider tuning works such as making human-driven rules for eliminating these non-relevant contents for all blog sites. However, such tuning is a very inefficient process. Rather than this labor-intensive method, this paper first recognizes that many of these non-relevant contents are not changed between several consequent blog posts, and then proposes a simple and effective DiffPost algorithm to eliminate them based on content difference between two consequent blog posts in the same blog site. Experimental result in TREC blog track is remarkable, showing that the retrieval system using DiffPost makes an important performance improvement of about 10% MAP (Mean Average Precision) increase over that without DiffPost.},

This information is composed of classical textual and multimedia data, in concert with additional data (tags, annotations, comments, ratings).

The result is a rich structure of interrelationships between content items, participants and services. Although the size of such networks requires the use of advanced Information Retrieval techniques, classical IR models are not tailored for this type of content as they do not (in general) take advantage of the particular structure and unique aspects of this socially-driven content.This workshop proposes to report about the state-of-the- art in this direction and to gather a relevant panel of researchers working in the field.

abstract = {In the last decade, many evaluation results have been created within the evaluation initiatives like TREC, NTCIR and CLEF. The large amount of data available has led to substantial research on the validity of the evaluation procedure. An evaluation based on the Cranfield paradigm requires basically topics as descriptions of information needs, a document collection, systems to compare, human jurors to judge the documents retrieved by the systems against the information needs descriptions and some metric to compare the systems. For all these elements, there has been a scientific discussion. How many topics, systems, jurors and juror decisions are necessary to achieve valid results? How can the validity be measured? Which metrics are the most reliable ones and which metrics are appropriate from a user perspective? Examples from current CLEF experiments are used to illustrate some of the issues.User based evaluations confront test users with the results of search systems and let them solve information tasks given in the experiment. In such a test setting, the performance of the user can be measured by observing the number of relevant documents he finds. This measure can be compared to a gold standard of relevance for the search topic to see if the perceived performance correlates with an objective notion of relevance defined by a juror. In addition, the user can be asked about his satisfaction with the search system and its results. In recent years, there has a growing concern on how well the results of batch and user studies correlate. When systems improve in a batch comparison and bring more relevant documents into the results list, do users get a benefit from this improvement? Are users more satisfied with better result lists and do better systems enable them to find more relevant documents? Some studies could not confirm this relation between system performance and user satisfaction.},

abstract = {We witness a growing interest and capabilities of automatic content recognition (often referred to as information extraction) in various media sources that identify entities (e.g. persons, locations and products) and their semantic attributes (e.g., opinions expressed towards persons or products, relations between entities).These extraction techniques are most advanced for text sources, but they are also researched for other media, for instance for recognizing persons and objects in images or video. The extracted information enriches and adds semantic meaning to document and queries (the latter e.g., in a relevance feedback setting). In addition, content recognition techniques trigger automated linking of information across documents and even across media. This situation poses a number of opportunities and challenges for retrieval and ranking models. For instance, instead of returning full documents, information extraction provides the means to return very focused results in the form of entities such as persons and locations. Another challenge is to integrate content recognition and content retrieval as much as possible, for instance by using the probabilistic output from the information extraction tools in the retrieval phase. These approaches are important steps towards semantic search, i.e., retrieval approaches that truly use the semantics of the data.},

abstract = {Web Search Engines (WSEs) have stored in their query logs information about users since they started to operate. This information often serves many purposes. The primary focus of this tutorial is to introduce to the discipline of query log mining. We will show its foundations, by giving a unified view on the literature on query log analysis, and also present in detail the basic algorithms and techniques that could be used to extract useful knowledge from this (potentially) infinite source of information. Finally, we will discuss how the extracted knowledge can be exploited to improve different quality features of a WSE system, mainly its effectiveness and efficiency.},
