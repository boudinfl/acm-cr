abstract = {A result page of a modern commercial search engine often contains documents of different types targeted to satisfy different user intents (news, blogs, multimedia). When evaluating system performance and making design decisions we need to better understand user behavior on such result pages. To address this problem various click models have previously been proposed. In this paper we focus on result pages containing fresh results and propose a way to model user intent distribution and bias due to different document presentation types. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that successfully uses intent and layout information to improve existing click models.},

abstract = {Relevance is one of the key concepts in Information Retrieval (IR). A huge body of research exists that attempts to understand this concept so as to operationalize it for IR systems. Despite advances in the past few decades, answering the question "How does relevance happen?" is still a big challenge. In this paper, we investigate the connection between relevance and brain activity. Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we measured the brain activity of eighteen participants while they performed four topical relevance assessment tasks on relevant and non-relevant images. The results of this experiment revealed three brain regions in the frontal, parietal and temporal cortex where brain activity differed between processing relevant and non-relevant documents. This is an important step in unravelling the nature of relevance and therefore better utilising it for effective retrieval.},

In this paper, we investigate the sensemaking behaviour of online searchers in terms of sensemaking strategies, sharing of information, construction of a shared representation and sharing of task progress and status. We also looked into the support provided to them by search systems in the collaborative information seeking process. We report the results of an observational user study where 24 participants, in groups of 3, completed a travel planning task. Our results show that current tools do not sufficiently support searchers in most aspects of the collaborative sensemaking process.

Since this task is sometimes perceived as tedious or boring, annotations can be sparse. Commenting on the other hand is a frequently used means of expressing user opinion towards shared media items. This work makes use of time series analyses in order to infer potential tags and indexing terms for audio-visual content from user comments. In this way, we mitigate the vocabulary gap between queries and document descriptors. Additionally, we show how large-scale encyclopaedias such as Wikipedia can aid the task of tag prediction by serving as surrogates for high-coverage natural language vocabulary lists. Our evaluation is conducted on a corpus of several million real-world user comments from the popular video sharing platform YouTube, and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval performance.},

abstract = {Games with a purpose (GWAPs) are increasingly used in audio-visual collections as a mechanism for annotating videos through tagging. This trend is driven by the assumption that user tags will improve video search. In this paper we study whether this is indeed the case. To this end, we create an evaluation dataset that consists of: (i) a set of videos tagged by users via video labelling game, (ii) a set of queries derived from real-life query logs, and (iii) relevance judgements. Besides user tags from the labelling game, we exploit the existing metadata associated with the videos (textual descriptions and curated in-house tags) and closed captions. Our findings show that search based on user tags alone outperforms search based on all other metadata types. Combining user tags with the other types of metadata yields an increase in search performance of 33%. We also find that the search performance of user tags steadily increases as more tags are collected.},

With the fast development of the Internet, the popularization of mobile devices and e-commerce systems, searching specific products by image has become an interesting research topic. In this context, Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) techniques have been used to support and enhance the customer shopping experience. We propose an image re-ranking strategy based on multimedia information available on product databases. Our re-ranking strategy relies on category and textual information associated to the top-k images of an initial ranking computed purely with CBIR techniques. Experiments were carried out with users' relevance judgment on two image datasets collected from e-commerce Web sites. Our results show that our re-ranking strategy outperforms the baselines when using only CBIR techniques.},

abstract = {Predicting the diffusion of information on social networks is a key problem for applications like Opinion Leader Detection, Buzz Detection or Viral Marketing. Many recent diffusion models are direct extensions of the Cascade and Threshold models, initially proposed for epidemiology and social studies. In such models, the diffusion process is based on the dynamics of interactions between neighbor nodes in the network (the social pressure), and largely ignores important dimensions as the content of the piece of information diffused. We propose here a new family of probabilistic models that aims at predicting how a content diffuses in a network by making use of additional dimensions: the content of the piece of information diffused, user's profile and willingness to diffuse. These models are illustrated and compared with other approaches on two blog datasets. The experimental results obtained on these datasets show that taking into account the content of the piece of information diffused is important to accurately model the diffusion process.},

abstract = {The presence of emergent semantics in social annotation systems has been reported in numerous studies. Two important problems in this context are the induction of semantic relations among tags and the discovery of different senses of a given tag. While a number of approaches for discovering tag senses exist, little is known about which factors influence the discovery process. In this paper, we analyze the influence of user pragmatic factors. We divide taggers into different pragmatic distinctions. Based on these distinctions, we identify subsets of users whose annotations allow for a more precise and complete discovery of tag senses. Our results provide evidence for a link between tagging pragmatics and semantics and provide another argument for including pragmatic factors in semantic extraction methods. Our work is relevant for improving search, retrieval and browsing in social annotation systems, as well as for optimizing ontology learning algorithms based on tagging data.},

abstract = {We explore the potential of probabilistic topic modeling within the relevance modeling framework for both monolingual and cross-lingual ad-hoc retrieval. Multilingual topic models provide a way to represent documents in a structured and coherent way, regardless of their actual language, by means of language-independent concepts, that is, cross-lingual topics. We show how to integrate the topical knowledge into a unified relevance modeling framework in order to build quality retrieval models in monolingual and cross-lingual contexts. The proposed modeling framework processes all documents uniformly and does not make any conceptual distinction between monolingual and cross-lingual modeling. Our results obtained from the experiments conducted on the standard CLEF test collections reveal that fusing the topical knowledge and relevance modeling leads to building monolingual and cross-lingual retrieval models that outperform several strong baselines. We show that that the topical knowledge coming from a general Web-generated corpus boosts retrieval scores. Additionally, we show that within this framework the estimation of cross-lingual relevance models may be performed by exploiting only a general non-parallel corpus.},

abstract = {Search log k-anonymization is based on the elimination of infrequent queries under exact (or nearly exact) matching conditions, which usually results in a big data loss and impaired utility. We present a more flexible, semantic approach to k-anonymity that consists of three steps: query concept mining, automatic query expansion, and affinity assessment of expanded queries. Based on the observation that many infrequent queries can be seen as refinements of a more general frequent query, we first model query concepts as probabilistically weighted n-grams and extract them from the search log data. Then, after expanding the original log queries with their weighted concepts, we find all the k-affine expanded queries under a given affinity threshold Θ, modeled as a generalized k-core of the graph of Θ-affine queries. Experimenting with the AOL data set, we show that this approach achieves levels of privacy comparable to those of plain k-anonymity while at the same time reducing the data losses to a great extent.},

This work proposes and evaluates techniques for training GBRTs that have efficient runtime characteristics. Our approach is based on the simple idea that compact, shallow, and balanced trees yield faster predictions: thus, it makes sense to incorporate some notion of execution cost during training to "encourage" trees with these topological characteristics. We propose two strategies for accomplishing this: the first, by directly modifying the node splitting criterion during tree induction, and the second, by stagewise tree pruning. Experiments on a standard learning-to-rank dataset show that the pruning approach is superior; one balanced setting yields an approximately 40% decrease in prediction latency with minimal reduction in output quality as measured by NDCG.},

However neither metric considers the relative ranking of the documents in the retrieved sets. We therefore introduce a new performance metric, rank-accuracy, that is a rank weighted score of the top-k documents retrieved. By replicating documents across nodes based on their retrieval rate (a function of query frequency), and rank, we show that average rank-accuracy can be improved. The practical performance of rank-aware search is demonstrated using a simulated network of 10,000 nodes and queries drawn from a Yahoo! web search log.},

Focusing on the use of content information, different text representation methods (words and character n-grams) are tested. Moreover, two classification methods are examined, one-class SVM learners, used as a baseline, and an ensemble of classifiers based on random feature subspacing, originally proposed for author identification. It is demonstrated that very high precision can be achieved in open-set AGI while recall remains relatively high.},

abstract = {In recent years, location based services (LBS) have become very popular. The performance of LBS depends on number of factors including how well the places are described. Though LBS enable users to tag places, users rarely do so. On the other hand, users express their interests via online social networks. The common interests of a group of people that has visited a particular place can potentially provide further description for that place. In this work we present an approach that automatically assigns tags to places, based on interest profiles and visits or check-ins of users at places. We have evaluated our approach with real world datasets from popular social network services against a set of manually assigned tags. Experimental results show that we are able to derive meaningful tags for different places and that sets of tags assigned to places are expected to stabilise as more unique users visit places.},

abstract = {In sponsored search, the ad selection algorithm is used to pick out the best candidate ads for ranking, the bid keywords of which are best matched to the user queries. Existing ad selection methods mainly focus on the relevance between user query and selected ads, and consequently the monetization ability of the results is not necessarily maximized. To this end, instead of making selection based on keywords as a whole, our work takes advantages of the different impacts, as revealed in our data study, of different components inside the keywords on both relevance and monetization ability. In particular, we select keyword components and then maximize the relevance and revenue on the component level. Finally, we combine the selected components to generate the bid keywords. The experiments reveal that our method can significantly outperform two baseline algorithms on the metrics including recall, precision and the monetization ability.},

In particular, it helps to understand information need of a searcher, her personal preferences, context of the topic she is currently interested in. Most of the previous studies on the topic either considered the whole user activity for a fixed period of time or divided it relying on some predefined inactivity time-out. It helps to identify groups of web sites visited with the same information need. This paper addresses the problem of automatic segmentation of users browsing logs into logical segments. We propose a method for automatic division of their daily activity into intent-related parts. This segmentation advances the commonly used approaches. We propose several methods for browsing log partitioning and provide detailed study of their performance. We evaluate all algorithms and analyse contributions of various types of features.},

In many cases, real-life events like new scientific findings, resignations, deaths, or catastrophes serve as triggers for collaborative editing of articles about affected entities such as persons or countries. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of event-related updates in Wikipedia by examining different indicators for events including language, meta annotations, and update bursts. We then study how these indicators can be employed for automatically detecting event-related updates. Our experiments on event extraction, clustering, and summarization show promising results towards generating entity-specific news tickers and timelines.},

abstract = {Searching medical records is challenging due to their inherent implicit knowledge --- such knowledge may be known by medical practitioners, but it is hidden from an information retrieval (IR) system. For example, it is intuitive for a medical practitioner to assert that patients with heart disease are likely to have records from the hospital's cardiology department. Hence, we hypothesise that this implicit knowledge can be used to enhance a medical records search system that ranks patients based on the relevance of their medical records to a query. In this paper, we propose to group aggregates of medical records from individual hospital departments, which we refer to as department-level evidence, to capture some of the implicit knowledge. In particular, each department-level aggregate consists of all of the medical records created by a particular hospital department, which is then exploited to enhance retrieval effectiveness. Specifically, we propose two approaches to build the department-level evidence based on a federated search and a voting paradigm, respectively. In addition, we introduce an extended voting technique that could leverage this department-level evidence while ranking. We evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of our approaches in the context of the TREC 2011 Medical Records track. Our results show that modelling department-level evidence of records in medical records search improves retrieval effectiveness. In particular, our proposed approach to leverage department-level evidence built using a voting technique obtains results comparable to the best submitted TREC 2011 Medical Records track systems without requiring any external resources that are exploited in those systems.},

Finding topical n-grams, when possible based on context, instead of always presenting unigrams in topics does away with many ambiguities that individual words may carry. We derive a collapsed Gibbs sampler for posterior inference. Our experimental results show an improvement over the current state-of-the-art topics over time model.},

Our experimental results show significant improvements in user engagement when named-entity and timeline components were installed. Further, we investigate if we can predict user-centred metrics through user's interaction with the system. Results show that we can successfully learn a model that predicts all dimensions of user engagement and whether users will like the system or not. These findings might steer systems that apply a more personalised user experience, tailored to the user's preferences.},

We consider a class of temporal document priors that is inspired by retention functions considered in cognitive psychology that are used to model the decay of memory. Many such functions used as a temporal document prior have a positive effect on overall retrieval performance. We examine the stability of this effect across news and microblog collections and discover interesting differences between retention functions. We also study the problem of optimizing parameters of the retention functions as temporal document priors; some retention functions display consistent good performance across large regions of the parameter space. A retention function based on a Weibull distribution is the preferred choice for a temporal document prior.},

Our approach leverages temporal properties for QE and combines them according to the temporal variation of a given topic. Experimental results show that this QE method using automatically combined temporal properties is effective at improving retrieval performance.},

As a result we have 2,389 tweets that have been annotated by multiple humans and 75,761 tweets that have been annotated by one annotator. We discuss issues like inter-annotator agreement, the time that it took annotators to classify tweets in correlation to their subjective content and lastly, the distribution of subjective tweets in relation to topic categorization. The annotated datasets and all relevant anonymised information are freely available for research purposes.},

What precisely these scenarios are and how the data streams can efficiently be analyzed for each scenario is still largely unclear at this point in time and has therefore created significant interest in industry and academia. In this paper, we describe a novel algorithm for geo-spatial event detection on Social Media streams. We monitor all posts on Twitter issued in a given geographic region and identify places that show a high amount of activity. In a second processing step, we analyze the resulting spatio-temporal clusters of posts with a Machine Learning component in order to detect whether they constitute real-world events or not. We show that this can be done with high precision and recall. The detected events are finally displayed to a user on a map, at the location where they happen and while they happen.},

We model the problem theoretically, define a set of privacy objectives with respect to web search and investigate the effectiveness of the proposed solution with a set of real queries on a large web collection. Experiments show great improvements in retrieval effectiveness over a previously reported baseline in the literature. Furthermore, the methods are more versatile, predictably-behaved, applicable to a wider range of information needs, and the privacy they provide is more comprehensible to the end-user.},

We find that both the text and structure-based approaches are effective in retrieving relevant entities, but that they find different sets of entities. Additionally, we find that the performance of the structure-based approach is dependent on the quality and number of example entities given. We experiment with a number of hybrid techniques that balance between the two approaches and find that a method that uses the example entities to determine the weights of approaches in the combination on a per query basis is most effective.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges in the implementation of web-scale online search systems is the disambiguation of the user input when portions of the input queries are possibly misspelt. Spell correctors that must be integrated with such systems have very stringent restrictions imposed on them; primarily they must possess the ability to handle large volume of concurrent queries and generate relevant spelling suggestions at a very high speed. Often, these systems consist of highend server machines with lots of memory and processing power and the requirement from such spell correctors is to minimize the latency of generating suggestions to a bare minimum.In this paper, we present a spell corrector that we developed to cater to high volume incoming queries for an online search service. It consists of a fast, per-token candidate generator which generates spell suggestions within a distance of two edit operations of an input token. We compare its performance against an n-gram based spell corrector and show that the presented spell candidate generation approach has lower response times.},

The findings in this paper suggest that there is a way of modelling recommendation confidence that is related to accuracy (MAE, RMSE and NDCG) and user rating behaviour (rated vs unrated items). In particular, it was found that unrated items have lower confidence compared to the entire item set - highlighting the importance of explanations for novel but risky recommendations.},

This document set is often retrieved from the collection using a simple unsupervised bag-of-words method, e.g. BM25. This can potentially lead to learning a sub-optimal ranking, since many relevant documents may be excluded from the initially retrieved set. In this paper we propose a novel two-stage learning framework to address this problem. We first learn a ranking function over the entire retrieval collection using a limited set of textual features including weighted phrases, proximities and expansion terms. This function is then used to retrieve the best possible subset of documents over which the final model is trained using a larger set of query- and document-dependent features. Empirical evaluation using two web collections unequivocally demonstrates that our proposed two-stage framework, being able to learn its model from more relevant documents, outperforms current learning to rank approaches.},

abstract = {Search engines use replication and distribution of large indices across many query servers to achieve efficient retrieval. Under high query load, queries can be scheduled to replicas that are expected to be idle soonest, facilitated by the use of predicted query response times. However, the overhead of making response time predictions can hinder the usefulness of query scheduling under low query load. In this paper, we propose a hybrid scheduling approach that combines the scheduling methods appropriate for both low and high load conditions, and can adapt in response to changing conditions. We deploy a simulation framework, which is prepared with actual and predicted response times for real Web search queries for one full day. Our experiments using different numbers of shards and replicas of the 50 million document ClueWeb09 corpus show that hybrid scheduling can reduce the average waiting times of one day of queries by 68% under high load conditions and by 7% under low load conditions w.r.t. traditional scheduling methods.},

abstract = {In this paper we address the problem of modelling relational data, which has appeared in many applications such as social network analysis, recommender systems and bioinformatics. Previous studies either consider latent feature based models to do link prediction in the relational data but disregarding local structure in the network, or focus exclusively on capturing network structure of objects based on latent blockmodels without coupling with latent characteristics of objects to avoid redundant information. To combine the benefits of the previous work, we model the relational data as a function of both latent feature factors and latent cluster memberships of objects via our proposed Latent Factor BlockModel (LFBM) to collectively discover globally predictive intrinsic properties of objects and capture the latent block structure. We also develop an optimization transfer algorithm to learn the latent factors. Extensive experiments on the synthetic data and several real world datasets suggest that our proposed LFBM model outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for modelling the relational data.},

Hierarchies built by this process are usually sensitive to query changes. For search sessions with multiple queries, this could be undesirable since it may leave users a seemly random overview and partly diminish the benefits that SRC intents to offer. We propose to integrate external knowledge from Wikipedia when building concept hierarchies to boost their stability for session queries. Our evaluations on both TREC 2010 and 2011 Session tracks demonstrate that the proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art hierarchy construction algorithms in stability of search results organization.},

This information, while often voluminous, is frequently degraded by the inclusion of unimportant, duplicate, or wrong information. It is important to be able to present users with only the novel, important information about these events as they develop. We present the problem of updating users about time critical news events, and focus on the task of deciding which information to select for updating users as an event develops. We propose a solution to this problem which incorporates techniques from information retrieval and multi-document summarization and evaluate this approach on a set of historic events using a large stream of news documents. We also introduce an evaluation method which is significantly less expensive than traditional approaches to temporal summarization.},

We ask each group to manually construct queries to respond to TREC information needs and calculate their resulting recall and precision. Traditional web interface users are provided feedback on their initial queries and asked to use this information to reformulate their original queries.

Tag co-occurrence has been shown to improve image annotation by identifying additional keywords associated with user-provided keywords. However, existing approaches have treated tag co-occurrence as a static measure over time, thereby ignoring the temporal trends of many tags. The temporal distribution of tags, however, caused by events, seasons, memes, etc. provide a strong source of evidence beyond keywords for AIA. In this paper we propose a temporal tag co-occurrence approach to improve upon the current state-of-the-art automatic image annotation model. By replacing the annotated tags with more temporally significant tags, we achieve statistically significant increases to annotation accuracy on a real-life timestamped image collection from Flickr.},

In order to leverage users' efforts, we present a set of state-of-the-art ephemeral clustering algorithms, which allow to summarize web image search results into meaningful clusters. This way of presenting visual information on mobile devices is exhaustively evaluated based on two main criteria: clustering accuracy, which must be maximized, and wasted space-interface, which must be minimized. For the first case, we use a broad set of metrics to evaluate ephemeral clustering over a public golden standard data set of web images. For the second case, we propose a new metric to evaluate the mismatch of the used space-interface between the ground truth and the cluster distribution obtained by ephemeral clustering. The results evidence that there exist high divergences between clustering accuracy and used space maximization. As a consequence, the trade-off of cluster-based exploration of web image search results on mobile devices is difficult to define, although our study evidences some clear positive results.},

abstract = {Social networks have emerged as hubs of user generated content. Online social conversations can be used to retrieve users interests towards given topics and trends. Microblogging platforms like Twitter are primary examples of social networks with significant volumes of topical message exchanges between users. However, unlike traditional online discussion forums, blogs and social networking sites, explicit discussion threads are absent from microblogging networks like Twitter. This inherent absence of any conversation framework makes it challenging to distinguish conversations from mere topical interests. In this work, we explore semantic, social and temporal relationships of topical clusters formed in Twitter to identify conversations. We devise an algorithm comprising of a sequence of steps such as text clustering, topical similarity detection using TF-IDF and Wordnet, and intersecting social, semantic and temporal graphs to discover social conversations around topics. We further qualitatively show the presence of social localization of discussion threads. Our results suggest that discussion threads evolve significantly over social networks on Twitter. Our algorithm to find social discussion threads can be used for settings such as social information spreading applications and information diffusion analyses on microblog networks.},

Due to the small scale and specialized nature of such systems, we often do not have the luxury of depending on query logs for finding query suggestions. We propose a retrieval model for generating query suggestions for search on a set of problem solution pairs. We harness the problem solution partition inherent in such repositories to improve upon traditional query suggestion mechanisms designed for systems that search over general textual corpora. We evaluate our technique over real problem-solution datasets and illustrate that our technique provides large and statistically significant improvements over the state-of-the-art technique in query suggestion.},

abstract = {Explicit semantic analysis (ESA) is a technique for computing semantic relatedness between natural language texts. It is a document-based distributional model similar to latent semantic analysis (LSA), which is often built on the Wikipedia database when it is required for general English usage. Unlike LSA, however, ESA does not use dimensionality reduction, and therefore it is sometimes unable to account for similarity between words that do not co-occur with same concepts, even if their concepts themselves cover similar subjects. In the Wikipedia implementation ESA concepts are Wikipedia articles, and the Wikilinks between the articles are used to overcome the concept-similarity problem. In this paper, we provide two general solutions for integration of concept-concept similarities into the ESA model, ones that do not rely on a particular corpus structure and do not alter the explicit concept-mapping properties that distinguish ESA from models like LSA and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).},

abstract = {Scientific documents often adopt a well-defined vocabulary and avoid the use of ambiguous terms. However, as soon as documents from different research sub-communities are considered in combination, many scientific terms become ambiguous as the same term can refer to different concepts from different sub-communities. The ability to correctly identify the right sense of a given term can considerably improve the effectiveness of retrieval models, and can also support additional features such as search diversification. This is even more critical when applied to explorative search systems within the scientific domain.In this paper, we propose novel semi-supervised methods to term disambiguation leveraging the structure of a community-based ontology of scientific concepts. Our approach exploits the graph structure that connects different terms and their definitions to automatically identify the correct sense that was originally picked by the authors of a scientific publication. Experimental evidence over two different test collections from the physics and biomedical domains shows that the proposed method is effective and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches based on feature vectors constructed out of term co-occurrences as well as standard supervised approaches.},

This idea has been implemented by ranking the images according to their average distances to their nearest neighbors. This query-dependent re-ranking is completed by a query-independent re-ranking taking into account the fact that some types of images are non-relevant for almost all queries. This idea is implemented by training a classifier on results from all queries in the training set.

abstract = {This paper presents a novel method for encoding local binary descriptors for Visual Object Categorization (VOC). Nowadays, local binary descriptors, e.g. LBP and BRIEF, have become very popular in image matching tasks because of their fast computation and matching using binary bitstrings. However, the bottleneck of applying them in the domain of VOC lies in the high dimensional histograms produced by encoding these binary bitstrings into decimal codes. To solve this problem, we propose to encode local binary bitstrings directly by the Bag-of-Features (BoF) model with Hamming distance. The advantages of this approach are two-fold: (1) It solves the high dimensionality issue of the traditional binary bitstring encoding methods, making local binary descriptors more feasible for the task of VOC, especially when more bits are considered; (2) It is computationally efficient because the Hamming distance, which is very suitable for comparing bitstrings, is based on bitwise XOR operations that can be fast computed on modern CPUs. The proposed method is validated by applying on LBP feature for the purpose of VOC. The experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2007 benchmark show that our approach effectively improves the recognition accuracy compared to the traditional LBP feature.},

Traditional query recommendation methods usually focus on recommending users relevant queries, which attempt to find alternative queries with close search intent to the original query. Whereas the ultimate goal of query recommendation is to assist users to accomplish their search task successfully, while not just find relevant queries in spite of they can sometimes return useful search results. To better achieve the ultimate goal of query recommendation, a more reasonable way is to recommend users high utility queries, i.e., queries that can return more useful information. In this paper, we propose a novel utility query recommendation approach based on absorbing random walk on the session-flow graph, which can learn queries' utility by simultaneously modeling both users' reformulation behaviors and click behaviors. Extensively experiments were conducted on real query logs, and the results show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under the evaluation metric QRR and MRD.},

abstract = {Traditional link-based web ranking algorithms are applied to web snapshots in the form of webgraphs consisting of pages as vertices and links as edges. Constructing webgraph, researchers do not pay attention to a particular method of how links are taken into account, while certain details may significantly affects the contribution of link-based factors to ranking. Furthermore, researchers use small subgraphs of the webgraph for more efficient evaluation of new algorithms. They usually consider a graph induced by pages, for example, of a certain first level domain. In this paper we reveal a significant dependence of PageRank on the method of accounting redirects while constructing the webgraph. We evaluate several natural ways of redirect accounting on a large-scale domain and find an optimal case, which turns out non-trivial. Moreover, we experimentally compare different ways of extracting a small subgraph for multiple evaluations and reveal some essential shortcomings of traditional approaches.},

These features are applicable to all words; it eliminates the need to continuous manual dictionary renewal. Our experiments are based on a sentiment dictionary for the Russian language.

When we analyse how people consume their search resource (i.e., a total number of search actions taken to complete a task) over the time, it was observed that there was a different pattern in successful sessions and unsuccessful sessions. Successful sessions tend to have a regular tempo in search actions while poor sessions tend to have uneven distribution of resource usage. The resource consumption graph also allows us to observe where in the search process was affected by experimental conditions. Therefore, this paper suggests that tempo of search actions can be exploited to model successful search sessions.},

Then we generate several classification hypotheses with such classifiers and rerank them to select the best one. Our rerankers exploit category dependencies, which allow them to recover from the multiclassifier errors whereas their application in top-down fashion results in high efficiency. The experimentation on Reuters Corpus Volume 1 (RCV1) shows that our incremental reranking is as accurate as global rerankers but at least one magnitude order faster.},

The proposed method makes use of two types of feedback, time feedback by evaluating the time distribution of top retrieved tweets, and query expansion by using highly frequent terms in top tweets as expanded terms. Our results suggest that using both types of feedback, we get better results than using a standard language model, and the time-based feedback uniformly improves results whether query expansion is used or not.},

We then examine Intent-Aware Expected Reciprocal Rank (ERR-IA), one of the official measures used to assess diversity in TREC 2011-12, with respect to the proposed user models. By analyzing ranking preferences as expressed by the user models and those estimated by ERR-IA, we investigate whether ERR-IA assesses document rankings according to the requirements of the diversity retrieval task expressed by the two models. Empirical results demonstrate that ERR-IA neglects query-intents coverage by attributing excessive importance to redundant relevant documents. ERR-IA behavior is contrary to the user models that require measures to first assess diversity through the coverage of intents, and then assess the redundancy of relevant intents. Furthermore, diversity should be considered separately from document relevance and the documents positions in the ranking.},

We compare several state-of-the-art late data fusion methods, and present a new semi-supervised variant that accounts for microblog characteristics. Our experiments show the utility of late data fusion in microblog search, and that our method helps boost retrieval effectiveness.},

abstract = {One of the challenges of searching in the medical domain is to deal with the complexity and ambiguity of medical terminology. Concept-based representation approaches using terminology from domain-specific resources have been developed to handle such a challenge. However, it has been shown that these techniques are effective only when combined with a traditional term-based representation approach. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to represent medical records and queries by focusing only on medical concepts essential for the information need of a medical search task. Such a representation could enhance retrieval effectiveness since only the medical concepts crucial to the information need are taken into account. We evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of our proposed approach in the context of the TREC 2011 Medical Records track. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, as it significantly outperforms a baseline where all concepts are represented, and markedly outperforms a traditional term-based representation baseline. Moreover, when combining the relevance scores obtained from our technique and a term-based representation approach, the achieved performance is comparable to the best TREC 2011 systems.},

We parameterize CORI and evaluate its performance across a range of parameter settings. Experimental results on three distributed retrieval testbeds show that CORI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art results merging and score normalization methods when its parameter goes to infinity.},

To bridge this vocabulary mismatch, we propose a conceptual approach that transforms the content into a conceptual space that represent the latent concepts of the content. We empirically show that the conceptual model performs better than various state-of-the-art techniques the performance gain obtained are substantial and significant.},

We also show that typical XML retrieval systems tend to perform poorly on focused queries and that systems ranking differs considerably when processing each of the types. Finally, we argue that the unbalanced number of focused queries in the INEX benchmark topic set might lead to misleading interpretations of the evaluation results.

Current diversity evaluation measures take the popularity of the subtopics into account and aim to favour systems that promote most popular subtopics earliest in the result ranking. However, this subtopic popularity is assumed to be static over time. In this paper, we hypothesise that temporal subtopic popularity change is common for many topics and argue this characteristic should be considered when evaluating diversity. Firstly, to support our hypothesis we analyse temporal subtopic popularity changes for ambiguous queries through historic Wikipedia article viewing statistics. Further, by simulation, we demonstrate the impact of this temporal intent variability on diversity evaluation.},

abstract = {We present $mathcal{DS}^4$, a Distributed Social and Semantic Search System that allows users to share content among friends and clusters of users. In $mathcal{DS}^4$ nodes that are semantically, thematically, or socially similar are automatically discovered and logically organised. Content retrieval is then performed by routing the query towards social friends and clusters of nodes that are likely to answer it. In this way, search receives two facets: the social facet, addressing friends, and the semantic facet, addressing nodes that are semantically close to the query. $mathcal{DS}^4$ is scalable (requires no centralised component), privacy-aware (users maintain ownership and control over their content), automatic (requires no intervention by the user), general (works for any type of content), and adaptive (adjusts to changes of user content or interests). In this work, we aim to design the next generation of social networks that will offer open and adaptive design, and privacy-aware content management.},

abstract = {The process of retrieving information for literature review purposes differs from traditional web information retrieval. Literature reviews differentiate between the weightiness of the retrieved data segments. For example, citations and their accompanying information, such as cited author, citation context etc., are a very important consideration when searching for relevant information in literature. However, this information is integrated into a scientific paper, in rich interrelationships, making it very complicated for standard search systems to present and track them efficiently. In this paper, we demonstrate a system, VisNavi, in the form of a visualized star-centered approach that introduces the rich citation interrelationships to the searchers in an effective and navigational appearance.},

abstract = {Political Hashtag Trends (PHT) is an analysis tool for political left-vs.-right polarization of Twitter hashtags. PHT computes a leaning for trending, political hashtags in a given week, giving insights into the polarizing U.S. American issues on Twitter. The leaning of a hashtag is derived in two steps. First, users retweeting a set of "seed users" with a known political leaning, such as Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, are identified and the corresponding leaning is assigned to retweeters. Second, a hashtag is assigned a fractional leaning corresponding to which retweeting users used it. Non-political hashtags are removed by requiring certain hashtag co-occurrence patterns. PHT also offers functionality to put the results into context. For example, it shows example tweets from different leanings, it shows historic information and it links to the New York Times archives to explore a topic in depth. In this paper, we describe the underlying methodology and the functionality of the demo.},

Unlike current online photo sharing services that take the average rating as the aesthetic score, our system integrates various ratings from different users by jointly modeling images and users' expertise in a regression framework. In the front-end, users are asked to rate images selected by an active learning process. A multi-observer regression model is employed in the back-end to integrate these ratings for predicting the aesthetic value of images. Moreover, the system can be incorporated into current photo sharing services as complement by providing more accurate ratings.},

In this tutorial we briefly discuss main DIR phases, that are resource description, resource selection, results merging and results presentation.

abstract = {Probabilistic topic models are a group of unsupervised generative machine learning models that can be effectively trained on large text collections. They model document content as a two-step generation process, i.e., documents are observed as mixtures of latent topics, while topics are probability distributions over vocabulary words. Recently, a significant research effort has been invested into transferring the probabilistic topic modeling concept from monolingual to multilingual settings. Novel topic models have been designed to work with parallel and comparable multilingual data (e.g., Wikipedia or news data discussing the same events). Probabilistic topics models offer an elegant way to represent content across different languages. Their probabilistic framework allows for their easy integration into a language modeling framework for monolingual and cross-lingual information retrieval. Moreover, we present how to use the knowledge from the topic models in the tasks of cross-lingual event clustering, cross-lingual document classification and the detection of cross-lingual semantic similarity of words. The tutorial also demonstrates how semantically similar words across languages are integrated as useful additional evidences in cross-lingual information retrieval models.},

Because this technique is directly based on observed user behavior, it is a promising alternative to traditional offline evaluation, which is based on manual relevance assessments. In particular, online evaluation can enable comparisons in settings where reliable assessments are difficult to obtain (e.g., personalized search) or expensive (e.g., for search by trained experts in specialized collections).Despite its advantages, and its successful use in commercial settings, online evaluation is rarely employed outside of large commercial search engines due to a perception that it is impractical at small scales. The goal of this tutorial is to show how online evaluations can be conducted in such settings, demonstrate software to facilitate its use, and promote further research in the area. We will also contrast online evaluation with standard offline evaluation, and provide an overview of online approaches.},

abstract = {Professional search in specific domains (e.g. patent, medical, scientific literature, media) usually needs an exploratory type of search which is characterized more often, in comparison to fact finding and question answering web search, by recall-oriented information needs and by uncertainty and evolution or change of the information need. Additionally, the complexity of the tasks that need to be performed by professional searchers, which usually include not only retrieval but also information analysis and monitoring tasks, require association, pipelining and possibly integration of information as well as synchronization and coordination of multiple and potentially concurrent search views produced from different datasets, search tools and UIs. Many facets of IR technology (e.g. exploratory search, aggregated search, federated search, task-based search, IR over query sessions, cognitive IR approaches, Human Computer and Information Retrieval) aim to at least partially address these demands. This workshop aims to stimulate exploratory research, bring together various facets of IR research and promote discussion between researchers towards the development of a generalised framework facilitating the integration of IR technologies and search tools into next generation professional search systems. This envisioned framework should be supported from new or the extension of existing protocols and may influence the design of next generation professional search systems.},

Over the years, more and more user-related information such as click information or search history has entered the equation creating more and more personalized search experiences, though still within the scope of the same overall system. Though fully personalized search is probably desirable, this individualistic perspective does not exploit the fact that a lot of a users behavior can be explained through their group membership. Children, despite individual differences, share many challenges and needs; as do men, Republicans, Chinese or any user group. This workshop takes a group-centric approach to IR and invites contributions that either (i) propose and evaluate IR systems for a particular user group or that (ii) describe how the search behavior of specific groups differ, potentially requiring a different way of addressing their needs.},
