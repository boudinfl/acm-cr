abstract = {In the course of a search session, searchers often modify their queries several times. In most previous work analyzing search logs, the addition of terms to a query is identified with query specification and the removal of terms with query generalization. By analyzing the result sets that motivated searchers to make modifications, we show that this interpretation is not always correct. In fact, our experiments indicate that in the majority of cases the modifications have the opposite functions. Terms are often removed to get rid of irrelevant results matching only part of the query and thus to make the result set more specific. Similarly, terms are often added to retrieve more diverse results. We propose an alternative interpretation of term additions and removals and show that it explains the deviant modification behavior that was observed.},

abstract = {Search queries have been roughly classified into three categories --- navigational, informational and transactional. The latter group includes queries that aim to perform some Web-mediated task, often by interacting with parameterized Web services. In order to assist users in completing tasks online, one of the first building blocks is identifying whether and which transactional use-case is associated with each query.This paper describes a framework and an algorithm for automatically generating compact representations of queries associated with transactional use cases. We mine search click logs for queries that lead to clicks on pages associated with a use-case, generalize the set of mined queries into templates by replacing query terms with taxonomy categories, and eliminate redundancies. This approach allows associating the use-case with queries unseen in the log sample, while keeping a concise model. Our methodology allows a business owner to select an appropriate operating point that balances the tradeoff between precision and recall. We report the results of an offline evaluation of our framework on three transactional domains, and demonstrate the viability of the approach.},

Anyhow, it still is a challenge for current search engines to decide which news events are worth being shown to the user (either for a newsworthy query or in a news portal). In this paper we define the task of predicting the future impact of news events. Being able to predict event impact will, for example, enable a newspaper to decide whether to follow a specific event or not, or a news search engine which stories to display. We define a flexible framework that, given some definition of impact, can predict its future development at the beginning of the event. We evaluate several possible definitions of event impact and experimentally identify the best features for each of them.},

abstract = {Identifying child-appropriate web content is an important yet difficult classification task. This novel task is characterised by attempting to determine age/child appropriateness (which is not necessarily topic-based), despite the presence of unbalanced class sizes and the lack of quality training data with human judgements of appropriateness. Classification of feeds, a subset of web content, presents further challenges due to their temporal nature and short document format. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and present baseline results for this task through an empirical study that classifies incoming news stories as appropriate (or not) for children. We show that while the na\"{\i}ve Bayes approach produces a higher AUC it is vulnerable to the imbalanced data problem, and that support vector machine provides a more robust overall solution. Our research shows that classifying children's content is a non-trivial task that has greater complexities than standard text based classification. While the F-score values are consistent with other research examining age-appropriate text classification, we introduce a new problem with a new dataset.},

abstract = {The free-form tags available from social bookmarking sites such as Delicious have been shown to be useful for a number of purposes and could serve as a cheap source of metadata about URLs on the web. Unfortunately recent years have seen a reduction in the popularity of such sites, however at the same time microblogging sites such as Twitter have exploded in popularity. On these sites users submit short messages (or "tweets") about what they are currently reading, thinking and doing and often post URLs.In this work we look into the similarity between top tags drawn from Delicious and high-frequency terms from tweets to ascertain whether Twitter data could serve as a useful replacement for Delicious. We investigate how these terms compare with web page content, whether or not top Twitter terms converge and determine if the terms are mostly descriptive (and therefore useful) or if they are mostly expressing sentiment or emotion. We discover that provided a large number of tweets are available referring to a chosen URL then the top terms drawn from these tweets are similar to Delicious tags and could therefore be used for similar purposes.},

Large numbers of items uploaded to Flickr do not contain GPS-based latitude/longitude coordinates, although it would be beneficial to obtain such geographic information for a wide variety of potential applications such as travelogues and visual place descriptions. While most works in this area consider an image's textual meta-data to estimate its geo-location, we consider an additional textual dimension: the image owner's traces on the social Web, in particular on the micro-blogging platform Twitter. We investigate the following question: does enriching an image's available textual meta-data with a user's tweets improve the accuracy of the geographic location estimation process? The results show that this is indeed the case; in an oracle setting, the median error in kilometres decreases by 87%, in the best automatic approach the median error decreases by 56%.},

abstract = {Many search applications involve documents with structure or fields. Since query terms often are related to specific structural components, mapping queries to fields and assigning weights to those fields is critical for retrieval effectiveness. Although several field-based retrieval models have been developed, there has not been a formal justification of field weighting.In this work, we aim to improve the field weighting for structured document retrieval. We first introduce the notion of field relevance as the generalization of field weights, and discuss how it can be estimated using relevant documents, which effectively implements relevance feedback for field weighting. We then propose a framework for estimating field relevance based on the combination of several sources. Evaluation on several structured document collections show that field weighting based on the suggested framework improves retrieval effectiveness significantly.},

abstract = {Traditional retrieval models compute term weights based on only the information related to individual terms such as TF and IDF. However, query terms are related. Intuitively, these relations could provide useful information about the importance of a term in the context of other query terms. For example, query "perl tutorial" specifies that a user look for information relevant to both perl and tutorial. Thus, a document containing both terms should have higher relevance score than the ones with only one of them. However, if the IDF value of "tutorial" is much smaller than "perl", existing retrieval models may assign the document lower score than those containing multiple occurrences of "perl". It is clear that the importance of a term should be dependent on not only collection statistics but also the relations with other query terms. In this work, we study how to utilize semantic relations among query terms to regularize term weighting. Experiment results over TREC collections show that the proposed strategy is effective to improve the retrieval performance.},

abstract = {The Web of Data describes objects, entities, or "things" in terms of their attributes and their relationships, using RDF statements. There is a need to make this wealth of knowledge easily accessible by means of keyword search. Despite recent research efforts in this direction, there is a lack of understanding of how structured semantic data is best represented for text-based entity retrieval. The task we are addressing in this paper is ad-hoc entity search: the retrieval of RDF resources that represent an entity described in the keyword query. We build upon and formalise existing entity modeling approaches within a generative language modeling framework, and compare them experimentally using a standard test collection, provided by the Semantic Search Challenge evaluation series. We show that these models outperform the current state-of-the-art in terms of retrieval effectiveness, however, this is done at the cost of abandoning a large part of the semantics behind the data. We propose a novel entity model capable of preserving the semantics associated with entities, without sacrificing retrieval effectiveness.},

The first method is the commonly used majority voting (MV) which determines the document relevance based on the label that received the most votes, treating all the workers equally. The second is a probabilistic model that concurrently estimates the document relevance and the workers accuracy using expectation maximization (EM). We run simulations and conduct experiments with crowdsourced relevance labels from the INEX 2010 Book Search track to investigate the accuracy and robustness of the relevance assessments to the noisy labels. We observe the effect of the derived relevance judgments on the ranking of the search systems. Our experimental results show that the EM method outperforms the MV method in the accuracy of relevance assessments and IR systems ranking. The performance improvements are especially noticeable when the number of labels per document is small and the labels are of varied quality.},

First, the underlying recommendation model is built fully automatically in an unsupervised way and it can be easily extended with heterogeneous sources of information. Moreover, recommendations are personalized according to the places previously visited by the user. Finally, such personalized recommendations can be generated very efficiently even on-line from a mobile device.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study how to automatically predict reliability of web pages in the medical domain. Assessing reliability of online medical information is especially critical as it may potentially influence vulnerable patients seeking help online. Unfortunately, there are no automated systems currently available that can classify a medical webpage as being reliable, while manual assessment cannot scale up to process the large number of medical pages on the Web. We propose a supervised learning approach to automatically predict reliability of medical webpages. We developed a gold standard dataset using the standard reliability criteria defined by the Health on Net Foundation and systematically experimented with different link and content based feature sets. Our experiments show promising results with prediction accuracies of over 80%. We also show that our proposed prediction method is useful in applications such as reliability-based re-ranking and automatic website accreditation.},

abstract = {Automatic organization of email messages into folders is both an open problem and challenge for machine learning techniques. Besides the effect of email overload, which affects many email users worldwide, there are some increasing difficulties caused by the semantics applied by each user. The varying number of folders and their meaning are personal and in many cases pose difficulties to learning methods. This paper addresses automatic organization of email messages into folders, based on supervised learning algorithms. The textual fields of the email message (subject and body) are considered for learning, with different representations, feature selection methods, and classifiers. The participant fields are embedded into a vector-space model representation. The classification decisions from the different email fields are combined by majority voting. Experiments on a subset of the Enron Corpus and on a private email data set show the significant improvement over both single classifiers on these fields as well as over previous works.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of BM25 retrieval function is mainly due to its sub-linear term frequency (TF) normalization component, which is controlled by a parameter k1. Although BM25 was derived based on the classic probabilistic retrieval model, it has been so far unclear how to interpret its parameter k1 probabilistically, making it hard to optimize the setting of this parameter. In this paper, we provide a novel probabilistic interpretation of the BM25 TF normalization and its parameter k1 based on a log-logistic model for the probability of seeing a document in the collection with a given level of TF. The proposed interpretation allows us to derive different approaches to estimation of parameter k1 based solely on the current collection without requiring any training data, thus effectively eliminating one free parameter from BM25. Our experiment results show that the proposed approaches can accurately predict the optimal k1 without requiring training data and achieve better or comparable retrieval performance to a well-tuned BM25 where k1 is optimized based on training data.},

abstract = {In many Information Retrieval (IR) tasks, documents should be ranked based on a combination of multiple criteria. Therefore, we would need to score a document in each criterion aspect of relevance and then combine the criteria scores to generate a final score for each document. Linear combination of these aspect scores has so far been the dominant approach due to its simplicity and effectiveness. However, such a strategy of combination requires that the scores to be combined are "comparable" to each other, an assumption that generally does not hold due to the different ways of scoring each criterion. Thus it is necessary to transform the raw scores for different criteria appropriately to make them more comparable before combination. In this paper we propose a new principled approach to score transformation in linear combination, in which we would learn a separate non-linear transformation function for each relevance criterion based on the Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) algorithm and BoxCox Transformation. Experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and is also robust against non-linear perturbations of the original scores.},

A main challenge in applying translation models to ad hoc information retrieval is to estimate a translation model without training data. In this paper, we perform axiomatic analysis of translation language model for retrieval in order to gain insights about how to optimize the estimation of translation probabilities. We propose a set of constraints that a reasonable translation language model should satisfy. We check these constraints on the state-of-the-art translation estimation method based on Mutual Information and find that it does not satisfy most of the constraints. We then propose a new estimation method that better satisfies the defined constraints. Experimental results on representative TREC data sets show that the proposed new estimation method outperforms the existing Mutual Information-based estimation, suggesting that the proposed constraints are indeed helpful for designing better estimation methods for translation language model.},

The results of the experimental comparisons between these extensions and existing CLIR systems, on three collections and three language pairs, reveal that the cross-language extension of the LL model provides a state-of-the-art CLIR system, yielding the best performance overall.},

abstract = {Inferring the distributions of relevant and nonrelevant documents over a ranked list of scored documents returned by a retrieval system has a broad range of applications including information filtering, recall-oriented retrieval, metasearch, and distributed IR. Typically, the distribution of documents over scores is modeled by a mixture of two distributions, one for the relevant and one for the nonrelevant documents, and expectation maximization (EM) is run to estimate the mixture parameters. A large volume of work has focused on selecting the appropriate form of the two distributions in the mixture. In this work we consider the form of the distributions as a given and we focus on the inference algorithm. We extend the EM algorithm (a) by simultaneously considering the ranked lists of documents returned by multiple retrieval systems, and (b) by encoding in the algorithm the constraint that the same document retrieved by multiple systems should have the same, global, probability of relevance. We test the new inference algorithm using TREC data and we demonstrate that it outperforms the regular EM algorithm. It is better calibrated in inferring the probability of document's relevance, and it is more effective when applied on the task of metasearch.},

abstract = {The top-k retrieval problem aims to find the optimal set of k documents from a number of relevant documents given the user's query. The key issue is to balance the relevance and diversity of the top-k search results. In this paper, we address this problem using Facility Location Analysis taken from Operations Research, where the locations of facilities are optimally chosen according to some criteria. We show how this analysis technique is a generalization of state-of-the-art retrieval models for diversification (such as the Modern Portfolio Theory for Information Retrieval), which treat the top-k search results like "obnoxious facilities" that should be dispersed as far as possible from each other. However, Facility Location Analysis suggests that the top-k search results could be treated like "desirable facilities" to be placed as close as possible to their customers. This leads to a new top-k retrieval model where the best representatives of the relevant documents are selected. In a series of experiments conducted on two TREC diversity collections, we show that significant improvements can be made over the current state-of-the-art through this alternative treatment of the top-k retrieval problem.},

abstract = {A major challenge when dealing with large collections of digital images is to find relevant objects, especially when no metadata on the objects is available. Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) addresses this problem but usually lacks query images that are good enough to express the user's information need. Therefore, in Query-by-Sketch, CBIR has been considered with user provided sketches as query objects --- but so far, this has suffered from the limitations of existing user interfaces. In this paper, we present a novel user interface for query by sketch that exploits emergent interactive paper and digital pen technology. Users can draw sketches on paper in a user-friendly way. Search can be started interactively from the paper front-end, due to a streaming interface from the digital pen to the underlying CBIR system. We present the implementation of the interactive paper/digital pen interface on top of QbS, our system for CBIR using sketches, and we present in detail the evaluation of the system on the basis of the MIRFLICKR-25000 image collection.},

abstract = {Text illustration is a multimedia retrieval task that consists in finding suitable images to illustrate text fragments such as blog entries, news reports or children stories. In this paper we describe a crossmedia retrieval system which, given a textual input, selects a short list of candidate images from a large media collection. This approach makes use of a recently proposed method to map metadata and visual features into a common textual representation that can be handled by traditional information retrieval engines. Content-based analysis is enhanced by visual abstraction, namely the Anisotropic Kuwahara Filter, which impacts feature information captured by the Joint Composite and Speeded Up Robust Features visual descriptors. For evaluation purposes, we used the well-established MIRFlickr photo collection, with 25,000 photos and user tags collected from Flickr as well as manual annotations provided as image retrieval groundtruth. Results show that image abstraction can improve visual retrieval as well as significantly reduce processing and storage requirements, even more when paired with Google's WebP image format. We conclude that applying a visual rerank after an initial text retrieval step improves the quality of results, and that the adopted text mapping method for visual descriptors provides an effective crossmedia approach for text illustration.},

abstract = {Since their introduction, ranking SVM models [11] have become a powerful tool for training content-based retrieval systems. All we need for training a model are retrieval examples in the form of triplet constraints, i.e. examples specifying that relative to some query, a database item a should be ranked higher than database item b. These types of constraints could be obtained from feedback of users of the retrieval system. Most previous ranking models learn either a global combination of elementary similarity functions or a combination defined with respect to a single database item. Instead, we propose a "coarse to fine" ranking model where given a query we first compute a distribution over "coarse" classes and then use the linear combination that has been optimized for queries of that class. These coarse classes are hidden and need to be induced by the training algorithm. We propose a latent variable ranking model that induces both the latent classes and the weights of the linear combination for each class from ranking triplets. Our experiments over two large image datasets and a text retrieval dataset show the advantages of our model over learning a global combination as well as a combination for each test point (i.e. transductive setting). Furthermore, compared to the transductive approach our model has a clear computational advantages since it does not need to be retrained for each test query.},

abstract = {Constrained clustering is a recently presented family of semi-supervised learning algorithms. These methods use domain information to impose constraints over the clustering output. The way in which those constraints (typically pair-wise constraints between documents) are introduced is by designing new clustering algorithms that enforce the accomplishment of the constraints. In this paper we present an alternative approach for constrained clustering where, instead of defining new algorithms or objective functions, the constraints are introduced modifying the document representation by means of their language modelling. More precisely the constraints are modelled using the well-known Relevance Models successfully used in other retrieval tasks such as pseudo-relevance feedback. To the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to try such approach. The results show that the presented approach is an effective method for constrained clustering even improving the results of existing constrained clustering algorithms.},

The models subsequently introduce propagation between messages reported by the same user, messages authored by the same user, and messages with similar content. Each of the models can also be converted to a simple semi-supervised scheme. We test our models on data from a popular social network and compare the models to two baselines, based on message content and raw report counts.

Our approach waives the common practice of expanding the feature-space with new dimensions derived either from explicit or from latent semantic analysis. As a consequence it is simple and maintains a compact intelligible representation of the output categories.

In this paper, we propose techniques where the TTL values are set in an adaptive manner, on a per-query basis. Our results show that the proposed techniques reduce the fraction of stale results served by the cache and also decrease the fraction of redundant query evaluations on the search engine backend compared to a strategy using a fixed TTL value for all queries.},

The final result is very simple and implies to compute just five parameters that depend on the input data and the performance of the search engine. The model is validated through extensive experimental results and is motivated on capacity planning and the overall optimization of the search architecture.},

We compare these models using the inference of average precision as a measure of utility. For the three models studied in this paper, we conclude that adhering to the RFCH is practically useful for the two-normal model, makes no difference for the two-gamma model, and degrades the performance of the two-lognormal model.},

This paper investigates a semi-automatic solution where only the predictions for the documents which are more likely to be correctly classified would be considered. This method provides high-quality automatic classification for large subsets of the collection and employs human expertise for the "most complicated" decisions. This research presents different approaches to measure document difficulty and it discusses the benefits of applying it for semi-automatic classification. In addition, experiments are carried out to show the results achieved for different subsets of the collection. Experiments prove that it is possible to improve quality significantly with large subsets (i.e. 13% micro-f1 increase with 70% of documents) of two different collections. Furthermore, it shows how it provides a flexible mechanism to apply automatic classification to specific subsets while specific constrains are met.},

The summaries are then used to index the images. In this paper we investigate how various summarization techniques affect image retrieval performance and show significant improvements can be obtained when using the summaries for indexing.},

The resulting string often does not match its intended translation which hurts retrieval. We propose an approach to extract the correct word from such strings using word segmentation along with approximate string matching using Soundex algorithm &amp; Levenshtein distance. We evaluate our approach across three Indian languages and find an average improvement of 5.8% MAP on the FIRE-2010 dataset.},

We also give a mini-batch version which allows an efficient dynamic processing of data points as they arrive in groups. Our experiments on the TDT5 benchmark collection show the superiority of both versions of this algorithm compared to other state-of-the-art alternatives.},

We conduct experiments on ensemble pruning-based news article categorization to measure its accuracy and time cost. The results show that our heuristics reduce the time cost of the second phase. Also we can make a trade-off between accuracy and time cost to improve both of them with appropriate pruning degrees.},

Despite the research interest in the field of social networks, few has been done up to now w.r.t. information access in multi-relational social networks where queries can be multifaceted queries (e.g. a mix of textual key-words and key-persons in some social context). We propose a unified and efficient framework to address such complex queries on multi-modal "social" collections, working in 3 distinct phases, namely: (I) aggregation of documents into modal profiles, (II) expansion of mono-modal subqueries to mono-modal and multi-modal subqueries, (III) relevance score computation through late fusion of the different similarities deduced from profiles and subqueries obtained during the first two phases. Experiments on the ENRON email collection for a recipient proposal task show that competitive results can be obtained using the proposed framework.},

A weighted graph is used to model temporal correlation between n-grams, with a PageRank variant employed to combine both pseudo-relevant document term distribution and temporal collection evidence.

abstract = {This poster argues for a need for more dialogue and richer information and interaction during query formulation between the user and the system. We present two novel methods --- query previews and categorised Interactive Query Expansions --- that seek to do just this. Our method enriches a searcher's query formulation by leveraging semantic information to help identify the topicality of the term, and the outcomes of its selection. The initial findings are largely positive and suggest user preference.},

abstract = {Using keyword queries to find entities has emerged as one of the major search types on the Web. In this paper, we study the task of ad-hoc entity retrieval: keyword search in a collection of structured data. We start with a baseline retrieval system that constructs pseudo documents from RDF triples and introduce three extensions: preprocessing of URIs, using two-fielded retrieval models, and boosting popular domains. Using the query sets of the 2010 and 2011 Semantic Search Challenge, we show that our straightforward approach outperforms all previously reported results, some generated by far more complex systems.},

We present the "personal information retrieval evaluation (PIRE)" tool, which provides a solution to this evaluation problem using a ‘living laboratory' approach. This tool allows for the evaluation of retrieval techniques using ‘real' individuals' personal collections, queries and result sets, in a cross-comparable repeatable way, while importantly maintaining an individual's informational privacy.},

The software is able to retrieve three kind of documents that a matching search-based system would not retrieve. Firstly, by using person profiles, the software will rank documents related to the key persons without requiring them to be participant (i.e. being author or recipient). Secondly, the system will retrieve documents sharing the same topics as the key words but not necessarily containing them. Thirdly, the proposed solution will also retrieve other participants who are members of the communities associated to the key persons.},
