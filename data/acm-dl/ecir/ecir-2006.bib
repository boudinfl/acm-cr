abstract = {The advent of the current generation of Web search engines around 1998 challenged the relevance of academic information retrieval research – established evaluation methodologies didn't scale and nor did they reflect the diverse purposes to which search engines are now put. Academic ranking algorithms of the time almost completely ignored the features which underpin modern web search: query-independent evidence and evidence external to the document. Unlike their commercial counterparts, academic researchers have for years been unable to access Web scale collections and their corresponding link graphs and search logs.},

abstract = {We introduce the hypergeometric models KL, DLH and DLLH using the DFR approach, and we compare these models to other relevant models of IR. The hypergeometric models are based on the probability of observing two probabilities: the relative within-document term frequency and the entire collection term frequency. Hypergeometric models are parameter-free models of IR. Experiments show that these models have an excellent performance with small and very large collections. We provide their foundations from the same IR probability space of language modelling (LM). We finally discuss the difference between DFR and LM. Briefly, DFR is a frequentist (Type I), or combinatorial approach, whilst language models use a Bayesian (Type II) approach for mixing the two probabilities, being thus inherently parametric in its nature.},

The proposed measure improves on the previously proposed similarity measure based on optimal matching by allowing many-to-many matching between subtopics of documents. After documents are decomposed into sets of subtopics, the Proportional Transportation Distance is employed to evaluate the similarity between sets of subtopics for two documents by solving a transportation problem. Experiments on TDT-3 data demonstrate its good ability for measuring document similarity and also its high robustness, i.e. it does not rely on the underlying document decomposition algorithm largely as the optimal matching based measure.},

In this paper, we follow a formal approach in text retrieval to re-formulate the problem. Based on the classic probability ranking principle, we propose a probabilistic user-item relevance model. Under this formal model, we show that user-based and item-based approaches are only two different factorizations with different independence assumptions. Moreover, we show that smoothing is an important aspect to estimate the parameters of the models due to data sparsity. By adding linear interpolation smoothing, the proposed model gives a probabilistic justification of using TF\texttimes{}IDF-like item ranking in collaborative filtering. Besides giving the insight understanding of the problem of collaborative filtering, we also show experiments in which the proposed method provides a better recommendation performance on a music play-list data set.},

Moreover, it uses only 1% extra storage cost. Compared with an inverted index, our improvement is 40% and 72% for the overall and large queries respectively.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of the information retrieval systems is largely dependent on term-weighting. Most current term-weighting approaches involve the use of term frequency normalization. We develop here a method to assess the potential role of the term frequency-inverse document frequency measures that are commonly used in text retrieval systems. Since automatic information retrieval systems have to deal with documents of varying sizes and terms of varying frequencies, we carried out preliminary tests to evaluate the effect of term-weighing items on the retrieval performance. With regard to the preliminary tests, we identify a novel factor (effective level of term frequency) that represents the document content based on its length and maximum term-frequency. This factor is used to find the maximum main terms within the documents and an appropriate subset of documents containing the query terms. We show that, all document terms need not be considered for ranking a document with respect to a query. Regarding the result of the experiments, the effective level of term frequency (EL) is a significant factor in retrieving relevant documents, especially in large collections. Experiments were under-taken on TREC collections to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposal.},

We consider applications of the Cox-Lewis statistic in three scenarios: comparing clusterability of different text collections using the same representation, comparing different representations of the same text collection, and predicting the query performance based on the clusterability of the query results set. Our experimental results show a correlation between the observed effectiveness and this statistic, thereby demonstrating the utility of such data analysis in text retrieval.},

We observe that a piece of important news generally occupies visually significant place in some homepage of a news site and import news event will be reported by many news sites. To explore these two properties, we model the relationship between homepages, news and latent events by a tripartite graph, and present an algorithm to identify important news in this model. Based on this algorithm, we implement a system TOPSTORY to dynamically generate homepages for users to browse important news reports. Our experimental study indicates the effectiveness of proposed approach.},

abstract = {Experiments on the effectiveness of relevance feedback with real users are time-consuming and expensive. This makes simulation for rapid testing desirable. We define a user model, which helps to quantify some interaction decisions involved in simulated relevance feedback. First, the relevance criterion defines the relevance threshold of the user to accept documents as relevant to his/her needs. Second, the browsing effort refers to the patience of the user to browse through the initial list of retrieved documents in order to give feedback. Third, the feedback effort refers to the effort and ability of the user to collect feedback documents. We use the model to construct several simulated relevance feedback scenarios in a laboratory setting. Using TREC data providing graded relevance assessments, we study the effect of the quality and quantity of the feedback documents on the effectiveness of the relevance feedback and compare this to the pseudo-relevance feedback. Our results indicate that one can compensate large amounts of relevant but low quality feedback by small amounts of highly relevant feedback.},

abstract = {Efficient and effective routing of content-based queries is an emerging problem in peer-to-peer networks, and can be seen as an extension of the traditional “resource selection” problem. Although some approaches have been proposed, finding the best architecture (defined by the network topology, the underlying selection method, and its integration into peer-to-peer networks) is still an open problem. This paper investigates different building blocks of such architectures, among them the decision-theoretic framework, CORI, hierarchical networks, distributed hash tables and HyperCubes. The evaluation on a large test-bed shows that the decision-theoretic framework can be applied effectively and cost-efficiently onto peer-to-peer networks.},

We consider this problem in the context of distributed Web exploration applications like focused crawling. Typical applications are user-specific classification of retrieved Web contents into personalized topic hierarchies as well as automatic refinements of such taxonomies using unsupervised machine learning methods (e.g. clustering). Our approach is to combine models from multiple peers and to construct the advanced decision model that takes the generalization performance of multiple ‘local' peer models into account. In addition, meta algorithms can be applied in a restrictive manner, i.e. by leaving out some ‘uncertain' documents. The results of our systematic evaluation show the viability of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {URL usually contains meaningful information for measuring the relevance of a Web page to a query in Web search. Some existing works utilize URL depth priors (i.e. the probability of being a good page given the length and depth of a URL) for improving some types of Web search tasks. This paper suggests the use of the location of query terms occur in a URL for measuring how well a web page is matched with a user's information need in web search. First, we define and estimate URL hit types, i.e. the priori probability of being a good answer given the type of query term hits in the URL. The main advantage of URL hit priors (over depth priors) is that it can achieve stable improvement for both informational and navigational queries. Second, an obstacle of exploiting such priors is that shortening and concatenation are frequently used in a URL. Our investigation shows that only 30% URL hits are recognized by an ordinary word breaking approach. Thus we combine three methods to improve matching. Finally, the priors are integrated into the probabilistic model for enhancing web document retrieval. Our experiments were conducted using 7 query sets of TREC2002, TREC2003 and TREC2004, and show that the proposed approach is stable and improve retrieval effectiveness by 4%~11% for navigational queries and 10% for informational queries.},

On the other hand, document's visual aspects such as the layout, colour scheme, or presence of images have been studied in a limited context with regard to their effectiveness of search result presentation. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of textual and visual forms of document summaries as the additional document surrogate in the search result presentation. In our study, a sentence-based summarisation technique was used to create a textual document summary, and the thumbnail image of web pages was used to represent a visual summary. The experimental results suggest that both have the cases where the additional elements contributed to a positive effect not only in users' relevance assessment but also in query re/formulation. The results also suggest that the two forms of document summary are likely to have different contexts to facilitate user's search experience. Therefore, our study calls for further research on adaptive models of IR systems to make use of their advantages in appropriate contexts.},

Relevance Feedback integrates relevance information provided by a user to enhance retrieval quality. For keyword-based XML queries, feedback engines usually generate an expanded keyword query from the content of elements marked as relevant or nonrelevant. This approach that is inspired by text-based IR completely ignores the semistructured nature of XML. This paper makes the important step from pure content-based to structural feedback. It presents a framework that expands a keyword query into a full-fledged content-and-structure query. Extensive experiments with the established INEX benchmark and our TopX search engine show the feasibility of our approach.},

The model can produce a ranked list of documents elements which fulfills a given information need expressed in the query.

abstract = {When presented with a retrieved document, users of a search engine are usually left with the task of pinning down the relevant information inside the document. Often this is done by a time-consuming combination of skimming, scrolling and Ctrl+F. In the setting of a digital library for scientific literature the issue is especially urgent when dealing with reference works, such as surveys and handbooks, as these typically contain long documents. Our aim is to develop methods for providing a “go-read-here” type of retrieval functionality, which points the user to a segment where she can best start reading to find out about her topic of interest. We examine multiple query-independent ways of segmenting texts into coherent chunks that can be returned in response to a query. Most (experienced) authors use paragraph breaks to indicate topic shifts, thus providing us with one way of segmenting documents. We compare this structural method with semantic text segmentation methods, both with respect to topical focus and relevancy. Our experimental evidence is based on manually segmented scientific documents and a set of queries against this corpus. Structural segmentation based on contiguous blocks of relevant paragraphs is shown to be a viable solution for our intended application of providing “go-read-here” functionality.},

In order to fully exploit motion databases for reuse and for the synthesis of new motions, one needs efficient retrieval and browsing methods to identify similar motions. So far, only ad-hoc methods for content-based motion retrieval have been proposed, which lack efficiency and rely on quantitative, numerical similarity measures, making it difficult to identify logically related motions. We propose an efficient motion retrieval system based on the query-by-example paradigm, which employs qualitative, geometric similarity measures. This allows for intuitive and interactive browsing in a purely content-based fashion without relying on textual annotations. We have incorporated this technology in a novel user interface facilitating query formulation as well as visualization and ranking of search results.},

abstract = {The quality of search engines depends usually on the content of the returned documents rather than on the text used to express this content. So ideally, search techniques should be directed more toward the semantic dependencies underlying documents than toward the texts themselves. The most visible examples in this direction are Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and the Hyperspace Analog to Language (HAL). If these techniques are really based on semantic dependencies, as they contend, then they should be applicable across languages.To investigate this contention we used electronic versions of two kinds of material with their translations: a novel, and a popular treatise about cosmology. We used the analogy of fingerprinting as employed in forensics to establish whether individuals are related. Genetic fingerprinting uses enzymes to split the DNA and then compare the resulting band patterns. Likewise, in our research we used queries to split a document into fragments. If a search technique really isolates fragments semantically related to the query, then a document and its translation should have similar band patterns.In this paper we (1) present the fingerprinting technique, (2) introduce the material used, and (3) report results of an evaluation for two semantic indexing techniques.},

abstract = {Our cultural heritage, as preserved in libraries, archives and museums, is made up of documents written many centuries ago. Large-scale digitization initiatives make these documents available to non-expert users through digital libraries and vertical search engines. For a user, querying a historic document collection may be a disappointing experience: queries involving modern words may not be very effective for retrieving documents that contain many historic terms. We propose a cross-language approach to historic document retrieval, and investigate (1) the automatic construction of translation resources for historic languages, and (2) the retrieval of historic documents using cross-language information retrieval techniques. Our experimental evidence is based on a collection of 17th century Dutch documents and a set of 25 known-item topics in modern Dutch. Our main findings are as follows: First, we are able to automatically construct rules for modernizing historic language based on comparing (a) phonetic sequence similarity, (b) the relative frequency of consonant and vowel sequences, and (c) the relative frequency of character n-gram sequences, of historic and modern corpora. Second, modern queries are not very effective for retrieving historic documents, but the historic language tools lead to a substantial improvement in retrieval effectiveness. The improvements are above and beyond the improvement due to using a modern stemming algorithm (whose effectiveness actually goes up when the historic language is modernized).},

This paper describes a system that overcomes this limitation by automatically collecting high quality parallel bilingual corpora from the web. Previous systems used a single principle feature for parallel web page verification, whereas we use multiple features to identify parallel texts via a k-nearest-neighbor classifier. Our system was evaluated using a data set containing 6500 Chinese–English candidate parallel pairs that have been manually annotated. Experiments show that the use of a k-nearest-neighbors classifier with multiple features achieves substantial improvements over the systems that use any one of these features. The system achieved a precision rate of 95% and a recall rate of 97%, and thus is a significant improvement over earlier work.},

In this paper we present an approach based on document fingerprinting for identifying highly similar sequences.

abstract = {Genomic IR, characterized by its highly specific information need, severe synonym and polysemy problem, long term name and rapid growing literature size, is challenging IR community. In this paper, we are focused on addressing the synonym and polysemy issue within the language model framework. Unlike the ways translation model and traditional query expansion techniques approach this issue, we incorporate concept-based indexing into a basic language model for genomic IR. In particular, we adopt UMLS concepts as indexing and searching terms. A UMLS concept stands for a unique meaning in the biomedicine domain; a set of synonymous terms will share same concept ID. Therefore, the new approach makes the document ranking effective while maintaining the simplicity of language models. A comparative experiment on the TREC 2004 Genomics Track data shows significant improvements are obtained by incorporating concept-based indexing into a basic language model. The MAP (mean average precision) is significantly raised from 29.17% (the baseline system) to 36.94%. The performance of the new approach is also significantly superior to the mean (21.72%) of official runs participated in TREC 2004 Genomics Track and is comparable to the performance of the best run (40.75%). Most official runs including the best run extensively use various query expansion and pseudo-relevance feedback techniques while our approach does nothing except for the incorporation of concept-based indexing, which evidences the view that semantic smoothing, i.e. the incorporation of synonym and sense information into the language models, is a more standard approach to achieving the effects traditional query expansion and pseudo-relevance feedback techniques target.},

This work examines the broad morphological variation that searchers of an Arabic retrieval system put into their queries. In this study, 15 native Arabic speakers were asked to generate queries, morphological variants of query words were collated across users. Queries composed of either the commonest or rarest variants of each word were submitted to a retrieval system and the effectiveness of the searches was measured. It was found that queries composed of the more popular morphological variants were more likely to retrieve relevant documents that those composed of less popular.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen the development of different modalities for video retrieval. The most common of these are (1) to use text from speech recognition or closed captions, (2) to match keyframes using image retrieval techniques like colour and texture [6] and (3) to use semantic features like “indoor”, “outdoor” or “persons”. Of these, text-based retrieval is the most mature and useful, while image-based retrieval using low-level image features usually depends on matching keyframes rather than whole-shots. Automatic detection of video concepts is receiving much attention and as progress is made in this area we will see consequent impact on the quality of video retrieval. In practice it is the combination of these techniques which realises the most useful, and effective, video retrieval as shown by us repeatedly in TRECVid [5].},

In this paper, we show how an efficient implementation of this model can be achieved. The resulting method is comparable in terms of efficiency to other standard term matching algorithms (such as the vector space model, BM25 and the multinomial Language Model).},

We propose an approach that uses class information to influence LSI dimensions whereby class labels of training documents are endoded as new terms, which are appended to the documents. When LSI is carried out on the augmented term-document matrix, terms pertaining to the same class are pulled closer to each other. Evaluation over experimental data reveals significant improvement in classification accuracy over LSI. The results also compare favourably with naive Support Vector Machines.},

Though these approaches perform well in identifying copied or even modified passages, they assume a closed world: a reference collection must be given against which a plagiarized document can be compared.This raises the question whether plagiarized passages within a document can be detected automatically if no reference is given, e. g. if the plagiarized passages stem from a book that is not available in digital form. We call this problem class intrinsic plagiarism detection. The paper is devoted to this problem class; it shows that it is possible to identify potentially plagiarized passages by analyzing a single document with respect to variations in writing style.Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a taxonomy of plagiarism delicts along with detection methods, (ii) new features for the quantification of style aspects, (iii) a publicly available plagiarism corpus for benchmark comparisons, and (iv) promising results in non-trivial plagiarism detection settings: in our experiments we achieved recall values of 85% with a precision of 75% and better.},

abstract = {Current information retrieval systems make no measurement of the user's response to the searching process or the information itself. Existing psychological studies show that subjects exhibit measurable physiological responses when carrying out certain tasks, e.g. when viewing images, which generally result in heightened emotional states. We find that users exhibit measurable biometric behaviour in the form of galvanic skin response when watching movies, and engaging in interactive tasks. We examine how this data might be exploited in the indexing of data for search and within the search process itself.},

abstract = {A new Relevance Feedback (RF) technique is developed to improve upon the efficiency and performance of existing techniques. This is based on propagating positive and negative weights from documents judged relevant and not relevant respectively, to other documents, which are deemed similar according to one of a number of criteria. The performance and efficiency improve since the documents are treated as independent vectors rather than being merged into a single vector as is the case with traditional approaches, and only the documents considered in a given neighbourhood are inspected. This is especially important when using large test collections.},

abstract = {Structured document retrieval requires the ranking of document elements. Previous approaches either aggregate term weights or retrieval status values, or propose alternatives to idf, for example, ief (inverse element frequency). We propose and investigate in this paper a new approach: Context-specific idf, which is, in contrast to aggregation-based ranking functions, parameter-free.},
