abstract = {One of the most important models for IR derives from the representation of documents and queries as vectors in a vector space. I will show how logic emerges from the geometry of such a vector space. As a consequence of looking at such a space in terms of states and observables I will show how an appropriate probability measure can be constructed on this space which may be the basis for a suitable probabilistic logic for information retrieval.},

abstract = {Peer-to-peer file sharing has become a very popular Internet application. P2P systems such as Gnutella and Kazaa work well when the number of peers is small. Their performances degraded significantly when the number of peers scales. In order to overcome the scalability problem, numerous research groups have experimented with different approaches. We conduct a novel evaluation study on Kazaa traffic focusing on the interest-based locality. Our analysis shows that strong interest-based locality exist in P2P systems and can be exploited to improve performance. Based on our findings, we propose a history-based P2P search algorithm and topology adaptation mechanism. The resulting system naturally clusters peers with similar interests to each other and greatly improves the efficiency for searching. We test our design through simulations; the results show significant reduction in total system load and large speedup in search efficiency compared to random walk and interest shortcut schemes. In addition, we show that our system is more robust under dynamic situations.},

abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking continuously gains popularity among computing science researchers. The problem of information retrieval (IR) over P2P networks is being addressed by researchers attempting to provide valuable insight as well as solutions for its successful deployment. All published studies have, so far, been evaluated by simulation means, using well-known document collections (usually acquired from TREC). Researchers test their systems using divided collections whose documents have been previously distributed to a number of simulated peers. This practice leads to two problems: First, there is little justification in favour of the document distributions used by relevant studies and second, since different studies use different experimental testbeds, there is no common ground for comparing the solutions proposed. In this work, we contribute a number of different document testbeds for evaluating P2P IR systems. Each of these has been deduced from TREC's WT10g collection and corresponds to different potential P2P IR application scenarios. We analyse each methodology and testbed with respect to the document distributions achieved as well as to the location of relevant items within each setting. This work marks the beginning of an effort to provide more realistic evaluation environments for P2P IR systems as well as to create a common ground for comparisons of existing and future architectures.},

This paper addresses the problems of resource representation, resource ranking and selection, and result merging for federated search of text-based digital libraries in hierarchical peer-to-peer networks. Existing approaches to text-based federated search are adapted and new methods are developed for resource representation and resource selection according to the unique characteristics of hierarchical peer-to-peer networks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approaches offer a better combination of accuracy and efficiency than more common alternatives for federated search in peer-to-peer networks.},

This task, also called “schema matching”, is a crucial step in integrating heterogeneous collections. As schemas may have different granularities, and as schema attributes do not always match precisely, a general-purpose schema mapping approach requires support for uncertain mappings, and mappings have to be learned automatically. The framework combines different classifiers for finding suitable mapping candidates (together with their weights), and selects that set of mapping rules which is the most likely one. Finally, the framework with different variants has been evaluated on two different data sets.},

In the suggested approach we merge two independent phrase extraction strategies. The first proposed strategy (LASt) uses argumentative, positional and structural features in order to suggest a GeneRIF. The second extraction scheme (LogReg) incorporates statistical properties to select the most appropriate sentence as the GeneRIF. Based on the TREC-2003 genomic collection, the basic extraction strategies are already competitive (52.78% for LASt and 52.28% for LogReg, respectively). When used in a combined approach, the extraction task clearly shows improvement, achieving a Dice score of over 55%.},

This expansion is a way for selecting in a more reliable way excerpts that are linked to profiles but also for selecting excerpts that may bring new and interesting information about their topics. This method was implemented by the REDUIT system, which was successfully evaluated for document filtering and passage extraction.},

abstract = {This paper investigates a new approach for Single Document Summarization based on a Machine Learning ranking algorithm. The use of machine learning techniques for this task allows one to adapt summaries to the user needs and to the corpus characteristics. These desirable properties have motivated an increasing amount of work in this field over the last few years. Most approaches attempt to generate summaries by extracting text-spans (sentences in our case) and adopt the classification framework which consists to train a classifier in order to discriminate between relevant and irrelevant spans of a document. A set of features is first used to produce a vector of scores for each sentence in a given document and a classifier is trained in order to make a global combination of these scores. We believe that the classification criterion for training a classifier is not adapted for SDS and propose an original framework based on ranking for this task. A ranking algorithm also combines the scores of different features but its criterion tends to reduce the relative misordering of sentences within a document. Features we use here are either based on the state-of-the-art or built upon word-clusters. These clusters are groups of words which often co-occur with each other, and can serve to expand a query or to enrich the representation of the sentences of the documents. We analyze the performance of our ranking algorithm on two data sets – the Computation and Language (cmp_lg) collection of TIPSTER SUMMAC and the WIPO collection. We perform comparisons with different baseline – non learning – systems, and a reference trainable summarizer system based on the classification framework. The experiments show that the learning algorithms perform better than the non-learning systems while the ranking algorithm outperforms the classifier. The difference of performance between the two learning algorithms depends on the nature of datasets. We give an explanation of this fact by the different separability hypothesis of the data made by the two learning algorithms.},

The Topiary system, developed at the University of Maryland with BBN, was the top performing headline generation system at DUC 2004. Topiary-style headlines consist of a number of general topic labels followed by a compressed version of the lead sentence of a news story. The Topiary system uses a statistical learning approach to finding topic labels for headlines, while our approach, the LexTrim system, identifies key summary words by analysing the lexical cohesive structure of a text. The performance of these systems is evaluated using the ROUGE evaluation suite on the DUC 2004 news stories collection. The results of these experiments show that a baseline system that identifies topic descriptors for headlines using term frequency counts outperforms the LexTrim and Topiary systems. A manual evaluation of the headlines also confirms this result.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method to improve the precision of top retrieved documents in Chinese information retrieval where the query is a short description by re-ordering retrieved documents in the initial retrieval. To re-order the documents, we firstly find out terms in query and their importance scales by making use of the information derived from top N(N<=30) retrieved documents in the initial retrieval; secondly, we re-order retrieved K(N<<K) documents by what kinds of terms of query they contain. That is, we first automatically extract key terms from top N retrieved documents, then we collect key terms that occur in query and their document frequencies in the N retrieved documents, finally we use these collected terms to re-order the initially retrieved documents. Each collected term is assigned a weight by its length and its document frequency in top N retrieved documents. Each document is re-ranked by the sum of weights of collected terms it contains. In our experiments on 42 query topics in NTCIR3 Cross Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR) dataset, an average 17.8%-27.5% improvement can be made for top 10 documents and an average 6.6%-26.9% improvement can be made for top 100 documents at relax/rigid relevance judgment and different parameter setting.},

For small display sizes and limited user actions, we are able to construct a tree representing all possible outcomes. Examination of the tree permits us to compute an upper limit on relevance feedback performance. Three standard feedback algorithms are considered – Rocchio, Robertson/Sparck-Jones and a Bayesian algorithm. Two display strategies are considered, one based on maximizing the immediate information gain and the other on most likely documents. Our results bring out the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms, and the need for exploratory display strategies with conservative feedback algorithms.},

In this paper, we tackle the collection-dependence problem by proposing a new tuning method by measuring the normalisation effect. The proposed method refines and extends our methodology described in [7]. In our experiments, we evaluate our proposed tuning method on various TREC collections, for both the normalisation 2 of the Divergence From Randomness (DFR) models and the BM25's normalisation method. Results show that for both normalisation methods, our tuning method significantly outperforms the robust empirically-obtained baselines over diverse TREC collections, while having a marginal computational cost.},

This extension requires the design of a new algorithm to compute the posterior probabilities of relevance. Another contribution is related to the evaluation of the influence diagram. The computation of the expected utilities in the original CID model was approximated by applying an independence criterion. We present another approximation that does not assume independence, as well as an exact evaluation method.},

abstract = {Text collections represented in LSI model are hard to search efficiently (i.e. quickly), since there exists no indexing method for the LSI matrices. The inverted file, often used in both boolean and classic vector model, cannot be effectively utilized, because query vectors in LSI model are dense. A possible way for efficient search in LSI matrices could be the usage of metric access methods (MAMs). Instead of cosine measure, the MAMs can utilize the deviation metric for query processing as an equivalent dissimilarity measure. However, the intrinsic dimensionality of collections represented by LSI matrices is often large, which decreases MAMs' performance in searching. In this paper we introduce σ-LSI, a modification of LSI in which we artificially decrease the intrinsic dimensionality of LSI matrices. This is achieved by an adjustment of singular values produced by SVD. We show that suitable adjustments could dramatically improve the efficiency when searching by MAMs, while the precision/recall values remain preserved or get only slightly worse.},

abstract = {This paper introduces PIRE, a probabilistic IR engine. For both document indexing and retrieval, PIRE makes heavy use of probabilistic Datalog, a probabilistic extension of predicate Horn logics. Using such a logical framework together with probability theory allows for defining and using data types (e.g. text, names, numbers), different weighting schemes (e.g. normalised tf, tf.idf or BM25) and retrieval functions (e.g. uncertain inference, language models). Extending the system thus is reduced to adding new rules. Furthermore, this logical framework provide a powerful tool for including additional background knowledge into the retrieval process.},

abstract = {This paper is focused on the effect of correlation on data fusion for multiple retrieval results. If some of the retrieval results involved in data fusion correlate more strongly than the others, their common opinion will dominate the voting process in data fusion. This may degrade the effectiveness of data fusion in many cases, especially when very good results appear to be a minority. For solving this problem, we assign each result a weight, which is derived from the correlation coefficient of that result to the other results, then the linear combination method can be used for data fusion. The evaluation of the effectiveness of the proposed method with TREC 5 ( ad hoc track) results is reported. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between results correlation and data fusion by some experiments, and demonstrate that a relationship between them does exists.},

With ”junk documents” we mean documents that do not belong to the topic categories (classes) we are interested in. This type of documents can typically not be covered by the training set; nevertheless in many real world applications (e.g. classification of web or intranet content, focused crawling etc.) such documents occur quite often and a classifier has to make a decision about them. We tackle this problem by using restrictive methods and ensemble-based meta methods that may decide to leave out some documents rather than assigning them to inappropriate classes with low confidence. Our experiments with four different data sets show that the proposed techniques can eliminate a relatively large fraction of junk documents while dismissing only a significantly smaller fraction of potentially interesting documents.},

Most such methods are character-based, and thus have the potential to automatically capture non-word features of a document, such as punctuation, word-stems, and features spanning more than one word. However, compression-based classification methods have drawbacks (such as slow running time), and not all such methods are equally effective. We present the results of a number of experiments designed to evaluate the effectiveness and behavior of different compression-based text classification methods on English text. Among our experiments are some specifically designed to test whether the ability to capture non-word (including super-word) features causes character-based text compression methods to achieve more accurate classification.},

Due to CIRI's query expansion feature the number of search terms was remarkably higher in ontology queries than in Direct interface queries. The search results were evaluated with generalised precision and generalised relative recall as well as precision based on personal assessments. The Direct interface queries performed better in all methods of comparison.},

This information can be reused to aid future searches, especially when these logs contain the searching histories of specific communities of users. To date this information is rarely exploited as most Web search techniques continue to rely on the more traditional term-based IR approaches. In contrast, the I-SPY system attempts to reuse past search behaviours as a means to re-rank result-lists according to the implied preferences of like-minded communities of users. It relies on the ability to recognise previous search sessions that are related to the current target search by looking for similarities between past and current queries. We have previously shown how a simple model of query similarity can significantly improve search performance by implementing this reuse approach. In this paper we build on previous work by evaluating alternative query similarity models.},

Correlation analysis of the data obtained from actual tests using a subset of the methods in the framework suggest that these methods measure different aspects of the search engine. In practice, we argue that the selection of the test method is a tradeoff between measurement intent and cost.},

abstract = {Most modern retrieval systems use compressed Inverted Files (IF) for indexing. Recent works demonstrated that it is possible to reduce IF sizes by reassigning the document identifiers of the original collection, as it lowers the average distance between documents related to a single term. Variable-bit encoding schemes can exploit the average gap reduction and decrease the total amount of bits per document pointer. However, approximations developed so far requires great amounts of time or use an uncontrolled memory size. This paper presents an efficient solution to the reassignment problem consisting in reducing the input data dimensionality using a SVD transformation. We tested this approximation with the Greedy-NN TSP algorithm and one more efficient variant based on dividing the original problem in sub-problems. We present experimental tests and performance results in two TREC collections, obtaining good compression ratios with low running times. We also show experimental results about the tradeoff between dimensionality reduction and compression, and time performance.},

Secondly, source language topics (in English, German, and Swedish) were automatically translated into the target language (Finnish), using both structured and unstructured queries. Effectiveness of the translated queries was compared to that of the monolingual queries. CLIR performance was evaluated using three relevance criteria: stringent, regular, and liberal. When regular or liberal criteria were used, a reasonable performance was achieved. Adopting stringent criteria caused a considerable loss of performance, when compared to monolingual Finnish performance.},

We found that the specific optimum parameters varied but the general performance increase was consistent across all 3 collections. To squeeze the last bit of performance out of a system it would be necessary to train a distance measure for a specific collection. However, a fractional distance measure with parameter p = 0.5 will consistently outperform both L1 and L2 norms.},

This paper presents a multi-facetted framework featuring visual semantics and signal texture descriptions for automatic image retrieval. It relies on an expressive representation formalism handling high-level image descriptions and a full-text query framework in an attempt to operate image indexing and retrieval operations beyond trivial low-level processes and loosely-coupled state-of-the-art systems.

Our study shows that combinations of factors can yield more promising results than individual factors, and that different aspects of web pages affect similarities between pages in a different manner.

abstract = {Mobile devices suffer from limited screen real-estate and restricted text input capabilities. In the recent past these limitations have greatly effected the usability of many mobile Internet applications [1], largely because little effort has been typically made to take account of the special features of the mobile Internet. These limitations are especially problematic for mobile search-engines: they restrict the number of results that can be displayed per screen and impact the type of queries that are likely to be provided. Nevertheless, most attempts to provide mobile search engines have involved making only simplistic adaptations to standard search interfaces. For example, fewer results per page are returned and the ‘snippet' text associated with each result may be truncated [2]. We believe that more fundamental adaptations are necessary if search technology is to succeed in the mobile space. In this paper we focus on the snippet text issue and we argue that providing paragraphs of descriptive text alongside each result is a luxury that does not make sense in the context of mobile device limitations. We describe how the I-SPY system [3] can track and record past queries that have resulted in the selection of a given result page and we argue that these related queries can be used to help users understand the context of a search result in place of more verbose snippet text.},

The system is trained from a set of positive and negative examples for each indexed concept. It has been evaluated using the TREC VIDEO protocol and conditions for the detection of visual concepts.

Preliminary experiments indicate the utility of our approach over other current link structure algorithms and warrants further research.},

Adding searcher's relevance judgements for (intermediary) search results is known to improve the retrieval.

Here we present a system architecture and a process for identifying the geographical scope of Web pages, defining a scope as the region where more people than average would find that page relevant. We rely on typical Web IR heuristics (i.e. feature weighting, hypertext topic locality, anchor description) and assumptions on how people use geographical references in documents. The method involves three major steps. First, geographical named entities are identified in the text. Next, we propagate the found named entities through the Web linkage graph. Finally, a geographical ontology is used to disambiguate among the named entities associated to a document, this way selecting the most likely scope. In the future, we plan on using scopes in new location-aware search tools.},
