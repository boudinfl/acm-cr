abstract = {This paper reviews the development of statistically-based retrieval. Since the 1950s statistical techniques have clearly demonstrated their practical worth and statistical theories their staying power, for document or text retrieval. In the last decade the TREC programme, and the Web, have offered new retrieval challenges to which these methods have successfully risen. They are now one element in the much wider and very productive spread of statistical methods to all areas of information and language processing, in which innovative approaches to modelling their data and tasks are being applied.},

abstract = {Live Logging and Posterity Logging are the two basic applications for video databases. The former aims at providing effective annotation of video in quasi-real time and supports extraction of meaningful clips from the live stream; the latter provides annotation for later reuse of video material and is the prerequisite for retrieval by content from video digital libraries. Both require that information is adequately structured with interchange format and that annotation is performed, at a great extent, automatically. Video information structure must encompass both low-intermediate level video organization and event relationships that define specific highlights and situations. Analysis of the visual data of the video stream permits to extract hints, identify events and detect highlights. All of this must be supported by a-priori knowledge of the subject and effective reasoning engines capable to capture the inherent semantics of the visual events.},

abstract = {Link analysis methods have become popular for information access tasks, especially information retrieval, where the link information in a document collection is used to complement the traditionally used content information. However, there has been little firm evidence to confirm the utility of link information. We show that link information can be useful when the document collection has a sufficiently high link density and links are of sufficiently high quality. We report experiments on text classification of the Cora and WebKB data sets using Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis and Probabilistic Hypertext Induced Topic Selection. Comparison with manually assigned classes shows that link information enhances classification in data with sufficiently high link density, but is detrimental to performance at low link densities or if the quality of the links is degraded. We introduce a new frequency-based method for selecting the most useful citations from a document collection for use in the model.},

The hierarchy of categories is involved in all phases of automated document classification, namely feature extraction, learning, and classification of a new document. The innovative aspects of this work are the feature selection process, the automated threshold determination for classification scores, and an experimental study on real-word Web documents that can be associated to any node in the hierarchy. Moreover, a new measure for the evaluation of system performances has been introduced in order to compare three different techniques (flat, hierarchical with proper training sets, hierarchical with hierarchical training sets). The method has been implemented in the context of a client-server application, named WebClassII. Results show that for hierarchical techniques it is better to use hierarchical training sets.},

abstract = {As more and more structured documents, such as the SGML or XML documents, become available on the Web, there is a growing demand to develop effective structured document retrieval which exploits both content and hierarchical structure of documents and return document elements with appropriate granularity. Previous work on partial retrieval of structured document has limited applications due to the requirement of structured queries and restriction that the document structure cannot be traversed according to queries. In this paper, we put forward a method for flexible element retrieval which can retrieve relevant document elements with arbitrary granularity against natural language queries. The proposed techniques constitute a novel hierarchical index propagation and pruning mechanism and an algorithm of ranking document elements based on the hierarchical index. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms other existing methods. Our method also shows robustness to the long-standing problems of text length normalization and threshold setting in structured document retrieval.},

Analysis of the results from the comparative study of these two interfaces shows that the BEP interface was strongly preferred to the relevant object interface, and that appropriate usage of BEPs can lead to improved task performance. However, the study also highlighted shortcomings related to the inconsistent nature of BEPs and to BEP interface design.},

We compared several search guide algorithms experimentally, and the experiments' results show that the suggested algorithms are applicable to the domain of online stores.},

Product brokering in e-commerce is a typical example and systems which can recommend products to their users in a personalized manner have been studied rigoriously in recent years. Collaborative filtering is one of the commonly used approaches where careful choices of the user similarity measure and the rating style representation are required, and yet there is no guarantee for their optimality. In this paper, we propose the use of machine learning techniques to learn the user similarity as well as the rating style. A criterion function measuring the prediction errors is used and several problem formulations are proposed together with their learning algorithms. We have evaluated our proposed methods using the EachMovie dataset and succeeded in obtaining significant improvement in recommendation accuracy when compared with the standard correlation method.},

Rather than just throwing phrases and keywords together, we shall start with pure HM pairs and gradually add more keywords to the document representation. We use the classification on keywords as the baseline, which we compare with the contribution of the pure HM pairs to classification accuracy, and the incremental contributions from heads and modifiers. Finally, we measure the accuracy achieved with all words and all HM pairs combined, which turns out to be only marginally above the baseline.We conclude that even the most careful term selection cannot overcome the differences in Document Frequency between phrases and words, and propose the use of term clustering to make phrases more cooperative.},

abstract = {The stemming problem, i.e. finding a common stem for different forms of a term, has been extensively studied for English, but considerably less is known for other languages. Previously, it has been claimed that stemming is essential for highly declensional languages. We report on our experiments on stemming for German, where an additional issue is the handling of compounds, which are formed by concatenating several words. Rarely do studies on stemming for any language cover more than one or two different approaches. This paper makes a major contribution that transcends its focus on German by investigating a complete spectrum of approaches, ranging from language-independent to elaborate linguistic methods. The main findings are that stemming is beneficial even when using a simple approach, and that carefully designed decompounding, the splitting of compound words, remarkably boosts performance. All findings are based on a thorough analysis using a large reliable test collection.},

abstract = {Expressive power is a potential source of benefits for Information Retrieval. Indeed, a number of works have been traditionally devoting their efforts to defining models able to manage structured documents. Similarly, many researchers have looked at query formulation and proposed different methods to generate structured queries. Nevertheless few attempts have addressed the combination of both expressive documents and expressive queries and its effects on retrieval performance. This is mostly due to the lack of a coherent and expressive framework in which both documents and queries can be handled in an homogeneous and efficient way. In this work we aim at filling this gap. We test the impact of logical representations for documents and queries under a large-scale evaluation. The experiments show clearly that, under the same conditions, the use of logical representations for both documents and queries leads to significant improvements in retrieval performance. Moreover, the overall performance results make evident that logic-based approaches can be competitive in the field of Information Retrieval.},

abstract = {Uncertain inference is a probabilistic generalisation of the logical view on databases, ranking documents according to their probabilities that they logically imply the query. For tasks other than ad-hoc retrieval, estimates of the actual probability of relevance are required. In this paper, we investigate mapping functions between these two types of probability. For this purpose, we consider linear and logistic functions. The former have been proposed before, whereas we give a new theoretic justification for the latter. In a series of upper-bound experiments, we compare the goodness of fit of the two models. A second series of experiments investigates the effect on the resulting retrieval quality in the fusion step of distributed retrieval. These experiments show that good estimates of the actual probability of relevance can be achieved, and the logistic model outperforms the linear one. However, retrieval quality for distributed retrieval (only merging, without resource selection) is only slightly improved by using the logistic function.},

The experimental results show that sentence alignment without considering the word position or order in a sentence obtains the best performance. Besides, two strategies are proposed for multilingual document clustering. The two-phase strategy (translation after clustering) is better than one-phase strategy (translation before clustering). Translation deferred to sentence clustering, which reduces the propagation of translation errors, is most promising. Moreover, three strategies are proposed to tackle the sentence clustering. Complete link within a cluster has the best performance, however, the subsumption-based clustering has the advantage of lower computation complexity and similar performance. Finally, two visualization models (i.e., focusing and browsing), which consider the users' language preference, are proposed.},

This paper surveys several RF algorithms and introduces a novel hybrid RF approach using a support vector machine (HRFSVM), which actively selects the uncertain documents as well as the most relevant ones on which to ask users for feedback. It can efficiently rank documents in a natural way for user browsing. We conduct experiments on Reuters-21578 dataset and track the precision as a function of feedback iterations.

abstract = {We focus on two recently proposed algorithms in the family of "boosting"-based learners for automated text classification, ADABOOST. MH and ADABOOST.MHKR. While the former is a realization of the well-known ADABOOST algorithm specifically aimed at multilabel text categorization, the latter is a generalization of the former based on the idea of learning a committee of classifier sub-committees. Both algorithms have been among the best performers in text categorization experiments so far.A problem in the use of both algorithms is that they require documents to be represented by binary vectors, indicating presence or absence of the terms in the document. As a consequence, these algorithms cannot take full advantage of the "weighted" representations (consisting of vectors of continuous attributes) that are customary in information retrieval tasks, and that provide a much more significant rendition of the document's content than binary representations.In this paper we address the problem of exploiting the potential of weighted representations in the context of ADABOOST-like algorithms by discretizing the continuous attributes through the application of entropy-based discretization methods. We present experimental results on the Reuters-21578 text categorization collection, showing that for both algorithms the version with discretized continuous attributes outperforms the version with traditional binary representations.},

Second, smoothing techniques from statistical language modeling can be used to recover better estimates than the Laplace smoothing techniques usually used in naive Bayes classification.

abstract = {In the Web search process people often think that the hardest work is done by the search engines or by the directories which are entrusted with finding the Web pages. While this is partially true, a not less important part of the work is done by the user, who has to decide which page is relevant from the huge set of retrieved pages. In this paper we present a graphical visualisation tool aimed at helping users to determine the relevance of a Web page with respect to its structure. Such tool can help the user in the often tedious task of deciding which page is relevant enough to deserve a visit.},

address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {We introduce a novel relevance feedback method for content-based image retrieval and demonstrate its effectiveness using a subset of the Corel Gallery photograph collection and five low-level colour descriptors. Relevance information is translated into updated, analytically computed descriptor weights and a new query representation, and thus the system combines movement in both query and weight space. To assess the effectiveness of relevance feedback, we first determine the weight set that is optimal on average for a range of possible queries. The resulting multiple-descriptor retrieval model yields significant performance gains over all the single-descriptor models and provides the benchmark against which we measure the additional improvement through relevance feed-back. We model a number of scenarios of user-system interaction that differ with respect to the precise type and the extent of relevance feedback. In all scenarios, relevance feedback leads to a significant improvement of retrieval performance suggesting that feedback-induced performance gain is a robust phenomenon. Based on a comparison of the different scenarios, we identify optimal interaction models that yield high performance gains at a low operational cost for the user. To support the proposed relevant feedback technique we developed a novel presentation paradigm that allows relevance to be treated as a continuous variable.},

abstract = {We present a user-centred, task-oriented, comparative evaluation of two query-based document skimming tools. ProfileSkim bases within-document retrieval on computing a relevance profile for a document and query; FindSkim provides similar functionality to the web browser Find-command. A novel simulated work task was devised, where experiment participants are asked to identify (index) relevant pages of an electronic book, given subjects from the existing book index. This subject index provides the ground truth, against which the indexing results can be compared. Our major hypothesis was confirmed, namely ProfileSkim proved significantly more efficient than Find-Skim, as measured by time for task. Moreover, indexing task effectiveness, measured by typical IR measures, demonstrated that ProfileSkim was better than FindSkim in identifying relevant pages, although not significantly so. The experiments confirm the potential of relevance profiling to improve query-based document skimming, which should prove highly beneficial for users trying to identify relevant information within long documents.},

abstract = {In order to reduce human efforts, there has been increasing interest in applying active learning for training text classifiers. This paper describes a straightforward active learning heuristic, representative sampling, which explores the clustering structure of 'uncertain' documents and identifies the representative samples to query the user opinions, for the purpose of speeding up the convergence of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Compared with other active learning algorithms, the proposed representative sampling explicitly addresses the problem of selecting more than one unlabeled documents. In an empirical study we compared representative sampling both with random sampling and with SVM active learning. The results demonstrated that representative sampling offers excellent learning performance with fewer labeled documents and thus can reduce human efforts in text classification tasks.},

address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {In Text Categorization (TC) based on the vector space model, feature weighting is vital for the categorization effectiveness. Various non-binary weighting schemes are widely used for this purpose. By emphasizing the category discrimination capability of features, the paper firstly puts forward a new weighting scheme TF*IDF*IG. Upon the fact that refined statistics may have more chance to meet sparse data problem, we re-evaluate the role of the Binary Weighting Model (BWM) in TC for further consideration. As a consequence, a novel approach named the Binary Weighting Model with Non-Binary Smoothing (BWM-NBS) is then proposed so as to overcome the drawback of BWM. A TC system for Chinese texts using words as features is implemented. Experiments on a large-scale Chinese document collection with 71,674 texts show that the F1 metric of categorization performance of BWM-NBS gets to 94.9% in the best case, which is 26.4% higher than that of TF*IDF, 19.1% higher than that of TF*IDF*IG, and 5.8% higher than that of BWM under the same condition. Moreover, BWM-NBS exhibits the strong stability in categorization performance.},

abstract = {Current trend in operational text categorization is the designing of fast classification tools. Several studies on improving accuracy of fast but less accurate classifiers have been recently carried out. In particular, enhanced versions of the Rocchio text classifier, characterized by high performance, have been proposed. However, even in these extended formulations the problem of tuning its parameters is still neglected. In this paper, a study on parameters of the Rocchio text classifier has been carried out to achieve its maximal accuracy. The result is a model for the automatic selection of parameters. Its main feature is to bind the searching space so that optimal parameters can be selected quickly. The space has been bound by giving a feature selection interpretation of the Rocchio parameters. The benefit of the approach has been assessed via extensive cross evaluation over three corpora in two languages. Comparative analysis shows that the performances achieved are relatively close to the best TC models (e.g. Support Vector Machines).},

abstract = {The need of efficient tools in order to manage, retrieve and filter the information in the WWW is clear. Web directories are taxonomies for the classification of Web documents. These kind of information retrieval systems present a specific type of search where the document collection is restricted to one area of the category graph. This paper introduces a specific data architecture for Web directories that improves the performance of restricted searches. That architecture is based on a hybrid data structure composed of an inverted file with multiple embedded signature files. Two variants are presented: hybrid architecture with total information and with partial information. This architecture has been analyzed by means of developing both variants to be compared with a basic model. The performance of the restricted queries was clearly improved, especially the hybrid model with partial information, which yielded a positive response under any load of the search system.},

Then we study an application of the D-index to implement the most promising alternative of range searching. Though also this approach is not able to eliminate the intrinsic quadratic complexity of similarity joins, significant performance improvements are confirmed by experiments.},

The idea is to use a separate semiadaptive model to compress the text that lies inside each different structure type (e.g., different XML tag). The intuition behind the idea is that the distribution of all the texts that belong to a given structure type should be similar, and different from that of other structure types. We test our idea using a word-based Huffman coding, which is the standard for compressing large natural language textual databases, and showt hat our compression method obtains significant improvements in compression ratios. We also analyze the possibility that storing separate models may not pay off if the distribution of different structure types is not different enough, and present a heuristic to merge models with the aim of minimizing the total size of the compressed database. This technique gives an additional improvement over the plain technique. The comparison against existing prototypes shows that our method is a competitive choice for compressed text databases.},

This allows for relational indexing and expression of complex user needs, in comparison to classical text retrieval, where simple keywords are generally used as document descriptors. In classical text retrieval, the keywords are weighted to give emphasis to good document descriptors and discriminators where the most popular weighting schemes are based on variations of tf.idf. In this paper, we present an extension of tf.idf, introducing a new weighting scheme suited for star-graphs. This weighting scheme is based on a local analysis of star-graphs indexing a document and a global analysis of star-graphs across the whole collection. We show and discuss some preliminary results evaluating the performance of this weighting scheme applied to image retrieval.},

The system performs pre-processing and data cleaning, followed by feature extraction from the raw text. It subsequently classifies the paper using the extracted features with a Na\"{\i}ve Bayes Classifier.

abstract = {In traditional content-based music information retrieval systems, users may face with longer response time, since the traditional systems mostly do syntactic processing to match query melody and whole melodies of the underlying music database. Hence, there has been a growing need for theme melody index that can support to quick retrieve the relevant music to user's query melody. In this paper, we suggested an automatic mechanism for constructing the theme melody index from large music database and also showed how the theme melody index can be used for content-based music retrievals by implementing a prototype system.},

abstract = {The amount of information available on the web, as well as the number of e-businesses and web shoppers, is growing exponentially. Customers have to spend a lot of time to browse the net in order to find relevant information. One way to overcome this problem is to use dialoguing agents that exploit user profiles to generate personal recommendations. This paper presents a system, designed according to this approach, that adopts a query refinement mechanism to improve the search process of an Internet commerce web site.},
