abstract = {The huge wealth of data in the health domain can be exploited to create models that predict development of health states over time. Temporal learning algorithms are well suited to learn relationships between health states and make predictions about their future developments. However, these algorithms: (1) either focus on learning one generic model for all patients, providing general insights but often with limited predictive performance, or (2) learn individualized models from which it is hard to derive generic concepts. In this paper, we present a middle ground, namely parameterized dynamical systems models that are generated from data using a Genetic Programming (GP) framework. A fitness function suitable for the health domain is exploited. An evaluation of the approach in the mental health domain shows that performance of the model generated by the GP is on par with a dynamical systems model developed based on domain knowledge, significantly outperforms a generic Long Term Short Term Memory (LSTM) model and in some cases also outperforms an individualized LSTM model.},

abstract = {Web sites and online services increasingly engage with users through live chats to provide support, advice, and offers. Such approaches require reliable methods to predict the user’s intent and make an informed decision when and how to intervene during an active session. Prior work on predicting purchase intent involved clickstream data mining and feature construction in an ad-hoc manner with a moderate success (AUC 0.70 range). We demonstrate the use of the consumer Purchase Decision Model (PDM) and a principled way of constructing features predictive of the purchase intent. We show that the Logistic Regression (LR) classifiers, trained with multi-action motifs, perform on par with the state-of-the-art LSTM sequence model achieving comparable AUC (0.95 vs 0.96) and performing better for the sparse purchase sessions, with higher recall (0.85 vs 0.61) and higher F1 score (0.73 vs 0.66). While LSTM performs better than LR in terms of weighted averages of F1, precision, and recall, it requires 7 times longer to train and offers no insights about the predictive model in terms of the user actions and the purchase decision stages. The LR predictors are robust and effective in simulating real-time interventions, achieving F1 of 0.84 and AUC of 0.85 after observing only 50% of an active session. For non-purchase sessions that leaves room for live intervention, on average within 8 actions before the session ends. },

abstract = {Exploiting the selections of social friends and foes can efficiently face the data scarcity of user preferences and the cold-start problem. In this paper, we present a Social Deep Pairwise Learning model, namely SDPL. According to the Bayesian Pairwise Ranking criterion, we design a loss function with multiple ranking criteria based on the selections of users, and those in their friends and foes to improve the accuracy in the top-k recommendation task. We capture the nonlinearity in user preferences and the social information of trust and distrust relationships by designing a deep learning architecture. In each backpropagation step, we perform social negative sampling to meet the multiple ranking criteria of our loss function. Our experiments on a benchmark dataset from Epinions, among the largest publicly available that has been reported in the relevant literature, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming other state-of-the art methods. In addition, we show that our deep learning strategy plays an important role in capturing the nonlinear associations between user preferences and the social information of trust and distrust relationships, and demonstrate that our social negative sampling strategy is a key factor in SDPL.},

abstract = {Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is often used to perform authentication and acts as a gateway to personal and organizational information. One weak link in the architecture of identity management services is sufficient to cause exposure and risk identity. Recently, we have witnessed a shift in identity management solutions with the growth of blockchain. Blockchain—the decentralized ledger system—provides a unique answer addressing security and privacy with its embedded immutability. In a blockchain-based identity solution, the user is given the control of his/her identity by storing personal information on his/her device and having the choice of identity verification document used later to create blockchain attestations. Yet, the blockchain technology alone is not enough to produce a better identity solution. The user cannot make informed decisions as to which identity verification document to choose if he/she is not presented with tangible guidelines. In the absence of scientifically created practical guidelines, these solutions and the choices they offer may become overwhelming and even defeat the purpose of providing a more secure identity solution. We analyze different PII options given to users for authentication on current blockchain-based solutions. Based on our Identity Ecosystem model, we evaluate these options and their risk and liability of exposure. Powered by real world data of about 6,000 identity theft and fraud stories, our model recommends some authentication choices and discourages others. Our work paves the way for a truly effective identity solution based on blockchain by helping users make informed decisions and motivating blockchain identity solution providers to introduce better options to their users.},

abstract = {The recent boom in social networking services has prompted the research of recommendation systems. The basic assumption behind these works was that "users’ preference is similar to or influenced by their friends". Although many studies have attempted to use social relations to enhance recommendation system, they neglected that the heterogeneous nature of online social networks and the variations in users' trust of friends according to different items. As a natural symmetry between the latent preference vector of the user and her friends, we propose a new social recommendation method called ScAN (short for “co-Attention Neural Network for Social Recommendation”). ScAN is based on a co-attention neural network, which learns the influence value between the user and her friends from the historical data of the interaction between the user/her friends and an item. When the user interacts with different items, different attention weights are assigned to the user and her friends respectively, and the user's new latent preference feature is obtained through an aggregation strategy. To enhance the recommendation performance, a network embedding technique is utilized as a pre-training strategy to extract the users’ embedding and to incorporate the extracted factors into the neural network model. By conducting extensive experiments on three different real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method ScAN achieves a superior performance for all datasets compare with state-of-the-art baseline methods in social recommendation task.},

However, most methods require a large parallel corpus, which is expensive to build. In this paper, our purpose is sentence simplification with a non-parallel corpus in open data en-Wikipedia and Simple-Wikipedia articles. We use a style transfer framework with adversarial learning for learning by non-parallel corpus and adapted a prior work [by Barzilay et al.] to sentence simplification as a base framework. Furthermore, from the perspective of improving retention of sentence meaning, we add pretraining reconstruction loss and cycle consistency loss to the base framework. We also improve the sentence quality output from the proposed model as a result of the expansion. },

abstract = {Language systems have been of great interest to the research community and have recently reached the mass market through various assistant platforms on the web. Reinforcement Learning methods that optimize dialogue policies have seen successes in past years and have recently been extended into methods that personalize the dialogue, e.g. take the personal context of users into account. These works, however, are limited to personalization to a single user with whom they require multiple interactions and do not generalize the usage of context across users. This work introduces a problem where a generalized usage of context is relevant and proposes two Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based approaches to this problem. The first approach uses a single learner and extends the traditional POMDP formulation of dialogue state with features that describe the user context. The second approach segments users by context and then employs a learner per context. We compare these approaches in a benchmark of existing non-RL and RL-based methods in three established and one novel application domain of financial product recommendation. We compare the influence of context and training experiences on performance and find that learning approaches generally outperform a handcrafted gold standard.},

Contextual Advertising is a type of online display advertising that takes cues from the content of the triggering page and displays advertisements that are relevant to the current context. However, on several occasions, the context may have a negative connotation, and displaying advertisements that are relevant to it might prove to be detrimental to the advertiser. We refer to such a scenario as an unfortunate placement. In this work, we propose APNEA (Ad Positive NEgative Analysis), a light-weight system that uses a sentiment-oriented approach to rank the advertisers such that positively correlated brands are ranked higher than brands that are neutral or negatively correlated. Experiments show that APNEA helps avoid unfortunate placements while maintaining ad-relevance. It outperforms several baselines in terms of accuracy on human-annotated test data while having a lower run-time, which is crucial for real-time bidding systems.},

Two sources of information were used to determine the legitimacy of an online store. First, contextual features extracted from the HTML and meta information were used to train various machine learning algorithms. Second, visual information, like the presence of social media logos, was added to make improvements on this baseline model. Results show a positive effect for adding visual information, increasing the F1-score from 0.93 to 0.98 over the baseline model.

abstract = {In many applications, it is required to analyze a graph merely based on its topology. In these cases, nodes can only be distinguished based on their structural neighborhoods and it is common that nodes having the same functionality or role yield similar neighborhood structures. In this work, we investigate two problems: (1) how to create structural node embeddings which describe a node’s role and (2) how important the nodes’ roles are for characterizing entire graphs. To describe the role of a node, we explore the structure within the local neighborhood (or multiple local neighborhoods of various extents) of the node in the vertex domain, compute the visiting probability distribution of nodes in the local neighborhoods and summarize each distribution to a single number by computing its entropy. Furthermore, we argue that the roles of nodes are important to characterize the entire graph. Therefore, we propose to aggregate the role representations to describe whole graphs for graph classification tasks. Our experiments show that our new role descriptors outperform state-of-the-art structural node representations that are usually more expensive to compute. Additionally, we achieve promising results compared to advanced state-of-the-art approaches for graph classification on various benchmark datasets, often outperforming these approaches.},

abstract = {In this work we address the problem of argument search. The purpose of argument search is the distillation of pro and contra arguments for requested topics from large text corpora. In previous works, the usual approach is to use a standard search engine to extract text parts which are relevant to the given topic and subsequently use an argument recognition algorithm to select arguments from them. The main challenge in the argument recognition task, which is also known as argument mining, is that often sentences containing arguments are structurally similar to purely informative sentences without any stance about the topic. In fact, they only differ semantically. Most approaches use topic or search term information only for the first search step and therefore assume that arguments can be classified independently of a topic. We argue that topic information is crucial for argument mining, since the topic defines the semantic context of an argument. Precisely, we propose different models for the classification of arguments, which take information about a topic of an argument into account. Moreover, to enrich the context of a topic and to let models understand the context of the potential argument better, we integrate information from different external sources such as Knowledge Graphs or pre-trained NLP models. Our evaluation shows that considering topic information, especially in connection with external information, provides a significant performance boost for the argument mining task.},

They enable social media users to emphasize their emotions and to express gestural movements in their posts. In addition to emojis, kaomojis (emoticons or facemarks) also behave in a similar way. They are composed of a sequence of characters, which are popularized especially in Asian countries. Although both emojis and kaomojis fulfill similar functions and share the same meaning that can be clues in opinion mining or sentiment analysis, the previous researches have been biased to explore emojis and kaomojis separately. In this paper, we align emojis and kaomojis together as a single token in the Japanese context to offer a bridge between them. Specifically, we aim to judge whether emojis and kaomojis share the same meaning or are similar with each other. We assume that emojis and kaomojis are both a single word in order to obtain their linguistic information with the skip-gram model. Furthermore, we present a new approach to consider the appearances of emojis and kaomojis in themselves, meaning that we explore the information of their visually similar shapes. We regard both of them as a single image to take into account their visual information with the CNN model. We merge two different perspectives toward emojis and kaomojis by exploring their linguistic and visual information simultaneously on the same space. The experimental results showed that we can align an unlimited number of emojis and kaomojis together with their representations (embeddings), and adding the visual information to the linguistic information can improve their representations.},

This paper provides algorithms and system architecture for generating immediate personalized news in a practical environment. Immediacy means changes in news trends and user interests are reflected in recommended news lists quickly. Since news trends and user interests rapidly change, immediacy is critical in news personalization applications. We develop algorithms and system architecture to realize immediacy. Our algorithms are based on collaborative filtering of user clusters and evaluate news articles using click-through rate and decay scores based on the time elapsed since the user’s last access. Existing studies have not fully discussed system architecture, so a major contribution of this paper is that we demonstrate a system architecture and realize our algorithms and a configuration example implemented on top of Amazon Web Services. We evaluate the proposed method both offline and online. The offline experiments are conducted through a real-world dataset from a commercial news delivery service, and online experiments are conducted via A/B testing on production environments. We confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method and also that our system architecture can operate in large-scale production environments.},

abstract = {Media monitoring services allow their customers, mostly companies, to receive, on a daily basis, a list of documents from mass media that discuss topics relevant to the company. However, media monitoring services often generate these lists by using keyword-filtering techniques, which introduce many false positives. Hence, before the end users, i.e., the employees of the company, may consult these lists and find relevant documents, a human editor must inspect the keyword-filtered documents and remove the false positives. This is a time consuming job. In this paper we present a recommender system that aims at reducing the number of documents that the editor needs to inspect every day. The proposed solution classifies documents (represented with TF-IDF and embeddings features) using techniques trained on data containing the editors’ past actions (i.e. the removals of false positives). The proposed technique is shown to be able to correctly predict the true positives, thus reducing the number of documents that the editor needs to inspect every day.},

abstract = {Latent community models are successful at statistically modeling network data by assigning network entities to communities and modelling entity relations as the relations of their communities. In this paper, we describe the limitation of these models in inferring relations between two communities when the entity relations between these communities are unobserved. We propose a solution to this problem by factorizing the community relations matrix into two community feature matrices, thereby adding a dependency between community relations. We introduce the deep dynamic mixed membership stochastic blockmodel based network (DDBN) to demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach. Our model marries the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB) with deep neural networks for rich feature extraction and introduces a temporal dependency in latent features using a long short-term memory unit for dynamic network modeling. We evaluate our model on the link prediction task in static and dynamic networks and find that our model achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods.},

abstract = {During the last years, the phenomenon of hate against women increased exponentially especially in online environments such as microblogs. Although this alarming phenomenon has triggered many studies both from computational linguistic and machine learning points of view, less effort has been spent to analyze if those misogyny detection models are affected by an unintended bias. This can lead the models to associate unreasonably high misogynous scores to a non-misogynous text only because it contains certain terms, called identity terms. This work is the first attempt to address the problem of measuring and mitigating unintended bias in machine learning models trained for the misogyny detection task. We propose a novel synthetic test set that can be used as evaluation framework for measuring the unintended bias and different mitigation strategies specific for this task. Moreover, we provide a misogyny detection model that demonstrate to obtain the best classification performance in the state-of-the-art. Experimental results on recently introduced bias metrics confirm the ability of the bias mitigation treatment to reduce the unintended bias of the proposed misogyny detection model.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in computer-assisted learning systems have caused an increase in the research of knowledge tracing, wherein student performance on coursework exercises is predicted over time. From the viewpoint of data structure, the coursework can be potentially structured as a graph. Incorporating this graph-structured nature into the knowledge tracing model as a relational inductive bias can improve its performance; however, previous methods, such as deep knowledge tracing, did not consider such a latent graph structure. Inspired by the recent successes of the graph neural network (GNN), we herein propose a GNN-based knowledge tracing method, i.e., graph-based knowledge tracing. Casting the knowledge structure as a graph enabled us to reformulate the knowledge tracing task as a time-series node-level classification problem in the GNN. As the knowledge graph structure is not explicitly provided in most cases, we propose various implementations of the graph structure. Empirical validations on two open datasets indicated that our method could potentially improve the prediction of student performance and demonstrated more interpretable predictions compared to those of the previous methods, without the requirement of any additional information.},

abstract = {In open source software development, a major challenge is the prioritization of new requirements as well as the identification of responsible developers for their implementation. Unlike conventional industrial software development, where requirements engineers have to explicitly define who implements what, in the context of open source development, developers (contributors) usually decide on their own which requirements to implement next. Contributors have to deal with a huge number of requirements where the recognition of the most relevant ones often becomes a crucial task with a high impact on the success of a software project. This fact defines our major motivation for the development of a prioritization tool for the Eclipse community which recommends relevant requirements (issues/bugs) to open source developers. Our tool uses real-world data from Eclipse in order to build a prediction model. We trained and tested our tool with different classifiers such as Naive Bayes (representing our baseline), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The evaluation results indicate that the Random Forest classifier correctly predicts issues with a precision of 0.88 (F1-score 0.68).},

abstract = {Understanding the human decision-making process and evaluating the quality of these decisions has been the focus of many researchers. Previously, we proposed a computational, cognitive framework called the Double Transition Model (DTM) to study human decision-making processes. We applied it to simulate a couple of scenarios developed through a naval warfare simulation game called Steel Ocean. This framework concentrated on the cognitive process of an individual's decision-making process and capturing his cognitive style. One of the key functionalities of this framework has been to provide a reward distribution indicating the quality of decisions made under certain conditions. In this paper, we present a rigorous investigation of our models capturing individual characteristics with respect to decision-making style and the reward distributions. In particular, our models explored the following questions: 1) whether individual models are different from each other like human beings are; 2) whether these models exhibit particular decision-making styles; and 3) whether these models can capture different situations as human beings do. We evaluated the capability of our models capturing these individuals' characteristics by comparing multiple DTMs against each other, each built from a couple of individuals under various circumstances. We confirmed that individual characteristics could be captured in the DTMs. Furthermore, we compared individuals' trajectories (i.e., a sequence of decisions) identified by multiple DTMs in addition to their associated neighbors to verify that decision-making process in various social conditions could be described with DTMs. Our empirical study was conducted on two sets of real-world data: Supervisory Control Operations User Testbed (SCOUT) and the naval warfare simulation game (Steel Ocean).},

Despite their effectiveness, a main limitation is that they heavily rely on the dataset and the parameters chosen in order to establish the right status of each data point. These parameters typically include, but are not limited to, the neighborhood radius and threshold. In continuous streaming environments, the need for real-time analysis does not permit for an algorithm to be restarted multiple times with different parameters until the right combination is specified. This gives rise to the need for one technique that combines an arbitrary number of parameterizations with the use of minimal yet sufficient computer resources. In this work we both compare the state-of-the-art techniques for handling multiple queries in distance-based outlier detection algorithms and we propose a novel technique for multi-parameter distance-based outlier detection tailored to distributed continuous streaming environments, such as Spark and Flink.},

abstract = {Ratings, which are explicit feedback, are the most popular form that is often used in Recommender System (RSs). However, using the actual ratings from neighbors to predict ratings of target user toward target item often leads to low accuracy prediction due to the improper rating range problem. Rating conversion methods are proposed to solve this problem over the past few years. To propose rating conversion method, each user’s preference or rating pattern is needed. Some studies adopt the idea from translation-based embedding model and represent user’s preference in graph form. Although some studies represent users, items, and relations in embedding vector form, their representation may be improper and inaccurate if the rating pattern of each user is not in the same range. These vectors still suffer from the improper rating range as well. In this work, we propose a translation-based embedding model with rating conversion in RSs. We aim to solve the improper rating range problem in translation-based embedding model. Our challenges are 1) representing the relation (rating) between a pair of user and item in vector form, instead of scalar form and 2) dealing with rating conversion of user’s rating in vector form. The FilmTrust and MovieLens dataset are used in experiments comparing the proposed method with the existing methods. The evaluation showed that the proposed rating conversion method provides better accuracy results in term of both rating prediction and ranking recommendation.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an approach on Facebook search in Arabic and English, which exploits several users’ traces (e.g. comment, share, reactions) left on Facebook posts to estimate their social importance. Our goal is to show how these social traces (signals) can play a vital role in improving Arabic and English Facebook search. Firstly, we identify polarities (positive or negative) carried by the textual signals (e.g. comments) and non-textual ones (e.g. the reactions love and sad) for a given Facebook posts. Therefore, the polarity of each comment expressed in Arabic or in English on a given Facebook post, is estimated on the basis of a neural sentiment model. Secondly, we group signals according to their complementarity using attributes (features) selection algorithms. Thirdly, we apply learning to rank (LTR) algorithms to re-rank Facebook search results based on the selected groups of signals. Finally, experiments are carried out on 13,500 Facebook posts, collected from 45 topics, for each of the two languages. Experiments results reveal that Random Forests was the most effective LTR approach for this task, and for the both languages. However, the best appropriate features selection algorithms are ReliefFAttributeEval and InfoGainAttributeEval for Arabic and English Facebook search task, respectively.},

However, we employed only the visited website categories to predict a user’s gender, age, relationship status, and big six personality scores, which is an authoritative index to represent an individual’s personality in six dimensions. We also show that applying simple clustering as a preprocessing step enhances the predictive power. As a result, the data collectors, even when storing only a coarse granularity of the visited URLs of the users, may leverage such information to identify a user’s preferences/tastes and her/his private information without notifying users.},

The proposed model makes predictions based on the latent variables that represent possible interactions among the multiple targets and among the features. The experimental results show that this method outperforms the carefully tuned single-target training models most of the time. If the size of the training data is limited, the model shows a significant improvement over the baseline models, likely because the hidden relationship among different targets can be discovered by our model.},

Previous work has shown that personalized interventions can be obtained through RL using simple, discrete state information such as the recent activity performed. In reality however, such features are often not observed, but instead could be inferred from noisy, low-level sensor information obtained from mobile devices (e.g. accelerometers in mobile phones). One could first transform such raw data into discrete activities, but that could throw away important details and would require training a classifier to infer these discrete activities which would need a labeled training set. Instead, we propose to directly learn intervention strategies for the low-level sensor data end-to-end using deep neural networks and RL. We test our novel approach in a self-developed simulation environment which models, and generates, realistic sensor data for daily human activities and show the short-and long-term efficacy of sending personalized physical workout interventions using RL policies. We compare several different input representations and show that learning using raw sensor data is nearly as effective and much more flexible.},

abstract = {Online Peer to Peer Lending (P2PL) systems connect lenders and borrowers directly, thereby making it convenient to borrow and lend money without intermediaries such as banks. Many recommendation systems have been developed for lenders to achieve higher interest rates and avoid defaulting loans. However, there has not been much research in developing recommendation systems to help borrowers make wise decisions. On P2PL platforms, borrowers can either apply for bidding loans, where the interest rate is determined by lenders bidding on a loan or traditional loans where the P2PL platform determines the interest rate. Different borrower grades — determining the credit worthiness of borrowers get different interest rates via these two mechanisms. Hence, it is essential to determine which type of loans borrowers should apply for. In this paper, we build a recommendation system that recommends to any new borrower the type of loan they should apply for. Using our recommendation system, any borrower can achieve lowered interest rates with a higher likelihood of getting funded.},

abstract = {Clustering of users underlies many of the personalisation algorithms that are in use nowadays. Such clustering is mostly performed in an offline fashion. For a health and wellbeing setting, offline clustering might however not be suitable, as limited data is often available and patient states can also quickly evolve over time. Existing online clustering algorithms are not suitable for the health domain due to the type of data that involves multiple time series evolving over time. In this paper we propose a new online clustering algorithm called CluStream-GT that is suitable for health applications. By using both artificial and real datasets, we show that the approach is far more efficient compared to regular clustering, with an average speedup of 93%, while only losing 12% in the accuracy of the clustering with artificial data and 3% with real data.},

Furthermore, to increase the fairness between the recommended teams, the K-rounds and Pairs-rounds methods are proposed as variations of the heuristic approach.

In this paper, we propose SemKeyphrase, an unsupervised cluster-based approach for keyphrase extraction from MOOC video lectures. SemKeyphrase incorporates a new ranking algorithm, called PhaseRank, that involves two phases on ranking candidate keyphrases.

We do not know how people and things will be moving within cities in 30 years, but for sure we know that road network planning and traffic management will remain critical issues. The goal of our research is the implementation of a data-driven micro-simulation traffic model for computing everyday simulations of road traffic in a medium-sized city. A dynamic traffic model is needed in every urban area, we introduce an easy-to-set-up solution for cities that already have traffic sensors installed. Daily traffic flows are created from real data measured by induction loop detectors along the urban roads in Modena. The result of the simulation provides a set of ”snapshots” of the traffic flow within the Modena road network every minute. The main contribution of the implemented model is the ability, starting from traffic punctual information on 400 locations, to provide an overview of traffic intensity on more than 800 km of roads. },

Our approach focuses on using a Naive Bayes classification algorithm to assess political party and public Twitter sentiment. A Granger causality analysis is then introduced to investigate the hypothesis that BREXIT public sentiment, as measured by the twitter sentiment time series, is indicative of changes in the GBP/EUR Fx and FTSE 100 Index. Our results from the Twitter public sentiment indicate that the accuracy of the “Article 50” scenario had the single biggest effect on short run dynamics on the FTSE 100 index, additionally the “Norway” BREXIT strategy has a marginal effect on the FTSE 100 index whilst there was no significant causation to the GBP/EUR Fx. The BREXIT Political party sentiment for the “No Deal” was indicative of short-term dynamics on the GBP/EUR Fx at a marginal rate. Our test concluded that there was no causality on the FTSE 100.},

In this context, Entity Resolution (ER) emerges as a fundamental task to integrate multiple knowledge bases or identify similarities between data items (i.e., entities). Since ER is an inherently quadratic task, blocking techniques are often used to improve efficiency. Beyond the challenges related to the data volume and heterogeneity, blocking techniques also face two other challenges: streaming data and incremental processing. To address these challenges, we propose PRIME, a novel incremental schema-agnostic blocking technique that utilizes parallelism to enhance blocking efficiency. The proposed technique deals with streaming and incremental data using a distributed computational infrastructure. To improve efficiency, the technique avoids unnecessary comparisons and applies a time window strategy to prevent excessive memory consumption.},

For named entity recognition using spaCy, a model that extends the standard ENAMEX type (organization, location, person) was built.

Collaborative filtering algorithms firstly find people that have rated items in a similar fashion; these people are coined as “near neighbors” and their ratings on items are combined in the recommendation generation phase to predict ratings and generate recommendations. On the other hand, people exhibit different levels of eagerness to adopt new products: according to this characteristic, there is a set of users, termed as “Early Adopters”, who are prone to start using a product or technology as soon as it becomes available, in contrast to the majority of users, who prefer to start using items once they reach maturity; this important aspect of user behavior is not taken into account by existing algorithms. In this work, we propose an algorithm that considers the eagerness shown by users to adopt products, so as to leverage the accuracy of rating prediction.

abstract = {Social media has become a platform where users post their messages about a wide range of topics, making it a useful source of information to summarize events such as sports matches. Previous summaries of sports matches generated using social media tended to be biased towards one of the teams, due to a high proportion of the posts used being from fans of the teams involved. This is problematic because in general people desire summaries that are free from bias and objective. To remedy this problem and generate higher quality summaries, we propose two approaches. The first is a function maximization method which measures the objectivity of each post based on its constituent words. The second is a neural network-based approach, where we use an encoder-decoder architecture. Then, we compare them with an existing approach and show promising results that indicate the effectiveness of our methods.},

abstract = {Rank aggregation is a popular problem that combines different ranked lists from various sources (frequently called voters or judges), and generates a single aggregated list with improved ranking of its items. In this context, a portion of the existing methods attempt to address the problem by treating all voters equally. Nevertheless, several related works proved that the careful and effective assignment of different weights to each voter leads to enhanced performance. In this article, we introduce an unsupervised algorithm for learning the weights of the voters for a specific topic or query. The proposed method is based on the fact that if a voter has submitted numerous elements which have been placed in high positions in the aggregated list, then this voter should be treated as an expert, compared to the voters whose suggestions appear in lower places or do not appear at all. The algorithm iteratively computes the distance of each input list with the aggregated list and modifies the weights of the voters until all weights converge. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally demonstrated by aggregating input lists from six TREC conferences.},

abstract = {Supervised learning algorithms employ labeled training data for classification purposes while obtaining labeled data for large datasets is costly and time consuming. Semi-supervised learning algorithms, on the contrary, use a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data to improve predication performance and thus may be a good alternative to supervised learning algorithms for large text datasets. Although many semi-supervised learning algorithms have been proposed in the data science literature, most of these algorithms are not feasible for discrete and unstructured text data. This paper aims to improve classification accuracy of semi-supervised learning algorithms applied to text data. To achieve this goal, a novel design for convolutional neural network is employed in a co-training semi-supervised learning algorithm which adds augmented data as the second input of the convolutional neural network to predict labels of text data. we also propose a novel approach for partitioning the dataset into independent views via topic modeling to train independent classifiers. In so doing, neighbour classifiers are found and confident predictions of unlabeled data are fused into labeled data. The prediction accuracy of the combined algorithm is then compared to the state-of-the-art supervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms. Our findings show that the proposed combined algorithm outperforms the supervised and semi-supervised algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy. },

In this study, we propose a classifier that quantifies changes in the player’s time series of online gambling behavioral data by using distance measurement with shapelet for the early detection of behaviors in players that could lead to problem gambling. We investigated the prediction capabilities of shapelets that represent behavioral change patterns, and the results showed that shapelet features can improve predictive accuracy. Furthermore, based on this result, we found characteristic behavioral changes leading to problem gambling, such as loss chasing. Subsequently, we demonstrated a possibility for improvements in accuracy using these behavioral change patterns based on expert knowledge.},

abstract = {Most financial institutions mainly use numerical statistics to detect anomalous (malpractice) activity. The textual content in financial records however contains precious information which to date has not been effectively used for detection of anomalous behaviors by users because these are often unintelligible, cluttered with abbreviations, numbers and symbols, which makes it difficult to build a framework system that can coherently understand and draw conclusions. Rule-based techniques have been proposed but such systems are easy to elude, as they are difficult to generalize and do not scale up. The work presented in this paper differs from previous work in that we exclusively base anomalous activities on text (excluding numerical values) in financial records and treat this as a classification problem for a deep learning network. We propose four solutions using deep learning techniques on textual data to distinguish between normal with anomalous behaviors of the users. The results of our experiments convincingly show that use of the textual content in financial records yields greater accuracy in anomalous behavior detection. They also suggest that deep learning is a viable and effective solution for real time anomaly detection by financial institutions. },

abstract = {Humanitarian aid workers who try to provide aid to the most vulnerable populations in the Middle East or Africa are risking their own lives and safety to help others. The current lack of a collaborative real-time information system to predict threats prevents responders and local partners from developing a shared understanding of potentially threatening situations, causing increased response times and leading to inadequate protection. To solve this problem, this paper presents a threat detection and decision support system that combines knowledge and information from a network of responders with automated and modular threat detection. The system consists of three parts. It first collects textual information, ranging from social media, and online news reports to reports and text messages from a decentralized network of humanitarian staff. Second, the system uses deep neural network techniques to automatically detects a threat or incident and provide information including location, threat category, and casualties. Third, given the type of threat and the information extracted by the NER, a feedforward network proposes a mitigation plan based on humanitarian standard operating procedures. The classified information is rapidly redistributed to potentially affected humanitarian workers at any level. The system testing results show a high precision of 0.91 and 0.98 as well as an F-measure of 0.87 and 0.88 in detecting the threats and decision support respectively. We thus combine the collaborative intelligence of a decentralized network of aid workers with the power of deep neural networks.},

This work proposes a multimodal retrieval model for image recall in image-text intertwined lifelogs. Our Attentive Image-Story model combines an Image model, which transfers visual information and textual information to a single representation space, and a Story model, which captures text-based contextual information, with an attention mechanism to reduce the semantic gap between visual and textual information. Experimental results show our model outperforms a state-of-the-art image-based retrieval model and the image/text hybrid system.},

abstract = {Navigability is a distinctive features of graphs associated with artificial or natural systems whose primary goal is the transportation of information or goods. We say that a graph is navigable when an agent is able to efficiently reach any target node in by means of local routing decisions. In a social network navigability translates to the ability of reaching an individual through personal contacts. Graph navigability is well-studied, but a fundamental question is still open: why are some individuals more likely than others to be reached via short, friend-of-a-friend, communication chains? In this article we answer the question above by proposing a novel centrality metric called the potential gain, which, in an informal sense, quantifies the easiness at which a target node can be reached. We define two variants of the potential gain, called the geometric and the exponential potential gain, and present fast algorithms to compute them. The geometric and the potential gain are the first instances of a novel class of composite centrality metrics, i.e., centrality metrics which combine the popularity of a node in G with its similarity to all other nodes. As shown in previous studies, popularity and similarity are two main criteria which regulate the way humans seek for information in large networks such as Wikipedia. We give a formal proof that the potential gain of a node is always equivalent to the product of its degree centrality (which captures popularity) and its Katz centrality (which captures similarity). },

abstract = {Phishing is one of the social engineering techniques to steal users’ sensitive information by disguising a fake Web site as a trustworthy one. Previous research proposed phishing mitigation techniques, such as blacklist, heuristics, visual similarity, and machine learning. However, these kinds of methods have limitation on the detection of a zero-hour phishing site, a phishing site that no one has noticed yet. This paper presents a new approach to the detection of zero-hour phishing sites: proactive detection. If those malicious sites are detected as early as possible, shutdown by the specialized agencies and mitigation of user damages are expected. We also present a method and system of efficient phishing site detection based on the proactive approach. The method is composed of two major parts: suspicious domain names generation and judgment. The former predicts likely phishing Web sites from the given legitimate brand domain name. The latter scores and judges suspects by calculating various indexes. That is, zero-hour phishing sites can be detected by hypothesis and test cycles. As a result of the preliminary experiment, we detected several zero-hour phishing sites disguising as major brands, including eBay, Google, and Amazon.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method of suggesting expanded queries that disambiguate the original Web query which has multiple interpretations. In order to produce a diverse set of queries including those corresponding to infrequent query intents, our method produces queries by extracting phrases connecting given query terms from a corpus. We use a corpus because infrequent query intents may not appear in query logs. We use phrase queries because we need sufficiently specific queries for retrieving pages corresponding to infrequent query intents out of many pages corresponding to popular query intents. Phrase queries usually have high accuracy but low recall. In order to also achieve high recall, we use a disjunction of many phrase queries as a query. Our method first produces many phrase queries by using term expansion and phrase extraction from a corpus, then group semantically similar phrases into clusters, and use each cluster as a disjunctive set of phrase queries.},

abstract = {Attackers can orchestrate a fraudulent resource consumption (FRC) attack by wittingly consuming metered resources of the cloud servers for a long duration of time. The skillful over-consumption of the resources results in significant financial burden to the client. These attacks differ in intent but not in content, hence they are hard to detect. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for the detection of the FRC attack on a cloud based web-server. We first divide the web-pages into a number of quantiles based on their popularity index. Next, we compute the number of requests per hour for each of these quantiles. Discrete Wavelet Transform is then applied to these quantiles to remove any high-frequency anomaly and smoothen the time series data. The n-tuple data from these quantiles along with their label (attack or normal) is used to train an Artificial Neural Network model. Our trained model for low percent of FRC attack (5%) obtained an accuracy of 98.51% with a precision of 0.983 and recall of 0.987 in detecting the FRC attack.},

Since ordering and positioning of characters and words in a document plays a vital role in content analysis, the SentiLangN employs the longest common subsequence and degree similarity to capture inherent semantics of the textual data. SentiLangN introduces averaged character n-gram graph model and an application of long-short-term memory (LSTM) approach for sentiment analysis. The performance of SentiLangN is evaluated over real Twitter dataset, and it performs better than the individual n-gram graph models and traditional machine learning algorithms like C4.5.

abstract = {Knowledge graphs have recently been extensively applied in many different areas (e.g., disaster management and relief, disease diagnosis). For example, event-centric knowledge graphs have been developed to improve decision making in disaster management and relief. This paper focuses on the task of event detection, which is the precondition of event extraction for constructing event-centric knowledge graphs. Event detection identifies trigger words of events in the sentences of a document and further classifies the types of events. It is straightforward that context information is useful for event detection. Therefore, the feature-based methods adopt cross-sentence information. However, they suffer from the complication of human-designed features. On the other hand, the representation-based methods learn document-level embeddings, which, however, contain much noise caused by unsupervised learning. To overcome these problems, in this paper we propose a new model based on Semi-supervised Auto-Encoder, which learns Context information to Enhance Event Detection, thus called SAE-CEED. This model first applies large-scale unlabeled texts to pre-train an auto-encoder, so that the embeddings of segments learned by the encoder contain the semantic and order information of the original text. It then uses the decoder to extract the context embeddings and fine-tunes them to enhance a bidirectional neural network model to identify event triggers and their types in sentences. Through experiments on the benchmark ACE-2005 dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SAE-CEED model. In addition, we systematically conduct a series of experiments to verify the impact of different lengths of text segments in the pre-training of the auto-encoder on event detection.},

abstract = {Understanding the dynamic properties of epidemic spreading on complex social networks is essential to make effective and efficient public health policies for epidemic prevention and control. In recent years, the concept of network embedding has attracted lots of attention to deal with various network analytic tasks, the purpose of which is to encode relationships or information of networked elements into a low-dimensional vector space. However, most existing embedding methods have focused mainly on preserving static network information, such as structural proximity, node/edge attributes, and labels. On the contrary, in this paper, we focus on the embedding problem of preserving dynamic characteristics of epidemic spreading on social networks. We propose a novel embedding method, namely EpiRep, to learn node representations of a network by maximizing the likelihood of preserving groups of infected nodes due to the epidemics starting from every single node on the network. Specifically, the Susceptible-Infectious model is adopted to simulate the epidemic dynamics on networks, and the Continuous Bag-of-Words model with negative sampling is used to obtain node representations. Experimental results show that the EpiRep method outperforms two benchmark random-walk based embedding methods in terms of node clustering and classification on several synthetic and real-world networks. The proposed method and findings in this paper may offer new insight for source identification and infection prevention in the face of epidemic spreading on social networks.},

abstract = {Active surveillance, which aims at detecting and controlling infectious diseases at an early stage, is essential to prevent the spread of infections, protect people’s health, and promote social good. One difficult problem in active surveillance is how to intelligently sample a small group of nodes as sentinels from a large number of individuals for detecting the outbreaks of infectious diseases as early as possible. To sample sentinels, the existing methods depending on the global information about a social network are infeasible for mapping out social connections is time-consuming and inaccurate. Instead, some existing studies utilize local information about individuals’ connected neighbors to heuristically select sentinels. However, few of them take into account the temporal structure of social connections, which is believed to have a direct effect on the spread of infectious diseases. In this paper, we propose two temporal-network surveillance strategies for selecting sentinels based on the friendship paradox theory, a sociological theory describing a phenomenon in social networks that most people have fewer friends than their friends have. By simulating our strategies with three existing strategies based on the susceptible-infected (SI) model, the results show that our proposed 1stAN and 2ndRN strategies can detect the outbreak of infectious diseases earlier than the other strategies on the synthetic temporal network and two real-world temporal social networks, respectively.},

abstract = {Image recognition aims to identify objects, places, people, or other targeted items in a given image, and has a wide range of social applications such as natural disasters recognition, plant disease detection, and traffic jam detection. Currently state-of-the-art methods of image recognition are based on deep learning and remain a common pattern in designing and using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, designing CNNs is extremely time intensive and requires an expert. Neural architecture search (NAS) can solve this problem by automatically identifying architectures of CNNs that are superior to hand-designed ones. Recently BO has been applied to neural architecture search and shows better performance than pure evolutionary strategies. All these methods adopt Gaussian processes (GPs) as surrogate function, with the handcraft similarity metrics as input. In this work, we propose a Bayesian graph neural network as a new surrogate, which can automatically extract features from deep neural architectures, and use such learned features to fit and characterize black-box objectives and their uncertainty. Based on the new surrogate, we then develop a graph Bayesian optimization framework to address the challenging task of deep neural architecture search. Experiment results show our method significantly outperforms the comparative methods on benchmark tasks.},
