abstract = {As a process, information interaction is (fairly) well defined; considerable amount of research is devoted to the topic in various areas, particularly in human information behavior and human-computer interaction. In contrast the notion of "context" in which this interaction takes place is ill or not defined and rarely researched -- mostly it is taken as a primitive term. Paul Watzlawick (1921-2007) facing a similar issue as to the notion of "communication" formulated five axioms in his theory of communication; the most famous is the first axiom: "One Cannot Not Communicate (Man kann nicht nicht kommunizieren)." [1]. Directly following Watzlawick's axioms, this address is an attempt to formulate five axioms related to "context" in information interaction. We start with an assumption that information interaction involves two distinct parties: an information system on the one hand, and an information user (or group of users) on the other hand. Systems and users are partners in interaction. Both have a context, but since there is no interaction without a user (or group), we concentrate here mostly with the user side of the context.Axiom 1: One cannot not have a context in information interaction. Every interaction is conducted within a context. Because context-less information interaction is impossible, it is not possible not to have a context.Axiom 2: Every interaction has a content and relationship aspect -- context is the later and classifies the former. It means that all interactions, apart from information derived from meaning of words or terms describing the content, have more information to be derived from context.Axiom 3: The nature of information interaction is asymmetric; it involves differing processes and interpretation by parties involved. Contexts are asymmetric as well. Systems context is primarily about meanings; user context is primarily about situations.Axiom 4: Context is multilayered. It extends beyond users or systems. In interactions it is customary to consider direct context, but context extends indirectly to broader social context also.Axiom 5: Context is not self-revealing, nor is it self-evident. Context may be difficult to formulate and synthesize. But plenty can go wrong when not taken into consideration in interactions.The problem of context is determining the conditions and circumstances that are relevant to a given information interaction; with this, the notion of information interaction context is connected with the notion of relevance in information science.},

We conducted a diary study of a heterogeneous population (n=38), in the non-work related activity of watching television, and we received 381 responses. From the collected responses, we used a bottom-up approach to generate coding schemes for the needs and reasons given for those needs, respectively. Subsequently, 4 coders tested the coherency of the coding schemes by coding 50 random needs and reasons, and this revealed a large consistency in the use of the schemes. Our findings reveal important aspects of information behaviour in the context of television viewing and show how the characteristics of information needs can be different in leisure or non-work situations. We also found that contextual factors are very influential in relation to the needs and reasons. With these findings we provide important knowledge in relation to future television information systems design.},

Results indicate that generally those who exhibit a more Visual style of processing or those who exhibit simultaneously a high level of both Visual and Verbal styles of processing as well as scoring high on the Curiosity scale tend to multitask the most. A similar pattern emerged with respect to the two information search tasks.

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that exploratory search tasks require more search support than currently provided on most commercial Information Retrieval (IR) systems. As a result, richer modes of interaction, and more functional IR systems are being developed. But these next generation IR systems come at a cost: they can place a large cognitive load on the user during interaction, and hamper progress. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between search tasks and search interfaces, and try to understand when system support is most effective for search tasks. We present a user study comprising known-item and exploratory search tasks and different interfaces that provide varying levels of system support. A quantitative and qualitative data analysis was conducted on the users' performances, preferences, and search behaviours. Our findings suggest that a relationship exists between the level of system support and search tasks, and that system support is most effective when it is enabling search activities appropriate to the task},

abstract = {Today, if a website owner or blogger wants to provide a search interface on their web site, they have essentially two options: web search or site search. Site search is often too narrow and web search often too broad. We propose a context-specific alternative: the use of 'topical search engines' (TopS) providing results focused on a specific topic determined by the site owner. For example a photography blog could offer a search interface focused on photography.In this paper, we describe a promising new approach to easily create such topical search engines with minimal manual effort. In our approach, whenever we have enough contextual information, we alter ambiguous topic related queries issued to a generic search engine by adding contextual keywords derived from (topic-specific) query logs; the altered queries help focus the search engine's results to the specific topic of interest. Our solution is deployed as a query wrapper, requiring no change in the underlying search engine.We present techniques to automatically extract queries related to a topic from a web click graph, identify suitable query contexts from these topical queries, and use these contexts to alter queries that are ambiguous or under-specified. We present statistics on three topical search engine prototypes we created. We then describe an evaluation study with the prototypes we developed in the areas of photography and automobiles. We conducted three tests comparing these prototypes to baseline engines with and without fixed query refinements. In each test, we obtained preference judgments from over a hundred participants. Users showed a strong preference for TopS prototypes in all three tests, with statistically significant preference differences ranging from 16% to 42%.},

The participants were given ten scenarios, for which they were asked to retrieve all the relevant images in the database. Each participant was randomly assigned to one of four retrieval interfaces: tag search in a search box; faceted tag search in a search box, selecting terms from the tag cloud of all the tags in the database and selecting concepts from an ontology created from the tags assigned to the images. Each interface was tested by 21 users. The results show that the highest recall on average was achieved by users of the ontology interface, for seven out of the ten tasks, however users were more satisfied with the textbox based search than the cloud or the ontology. Differences between the precision values were small (less than 10%), but none of the interfaces clearly outdid the others. In terms of recall, on average there was a 27% difference between the group achieving the highest and lowest recall.},

abstract = {Task-based information access is a significant context for studying information interaction and for developing information retrieval (IR) systems. Molecular medicine (MM) is an information-intensive and rapidly growing task domain, which aims at providing new approaches to the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of various diseases. The development of bioinformatics databases and tools has led to an extremely distributed information environment. There are numerous generic and domain-specific tools and databases available for online information access. This renders MM as a fruitful context for research in task-based IR. The present paper examines empirically task-based information access in MM and analyzes task processes as contexts of information access and interaction, integrated use of resources in information access and the limitations of (simple server-side) log analysis in understanding information access, retrieval sessions in particular. We shed light on the complexity of the between-systems interaction. The findings suggest that the system development should not be done in isolation as there is considerable interaction between them in real world use. We also classify system-level strategies of information access integration that can be used to reduce the amount of manual system integration by task performers.},

Contrary to Cranfield-style evaluation methods, our approach recognizes that a user's initial search interaction is with the result page produced by a search system, not the landing pages linked from it. Our key contribution is that the method allows us to investigate aspects of component relevance that are difficult or impossible to judge in isolation. Such contextual aspects include component-level information redundancy and cross-component coherence. We report on how the method complements traditional document relevance measurement and its support for comparative relevance assessment across multiple search engines. We also study possible issues with applying the method, including brand presentation effects, inter-judge agreement, and comparisons with document-based relevance judgments. Our findings show this is a useful method for evaluating the dominant user experience in interacting with search systems.},

abstract = {The relevance of a document has many facets, going beyond the usual topical one, which have to be considered to satisfy a user's information need. Multiple representations of documents, like user-given reviews or the actual document content, can give evidence towards certain facets of relevance. In this respect polyrepresentation of documents, where such evidence is combined, is a crucial concept to estimate the relevance of a document. In this paper, we discuss how a geometrical retrieval framework inspired by quantum mechanics can be extended to support polyrepresentation. We show by example how different representations of a document can be modelled in a Hilbert space, similar to physical systems known from quantum mechanics. We further illustrate how these representations are combined by means of the tensor product to support polyrepresentation, and discuss the case that representations of documents are not independent from a user point of view. Besides giving a principled framework for polyrepresentation, the potential of this approach is to capture and formalise the complex interdependent relationships that the different representations can have between each other.},

abstract = {Interactive Information Retrieval refers to the branch of Information Retrieval that considers the retrieval process with respect to a wide range of contexts, which may affect the user's information seeking experience. The identification and representation of such contexts has been the object of the principle of Polyrepresentation, a theoretical framework for reasoning about different representations arising from interactive information retrieval in a given context. Although the principle of Polyrepresentation has received attention from many researchers, not much empirical work has been done based on it. One reason may be that it has not yet been formalised mathematically.In this paper we propose an up-to-date and flexible mathematical formalisation of the principle of Polyrepresentation for information needs. Specifically, we apply Subjective Logic to model different representations of information needs as beliefs marked by degrees of uncertainty. We combine such beliefs using different logical operators, and we discuss these combinations with respect to different retrieval scenarios and situations. A formal model is introduced and discussed, with illustrative applications to the modelling of information needs.},

The proposed model is verified by a multiple linear regression analysis based on 50 users' interaction features collected from a task-based user study of interactive CBIR systems. To our best knowledge, this is the first principled user classification model in CBIR verified by a formal and systematic qualitative analysis of extensive user interaction data.},

abstract = {Exploratory search is a difficult activity that requires iterative interaction. This iterative process helps the searcher to understand and to refine the information need. It also generates a rich set of data that can be used effectively to reflect on what has been found (and found useful). While traditional information retrieval systems have focused on organizing the data that was retrieved, in this paper, we describe a systematic approach to organizing the metadata generated during the search process. We describe a framework for unifying transitions among various stages of exploratory search, and show how context from one stage can be applied to the next. The framework can be used both to describe existing information-seeking interactions, and as a means of generating novel ones. We illustrate the framework with examples from a session-based exploratory search system prototype.},

The overall objective of the study is in a systematic manner to learn how and for what types of evaluations the concept is applied. In particular we are interested to learn whether the recommendations for how to apply simulated work task situations are followed.The preliminary findings indicate a need for clarifications of the recommendations of how to use simulated work task situations. Particularly with respect to 'realism' of the simulated work task situations, which is emphasised through the need for tailoring of the simulated work task situations towards the group of study participant to ensure the depicted situations are realistic and interesting from the participants' point of view. Likewise it seems that the recommendation to involve the study participants' own information needs (to function as baseline of search interaction) is generally neglected in the reported studies.},

Sixty subjects (30 pairs) were asked to complete search tasks based on a simulated work situations using an institutional repository. Subsequently, subjects were instructed to visually depict how they thought the institutional repository worked and then explain this to their partner. Our findings are based on these drawings, descriptors written on drawings, and audio-recordings of explanations and conversations. The results reveal that most of the subjects constructed mental models focusing on system operations and the design of the user interface. Few highlighted the interactivity between the system and the end user or presented a global-view of the system to show how it related to other search engines or databases. We found that the co-discovery method provides a viable research design to elicit people's mental model construction. The implications of the results for interactive information retrieval community and institutional repository community are discussed in terms of research design, search behavior, and user instruction.},

abstract = {Users often conduct exploratory searches on the Web to solve complex problems, but how for evaluating the effectiveness of a search, especially in a user-centered approach, remains an open question. We propose a user-centered method to evaluate the effectiveness of an exploratory search by focusing on the change in the users' mental representations of a topic during their exploratory search on the Web. This was done by comparing the concept maps depicted before and after each users searching. Thirty-five undergraduate students recruited from various departments and universities participated in our experiment. The participants were instructed to search for and gather Web pages for the task of writing a term paper on two given topics, politics and media, while working in either of two scenarios: "Selective scenario" (identifying only ten Web pages as important) and "As-Many-As scenario" (collecting as many Web pages as possible). The participants were divided into two groups: one group searched for both topics in the Selective scenario, and the other searched for them in the As-Many-As scenario. They composed their concept maps before and after searching. We defined the following measures to show the differences between the maps before and after a search to analyze the concept maps made by the participants: common, new, and lost map components like nodes, links, and link labels. We used these measures to compare the results from different topics, scenarios, and browser types. The results showed that the concept maps greatly changed after searching and that there were more common nodes and link labels in the Selective scenario than in the As-Many-As scenario. A comparative analysis of the concept maps between the pre- and post-search maps indicated that the users significantly changed their knowledge structure of a topic by completing the exploratory search task.},

This provides insights about searcher's interactions with the "whole page", and not just individual components. In addition, we used clustering techniques to identify groups of individuals, with distinct gaze patterns. The groups varied in how exhaustively they examined the search results and in what regions of the search result page they paid most attention to (organic results vs. ads). These results further our understanding of how attention is distributed across increasingly complex search result pages, and how individuals exhibit distinct patterns of attention and interaction.},

These summaries typically include a snippet -- a collection of text fragments from the underlying document -- that has some relation to the query that is being answered.In this study we investigate how 10 humans construct snippets: participants first generate their own natural language snippet, and then separately extract a snippet by choosing text fragments, for four queries related to two documents. By mapping their generated snippets back to text fragments in the source document using eye tracking data, we observe that participants extract these same pieces of text around 73% of the time when creating their extractive snippets.In comparison, we notice that automated approaches for extracting snippets only use these same fragments 10% of the time. However, when the automated methods are evaluated using a position-independent bag-of-words approach, as typically used in the research literature for evaluating snippets, they are scored much more highly, seemingly extracting the "correct" text 24% of the time.In addition to demonstrating this large scope for improvement in snippet generation algorithms with our novel methodology, we also offer a series of observations on the behaviour of participants as they constructed their snippets.},

The first determines what the system will search for and the second is frequently used to evaluate how the system behaved. With a large human involvement, these stages are expected to be largely influenced by user and task characteristics. To analyze the influence of these context features on the specified stages of health information retrieval, we conducted a user study in which we collected user features through two questionnaires. User characteristics include features like age, gender, web search experience, health search experience and familiarity with the medical topic. Task features include the medical specialty, the question type, the task's clarity and the task's easiness. Besides user and task features, the relevance assessment analysis also covered features related to the query and document. We found many variables do indeed aect query formulation and relevance judgment. Some of our results question evaluations using test collections and ask for evaluation models that incorporate other kind of success measures.},

We compared behavioral variables that characterized QRIs during which useful pages were found with those during which no useful pages were found. Our results demonstrated that the QRI duration and the total time spent on content pages during QRIs with useful pages were significantly longer than during QRIs with no useful pages. Users viewed more content pages and spent more time on content pages than on search result pages during QRIs with useful pages. The findings suggest that user behavior during QRIs can be used as an indicator of QRIs containing useful documents.},

In this paper, we report on the impact of state-of-the-art human indexing techniques, exemplified by MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms, in the document representation. We studied queries formulated by four different kinds of information seekers interactively using an experimental IR system: (1) search novices; (2) domain experts; (3) search experts and (4) medical librarians. The 3,442,321 documents came from the TREC 2004 Genomics Track document set. Effectiveness of retrieval was measured using the relevance judgments provided by TREC. Inclusion of MeSH terms in the document representation did not affect the effectiveness of queries with respect to precision and recall. Adding MeSH terms to the index did not have a positive impact on the effectiveness of queries formulated by different kinds of users. These findings contribute to our understanding of the associations between the users' cognitive space and the information objects in light of the principle of polyrepresentation.},

The aim of the analysis it twofold: (i) To identify differences in the query space, content space, user sessions, and user click behavior. (ii) To enhance the query log by including annotations of queries, sessions and actions. The paper presents plans to use this resource for further research on information retrieval for children. We found statistically significant differences between the set of general purpose queries, and the set of children queries. We show that many of these differences are consistent with small-scale research studies in which children were observed while using web search engines.},

abstract = {Evaluation is needed in order to benchmark and improve systems. In information retrieval (IR), evaluation is centered around the test collection, i.e. the set of documents that systems should retrieve given the matching queries coming from users. Much of the evaluation is uniform, i.e. there is one test collection and every query is processed in the same way by a system. But does one size fit all? Queries are created by different users in different contexts. This paper presents a method to contextualize the IR evaluation using search logs. We study search log files in the archival domain, and the retrieval of archival finding aids in the popular standard Encoded Archival Description (EAD) in particular. We study various aspects of the searching behavior in the log, and use them to define particular searcher stereotypes. Focusing on two user stereotypes, namely novice and expert users, we can automatically derive queries and pseudo-relevance judgments from the interaction data in the log files. We investigate how this can be used for context-sensitive system evaluation tailored to these user stereotypes. Our findings are in line with and complement prior user studies of archival users. The results also show that satisfying the demand of expert users is harder compared to novices as experts have more challenging information seeking needs, but also that the choice of system does not influence the relative IR performance of a system between different user groups.},

Specifically, this paper is concerned with the moves and tactics that 36 people used while conducting 141 searches of a video retrieval system. Transaction logs captured the participants' search strategies; each search move was coded and the data were examined for maximal repeating patterns (MRPs). Thirteen different search patterns (i.e., tactics) were used by the study participants; the tactics were mainly characterized by (1) the addition of concepts, resulting in a decrease in the size of the results set, and (2) frequent display and browsing of the search results. To explore the possibility that the multimedia character of the materials in the collection might affect people's search behaviors, these results are compared to results from an earlier study of search tactics used when searching a textual/factual database.},

As a blogger writes a post, the system automatically retrieves and displays links to web resources (web sites, news stories, video, etc) that are relevant to the bogger's entry. CONTEXT continuously monitors the blog post for new search keywords to find and display the most relevant resources to the blogger. The main goal of this system is to inform the blogger in real time of other related discussions that are going on in the blogosphere or elsewhere and give her/him a chance to be part of the 'global' conversation and thus improve his/her entry by incorporating some of the suggested resources into a post. Our expectation is that CONTEXT will lead to more interactive and content-rich blog entries, in which bloggers are not just expressing their own opinions, but they are also addressing each other and building on each other's arguments.},

This is an emerging problem due to the increased information access and engagement by children for their education and entertainment, and the explosion of stream-based information sources on most topics.It has been shown that children have difficulties formulating text-based queries and using interfaces primarily designed for adults. The in-progress system presented in this paper attempts to address these difficulties by employing an interaction-based interface that simplifies the expression of information needs and adapts itself to user interests over time. To overcome issues of content moderation, the system aggregates multiple child-friendly information feeds and performs offline processing to facilitate topic filtering. A set of standing topics are created for initial interaction and subsequent interactions are used to infer and refine which topics the child would most likely want to have presented. A simple and easy-to-use interface is presented which uses relevance information to determine the appropriate size of the document title to display to act as a relevance-cue to the user.The planned research focuses on validating the interaction-based approach with both child and adult populations to discover the differences and similarities that may exist.},

We adapt a model of the serendipitous process that examines serendipity more holistically. Using previously collected data, we focus on understanding the precipitating conditions that must be present to facilitate serendipity. Results suggest that serendipity occurs during social networking and active learning, and more specifically in the act of exploratory search. Results also suggest that serendipity is not always instant -- the usefulness of triggers may not be immediately apparent and a period of incubation is sometimes necessary before recognition of the serendipitous nature of a latent trigger is attained. Implications for the design of information systems are explored and support for the incubation period is discussed.},

In order to address this objective a user study was conducted that involved the completion of questionnaires, use of eye tracking technology, talk aloud protocols and post-search interviews. As opposed to previous studies, the present research asked participants to search for real information needs that represented different search contexts (e.g. from searches about personal interest to academic related searches). This permitted the identification of several relevance criteria that naturally occur across different search contexts and the emergence of some fixation patterns, not observed before, associated to the use of these criteria.
