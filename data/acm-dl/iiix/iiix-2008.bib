abstract = {The Cranfield projects began in 1958 -- fifty years ago. They have of course been extraordinarily influential, forming a view of information retrieval as an experimental science, which in some fashion persists to this day. Although the Cranfield tradition has had its ups and downs - the main down being in the late eighties, when it showed signs of being moribund - it revived and regained its status in the nineties with the start of TREC, and remains an extremely influential world-view of the field of search (as it is now commonly known) as we approach the second decade of the 21st century. At the same time, the field itself has become vastly better known, and IR systems vastly more widely used, as a result of the spread of the world wide web and the development of the web search engine.But the Cranfield/TREC view of IR has always been partial and biased. In particular, it has very greatly encouraged and promoted research into models, methods and algorithms appropriate to what is seen as the core search functionality of IR systems, at the expense of interaction, cognition, and the task-and user-context of search. It is the case that the basic Cranfield formalisation of the search task itself (receive a query, supply a result set) ignores such aspects; but this is not in itself the heart of the problem. The central problem is that these wider aspects are resistant to being studied experimentally in a laboratory setting.The essence of a laboratory experiment is abstraction. The principle is that we abstract, from the complexities and messiness of the real world, some small set of variables representing some limited aspects of the world. The abstraction is defined by both the choice of which aspects to include and which to leave out, and the nature of the variables themselves, whose laboratory representation may be a simplification of their counterparts in the real world.The laboratory, and the abstraction of the laboratory experiment, is a fundamental and extraordinarily useful device in the scientific method. Theories and models that can be defined in the context of laboratory abstractions, and tested rigorously in that context, have provided us with vast insights and hugely extended understanding of phenomena in the real world - and continue to do so. However, it is also the case that some phenomena in the real world are more resistant than others to such abstraction. The study of the phenomena of force, mass, motion and so on, that gave us such insights into basic physics, were much easier to abstract in this way than the phenomena associated with life. During the 20th century, but not before, we began to be able to study at least some aspects of life in the laboratory. But even within physics, much of our knowledge and understanding came from observational astronomy, with chance events that we happened to observe in the real universe, over the several millennia since Babylon, playing a huge role.Typically, we cannot expect to understand everything we need to know about a set of phenomena from laboratory abstractions. Even more, we cannot expect to do so from a single laboratory abstraction. We enlist the help of laboratory abstractions where and when we can; ideally we should seek several different ways to abstract the world for laboratory investigation, as well as seeking insights more directly from the real world.In some respects, the Cranfield tradition has become relatively rich. Although some parts of the abstraction that it represents are common to many laboratory experiments in IR, there has been a range of different approaches and ideas within it - as represented by the TREC tracks and other experiments outside TREC. These experiments have included serious forays into the more difficult aspects that I mentioned above, such as interaction, cognition, and the task-and user-context of search. Some of the difficulties thus revealed are obvious enough - difficulties of scale and reproducibility among them. However, some seem to be more subtle.One difficulty might be described thus. The main focus of all Cranfield/TREC work is system effectiveness - the object of virtually all experiments in this tradition is to evaluate the effectiveness of a method or component, or to compare multiple methods/components for effectiveness, or to optimise a set of parameters for effectiveness, and so on. But this object does not seem to fit well with, say, work on interaction, which tends to be much more interested in questions like 'If I provide this UI feature or device, how do users perceive and use it?' - with no necessity to attach value-judgments to the possible answers.Perhaps, indeed, this focus is itself a limitation, and an unnecessary one, of the Cranfield/TREC tradition. If we take the view that we would like to see IR as (at least in some sense) an experimental science, then it is worth enquiring more deeply into the role of experiment in science.A very cavalier account of how science works is as follows. We gather data about a class of phenomena; we try to formulate models or theories to describe or account for the phenomena; we push the models or theories to give us hypotheses, predictions about other things that we have not yet observed; and we then try to observe those new things, in order to test hypotheses. The role of experiments is sometimes in the initial data-gathering, and often after the formation of theories in straightforward measurement; but the main fundamental scientific contribution of experiments is in the testing of hypotheses.If we think of a typical TREC-style IR experiment as a test of a hypothesis, then it seems that the only form of hypothesis which we ever test is 'if we apply this model, search will be more effective.' This feels like a very limited class of hypotheses. I would like to suggest that we should be trying to open out the possibilities. We should be looking for ways in which our models or theories might be made to give us other kinds of hypotheses, which we could hope to test in experiments.I don't think such a change in the paradigm associated with Cranfield and TREC would be easy, and I'm not at all clear myself on how to go about it. But if it were possible, it could have the effect of breaking down, at least to some extent, the present barrier between what is seen as the Cranfield tradition on the one hand, and all those domains mentioned above, which are also of fundamental interest to IR, on the other.},

Interfaces for information seeking range from systems which offer little contextual information or flexibility of use to systems which are highly driven by the searcher's individual interaction. In this talk I will use existing search interfaces to highlight how the nature of information retrieval interfaces has changed in response to research from contextual IS&amp;R. A particular theme will be the commercial nature of web search interfaces and how approaches such as persuasive and emotional design can be used to encourage interaction. I will also consider the nature of specialized versus general purpose search interfaces and the challenges raised in interface design. The (not very) hidden agenda behind this presentation will be to argue for an interaction-centered approach to IR systems.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a study on search strategies in multimodal image retrieval. We analyzed the queries and search tactics employed by image journalism professionals and non-professionals in a user test. Transaction log data show that searchers are able to combine up to four query modes into a query. Most queries combined at least two of the modes (text, color, sketch, quality, and category). Task type was shown to affect the choice of which modes to employ. Known item and data search tasks led to queries combining text, color and category modes. Visually cued tasks resulted in searches combining several content-based and textual modes. Conceptual tasks led to a large number of queries by text and category only. User background also significantly affected the types of queries constructed. Professionals used the color mode more whereas non-professionals drew more sketches. Non-professionals were more likely to switch query modes whereas professionals edited the content of their queries. We described the search processes with Markov models and maximal repeating patterns. Common patterns and probable transitions dealt with querying, inspecting result images and saving them into the workspace or iterating queries of the same type. The results indicate a need to support multimodal image query formulation.},

User queries represent the evolution of information problems. A deeper understanding of the structure and process of query reformulation, in particular, could provide further information for system adaptations. The present study characterizes the query reformulation process in two types of term suggestion devices, relevance feedback (RF) and Local Context Analysis (LCA), in simulated question-answering tasks using Rutgers' TREC-8 Interactive Track dataset. Four types of query reformulation were identified on the basis of semantic contents and relations, as well as sequences in users' modifications of queries. We found a significant relationship between the types of query reformulations and the use of term suggestion devices. But we did not find significant correlations between types of query reformulations and search performance. Some issues regarding systematic biases in query reformulations and capturing context within queries in interactive IR system are discussed.},

abstract = {Current Information Retrieval systems are often based on topicality. They estimate relevance by comparing the similarity between the user query and each document. These systems do not take into account important contextual information. More specifically, they do not often apply mechanisms to filter out redundant information. We interpret context here as the set of chunks of text from the ranked set of documents that the user has already seen. This is a valuable contextual information to guide the retrieval processes in a way that avoids redundancy. It is desirable that the ranking of results is composed by relevant but also novel material. This means that each document must provide to the user unseen information which is related to his need.In this work we study different novelty detection approaches that make good use of this contextual information. We show that these techniques can be applied effectively and efficiently at the sentence level.},

Lexical cohesion is a characteristic of natural language texts, which can be used to determine whether the query terms are used in the same context in the document. In this paper we make use of a graph-based approach to capture term contexts and estimate the level of lexical cohesion in a document.

It is recognized that the harnessing of an individual's memories about HDM items can be used as context data (such as user location at the time of item access) to aid retrieval. We present a pilot study, using one subject's HDM, of remembered context data and its utility in retrieval. Our results explore the types of context data best remembered for different item types and categories over time and show that context appears to become a more important factor in effective HDM IR over time as the subject's recall of contents declines.},

This context is then integrated with traditional desktop search techniques to enable task-based document retrieval.Building upon Connections, a system that identifies task context by passively monitoring the user's interaction with their documents within the file system. Confluence also traces user activity within the user interface and incorporates methods to analyze and integrate this new stream of information.

User interests reflect generally the user background and topics of interests. However most of the proposed personalized retrieval models and strategies do not distinguish between short term and long term user interests and make use of the whole search history to improve the search accuracy. In this paper, we study how to learn long term user interests by aggregating concept-based short term ones identified within related search activities. For this purpose, we tackle the problem of session boundary recognition using context-sensitive similarity measures that are able to gauge the changes in the user interest topics with regard to reference ontology. Finally, the search personalization is achieved by re-ranking the search results for a given query using the short term user interest. Our experimental evaluation is carried out using TREC collection and shows that personalization brings significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness. Moreover, we observe that our context-sensitive session boundary recognition method can, to some extent, find a semantic correlation between the query and the user context across the search sessions.},

To this aim, we develop a TREC-like benchmark, in which the collection is made up by a set of application descriptors and the topics are made up by context descriptors. We then use the benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of different descriptors components, and of structured and unstructured (i.e., free text) data, finding results that are somehow useful for future MoBe development. We also discuss the issue of the evaluation methodology for highly interactive and novel applications like context-aware retrieval systems, and MoBe in particular.},

Before completing the final evaluation, three-fourths of the subjects were provided with feedback about their performances. Subjects were assigned randomly to one of four feedback conditions: a baseline condition where no feedback was provided; an actual feedback condition where subjects were provided with their real performances; and two conditions where subjects were deceived and told that they performed very well or very poorly.

abstract = {Archival finding aids are long and complexly structured documents describing archival material---the paper trails of the lives of corporate bodies, persons, and families. Currently, finding aids are encoded in XML using the standard Encoded Archival Description (EAD) and made available to the public on web-sites of archival institutions. But how to provide access to such long and complexly structured documents? On the one hand, users tend to look for specific archival material that may be deeply nested inside the archive. On the other hand, interpreting the meaning of an item is crucially dependent on its context.Using insights from the field of XML retrieval---a subfield of information retrieval that has recently attracted a lot of attention, mainly through the annual evaluation effort in INEX---we developed three different systems for searching in collections of digital finding aids corresponding to three fundamental choices about archival access. The first system provides access to the fonds or archive as a whole; the second system provides direct access to individual archival material at any level of description; the third system retrieves archival material while preserving the original context. This paper reports on the results of an extensive user study with the three systems. Our main finding is that test persons have a preference for the third system that retrieves archival material in their original context, with test persons indicating that the system assisted them in assessing relevancy, navigation and direct access to relevant parts of the finding aids.},

abstract = {This paper describes the preliminary results of a case study of task-based interactive information seeking and retrieval behaviour of virtual museum visitors in context. The research described here is part of a larger study: this paper specifically looks at 1) leisure tasks/interests and derived information needs, and 2) main characteristics of virtual museum visitors' information seeking behaviour. Both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from written enquiries to the museum, an online questionnaire and a user study of simulated interest tasks combined with retrospective think-aloud sessions. The data collected did not show exploratory behaviour to be predominant as expected. Rather analysis of data indicates a broad coverage of different types of needs. Finally, four main characteristics of virtual museum guests' information seeking behaviour were identified},

abstract = {This paper reports on an explorative study of information need characteristics in a television broadcast context. Nine in-depth interviews are conducted with scholars and students within the academic field of Media Studies, and we identify four characteristics. Firstly, broadcasts are needed as objects of analysis in empirical research. Secondly, the needs are related to three broadcast dimensions: 1) Transmission; 2) Archive; and 3) Reception. Thirdly, four fundamental types of information needs are verified in a television broadcast context: 1) Known item; 2) Factual data; 3) Known topic or content; and 4) Muddled topic or content. Fourthly, the interviewees' needs consist of four phases: 1) Getting an overview of transmitted broadcasts; 2) Identification of borderline exemplars; 3) Selection of specific programmes; and 4) Verification of facts. In this way, the present paper presents novel research on characteristics of information needs in a television broadcast context. This knowledge is imperative for the design and construction of future broadcast retrieval systems.},

abstract = {The paper presents the results of a case study of searcher's relevance criteria used for assessments of Web pages in a perspective of learning style. 15 test persons participated in the experiments based on two simulated work tasks that provided cover stories to trigger their information needs. Two learning styles were examined: Global and Sequential learners. The study applied eye-tracking for the observation of relevance hot spots on Web pages, learning style index analysis and post-search interviews to gain more in-depth information on relevance behavior.Findings reveal that with respect to use of graded relevance scores and number of relevance criteria applied per task and test person there are no significant difference between the different styles. Although there differences are detected in the use of relevance criteria between Global and Sequential learners during assessments, they are statistically insignificant. When interviewed in retrospective the resulting profiles tend to become even similar across learning styles but a shift occurs from instant assessments with content features of web pages replacing topicality judgments as predominant relevance criteria.},

abstract = {Many current evaluation techniques for information retrieval, such as test collections and simulations, are difficult to apply in situations where queries and preferred results are context-dependent. This is particularly true in personal metasearch applications, which provide a person with unified search access to all their usual online sources. A recently-proposed technique, based on presenting two or more search results sets in a single comparison interface, offers an alternative.We have embedded this technique in a working personal metasearch tool which we have distributed to volunteers. Initial experiments with server selection suggest that the technique is accepted by users, can operate over diverse and unarticulated contexts, and that the data it provides can provide a useful comparison to that from test collections. Further experimentation with the technique is continuing.},

abstract = {Writing professional documents requires finding relevant related information. Although the availability of information constantly increases, seeking for information relevant for the task is not easy. A Proactive Recommendation System (PRS) retrieves information relevant to the written text and presents it without user intervention. The information presented can improve the quality of the text, but can also interrupt the process of writing. We investigated the impact of a PRS on writing in comparison to active seeking situations. We explored the effects of both ways to access information (active versus proactive) during the different stages of writing. The results suggest that people need to access information especially in the first stage of writing: planning. Participants found that proactive presentation of relevant information is more useful and less disturbing during planning.},

abstract = {This paper presents an empirical model of Arabic-speaking children's interaction with the International Children's Digital Library (ICDL). The model is based on data collected from ten children ages 6--10 who interacted with the ICDL to find information for assigned and self-generated tasks. Two contexts influenced children's information seeking behavior: 1. the non-naturalistic laboratory environment where they used the ICDL as volunteers rather than as part of their everyday life or as a requirement for an assignment, and 2. the international and multicultural nature of the ICDL that provided access to an Arabic book collection, but did not support analytical searching in Arabic. The model presents 7 modes that characterized children's information seeking behavior and the range of moves associated with them. Underlying the behavior is the children's information need and their affective states that consisted of uncertainty and anxiety in the beginning and certainty and satisfaction upon completing the tasks.},

Eleven participants performed two different types of web search, an informational task and a transactional task, and their think aloud protocols and behaviors were recorded. Analyses of the screen capture logs showed that the task type affected the participants' informationseeking behaviors. In the transactional task, participants visited more web pages than for the informational task, but their reading time for each page was shorter than in the informational task. A preliminary analysis of eye-movement data for nine participants revealed characteristics of the scanpaths followed in search result pages as well as the distribution of lookzones for each task.},
