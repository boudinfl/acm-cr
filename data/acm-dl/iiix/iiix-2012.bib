abstract = {According to the principle of Polyrepresentation (Ingwersen &amp; J\"{a}rvelin, 2005; Ingwersen, 2012) bibliographic references in scientific documents as well as citations to documents have the potential of serving as useful features for re-ranking of retrieved documents. References (and thus citations) can be seen as footprints of information interaction, because of the behavioral conventions built in to the scientific communication and publication process. They are manifestations of degrees of utility of methods, results and ideas made earlier on by other scientists. The use of references in IR has been demonstrated to improve retrieval performance (Skov et al. 2008), whereas the number of citations has not provided similar improvements.},

abstract = {For some time now, the general goal of information retrieval (IR) has been to present a user with an optimally ranked set of results as quickly as possible. At first glance, things seem to be working well: users often find what they need on the first search results page, they do not have to create their own queries or read through multiple pages of text, and soon they may not even have to think of their own information needs. Researchers document success by showing reductions in time and amount of interaction, and increased user satisfaction, but do these measures really allow researchers to understand the impact of search?},

Although you might think that "literacy" is one of the great constants that transcends the ages, the skills of a literate person have changed substantially over time as texts and technology allow for new kinds of reading and understanding. Knowing how to read is just the beginning of it--knowing how to frame a question, pose a query, how to interpret the texts that you find, understand the information in context, how to organize and use the information you discover, how to understand your metacognition--these are all critical parts of being literate as well. In this talk I'll review what literacy is today, in the age of Google, and show how some very surprising and unexpected skills will turn out to be critical in the years ahead.},

abstract = {Borrowing novels is a major activity in public libraries. However, the interest in developing tools for fiction searching and analyzing the use of these tools is minor. It is studied how tools provided by an enriched public library catalogue are used to access novels to read. 58 users searched for interesting novels to read in a simulated situation where they had only a vague idea of what they would like to read. Data consist of search logs, pre and post search questionnaires and observations. For analyzing associations between novel reading activity, search variables and search success Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated. Based on this information, path models were built for predicting search success, i.e. the interest ratings of the novels found. Investing effort on examining results improves search success, i.e. finding interesting novels, whereas effort in querying has no bearing on it. Novel reading activity was not associated with search process and effort and success variables observed. The results suggest, that in designing systems for fiction retrieval, enriching result presentation with more detailed book information would benefit users in identifying good novels.},

abstract = {A user study of aNobii was conducted to compare its three book-finding tools: author search, browsing friends' bookshelves and browsing similar bookshelves. The construct of "social navigation" was identified as a useful theoretical framework to discuss various modes of information access on social media.A within-subject experimental design was adopted where all forty regular aNobii users searched alternately with the three book-finding tools. Several novel evaluation measures were designed to explore the potential benefits these tools might bring to the users. Other than the self-report user experience and search result measures, the "consideration set" model was used as a novel framework for navigational effectiveness.Some major findings are as follows. While the author search function was shown to be the most efficient, browsing friends' bookshelves was shown to generate more interesting and informative browsing experience. Three evaluative dimensions were derived from our study: search experience, search efficiency, and search result quality. The disagreement of these measures shows a need for a multi-faceted evaluative framework for these exploration-based navigational tools.},

abstract = {A key aspect of searching is the ability of users to absorb information from documents read in order to resolve their task. One group of users who have problems with reading are dyslexic users, who due to underlying cognitive impairments in phonological processing and working memory, tend to read more slowly and make reading errors. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the dyslexia cognitive profile on information searching. Searches were logged for 8 dyslexic and 8 non-dyslexic university students, in order to examine the differences in searching behavior between the two groups. A set of literacy and phonological working memory tasks were also completed, in order to investigate the relationship between these cognitive variables and searching behavior. Results show that there is a significant difference between the two groups on the number of documents being judged irrelevant, and that this cannot be explained by a topic effect. Instead, the number of documents judged irrelevant is significantly correlated with a measure of working memory. This key result provides the research community the first real insight into impact of impaired working memory on information searching.},

We first measured the ability of users to answer their questions using an interactive document retrieval system, and then compared the users' performance with the document retrieval system to question answering systems. We found that while users can successfully answer their questions using a document retrieval system, question answering systems have the potential to significantly increase the rate at which users find answers.},

This paper reports a comparative study of user elicitation behaviors by Chinese and English speakers in professional settings of mediated search, with particular reference to sociocultural aspects of human communication. More specifically, this study investigates user elicitation behavior from real-life interactional cases, with the goal of exploring whether there are differences between Chinese and English speaking users in their elicitation behavior. To reveal the sociocultural influences in user-intermediary interactions, corpus data is analyzed in terms of the identification and counting of the purposes and communicative functions. Our findings revealed significant differences in the use of elicitation purposes and communicative functions by Chinese and English users. Chinese users were more concerned about the technical aspects of searching activities, with little reference to the cognitive aspects of their information problems. Importantly, the differences in communicative functions (i.e., the intended meaning) suggested potential sociocultural influences on micro-level information seeking. The findings are discussed in view of IR system design supporting query formulation, user modeling in interactive IR and conceptual modeling in information behavior research.},

In contrast to the system-centric perspective often found in multimedia retrieval, we follow a more user-centered approach considering the search as an interactive process. To assist in this process, the discussed system supports directed and exploratory search as well as faceted navigation and a transition between these information seeking strategies.In order to integrate these strategies, a consistent retrieval and interaction model based on the principle of polyrepresentation is developed. To complete the functionality, a preference-based mechanism for graded relevance feedback is presented that overcomes limitations of binary as well as total order-based approaches. To improve the learnability of the system and to give users back the feeling of control over the search process, various visualizations are offered that open paths of communication between the system and the user in order to bridge the gap between the system's notion of the information need and the one of the actual user.},

abstract = {In the quest to develop better and more useful search systems, many novel search user interface features have been developed, such as relevance feedback, clusters, tag clouds, facets, and so on. Yet all of these novel 'interactions' have required novel forms of 'information', or metadata, to make them work. Consequently, we do not know whether users have been benefiting from better interaction or simply richer forms of metadata, or both. In this research, we aimed to show that better interaction can be provided, regardless of whether we have access to, or the ability to generate, richer forms of metadata. Using only search engine query suggestions as a consistent form of metadata, we built interface conditions for three common interaction models for search: query suggestions (our baseline), hierarchical browsing, and faceted filtering. Our results showed that, despite interacting with the same underlying metadata, users experienced significant performance gains with different forms of interaction. These findings have implications for search user interface designers, who are often working with fixed metadata or within limited budgets. Our future work will focus on complementing these findings by recreating the same interaction with different forms of metadata, such that we can then compare the performance gain separately provided by both information and interaction.},

We present an application that allows users to search and browse the events on offer in a number of different ways including via personalised event recommendations.

The results of this log analysis in combination with 2 surveys show some surprising usage patterns and point to how such applications can better serve users' needs.},

Specifically, the approach extracts and selects representative chunks (noun phrases or named entities) from the content (a text passage) using a rich set of features. We carry out experiments showing that the selected chunks can be effectively used to generate queries both in a TREC environment, where weights and query structure can be directly incorporated, and with a "black-box" web search engine, where query structure is more limited.},

The aim of this study was to get more insight into whether Web users manage to assess difficulty, time effort, query effort, and task outcome of search tasks, and if their judging performance relates to task complexity. Our study was conducted with a systematically selected sample of 56 people with a wide demographic background. They carried out a set of 12 search tasks with commercial Web search engines in a laboratory environment. The results confirm that it is hard for normal Web users to judge the difficulty and effort to carry out complex search tasks. The judgments are more reliable for simple tasks than for complex ones. Task complexity is an indicator for judging performance.},

abstract = {In this paper two methods are used, analysis of web access logs together with a web survey, to connect sessions with task context and intention. The dual methods approach connects information seeking behavior with actual IR-interactions to get a more holistic view of the information seeking and retrieval (IS&amp;R) process. The studied collection is a cultural heritage web site containing digitalized material and artist information. Based on different navigation strategies task context and intention was related to session length and arrival level in the site. Some statistically significant relationships were found between the factors. Users in a work context more often access the site by direct navigation for looking up facts. Users in a hobby or leisure context more often access the site by links or topical searches in search engines and they arrive further down in the site structure and their sessions are shorter. How and to what extent survey data and log data can be combined is discussed.},

abstract = {This paper reports on our task-based observational, logged, questionnaire study and analysis of ocular behavior pertaining to the interaction of structural features of text in Wikipedia using eye tracking. We set natural and realistic tasks searching Wikipedia online focusing on examining which features and strategies (skimming or scanning) were the most important for the participants to complete their tasks. Our research, carried out on a group of 30 participants, highlighted their interactions with the structural areas within Wikipedia articles, the visual cues and features perceived during the searching of the Wiki text. We collected questionnaire and ocular behavior (fixation metrics) data to highlight the ways in which people view the features in the articles. We found that our participants' extensively interacted with layout features, such as tables, titles, bullet lists, contents lists, information boxes, and references. The eye tracking results showed that participants used the format and layout features and they also highlighted them as important. They were able to navigate to useful information consistently, and they were an effective means of locating relevant information for the completion of their tasks with some success. This work presents results which contribute to the long-term goals of studying the features for genre and theoretical perception research.},

abstract = {Image indexing and retrieval systems mostly rely on the computation of similarity measures between images. This notion is ill-defined, generally based on simplistic assumptions that do not fit the actual context of use of image retrieval systems. This paper addresses two fundamental issues related to image similarity: checking whether the degree of similarity between two images is perceived consistently by different users and establishing the elements of the images on which users base their similarity judgment. A study is set up, in which human subjects have been asked to assess the degree of the pairwise similarity of images and describe the features on which they base their judgments. The quantitative analysis of the similarity scores reported by the subjects shows that users reach a certain consensus on similarity assessment. From the qualitative analysis of the transcripts of the records of the experiments, a list of the features used by the subjects to assess image similarity is built. From this, a new model of image description emerges. As compared to existing models, it is more realistic, free of preconceptions and more suited to the task of similarity computation. These results are discussed from the perspectives of psychology and computer science.},

abstract = {According to the principle of polyrepresentation, retrieval accuracy may improve through the combination of multiple and diverse information object representations about e.g. the context of the user, the information sought, or the retrieval system [9, 10]. Recently, the principle of polyrepresentation was mathematically expressed using subjective logic [12], where the potential suitability of each representation for improving retrieval performance was formalised through degrees of belief and uncertainty [15]. No experimental evidence or practical application has so far validated this model.We extend the work of Lioma et al. (2010) [15], by providing a practical application and analysis of the model. We show how to map the abstract notions of belief and uncertainty to real-life evidence drawn from a retrieval dataset. We also show how to estimate two different types of polyrepresentation assuming either (a) independence or (b) dependence between the information objects that are combined. We focus on the polyrepresentation of different types of context relating to user information needs (i.e. work task, user background knowledge, ideal answer) and show that the subjective logic model can predict their optimal combination prior and independently to the retrieval process.},

Time spent is commonly interpreted as an implicit measure of interest, but might indeed describe other circumstances of the information retrieval (IR) interaction. This phenomenon of time spent is interesting from an IR evaluation point of view with reference to how time spent is to be interpreted. A comparison of time spent between a semi-lab interactive IR (IIR) study using simulated work task situations and a naturalistic IIR study is presented. The findings of this comparison are further related to a study on information searching and seeking in the real work environment that provides a resonance board for the reported IIR studies. The main conclusion is that time spent searching depends not only on interest, but also on circumstances such as prior knowledge and external requirements.},

abstract = {Measuring is a key to scientific progress. This is particularly true for research concerning complex systems, whether natural or human-built. Multilingual and multimedia information access systems, such as search engines, are increasingly complex: they need to satisfy diverse user needs and support challenging tasks. Their development calls for proper evaluation methodologies to ensure that they meet the expected user requirements and provide the desired effectiveness. In this context, failure analysis is crucial to understand the behaviour of complex systems. Unfortunately, this is an especially challenging activity, requiring vast amounts of human effort to inspect query-by-query the output of a system in order to understand what went well or bad. It is therefore fundamental to provide automated tools to examine system behaviour, both visually and analytically. Moreover, once you understand the reason behind a failure, you still need to conduct a "what-if" analysis to understand what among the different possible solutions is most promising and effective before actually starting to modify your system. This paper provides an analytical model for examining performances of IR systems, based on the discounted cumulative gain family of metrics, and visualization for interacting and exploring the performances of the system under examination. Moreover, we propose machine learning approach to learn the ranking model of the examined system in order to be able to conduct a "what-if" analysis and visually explore what can happen if you adopt a given solution before having to actually implement it.},

abstract = {In task-based information searching, the task at hand is a central factor affecting information search. Task complexity, in particular, has been discovered to affect searching. In the present study, we shadowed the tasks of seven people working in city administration. The data consist of shadowing field notes, voice recordings, photographs and forms. We study, how task complexity affects information searching and information resource use. Task complexity was defined through the task performer's own experience (perceived task complexity) and her estimates of her a priori knowledge concerning the task. We analyzed the data both qualitatively and quantitatively, focusing on the links between task complexity and the use of information resources, information searching and problems encountered. We found that task complexity has a central but ambiguous relationship to task performance. The clearest differences were found between simple and complex tasks. In addition, perceived task complexity seems to affect the ways of performing the task more than a priori knowledge. The more complex a task is perceived, the more searches are performed and the more they concentrate on networked resources instead of information systems provided by the organization (SPOs). The use of resources on the task performer's PC and the SPOs decreases when complexity increases. In proportion, the use of networked resources and communication resources increases. The total number of information resources used is somewhat greater in complex and semi-complex tasks than in simple tasks; and each resource is used for a longer time on average. Our study shows that task context and especially task complexity seems to affect information searching and the selection of sources.},

A total of 223 biologists completed a web-based questionnaire in which they assessed 39 individual characteristics of bioinformatics tools, independently rating the importance of each one in their selection of bioinformatics tools. The most highly rated characteristic was whether a tool actually accomplished what a participant needed it to do. Other highly rated characteristics included the ease of use of a tool, online availability, little or no cost, the ability to handle large data sets, and compatibility with other tools. Rated as non-important were characteristics relating to an imposed choice, such as a tool already having been purchased. Differences in ratings were found between those whose work was primarily focused on laboratory biology, and those whose work was primarily computer focused. The findings provide a set of characteristics by which bioinformatics tools can be annotated to facilitate the selection of tools. The findings also highlight the need to consider the requirements of different user groups in the design and development of information systems, rather than assuming that one size fits all.},

Twenty-seven participants, in five separate groups ranging in age from 13 to early 30's, sketched visual metaphors representing strategies and interventions that the participants thought would remind them to remember before information was lost, in order to better relocate information. Nine themes emerged: embeddedness, fear and anxiety, interruptions, messiness and discomfort, locked doors and barriers, proximity and adjacency, signs and tattoos, scripts, and finally, the voice. This study started from the premise that design should begin with the user's metaphor as a way to describe the user's mind and ways of thinking and end with the designer mapping the metaphor to the artifact. The long term goal of this work is to move from ideation to implementation, using the users' metaphors of the mind as a basis for the design of information environments that scaffold metacognition during the search process.},

In this paper, we present preliminary results of a study designed to evaluate a set of search tasks that were developed for use in IIR studies. We created 20 search tasks using five levels of cognitive complexity and four domains, and conducted a laboratory evaluation of these tasks with 48 undergraduate subjects. We describe preliminary results from an analysis of data from 24 subjects for 10 search tasks. Initial results show that, in general, as cognitive complexity increased, subjects issued more queries, clicked on more search results, viewed more URLs and took more time to complete the task. Subjects' expected and experienced difficulty ratings of tasks generally increased as cognitive complexity increased with some exceptions. When subjects were asked to rank tasks according to difficulty and engagement, tasks with higher cognitive complexity were rated as more difficult than tasks with lower cognitive complexity, but not necessarily as more engaging. These preliminary results suggest that behaviors and ratings are fairly consistent with the differences one might expect among the search tasks and provide initial evidence of the usefulness of these tasks in IIR studies.},

abstract = {Evaluating the children's information seeking behaviors and information retrieval abilities poses a number of difficult challenges for researchers to overcome. One of the main problems is engaging children to undertake search tasks so that their abilities at retrieving relevant information can be assessed. In this poster paper, we outline PageFetch, which is an Information Retrieval based game designed to engage information seekers of all ages, but particular, children, to play and thus provide valuable data to assess and compare their search abilities to other age groups. We also report the results from an initial pilot study using PageFetch where over 140 participants played approximately 1500 games.While, previous research has shown that children do not perform as well as adults, our finding suggest that given modern search engines, children (or more specifically teenagers) are more than capable of finding specified pages - and in fact for topics that they are more likely to be interested in, they often out perform adults. Since, these findings are very preliminary, they do raise a number of questions about the quality of modern search engines and the search efficacy of younger searchers. This work motivates the undertaking of secondary and larger study that examines on a year by year basis how search skills develop and improve from childhood to adulthood.},

Moreover, the interplay between the different components and additional factors can lead to degraded system performance when adding or manipulating particular components. We explore the interactions and effects of different components and some of the factors with respect to performance. The main contribution of this paper is a better understanding of how to configure filtering systems along with the possible pitfalls of applying conflicting components which harm performance and result in a poor user experience.},

abstract = {Known-item finding is the task of re-finding and re-accessing an item previously seen. Typical examples of known items include accessed Web sites, received emails, or documents on one's personal desktop. Current research on known-item finding heavily relies on corpora of known-item queries and the respective known items. However, many existing corpora are proprietary and not available to the public (in particular those derived from Web query logs), a fact which does not allow for repeatable research. The existing publicly available corpora either contain automatically generated queries or queries that were manually generated while seeing the known item itself. Hence, we consider these public corpora to be rather artificial in nature.In this paper, we propose a methodology to create a known-item topic set that is much more realistic and that is built on top of a large-scale public test corpus. From know-item questions posted on the popular Yahoo! Answers platform we extract queries for known-items in a crowdsourcing setup. Since we ensure that all the known-items correspond to Web pages in the publicly available ClueWeb09 corpus (a large static Web crawl), we provide an environment for repeatable realistic Web-scale known-item searches.},

abstract = {Conducting Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) research is often seen as an arduous and tedious process with a high barrier to entry. This high barrier is due to the overheads in developing and setting up even a simple lab-based IIR experiment. SCAMP (Search ConfigurAtor for experiMenting with PuppyIR) is a web-based tool that we have developed which enables researchers to configure standard IIR experiments. SCAMP provides the infrastructure that handles the major processes within the experimental flow (such as Participant Registration, Consent, Surveys, and the logging and tracking of tasks and participants through the experiment). Consequently, SCAMP reduces the time required to create an experiment and is ideal for undergraduate and masters students who would like to conduct an IIR experiment without extensive development. Furthermore, the tool is extensible. Other features can be easily added to SCAMP to customise the experiments. To evaluate SCAMP, we performed a within-subjects experiment where 48 participants used a web search engine with different search aids (query suggestion, spell correction, etc) to complete various web search tasks - to increase the difficulty of the search tasks certain query terms were banned. We use this evaluation to showcase the different features of the SCAMP system and report on how participants perform under difficult querying conditions.},

abstract = {This paper introduces SlideDeckFinder, a tool integrated into a user's email client enabling the search for similarities between slide decks. The similarity calculations are based on visual correspondence (both from text and images/graphics) as well as slide (re-)composition patterns. The individual slides of different slide decks are first compared by matching their respective visual features extracted from any content such as text and images. The resulting similarity scores between pairs of slides are then the input for calculating the similarity between whole slide decks. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to represent the transformation (in terms of re-arrangements or insertions of new slides) from one slide deck to another, where the state emissions probabilities of the HMM correspond to slide similarity and the transition probabilities represent the likely slide sequence within slide decks. The Viterbi algorithm is finally used to calculate the most likely state sequence (i.e. recomposition pattern) between the slide decks and thus the similarity score. SlideDeckFinder has been evaluated both on its accuracy to compare visual appearance of slides with respect to human perception and its performance to retrieve related slide deck variants.},

This study explores how important familiarity is in predicting an interest response. In a study with 30 subjects, interest was manipulated by topical familiarity using novel stimuli from a popular news source. This study shows, within this context, familiarity is moderately important for an interest response: familiarity does indeed make the news interesting, but only to a certain extent. The results set a baseline for predicting interest during information encountering, indicating familiarity is important, but not the only influential variable a system should consider when selecting information for users.},

Preliminary results show that searching in a foreign language requires significantly longer time, more query reformulations, and more websites viewed.

abstract = {Complex tasks like answering research questions or solving problems require to carry out longitudinal processes where different information objects need to be gathered, collected, interpreted, analyzed, and evaluated [1]. Such a process normally includes several search and exploration sessions where the user interactively digs deeper into a more or less unknown domain.This research is driven by the fact that most common systems are designed to fit a general user where users are submitting queries and the retrieval system returns a ranked list of results. Regardless of the user, the query always returns the same list of results. Individual aspects like age, gender, profession or experience are often not taken into account, for example the difference in searching between children and adults. Unfortunately many systems are optimized for lookup searches, expecting that the user is only interested in facts and not in problem solving. Additionally common systems still assume that the user has a static information need which remains unchanged during the seeking process. In each step of the overall seeking process, the user faces a new situation in which knowledge and information need changes. This influences the relevance of information objects and may direct each user individually to different topics, domains, tasks or even search strategies.Due to uncertainty and missing knowledge, exploratory search activities need far more assistance like closing the the gap between different search sessions, allowing the user to review and continue their search more easily. Moreover the complexity of working tasks and the individual qualifications require personalized support to the searcher. The goal of this research is to investigate a concept assisting the user within such interactive exploratory search activities, allowing an effective information exploration by personalizing the seeking &amp; searching process. Personalized IR systems need to adapt to relevant factors and commit itself to the specific user and the personal search behavior. The user should be guided throughout the searching process, suggesting useful search strategies and effective tactics which matches the users searching behavior and the current situation. To bridge different search sessions, past activities must be visualized in a kind of breadcrumb or timeline. That's why we are currently prototyping a way to visualize the personal Google search history using Timeline JS.To further assist the user with strategic search support, it is necessary to be aware of the user herself and specific contextual circumstances which may be relevant to the situation. General information about the user like gender or age but also relevance feedback can be fetched explicitly, allowing the system to adapt in a more coarse grained way (e.g. deciding the way of presenting results). Moreover integrating common used applications (e.g. Evernote) or providing other ways to let the user manage tasks will help to understand the goal of the search activities. For this reason we are currently investigating ways to link search activities with task management.Information about the search behavior and indirectly the users knowledge and expertise can be conveyed by logging (e.g. query logs) and examining system interactions. The fetched data should be made transparent to the user, showing what kind of information has been gathered so far. The implicitly gained information has to be refined with the explicit ones and also other contextual data collected tacitly from different interfaces or sensors (e.g. time, location). Bringing it all together will allow a more fine grained way of system adaption and offers new options in assisting the user during the long-term search activities showing personalized search strategies and possible next search steps appropriate to the information need and level of experience.},

abstract = {Recreational reading is an important part of people's everyday life in many countries. Borrowing books and leisure reading are the most popular activities among library users, and most of the books borrowed in the public libraries are fiction. Although it is known that leisure reading concentrates mostly on fiction, and fiction readers make up a large portion of the public library clientele, we have little information on how readers are currently using library catalogues for fiction searching. Current knowledge on users' search behavior with digital systems has mainly focused on retrieving for non-fiction. Also in system development the focus has been on retrieving for non-fiction. In spite of the development of library catalogues and digital content description methods for fiction collections, research on the usability of new content description tools as a part of fiction retrieval in online catalogues is lacking. There is a gap in our understanding of how people currently search for recreational reading material in online catalogues and how these enriched catalogues support this activity in different reader groups.},

abstract = {Tourism information is dynamic and travel routes and decisions are dependent on highly varying factors such as perceived attractive sites, weather conditions, prices, transportation, accommodation, holidays, economic changes and so on. Travel guidebooks and present search engines completely lack this potential for dialog. Travel information search activities involved planning, decision making, anticipation of the trip with other people. The community (network of people) may act as a gateway to the information repository, when a tourist is not able to find the right information himself/herself or does not know about his/her information need. This leads to the collaboration for searching tourism information. Considering the following issues we are motivated to study this topic.},

abstract = {Knowledge workers need support in their daily activities to handle the information stream they encounter continuously (e.g. e-mail, search results etc.). One method for this is to place the information in context, i.e. to what activity is the information related? For this purpose, contexts need to be recognized. Additionally, this should happen in an unobtrusive way such that the worker is not disrupted and can remain focused at his work-related activities.},

abstract = {Online searching plays a central role in daily life. During online searching, people first decide which queries to submit to an information retrieval system, after that they decide which links to click on, and based on the quality of search result content, they further determine whether to stop viewing the current returned result set or to refine the query. At some point a person decides to terminate searching. For tasks that require a single answer such as a navigation task, it is relatively clear when a person decides to stop searching -- he or she has either found, or not found, an answer to his or her question. However, for tasks that have no obvious end-point, it is unclear when and why people decide to stop searching and more importantly, it is unclear how to model such behavior. The research question of deciding when information is enough to complete one's task is mostly investigated under the term "search stopping behavior" [3], even though no formal definition has been given in the literature.},
