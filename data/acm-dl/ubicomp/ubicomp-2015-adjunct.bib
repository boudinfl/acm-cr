abstract = {Charity badges and empathy (awareness) ribbons are common tokens of support for charities and other worthy causes. In this paper we revisit the concept of smart badges with the aim of developing digital equivalents of the charity badge/empathy ribbon. We describe the design of prototype low--cost digital empathy badges based around infra-red transceiver technology, that light up and play a ringtone in the presence of other badges and we present the findings of a small pilot study involving a dozen badge wearers.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose HuMorse, a universal home automation system for the elderly and people with disabilities of vision, speech or paralyzed limbs. Analog input using facial processing or tilt gestures is captured via smart-phone and is mapped to Morse code - dots and dashes. This Morse code sequence can be interpreted as words in a group to form an instruction from a basic instruction set. Using such a translation scheme - we define an architecture that can be used to communicate short messages and actuate simple commands on home automation systems such as heating, cooling, and the operation of smart doors and windows. In our prototype, we are able to achieve 90-95 % instruction translation accuracy and actuation time in the order of 9-13 seconds depending on the length and complexity of the instruction.},

In this work, we aim at accelerating camera calibration in an indoor setting, by selecting a small but sufficient set of keypoints. Our framework consists of two phases: In the offline phase, we cluster photos labeled with Wi-Fi and gyro sensor data according to a learned distance metric. Photos in each cluster form a "co-scene". We further select a few frequently appearing keypoints in each co-scene as "useful keypoints" (UKPs). In the online phase, when a query is issued, only UKPs from the nearest co-scene are selected, and subsequently we infer extrinsic camera parameters with multiple view geometry (MVG) technique. Experimental results show that our framework is effective and efficient to support calibration.},

abstract = {Though expressway administrators present drivers with traffic congestion information, the drivers cannot obtain sufficient practical information to avoid traffic congestion, determine how much congestion they will encounter or know when they will arrive at their destination. Therefore, we propose an interactive interface allowing the drivers to make a driving plan on an expressway with traffic predictions, and thus change their driving behavior. By visualizing traffic predictions using a diagram with two time axes, drivers can look at multiple futures interactively. Thus, they can obtain enough information to avoid traffic congestion. We compared our interface with conventional traffic congestion presentations, and also investigated its feasibility in a real environment by distributing our interface as an Android application. Our results showed that drivers were able to make a driving plan more efficiently using our interface than with conventional methods, and then follow their planned route on an expressway in a real environment.},

However, due to limited time, we always have missed some nice or popular scenes. This paper proposes a photo-taking application which reminds users with attractive scenes based on the location, photos recently taken, and photos contributed on the Internet. With an analysis of the photos on cloud-based album or social media, we combine the current context of user to recommend other nearby scenes that the user had missed to include in his/her collection. To evaluate our concept, we had tried to implement a prototype system with the use of geographical tags and scene recognition techniques to find out the similarities between photos. This helps us to filter candidate images for suggestion and rank them according to their physical closeness and the estimated popularity.},

In the ubicomp environment, mobile devices have enabled us to capture video and various types of sensor data easily. However, currently we do not have a framework to instantly integrate video and those sensor data on smartphones and share them easily with other users on the net. In this paper, we present Senbay, a platform to integrate video and sensor data stream into single video on smartphones. With Senbay, sensor data stream will be embedded into a video as animated QR code in real-time, thus users can share the "sensor-federated" video easily on the web, through lots of popular video sharing services. This paper introduces the architecture and evaluation of Senbay and discusses future vision of the sensor-federated video sharing platform along with several applications.},

First, we demonstrate the use of the headset in the accurate detection of blink tics as compared to more expensive and cumbersome technology. Comparing against invasive facial monitoring techniques using Smartphones, EEG driven detection is able to achieve 80% accuracy in correctly detected events, with a detection delay of less than 1 second. Next, we use these headsets to draw a positive correlation between excessive blinking and deterioration in attention and performance to support past research, and demonstrate that time taken for the same work can increase up to 300% depending on the type of work, due to excessive blinking. Finally, we make a case for applications involving the use of EEG headsets to monitor and aid students and workers with blink tics to ensure equitable time conditions.},

However, considered the highly dynamic indoor environment, Wi-Fi indoor localization system cannot maintain the high performance for longtime. To address this challenge, we propose a novel online deep learning approach OSDELM, which guarantees the running time of localization system from two aspects: discriminative feature, and updated model. Specifically, deep learning helps extract discriminative Wi-Fi features, and online learning updates the out-of-date model to fit the new environment. The experiments in real indoor environment show that the proposed OSDELM method can cope with the highly dynamic indoor environment issue and make the localization system work well in online manner.},

abstract = {With the increasing presence and role that computers play in our daily lives, the quantity of visual information received from digital devices is expanding. The mobility and portability requirements of our modern lifestyles further overload our visual cognition with distractions from the real world. Consequently, our cognition is constantly occupied with processing insignificant visual information. The excessive presence of visual information made concentrating on essentials more challenging than ever. To increase cognitive performance on user-relevant tasks, we propose an approach to filter unrelated visual information. Our approach utilizes Image Processing to blur all insignificant regions of the user's field of view, leaving only relevant user-defined visual regions. To verify our approach, we have developed a head mounted display based prototype and carried out a short user study followed by a questionnaire and an interview. The user-study's results indicated a number of insights, most importantly our approach's preliminary success in increasing users' concentration with presence of other distractions. Finally, we provided our future direction to further expand our research.},

We found that achieving immersion is a key factor to make our approach successful. The transformation from the real components to fictional components changes the meaning of the real space to more emotionally engage a player beyond the real space.This idea offers a lot of new promising opportunities like enhancing gamification by incorporating fictionality through Ubicomp technologies.},

In the current state of the art, there is no technology that can record climbing routes and statistics about a climber's exercises. Taking photographs of routes is the state of art method of sharing descriptions of climbing routes with other climbing enthusiasts. We propose to automatically track climbing routes using wearable devices placed on the hands and feet of a climber. Each wearable device has an IMU sensor and a barometer on it. In addition, the devices on the hands have EMG sensors on them. The combination of these sensors can detect when a person makes contact with a hold, and the relative position of the hold contacted with respect to the current hold, and the type of hold. A map of the route, including annotations of the hand hold and foot holds used by the climber, can be inferred by performing dead reckoning based navigation for each of the devices.},

However, they all assume a static budget for a task, the dynamics of tasks in terms of sensing contexts as well as user knowledge to the target area is not considered. This may result in uncompleted or overpaid tasks. In addition, existing studies mainly motivate user participation, whereas the quality of data is paid little attention. To address these issues, we propose a novel MCS incentive mechanism called TaskMe. An LBSN-powered reference model for dynamic budgeting is proposed, and a combination of reputation and multi-payment-enhanced reverse auction scheme is used to improve data quality.

Here, we observe that users perform several actions in their mobile phone: take photos, perform check-in, and access Wi-Fi networks. These behaviors generate spatial-temporal data that could be utilized to capture user activities. Hence, three features are extracted for activities inference: 1) geographical feature: indicating where user performs activities; 2) temporal feature: indicating when user performs activities; and 3) semantic feature: showing semantic concept of a place from location-based social networks. Here, we propose Spatial-Temporal Activity Inference Model (STAIM) to infer users' activities from aforementioned features. Experimental results show that STAIM is able to effectively infer users' activities, achieving 75% accuracy on average.},

As an HTML5-based visual programming platform, it provides children and beginners with an integrated environment in which they not only learn programming in an easy and fun way but also create, post and share their own programs. This will enhance children's computational thinking and is expected to serve as an effective learning tool for the STEAM education. We have held a workshop with 16 elementary school teachers and conducted a preliminary survey to illuminate Entry's 1) potential educational implications on logical thinking, problem solving and creativity, and 2) applicability in the field of education. This paper is expected to contribute to future research on programming education and STEAM education programs for children.},

In this paper, we propose a new distance-dependent strategy that does not require ascertainment of global or local network structure, namely, simply monitoring the relative significance difference of randomly selected individuals in school and workplace. To evaluate whether such two group could indeed provide early detection, we studied a flu outbreak in contact network simulation experiments. Our experimental results show that this method could provide significant additional time to react to epidemics, especially when the infection rate is not large.},

If a smartphone can estimate its own state, developers can create various consumer support applications, such as an application for preventing mis-operations while the smartphone is stored in the pocket. Six test participants operated some action tasks to measure sensor values for our experiments. The experimental results show that our method can classify six situations with an 87.0% accuracy. The results also show two findings: (1) Using various sensors improves the estimation accuracy and (2) our method can classify smartphone states independently of the user's action while the user is moving.},

Therefore, region functions should be a critical factor to affect people's travel behaviors and it is possible to infer traffic patterns to be generated from newly planned region functions based on the associations between the data of two modalities so as to minimize traffic congestions at the urban planning stage.},

CARE is also able to calculate the chewing frequency through recognizing the periodic pattern of acceleration data. Experiments are conducted and the results show that CARE obtains high accuracy on both chewing activity classification and chewing frequency detection.},

To propose effective ways of providing a more positive IoT user experience, this study examined the effects of identity extension (user identity being extended onto an IoT device vs. not being extended) and the type of framing (hedonic vs. utilitarian) of messages delivered via the device. Preliminary data from a between-subjects experiment (N = 22) revealed that identity extension induced greater attachment and satisfaction with regard to the device and resulted in the experience of greater feelings of social presence. In addition, the results indicated that the effect of identity extension on satisfaction and social presence was mediated by user attachment to the device. The implications of the key findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Our work investigates new designs for notification cues, leveraging knowledge about insects that people gained through lifelong experiences. We conducted a user study to identify people's knowledge about nine typical and easily differentiated insect-species. We conclude that this information can be used in creating notifications that can be perceived intuitively. We discuss how results of this study can inform design decisions in all four design dimensions of notification systems, and consider the future potential of notifications based on such biomimicry patterns.},

abstract = {Trunk endurance tests are widely used in physical medicine to assess the muscle status of people affected by low back pain. Nevertheless, traditional evaluation procedures suffer from practical limitations, which can lead to potential misdiagnoses. This work presents mDurance, a novel mobile health system aimed at supporting specialists in the functional assessment of trunk endurance by using wearable and mobile devices. The system makes use of a wearable inertial sensor to track the patient trunk posture, while portable electromyography sensors are employed to seamlessly measure the electrical activity produced by the trunk muscles. The information registered by the sensors is processed and managed by a mobile application that facilitates the expert normal routine, while reducing the impact of human errors and expediting the analysis of the test results. The reliability and usability of mDurance is proved through a case study, thus demonstrating its potential interest for regular physical therapy routines.},

In addition, we collected the location information of the nurses by using infrared information and communication equipment at the same time. In fact, we were able to extract a total of 1,805,760 pieces of activity rhythm of nurses, 462,418 pieces of location information data, 459,139 pieces of meeting information data, and 12,406 pieces of nurse duties information. In the future, we will visualize the nurse's activities, and analyse the factors that affect the activity rhythm, the nurse duties, and the location information.},

The system combines existing green maps, participatory apps, and smartphone-based image capture tools to visualize "green networks" and support the awareness of connected green sites in the neighborhood, thereby potentially accelerating citizencentered "green networking" in the neighborhood.},

In this paper, we present a shop type recommendation system, which can be used for multiple parties to make investment decisions. We adopt two types of features, location features and commercial features to model a shop, which are derived from the heterogeneous data, i.e., social media and location-based services (LBS). A novel bias learning matrix factorization method with feature fusion is proposed for recommending an appropriate shop type for a given location. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art solutions.},

After several iterations of prototyping, we created a functional prototype called BabyBumper that has the potential to reduce stress and improve the overall quality of life for mothers and their unborn children during pregnancy. This paper describes the project?s purpose, visual and interaction concept, system overview, and future work.},

Using a support vector machine classiffer and a leave-one-person-out evaluation scheme we can discriminate between two to four classes of standard curiosity scales well above chance. These results are promising and point towards a new class of context-aware systems that take the user's curiosity into account, thereby enabling new types of interaction and user adaptation.},

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is suitable for the IoT and supports multicast communication with things. However, multicast may lead to a traffic overload when the corresponding multiple responses travel through a CoAP-proxy concurrently. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to constructing a CoAP-proxy, which supports the efficient multicasting and grouping things based on the semantic description of a request. In addition, the proposed proxy merges multiple responses into an aggregated one, which is returned to a client. To demonstrate the feasibility, we implemented a prototype of the proposed CoAP-proxy and evaluated the performance of our approach in terms of the response time and network traffic.},

However, most elders with canes have never been instructed on the proper use and often have inappropriate devices. This work presents CaneFitter, a cane fitting system that consists of two major components: 1) recommendation module, which generates adaptive recommendations on better fitting canes based on the efficient gait analysis technique; 2) teaching module, where the image of an elderly user segmented from the live video is merged with the training video, allowing the user to learn the cane use in an immersive augmented virtual environment. Also, the user is adaptively instructed to correct their postures by using automatic posture matching techniques. We deploy CaneFitter in an elderly community and collect constructive feedback for further system improvement.},

As one such approach, we considered how to design exertion games (exergames) for group fitness. In this poster, we examined group fitness swimming as a case study, and designed SwimTrain, an exergame for this group activity. Our game focuses on helping multiple swimmers set and maintaining an appropriate exercise intensity through both competition and collaboration. We also explored several implementation issues, such as device settings, input methods, and game feedback.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose the e-Learning web system in which any users can not only answer questions, but also make questions. We also show an algorithm to assess the answer logs in consideration of difficulty and validity of questions. Today, education systems such as e-Learning are adopted in many universities, but only teachers or a limited number of people can make questions in many scenes so that they bear a great burden of making questions. Therefore it is possible to reduce the burden on teacher if any users can make questions. We formulated algorithm to reflect difficulty and validity of the questions to evaluation and made Web system to make questions and answer them. We carried out an experiment in a class of the university whether it would be possible to make a correct evaluation on real human-made questions using the system by algorithm of suggestion technique. As a result, assessment results in consideration of difficulty and validity were calculated for the human-made questions.},

abstract = {Mobile sensing applications have been increasingly popular. Even after many years of research, their power consumption and processing latency are still critical concerns. The problem gets aggravated especially when applications adopt complicated machine learning algorithms (e.g., GMM, HMM, Neural network) over high-rate sensor streams like sound and video. In this paper, we aim at addressing the problem using mobile GPUs, which is recently integrated into state-of-the-art smartphones. We first studied if GPUs are more power-efficient and faster compared to CPUs under four different workloads (median filter, matrix multiplication, fast Fourier transform and Viterbi algorithm). Based on our measurements, we developed a simple task dispatcher that intelligently offloads various tasks from CPU to GPU, and showed the effectiveness of the dispatcher.},

It separates the concern of developing textiles, electronics, infrastructure, and applications. Furthermore, it uses a similar application model as current smart-phones allowing developers to create applications for the smart textiles.

Then we introduced direction information from a compass sensor to increase the detection robustness in the canyon of buildings. The second experimentation result showed the proposed method considering direction information kept almost the same accuracy of indoor-outdoor detectionin a 'canyon' situation, whereas the baseline classifier worsened accuracy by 10%.},

Most relevant for these experts are time, date and user activity, followed by location, notifications and accelerometer. A feasibility test proved that all relevant sources are accessible on Android phones. We also assessed the desired granularity of the data gathered from each sensor source. Our results are a first step towards an ESM platform to create context-aware Android apps for ambulatory assessment.},

The interoperability between things is achieved by the help of Internet and Web of Things. Despite this progress, a main challenge remains to fully manage the heterogeneity of the smart things: handling their dynamicity at runtime. In this paper, we present a three layers platform to address this challenge. The first layer monitors the appearance and disappearance of smart things in the environment. The second one provides mechanisms to dynamically compose the services provided by smart things. The third layer offers an autonomic context-driven composition mechanism based on a new software paradigm: 'application schemas'. This layer manage the interferences and conflicts that may occur during the autonomic composition process.},

By embedding tiny Sensor-Tag into the user's shoes, FootStep-Tracker is able to accurately perceive the user's moving trace, including the moving direction and distance. Moreover, by detecting the user's activities such as going upstairs/downstairs and taking an elevator, FootStep-Tracker can correlate with the specified positions such as stairs and elevators, and determine the exacted moving traces in the indoor map.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing has been focusing on creating smart agents that are submerged into everyday environments, however, recent development on physical computing is demanding a shift from calm computing to a physically engaging form. Computing is no more limited to increasing our comfort through passive and pervasive deployment, they can now be created as being more actively intermeshed into our physical tasks. We present L'evolved, autonomous ubiquitous utilities that assist in user tasks through active physical participation. They not only dynamically adapt to individual user needs, but also work in close tandem with the users. By harnessing drone technology, we realize the design and implementation of a flying lamp and a desk that affords free motions and computational controls. Through specific use scenarios of those exemplary utilities, we show how this new form of smart agents promises various new ways of interacting with our physical environments.},

The initial application seeks to aid in the prevention of infectious diseases in Lagos, Nigeria through installing the application on up to 100 smartphones. In our demo we demonstrate how anonymous user IDs can be interrogated from a real-time dataset. Using this information a public policy maker or health worker can identify infected or at risk individuals immediately. Furthermore, they can notify such individuals if they are at risk. Lastly, future work will allow us to use this information to model the spread of an infectious disease in real-time with geospatial resolution not readily available in typical infectious disease models.},

In this way, both active and passive vocabulary are practiced. Through interaction with tangible objects, an unscripted narrative unfolds, resulting in natural exposure to the foreign language and a playful "learning by doing" experience. Using the accompanying storybook, caregivers can participate and aid in the learning process together with children.},

And the system uses other RFID tags to recognize the person. This system can trace the persons from these two inputs. We verify that the human tracking system identifies a person walking. This system can also identify the person while few people are walking over the sensor sheet.

In this study, we reverse this procedure in order to assist with toy block assembly and scanning methods. In order to assist with toy block assembly, our "StudI/O" system projects round markers on the studs of a target toy block to indicate the mounting position and direction of the block. When a user places a block in an appropriate location, the stud areas are illuminated exactly, without distortions. These markers are also useful when a user wants to disassemble his/her toy block work to scan the structure. This is an effective and practical system that uses only a projector. In addition, because the user manually adjusts the positions during the assembly and scanning task, no sensing devices to detect the position of the user and toy blocks are required.},

The LiDAR sensor is utilized to acquire 3D data of the environment and generate point cloud. Pictures captured by the panoramic camera are used for complementing RGB information of the point cloud after the calibration between the panoramic camera and the LiDAR sensor. We could maker point cloud denser by registering multiple frames of point cloud with Generalized Iterative Closet Point(Generalized-ICP) method. We evaluate Velobug in an underground shopping street near Nagoya Station. The experiment result shows the mobility, practicability and efficiency in reconstruction for 3D indoor mapping.},

Second interesting point is that it can run without a smartphone because it has a flash memory. The battery life in stand-alone mode is more than 12 hours. In addition to the hardware, we are now implementing a support software for iPhone/Android and Mac. Furthermore, 3D CAD data of various case designs will be open for users. As a result, SenStick enables everyone to sense every activities easily.},

In the absence of any public reports regarding potential risks, throughout our daily lives, we are faced with the risk of camera-recording attacks, which are a type of shoulder-surfing attack. Conventional knowledge-based authentication schemes are vulnerable to such attacks because a user is required to types or tap a secret directly. Several studies have proposed ways of countering such attacks. However, these schemes have remained issues such as a complex operation, increased memory requirements, and/or the need for additional devices. We, therefore, propose a Chameleon Dial (CDial) to improve the issues, and to enable us to be secure against repeated camera-recording attacks.},

abstract = {Near-field radio frequency identification (RFID) tags have a number of unique features such as being wirelessly powered, having ultra low power communication capabilities, small size and low cost. These qualities paired with the increasing availability of commodity near field communication (NFC) enabled smart phones presents a significant opportunity to enable a wide range of new applications and usage scenarios. However, existing NFC tags are mainly used for identification.This demo presents the NFC-WISP, which is an programmable, sensing and computationally enhanced platform designed to explore new RFID enabled sensing and user interface applications. Two example applications using NFC-WISP are showed: one is a battery-free display tag; the other is a real-time temperature tracking and motion indicating tag for cold chain monitoring application.},

Technology-based intervention strategies are scarce in China, which is why we chose to explore one such possibility in this paper. We present a collaborative play environment enabled by an affordable touching and singing plant for children with autism; the plant allows two users (such as the child and a family member) to collaboratively play a variety of music through the touch. The plant is also simple to assemble, making it portable and accessible. To the best of our knowledge, the plant is China's first affordable assistive device for children with autism. A pilot study with 5 children with ASD revealed mixed results.},

abstract = {Textiles are one of the most important materials developed and used extensively by man. Textiles have protected us from the hazardous environmental conditions and clothed us for modesty. One of the newest and rapidly growing area of textiles is electronic textiles where electronic interconnectivity is combined with 'classical' textiles. In the first generation, electronic devices were simply attached to garments or included in pockets. In the second generation, electronic functionality was achieved by incorporating conducting yarns into the textile structure. Integration of micro-semiconductor devices within the fibre of a yarn has an enormous potential in the creation of electronically functional yarns (EFY), and would provide the platform for the creation of a new generation of wearables (3rd generation).},

Trial usage of the system shows that our users can rapidly extract their target objects/space and extend their ideas by taking pictures and drawing/painting on them. This paper also discusses the feasibility of extension of the simple idea from personal usage to collaborative spatial designing by multiple designers, by enabling the merging of 3D sketch spaces.},

Our system will apply pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms to physical sensor measurements such as microphone and radio signals, but also to virtual sensor information such as call and message history and activity of messaging apps. We will evaluate to which extent and how well our system can automatically and unobtrusively find indicators for social interactions and, based on them, identify anomalies in the subject's behavior.},

In our research, we aim to expand the concept of single-sign-on from a single device to all of the user's devices, allowing trusted devices within close proximity to securely and transparently share authentication information in order to gain sufficient confidence in the user's identity to omit explicit authentication.},

abstract = {At a high level, my goal is to design and deploy behavioral coaching and intervention systems that better complement individual users' unique characteristics. I am motivated by the idea that a person's innate attributes and current contexts interact in ways that produce idiosyncratic behaviors that generic interventions may not suit. Using domain knowledge as a guide, my research develops lightweight profiling methods that leverage people's digital footprints in order to passively sense pertinent psychological, physiological, and behavioral characteristics -- and ultimately tailor personal informatics and intervention tools accordingly. I argue that such a theoretically-informed approach that is able to robustly mine, model, and accommodate personal variability will lead to technological solutions that better meet individual needs and produce more positive outcomes.},

abstract = {Poor body form and incorrect muscle usage are a leading cause of injuries in active sports and exercise. For this reason, monitoring of human muscle activity and skeletal motion i.e., musculoskeletal sensing, is important for alleviating injury. Many current monitoring systems are not conducive for this because they are either too invasive, or unable to mitigate the noise induced in the sensed signal by body motion. Our work focuses on creating a framework for acquiring musculoskeletal information in active environments, using a conducive wearable monitoring system. Upon completion, our work will provide an understanding of how to acquire musculoskeletal information, and propose a hardware implementation as well as body motion noise mitigation techniques.},

Building on this background, a glove is designed to allow the user to stimulate the fingertips of their affected hand by tapping the fingers of their unaffected hand, using Force Sensing Resistors to trigger Linear Resonance Actuators on the corresponding fingers. This paper outlines the design considerations and methods used to create the glove, and discusses the potential for further work in the pursuit of a clinical trial.},

abstract = {Smart devices with incompatible protocols and APIs are increasing in everyday environments. Adaptive middleware techniques have enabled smart phones to become smart gateways between these incompatible devices by providing protocol translation services at runtime. Thus, mobile apps can easily use remote services to execute the app logic, which typically integrates services in a distributed mobile environment. However, as the number of services increase, and the user's context changes, it is challenging for mobile apps to discover relevant device services due to incompatible protocols and unknown devices. A smart agent is needed to guide service composition in mobile apps with respect to the user's changing context, so that mobile apps can seamlessly integrate services from different networks and execute complex tasks. To this end, I present a novel approach for context-aware service discovery based on semi-lazy bandit algorithms, and, present a functioning prototype as a microservice, which shows encouraging first results.},

Continued disruption of biological rhythms often has serious consequences for physical and mental well-being, causing cardiovascular disease, cancer, obesity, and mental health problems. My research goal is to advance a vision for "circadian computing" --- designing, developing and deploying novel technology that helps to maintain our innate biological rhythms. Towards that vision, I focus on developing technologies for detecting circadian disruptions and providing in-situ interventions. My approach involves passive and automated sensing of behavioral traits to model body clock patterns that can be used to support varying needs of users over time. One strand of my research focuses on developing tools that can adapt to our individual rhythms and provide more biologically attuned support in the areas of physical and cognitive performance, sleep, and wellbeing. The other aspect of my research focuses on mental health --- preventing relapse by identifying disruptions and providing circadian interventions for bipolar and schizophrenic patients.},

abstract = {From the moment this gaze exists, I am already something other, in that I feel myself becoming an object for the gaze of others. But in this position, which is a reciprocal one, others also know that I am an object who knows himself to be seen.Jacques LacanWhy is there a tendency to associate visibility and transparency with truth, democracy and knowledge? Are there other forms of knowledge that come from the veil? How can we avoid the gaze, subvert it? Through the process of creating a device that draws awareness to the gaze, the Gaze Subversion Helmet, many fascinating questions arise. The form of the helmet lends it to be further objectified when the aperture becomes opaque. How does this heighten the experience and the awareness of the objectifying gaze? While this device does not address the digital realm of cyber-space, it focuses on the physical confrontations and a heightened awareness of the moment from which the gaze manifests. Its purpose is to react to this physical confrontation of real bodies and gazes.We are a species that requires privacy, yet that privacy has been deprived of us through concepts of total visibility and the ever present gaze. How can we design using a play of nuances of visibility, allowing for the gaze to manifest at particular moments and denying it at others? What can we learn from these nuances that we would not learn from a society of total visibility or total veiling? Drawing on architectural and design precedents, this helmet explores these nuances. The implications of the helmet go beyond the theoretical applications. These concepts can further be applied medically, specifically to those with difficulty with eye contact and personal confrontation.},

Buildings would light up brightly when busy, and dim down when people leave. Lighting would become more energy efficient, more personal, and colorful, tailored to individual needs. What applications beyond illumination would be possible in such a scenario? Halo is a wearable lighting device that aims to investigate this question. More specifically Halo explores the potential of body-centered lighting technology to alter appearance and create a personal space for its wearer. A ring of colored LEDs frames the wearer's face, putting her into the light she desires. Borrowing from both theatrical and photographic lighting design, Halo has several different lighting compositions that make the wearer appear happy, sad, energetic, mysterious, etc. Using a smart phone application, the wearer can switch between these modes. She can also let the application adjust automatically depending on her activities. Halo is an experimental technology that combines function and fashion---a platform to probe the future of wearable lighting.},

While wearables collect users' data and quantify information about their daily lives, mobile applications aid them to analyze and visualize the information collected, to raise their awareness and to encourage behavior changes. Several applications have been proven successful within this research context, for instance to promote healthier eating habits and the incorporation of physical activities in users' daily habits. Despite promising, the development of wearable solutions for healthcare still encompasses significant challenges; not only the devices must be comfortable and easy to use, but also their underlying strategies must be carefully designed to ensure users' acceptance, adoption and sustained engagement.

abstract = {Behavioral patterns linked to physical activity and nutrition are established during adolescence and people tend to maintain them throughout their whole lives. Wearable life tracking devices might be a useful tool in order to achieve healthy lifestyles among teens. The objective of this study is to investigate what teens think of current wearable devices for fitness tracking, using the results to provide preliminary suggestions for the design of wearable technology aimed at adolescents. Thirty 14--16 teens (sex balanced) divided into 3 groups were asked to trial use commercially available wearables for one week. Each group took part in two focus group sessions, separated by a week. During the trial users experienced some technical problems while using the devices. Monitoring physical activity seems not to be a priority for adolescents but they recognize the important potential in doing it. Recommendations were suggested for the devices to better meet teenage preferences and needs.},

Increasing aged population arises the problem of life style related disease, ie, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, hyper lipidemia. Medical practitioners expect so much on wearable health devices in controlling these diseases. But most of them have no chance to mention what they want. We provided a small chance what they want if they can contribute the development of wearable health devices. 10 minutes of brain storming produced so much idea and after that we put them into affinity diagram. We classified them between passive health and active health. Active health is what physicians want. We hope this study will open the gate among physicians, education specialists and IT developers.},

The mood recognition is concluded by smartphone-based wearable sensing. In a formative study, we evaluated the usability and unobtrusiveness of our mood assessment. A median SUS score of 90 shows a high usability. Subjects reported an easy, fast and intuitive use. The mood recognition was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy. First, we analyzed which features are best for the recognition. Spatio-temporal attributes, i.e. daytime, day of week and location, correlate most with the monitored mood. Based on the identified attributes, we trained personalized classifiers using Na\"{\i}ve Bayes and applied ten-fold-cross validation. The average recognition accuracy was 0.76 which is comparable to related work.},

In predictive modeling, determining ground truth plays a crucial role in labeling and training the model. Experience Sampling Method (ESM) is widely used in behavioral science to gather user responses about mental states. Smartphones equipped with sensors provide new avenues to design Experience Sampling Methods. Sensors provide multiple contexts that can be used to trigger collection of user responses. However, subsampling of sensor data can bias the inference drawn from trigger based ESM. We investigate whether continuous sensor data simplify the design of ESM. We use the typing pattern of users on smartphone as the context that can trigger response collection. We compare the context based and time based ESM designs to determine the impact of ESM strategies on emotion modeling. The results indicate how different ESM designs compare against each other.},

abstract = {The mobile phone-based Experience Sampling Method (ESM) enables in situ recording of human behaviour and experience by querying users, via their smartphones, anywhere and anytime. Sampling can happen on a previously unimaginable scale, and across a diverse pool of participants. Therefore, mobile ESM is not limited to capturing users' manual responses, as the surrounding context can be automatically captured by mobile sensors. However, obtaining high quality data with ESM is challenging, as users may fail to respond honestly, or may even ignore the questionnaire prompts if they perceive the study as too burdensome. In this paper, we discuss the potential of using interruptibility prediction models to deliver mobile ESM questionnaires at opportune moments, and thus improve the effectiveness of a study. We examine context prediction and interruptibility inference, which are fundamental challenges that need we need to overcome in order to make mobile ESMs better aligned with a user's lifestyle, and consequently paint a truthful picture of a user's behaviour.},

This study introduces the Mobile Photographic Stress Meter (MPSM), a new way to measure stress in which a user simply selects an image that best captures his or her stress level. Such a tool allows researchers to quickly measure stress in real time and in natural environments less onerous for the user. Our results show that MPSM is a valid measure of stress. Users find it easy and actually enjoyable to use. Our results also show that MPSM is strongly correlated with the Perceived Stress Scale, a validated multi-item stress scale. The correlation has an r-value of 0.5559 and a p-value of less than 0.001. We conclude that MPSM can be applied effectively in research experiments and advance the research on stress.},

abstract = {Human activities analyses based on sensor data are gaining much importance. Of particular importance are those situations where man-machine interaction needs to be studied. The detection of risk induced while driving and customizing the insurance premium accordingly is an appropriate example. For such, the individuals are induced to utilize their personally owned smartphones in order to collect data and share them with insurance companies. The traditional approach counts the number of harsh events and infers the risk induced. However, such event-based inference is not necessarily a suitable approach for understanding each individual's propensity to indulge in high risk maneuvers. We propose an alternate method where a statistical route is adopted for quantifying risk propensity as well as a comparative analysis amongst a peer-group of drivers. A relatively moderate scale experimental test bed had been deployed by collecting driving related data (using their smartphones) from approximately 50 volunteers, fora duration of two months at a stretch. The experiment was unsupervised and the relative assessment is dependent on the quantity and quality of the collected data for each driver. In our model, the acceleration profiles displayed by each driver for every completed trip are observed to extract statistical features like 'Skewness squared' and 'Kurtosis'. It is observed that the kurtosis of the acceleration profiles stores major information about the driving styles. Subsequently, we have used statistical techniques to identify trends in data and used it to quantify the nature of the driving style. A comparative analysis within the peer-group (people with similar demographic features and similar work responsibilities) is done to judge individual propensities. It is envisaged that such application can be used to induce road safety through competitive spirit; additionally a large enterprise will find this tool useful to encourage employees to move towards a safe and fulfilling lifestyle. In this paper, we present the initial results of the above mentioned exercise using a smaller subset of the collected data.},

We introduce our approach of mediating movement-based interaction techniques to the user allowing spontaneous interaction within walk-up-and-use scenarios. Our concept of semiotically enhanced shadow representations combines abstract user representations with meaningful symbols, visual accentuations and animations to emphasize body parts and explain movements that are relevant for the interaction with the system. The MeetingMirror is used as an example application for implementing this approach.},

abstract = {The proposed workshop envisions the idea of Pervasive Participation, forms of advanced citizen e-participation based on the pervasive computing paradigm utilizing latest mobile technology such as feature-rich smartphones and appliances embedded in today's technically enriched urban surroundings. Opportunities reach from using today's sensing, communication and display features of smartphones, wearable gadgets including smartwatches and glasses, up to instrumented environments with interactive walls. Pervasive Participation is an inherently interdisciplinary research endeavor requiring expertise from disciplines such as pervasive and mobile computing, human-computer interaction, social sciences as well as political sciences. We will select participants based on submitted position papers describing their research on advanced citizen e-participation. Together with them, we seek to discuss the requirements, opportunities, challenges and impact of such novel citizen e-participation concepts.This workshop is planned as a one-day workshop containing presentation sessions and an interactive brainstorming session and breakout activity for identifying relevant issues and upcoming research challenges. Based on the collected contributions, we will try to create a research roadmap for Pervasive Participation and to explore opportunities for future work and collaborations.},

Addressing citizens personally, interaction among co-located people, communication of the opportunity to engage and low participation barriers turned out to be the key drivers for creating user-accepted pervasive participation concepts. Also, we present different identity models that capture personal values relevant to participation. Scientists and practitioners alike can use these data to create meaningful and effective ubiquitous applications for situated civic discourse and participation.},

abstract = {With the availability of displays in public space increasing, they have been proposed and studied as platform for civic engagement. Due to their situated nature, public displays have the potential to enable a larger cross-section of the public to participate in community consultation processes, compared to focus groups or online surveys. Previous research has investigated a range of interaction methods for enabling this form of citizen participation with public displays. Through an analysis of related work we identified four main categories of interaction methods: remote indirect, kiosk, mid-air gestural and mobile. In this paper we propose a formerly introduced interaction method, based upon mobile augmented reality, which promises to enable pervasive participation by making interactions more private and simultaneous, through a familiar and convenient interface.},

With this paper, we add to the debate by presenting a study comparing intention and behaviour using a location-based mobile participation application. We find no correlation between hypothetical and actual participation, but find that intention to participate differs from actual participation both by frequency and by what the participants (state that they would) participate in. We also find that the most prominent reason for not installing the app and participating in the field study seems to have been privacy concern.},

Strongly related is further the question of how to design a both trustworthy and effective tool for civic engagement. This research investigates the potential of game elements in participation tools to motivate people to become active. Preliminary results show that game-related elements can serve as an initial motivation. However, the most important aspects remains governance responding to and considering civic input. Future work will focus on the effects of specific game elements and their long-term influence on participation.},

Scrolling patterns were also influenced by document structure, with most scrolling occurring at the intersection between paragraphs, in order to bring new text into the preferred reading region. We conclude with the implications of our findings with a new gaze-enhanced scrolling technique aimed to support behaviors evident in manual scrolling.},

To counter the motor noise we present a word-by-word textual UI that shows temporary command options to be executed by gaze-strokes. Twenty-seven participants conducted a simulated smartwatch task and were able to reliably perform commands that would adjust the speed of word presentation or make regressions.

The frame of the eyeglasses offers three natural contact points with the wearer's skin for haptic stimulation. The results of two user studies reported in this paper showed that stimulation moving between the contact points was easy for users to localize, and that the stimulation has potential to make the use of gaze gestures more efficient.},

abstract = {Personalized wearable ICT systems presented in fashionable and appealing lifestyle-designs have gained critical user acceptance, and comprise momentum to bring wearable computing to a socio-technical mass phenomenon within the next few years. Early indicators for this expected wearable systems 'tsunami' are the 'spring tide' of 7.3 billion mobile connected platforms (i.e. mobile subscribers) as of the end of 2014, 300 mio. shipped smart watches in 2014 with an expected annually growth of 35% till 2020, and a possible market for more than 200 million smart eyewear systems in 2015 [1].Following the great success of the 1st Superorganism of Wearables Workshop at Ubicomp 2014 with roughly 50 participants from 15 different countries, we build on the immense interest of the research community in the proposed topic. The structuring of the workshop in slots initiated by a keynote presentation accompanied by technical paper presentations and position statements resulted in lively and vibrant discussions. Collected material for the dissemination of the Workshop ideas can be found at the Workshop Website (https://www.pervasive.jku.at/ubicomp14/) The 2nd instantiation of the workshop will reattach to last years agenda and ask the questions on the potentials and opportunities of turning these massively deployed wearable systems to a globe spanning superorganism of socially interactive personal digital assistants. While the individual wearables are of heterogeneous provenance and typically act autonomously, we can assume that they can (and will) self-organize into large scale cooperative collectives, with humans being mostly out-of-the-loop [2]. We may not assume a common objective or central controller, but rather volatile network topologies, co-dependence and internal competition, non-linear and non-continuous dynamics, and sub-ideal, failure prone operation. We could refer to these emerging massive collectives of wearables as a "superorganism" [3], since it exhibits properties of a living organism (like e.g. 'collective intelligence') on its own. In order to properly exploit such superorganisms, we need to develop a deeper scientific understanding of the foundational principles by which they operate.},

abstract = {We are surrounded by a multitude of communicating sensing devices. Furnished with wearables to serve our very needs, we traverse sensor-rich environments of smart cities. Through new open standards and novel protocols this loose collection of devices increasingly evolves into a superorganism of wearables and environmental devices. All these devices share a single ubiquitous sensor type: the RF-interface. Ubiquitously available signals from e.g. FM-radio, WiFi or UMTS can be exploited as sensor for presence, location, crowd-size, activity or gestures [4, 1, 2]. On-site training of these systems will soon be replaced by offline-raytracing techniques [3] and recognition accuracies will further increase with the Channel State Information (CSI) on recent OFDM receivers. In contrast to RSSI, CSI features channel response information as a PHY layer power feature, revealing amplitudes and phases of each subcarrier (cf. Figure 2).Exemplary, enabled by this superorganism of wireless devices, we envision the advance of sentiment sensing, smart city architectures as well as autonomous intelligent spaces.},

abstract = {Emerging and future pervasive computing scenarios will soon feature a dramatic increase in the number of networked wearable devices: any computational mechanism involving humans (sensing, actuation, situation recognition, decision-making) will have the opportunity of involving large ensembles. What would be the proper programming model for such systems? We argue that it is nothing about current mainstream approaches, since they lack the suitable abstractions needed to smoothly address explosion of scale, resiliency and self-* properties, and heterogeneity of communication and computation infrastructure.We propose aggregate computing, a new approach for the development of large-scale, emerging pervasive computing systems. It considers as reference computing "machine" the overall "Superorganism of Wearables", abstracted to a mobile and densely interconnected continuum capable of manipulating physically-distributed computational structures as a whole. Independence from the details of the underlying network (size, density, topology, mobility) and support of resilience properties (adaptation, robustness, stabilisation) will no longer be a programming concern, but rather inherent features of the approach achieved by self-organisation "under-the-hood".In this talk, we give an overview of aggregate computing, and discuss its many facets and challenges: theoretical ground, production toolchain, libraries of reusable quality components, and run-time support.},

abstract = {Collective Adaptive System (CAS) as a broad term refers to todays observable indications of a deployment of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at a very large scale (e.g. 3.5*109 personal computers, 6.2*109 smart phones, 1.1*109 cars on planet). Taking such a massive ICT deployment, it is not just considered possible, but already a reality that these are programmed to operate cooperatively as very large scale collectives. As for example, smartphone apps have demonstrated globe-spanning cooperative sensing applications, liquid democracy applications, logistics and traffic management applications, energy management applications, etc.One essential aspect of such globe-spanning ICT collectives is that they often exhibit properties typical observed in complex systems, like (i) spontaneous, dynamic network configuration, with (ii) individual nodes acting in parallel, (iii) constantly acting and reacting to what the other agents are doing, and (iv) where the control tends to be highly dispersed and decentralized. If there is to be any coherent behavior observed on the level of the collective (macro-level), it (v) it usually arises from competition and cooperation among the individual elements (micro-level). The overall behavior of the collective (macro-behaviour) is the result of (vi) a huge number of decisions made every moment by many individual entities (micro-interactions), possibly leading to (vii) the emergence of unexpected phenomena.A critical challenge for CAS is to design and implement collectives able to operate in a more or less autonomous way, with little or no human interaction. In this endeavor, self-adaptation and self-management have emerged as two interrelated facets of CASs.Self-adaptive collectives in a top down strategy evaluate their own global behavior and change it when the evaluation indicates that they are not accomplishing what they were intended to do, or when better function or performance is possible. Here a challenge is to identify how to change the behaviors of the individuals so as to achieve the desired collective improvement. In self-managing collectives, individuals interact locally, typically according to a small set simple rules. Achieving a desirable collective behaviour is attempted with a bottom up strategy, in that local interaction policies are adopted so as to steer global behavior. Self-organisation is the process of enabling a system to change its organisation in case of environmental changes without explicit external command. We can distinguish between: weak self-organisation where from an internal point of view, there is re-organisation under an internal central control or planning; and strong-selforganisation (also referred to as "emergence"), where there is re-organisation with no explicit central control, either internal or external [1]. Building upon the mechanisms of self-adaptation and self-management, we may ask the questions on the potentials and opportunities of turning massively deployed systems to a globe spanning superorganism of socially interactive elements [2]. While the individual elements are of heterogeneous provenance and typically act autonomously, we can assume that they can (and will) self-configure into large scale cooperative collectives, either with or without human governance [3,4]. We may not assume a common objective or central control, but rather volatile network topologies, codependence and internal competition, non-linear and non-continuous dynamics, and sub-ideal, failure prone operation. The recent literature has referred to these emerging massive collectives as "superorganisms" [5], since they exhibit properties of a living organism (like e.g. 'collective intelligence') on its own. In order to properly exploit such superorganisms, we need to develop a deeper scientific understanding of the foundational principles by which they operate.},

In addition, eye tracking technologies especially with wearable eye trackers are becoming matured in terms of size and measurement accuracy, and more importantly, the cost of wearable eye trackers has been significantly reduced in recent years. This opens up new opportunities for us not only to capture what each person is seeing but also to analyze and understand how the person is seeing it for many kinds of applications.},

Despite significant advances in recent years, state-of-the-art human-machine systems still fall short in sensing, analysing, and fully "understanding" cues naturally expressed in everyday settings. Two of the most important non-verbal cues, as evidenced by a large body of work in experimental psychology and behavioural sciences, are visual (gaze) behaviour and body language. We envision a new class of collaborative human-machine systems that fully exploit the information content available in non-verbal human behaviour in everyday settings through joint analysis of human gaze and physical behaviour.},

For this, truly wearable devices that do not interfere with users activates are warranted. We have started to examine the potential use of implicit ambient surface information in the field of sports. Scientific and technological advances on such information will provide an innovative venue for wisdom computing and harmonious collaborations between humans and machines.},

While the initial aim of such research was to identify brain regions where structural variation correlated with cognitive functions, the flurry of correlational findings suggest that MRI scans of the human brain can be used to make predictions about individuals. We have confirmed this idea by constructing highly accurate prediction models for a multitude of cognitive traits using a machine learning technique called elastic net. We are currently implementing those prediction models on a web-based service called Neuroprofile where anyone can upload their brain scan to view the predicted cognitive traits. This service will be provided to make the contents of MRI-based brain health check-ups much richer and more informative.},

abstract = {To effectively leverage human sensorimotor abilities, this paper urges going beyond the traditional five senses. When users share physical space or location with other people, a crucial but neglected modality is arguably the sense of ownership. If, how, and what someone can see, touch, hear, feel, and taste is normally strongly influenced by their perceptions as to who something belongs to. This is illustrated by presenting preliminary results from an ongoing design space review of wearable computing experimentation concerned with encouraging interpersonal interactions between co-located people. Drawing upon urbanism theory helps show how different variations of territorial blending can articulate tactics for increasing sociality through interactive garments. These insights are offered to aid understanding of the design space for developers directly concerned with influencing co-located interactions through interactive apparel, and to address wider challenges of designing socially acceptable ubiquitous interaction.},

abstract = {Our research question is the role of body in a Ubiquitous era. To answer this question, we propose a study for the design of an innovative gestural corpus to allow a natural, simple interaction and communication in social smart space through the body.The goals of this work are 1) to examine the relation between body and space in Ubiquitous era; 2) to investigate the potential of body and senses to improve one's ability to interact with surroundings; 3) to present a study for a new gestural corpus for smart spaces, adopting a bodystorming approach. This paper introduces the general approach, describes our current statement of research and outlines the planned study design.},

abstract = {The body contains the particular condition of being simultaneously subject and object. In this regard, this position paper advocates for the importance of developing technologies that celebrate the subjective aspects of the body. As a theoretical ground, I find inspiration from Shusterman's concept of soma and his philosophical project of Somaesthetics, which acknowledges the body as mindful as well as a source of meaning-generation. Nowadays, technologies for self-exploration are mostly focused on supervising and shaping the objective body towards the interpretation of quantified outcomes. Even when the objective and subjective approaches can be complementary, I discuss about the current need for technology that takes into account the experiential and smart body that expands its semiotic world, providing new channels for self-expression and learning.},

Superdirective microphone array can recover such limit, performing a spatial filtering to achieve an augmented SNR. We present Glassense, a platform hosting a double microphone array connected to a processing unit and mounted on the frame of common glasses. The platform has the potential of delivering binaural spatially selective audio inputs, allowing ecological pointing of acoustic sources through head motion. The designed microphone arrays exhibit a gain suitable to improve the speech reception threshold of hearing-impaired subjects, obtained on a lightweight and scalable hardware setup.},

In this paper we discuss the drivers, needs and concerns of longitudinal QS-data collection. We argue that to support longitudinal QS various obstacles have to be overcome, including i) integration and sharing of data between a variety of (new) devices, ii) incorporating human input for psychological data collection and iii) providing answers to the questions people really have.},

To date we have concentrated on automatically detecting semantic concepts from within visual lifelogs yet identifying human activities from such lifelogged images or videos is still a major challenge if we are to use lifelogs to maximum benefit. In this paper, we propose an activity classification method from visual lifelogs based on Fisher kernels, which extract discriminative embeddings from Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) of occurrences of semantic concepts. By using the gradients as features, the resulting classifiers can better distinguish different activities and from that we can make inferences about human behaviour. Experiments show the effectiveness of this method in improving classification accuracy, especially when the semantic concepts are initially detected with low degrees of accuracy.},

We have proposed the system called Primer Streamer [2] that unconsciously leads the user to the specific information by presenting the visual information that is related to user's interest. This system utilizes the concept of the priming effect, whereby individuals are affected by content that has been presented before. In this research, we aim to expand the concept to more realistic situation. We showed that the image of desktop icons affects human behaviors. If the small image like the icon image also affects human behaviors, the proposed system can simultaneously work with other applications. In this paper, we performed an experiment that participants took photos in changing the icon image of camera application. Evaluation results confirmed that they changed the objects of shooting according to the icon image.},

While such goals are widely recognized as important, many people find it very hard to achieve them. Some of the key challenges include maintaining motivation, establishing habits, setting personal goals, monitoring progress and tackling forgetfulness. As a way to tackle these challenges, we introduce SAL (simple, situated ambient loggers). Their conception and design is grounded in theories of self-regulation. Users can situate a SAL logger within their environment to support self-regulation, by remembering, logging and self-reflection to help them achieve their long term goals. Our contribution is to propose this new class of personal loggers.},

We interviewed 18 subjects using a set of carefully designed qualitative questions and let them use a fitness sensor called Fitbit for one month. Before the study, participants found it challenging to motivate themselves for physical exercise. One month later, they became aware of their sedentary lifestyles and started to perform more activities at a steady pace. Subsequently, patients reported rethinking of fitness and visible behavior changes.},

abstract = {The Future Mobility Sensing (FMS) technology is a personal activity diary tool designed to support travel surveys. Traditionally done with paper-and-pencil or web-based questionnaires, these data collection efforts are essential for transport modelling tools, which are often used to support the decision making process of transportation systems. The limitations of this traditional approach are well-known: under-reporting of trips; inaccurate time and location information; high cost per survey; lack of detailed route information.FMS is a fully automated survey system based on 3 components: logger (smartphone or dedicated device); backend system with real-time data analysis; activity diary web interface. It has been tested in several contexts, including a survey with the Singapore Land Transport Authority (LTA) involving 1500+ participants, each one logging and validating up to two weeks of data.We see FMS as a quantifying self tool with particular focus on activity and travel behavior. This paper presents insights and lessons learned from FMS field surveys, related to battery performance, interface design, and data quality, together with proposals to tackle some of its key challenges.},

However, the modalities through which these information are presented often prevent individuals to gain useful insights. Numbers and graphs, in fact, are not suitable for all users. In this work, we suggest that storytelling can provide effective ways to present personal data to users. Looking at narrations and how they are told, Quantified Self tools can satisfy also the needs of those that have less experience in managing quantitative information.},

abstract = {In ambulatory assessment, subjects are monitored in everyday life. Though, it is difficult to unobtrusively assess information -- e.g. about their context and affective state -- which results in an increased burden for the subjects. This burden is caused by a complex self-report that they need to provide or by additional wearables that need to be carried. Newest technology can solve this issue by assessing a variety of information automatically. We propose to use smartwatches in combination with smartphones to assess physiological and smartphone data from which the affective state of a user can be inferred. We present the principle idea of our app and how we intend on evaluating it. A review of state of the art approaches and available Android Wear smartwatches in terms of sensors is given. We present a number of smartphone sensors and a selection of smartwatches whose combination should be evaluated regarding usefulness for mood assessment and recognition.},

This support generally focuses on an improved self-awareness based on the review of own fitness data, sometimes enhanced by social features like performance comparison. We see a demand for a goal-driven support of fitness goal achievement to be addressed by a digital coach. The digital coach identifies strength and weaknesses of the subject, generates a training plan, motivates and helps, just like a real coach. Such a digital coach will highly benefit from the activity tracking system data which is used to personalize the training plan based on performed activities.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new way to analyse and visualize quantified-self or lifelog data captured from any lifelogging device over an extended period of time. The mechanism works on the raw, unstructured lifelog data by detecting periodicities, those repeating patters that occur within our lifestyles at different frequencies including daily, weekly, seasonal, etc. Focusing on the 24 hour cycle, we calculate the strength of the 24-hour periodicity at 24-hour intervals over an extended period of a lifelog. Changes in this strength of the 24-hour cycle can illustrate changes or shifts in underlying human behavior. We have performed this analysis on several lifelog datasets of durations from several weeks to almost a decade, from recordings of training distances to sleep data. In this paper we use 24 hour accelerometer data to illustrate the technique, showing how changes in human behavior can be identified.},

This appears somewhat contradictory, as personal informatics technology becomes integrated in life in nuanced ways, contributing value beyond the instrumental data analysis role.

abstract = {This workshop (held in conjunction with the UBICOMP 2015: The 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing and ISCW 2015: The 19th International Symposium on Wearable Computers) will bring together researchers and practitioners to reflect on the use of participatory design methods, especially in the context of design for wellbeing. Delegates will reflect both on the user experience of being part of such methods, and on the design team experience, in line with recent calls for reflexivity in HCI. The workshop will enable delegates to situate their practice in the broader context of humanistic psychotherapy research, and implications for research methodologies and professional development will be discussed. Through a short series of talks, delegates will learn about attitudes and tools (specifically the Person Centred Approach and Interpersonal Process Recall) for reflection on team working and relational aspects of participatory design. The workshop will in turn contribute to the development of a person-centred framework for participatory and co-design research.This set of three talks reflects on the use of participatory design methods, especially in the context of design for mental health and wellbeing. In them we: introduce the Person-Centred Approach as a framework for conducting Participatory Design; outline the method of Interpersonal Process Recall (IPR); and present a heuristic case study of these approaches being developed by a multidisciplinary design research team with Mind, a UK mental health charity.The aims of the workshop are to: situate Participatory Design practice in the context of humanistic psychotherapy research, and discuss implications for design research methodologies; introduce phenomenological attitudes and tools for reflection on team working and relational aspects of Participatory Design; and contribute to the development of a person-centred framework for Participatory Design research.},

We propose that it can provide a mechanism for reflection on team working and relational aspects of Participatory Design.

We propose that this approach can help the field of Participatory Design recognise that researchers and research teams constructively inform their practice through the attitudes they bring to what is necessarily a relational situation. The PCA will be of interest to researchers working with mental health and wellbeing communities in particular, but may also be valuable in offering a framework for Participatory Design as a broad field of practice. The paper describes different modes of practice to be found in psychotherapy and outlines key aspects of the PCA, before discussing its implications for doing Participatory Design.},

The tool runs on two modes; mobility and ridership. The mobility mode displays an animation of bus movement in the city with varying number of riders of each bus stop throughout the day. In the ridership mode, the user can observe the varying number of riders (bus usage) in different areas of the city. The tool also allows the user to interact with the tool by not only selecting different modes of display (mobility and bus ridership), but also changing 2D-3D views, visualizing specific bus lines and stations, and viewing weather conditions. The visualization gives an overview of the dynamic urban flow. This also helps describe bus usage behavior, and it can be useful for urban planning and transport engineering to manage the flow in the city.},

We analyze similarities and differences between the two as well as the role that measurable factors such as trip distance or slope might play in the temporal differences. Finally, we propose a predictive model based on a set of measurable factors that improves the accuracy of Google's biking time computations by 5%.},

abstract = {Owning or leasing an electric vehicle (EV) is becoming more common in developed countries. While home charging is the most common choice, workplace charging and its provision by employers has become an important option. For many, it is essential to cope with the limited range of most EVs. Home and work are the two places where vehicles are parked for long periods and so are prime candidates as charging locations. However, workplace charging is often a limited resource. This paper reports on an empirical study of workplace charging at a UK public sector employer. It explores the use of workplace charging (WPC) via spatiotemporal analysis of employees and visitors' charging events over a 3-month period. It provides insights into weekly patterns and daily mechanisms of using shared facilities in a WPC environment. We identify insights that are relevant in the design of workplace-charging infrastructure, identify the design needs, emerging requirements, and highlight potential areas for sociotechnical-interventions.},

The research goal is to discover to what extent navigational strategies in a conceptual space should be reflected in a physical space, or vice versa. This paper describes preliminary analysis of results from two studies. These studies suggest that tourists have a strong preference for visiting places in order of 'closest next'. However, tourists also want to understand how places are conceptually related. Providing this type of information may assist tourists in their informal learning from a city visit.},

In 2013, we were ranked the third in terms of high road accident fatality rate according to the World Health Organization [9] and ranked the sixth from World Life Expectancy website [10]. ThaiRSC, Thai Road Accident Data Center for Road Safety Culture, reported that there are 27,627 accidents occurred in Bangkok Area in 2014 [5]. To examine the completeness of an official road accident report from ThaiRSC, we collected road accident reports from an independent and voluntary source, i.e. Twitter, via our natural language processing system, Traffy, and then compared with ThaiRSC source. The result shows that only 1.5% of the reports appear on both ThaiRSC and Twitter. This indicates that data from both sources could significantly complement each other and researchers using ThaiRSC source should be aware that single source of information may not be accurate in terms of completeness.},

abstract = {Informal waste collectors can provide recycling services to developing cities, while cities seek better data collection and stewardship of their waste systems. Mobile applications can mediate this relationship, but must be accessible and adopted by informal workers. Based on past work with recycling cooperatives in Brazil, we built and tested Forager, a web and mobile platform for coops to track their own collection vehicles in real-time and improve coordination and transparency with their private partners and local government. Through observations, workshops, and interviews, we identified simple, error-tolerant, unobtrusive interfaces as ideal for informal work environments. Finally, we discuss how security, workload, and user expectations present unique opportunities and challenges for pervasive urban applications in developing contexts.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a method to detect road anomalies by analyzing driver behaviours. The analysis is based on the data and the features extracted from smartphone inertial sensors to calculate the angle of swerving and also based on distinctive states of a driver behaviour event. A novel approach is introduced to deal with the gyroscope drift, reducing the average angle estimation error for curves up to 2° and the overall average angle error up to 5°. Using a simple machine learning approach and a clustering algorithm, the method can detect 70% of the swerves and 95% of the turns on the road.},

Passenger train ride likelihood calculation is first conducted using CDRs and targeted train objects. Then, the results obtained are compared with the trains specified in GPS logs. Empirical results obtained contain both good cases such as trains being estimated from CDRs and train objects corresponding to the train specified in GPS logs and bad cases such as the estimated train not corresponding to the actual train on which the passenger is riding. Therefore, analysis of each case is also carried out. The application of train objects and cell phone CDRs can facilitate analysis of how passengers ride trains, identification of origin-destination rail routes, and congestion/delay reduction.},

Instant mode displays an animation of a series of earthquake instances taking place in different geographical locations globally over time. Aggregate mode displays the aggregate level of instances of the earthquakes over time. Analysis mode provides a yearly graphical information along with some basic statistics for the user's further analysis. Selected area mode extends the analysis mode by allowing the user to look through the world map and examine different geographical areas as the EQviz provides basic statistics such as the average and standard deviation values of the earthquake magnitudes along with the graphical information of the selected area.},

Products from industry and research in academia currently focus on using the collected data to support health and fitness. Given these trends, it is only a matter of time before we see mobile sensing technology applied to cognitive tasks, enabling novel research directions and use cases. In this workshop, we explore the implications of "knowledge logging", how to record and track what we read, learn, comprehend and how this impacts research towards mind augmentation. The goal of this workshop is to combine innovations in ubiquitous computing with basic research in psychology and cognitive science. The aim is to bring mind augmentation technologies from a niche application in rehabilitation to a mainstream technology and initiating a major change in the way we use technology to externalize our mind. This workshop will bring together researchers, designers and practitioners at the intersection of technology and cognitive psychology to discuss elements and viewpoints of knowledge logging, inferring cognitive states and extending our perception.},

Usually, experiments are carried out with head fixations or by analyzing eye tracking data in large areas such as paragraphs. But if we want to analyze the eye gaze line by line or word by word with a non invasive apparatus, we have to face the mislocation of the recorded eye gaze. The lack of accuracy involves a difficult analysis of the small eyes movements during reading. This paper proposes a method to match lines of gazes with corresponding text lines, using three different methods. We will show that the Dynamic Time Warping is a promising way to measure similarity between a line of gaze and a text line.},

abstract = {With the demographic change and a generally increasing product complexity, there is a growing demand for assistance technology to cognitively support workers during industrial production processes. Many approaches including head-mounted displays, smart gloves, or in-situ projections have been suggested to provide cognitive support for the workers. Recently, research focused on improving the cognitive feedback by using activity recognition to make it context-aware. Thereby an assistance technology is able to detect work steps and provide additional feedback in case the worker makes mistakes. However, when designing feedback for a rather monotonous task, such as product assembly, it should be designed in a way it does neither over-challenge nor under-challenge the worker. In this paper, we sketch out requirements for providing cognitive assistance at the workplace that can adapt to the worker's needs in real-time. Further, we discuss challenges and provide design suggestions.},

With these devices an entire workspace for digital prototyping can be quickly setup in the wild. Examples are taken from "Hiking Hack" workshops held in Panama, Madagascar, and the U.S. The mobility of our setup will enable us to bring our studio directly to the "Wear and Tear" to illustrate the key components and elicit feedback about new designs for portable studio practice.},

abstract = {With wearable computing a new art form is evolving not only for artistic performances but now you can also interact with live digital performance content. Integrated with AR/VR (Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality) technologies, the future art performance will link with virtual characters. In this way the future artistic work may no longer be presented only on a stage, theater, or concert hall. In this paper we will present our idea on how to combine wearable sensors with art performances. Some technical problems need to be addressed. We surveyed the wearable hardware in the market and implemented the WISE (Wearable Item Service runtimE) platform. While wearing the sensors, skeleton (posture) information is delivered in real-time to WISE to render animations displayed on the screen or wearable glasses. This performance can be performed anywhere because it can be quickly deployed and supports improvisation. Even though there are hardware limitation due to non-customized hardware, we can still execute a live field performance to validate the idea and obtain feedback. We believe this will be a new art venue.},

These annotations are considered "ground truth" because users who collected activity data probably know what happened during the activity. However, while ground truth annotations are generally believed to be truthful representations of recorded activities, other qualities of activity recordings such as temporal precision are also of researchers' interest. To assess and compare the qualities of annotated recordings collected among different approaches, it is necessary to have another way to capture a ground truth of users' activities. In this paper, we demonstrate how we used wearable cameras and phone logs to assess the quality of users' recorded transportation activity data. We focus on how we collected photos and logs and generated a ground truth of transportation activity data, and we present challenges we encountered in the generation process.},

The users of this application are motivated to contribute to crowdsourcing by being rewarded with an available seat. Upon startup, SUWANT! displays on the phone screen whether there are passengers around the user who are likely to disembark soon, and the distance between these passengers and the user. The user searches for such passengers by walking around sitting passengers and seeing the changes on the screen. On an experimental test, SUWANT! has succeeded in showing potential vacant seats once in every 5 rides on a specific train.},

However, we have not seen a widespread adoption in industrial and professional scenarios yet. In this workshop, we want to assemble practitioners and researchers in the field to identify blockers of adoption and work towards overcoming them.Augmented Reality (AR) is a successful application area of Wearable Computing, especially for professional, industrial settings, in which mobility is an important factor. With the proliferation of mobile technology in the workplace, wearable computing research can offer a valuable contribution to the usability of mobile solutions, such as the use of context information to inform devices and services of the current task and user situation, relieve professionals of tedious and repetitive information entry tasks and increase worker safety in complex and hazardous environments. Wearable AR systems in general are widely utilized in various domains, including architecture, military, tourism, navigation, and entertainment. Such diverse usages impose several challenges on researchers from both areas of Augmented Reality and Wearable Computing, such as interaction, activity and context recognition, wearability, design, and modelling.We invite researchers and industrial developers from relevant disciplines to a one-day workshop held in conjunction with ISWC 2015 and UbiComp 2015 to present novel work and discuss the application of state-of-the-art Wearable Computing research and Augmented Reality systems. The workshop provides an opportunity for directed discussion to identify current issues, research topics, and solution approaches, which lead to the proposal of future research directions.},

abstract = {Recent advancement of technology enables installations of small sized accelerometers or gyroscopes on various kinds of wearable/portable information devices. By using such wearable sensors, these devices can estimate its posture or status. However, most of current devices only utilize these sensors for simple orientation and gesture recognition. More deep understandings and recognition of human activity through these sensors will enable the next-generation human-oriented computing. To enable the real-world application by these kinds of wearable sensors, a large scale human activity sensing corpus might play an important role. Additionally, we have now a lot of high-performance mobile devices in real-world such as smart-phones. It is a great challenge to utilize such an enormous number of wearable sensors to collect a large-scale activity corpus. In recent years, there are several ongoing projects which are collecting human activities. Following on huge successes of previous workshops, we are further planning to share these experiences of current research on human activity corpus and its applications among the researchers and the practitioners and to have a deep discussion for future of activity sensing.},

abstract = {An in-depth understanding of human activity is essential for building personalized systems like Google Now to support users in everyday life. For that understanding, a comprehensive user-annotated human activity corpus is highly relevant. However, getting a personal dataset for data mining tasks is always a big challenge for researchers.Our approach is Labels, a self-tracking mobile application to collect a human activity corpus with ground-truth data. Providing a user interface users are able to annotate automatically collected sensor data from mobile, desktop and social with valuable metadata (ground-truth), e.g., their performed activities.In this paper, we will present Labels, its functionalities and quality assurance mechanisms for annotated data. We evaluated this app within a four-week field study with 163 participants. The collected dataset with over 43 thousand manual annotated data will also be presented.},

abstract = {Evacuation drills are paramount for emergency preparedness as they train users for emergencies. The evaluation of these drills is critical as it provides insights about response times of building occupants. However, current evaluation of these drills is mostly manual, requiring a lot of human resources, and may still be imprecise with significant deviations from actual results. In this work, we emphasize the use of existing building infrastructure for an objective and automated evaluation of evacuation drills requiring lesser human resources compared to a manual evaluation. We propose the use of SNMP trap service on WiFi infrastructure for analysing occupant participation in evacuation drills. Traps are asynchronous messages sent by WiFi routers to server when an event (e.g. device authentication/de-authentication) occurs. Using the traps collected by our system during an informed drill, we study the evacuation patterns of building occupants. The results demonstrate that half the building users do not participate in the drill, and 34% of participating users evacuate the building using lifts. Our study further validates that most users in an informed fire drill violate the basic assumption -- that all users immediately evacuate the building in case of an emergency alarm. It also testifies the need for issuing prompt instructions to occupants to achieve successful evacuation.},

abstract = {Hybrid indoor positioning researches, which aim improving the positioning accuracy by applying multiple positioning techniques, are the focus of many researchers in these days. However, the current approaches do not consider the positioning accuracy, and tend to combine the positioning techniques together without further caring about the accuracy of each technique. We propose a novel method named "cross-assistive approach" for improving the positioning accuracy by using PDR and Wi-Fi positioning in a cross-assistive manner, where both the positioning techniques mutually increase the positioning accuracy by complementing each other's positioning result, thus we can estimate a user's real walking trajectory with high accuracy. In the cross-assistive approach, Wi-Fi positioning detects the initial values of PDR and corrects the accumulated error of PDR. Moreover, PDR improves Wi-Fi positioning as well. In our previous research, the initial parameters for PDR are manually configured. However, we solved the problem by automatically correcting the current position and direction using the estimated values from Wi-Fi positioning. We performed experiments in the real environment in the Umeda underground shopping mall in Osaka. As a result of the evaluation, we could estimate the initial values of PDR with the probability of 84% using Wi-Fi positioning, and improved the positioning accuracy up to about 10 meters.},

Recently, various studies on power consumptions are conducted. In this study, we have executed system development, experiments by subjects, analysis of correlation between life-pattern and power consumptions and proposal of electrical power reduction for the purpose of reducing home power consumption. At present, we are working on analysis of correlation between a life pattern and electrical power consumption of the residents. We asked the residents for inputting their activities for around several minutes per day using a system that we have developed. We were able to collect approximately 11,745 activity inputs, approximately 7.14GB of sensor data, and power consumption data of 237,280 hours corresponding to about 4 months from 35 homes. Using the collected data, we carried out the multiple regression analysis taking an estimated time of activity and sustained period as explanation variables and average power consumption per day as an objective variable. As the result, it was known that there is correlation between life-pattern and power consumption. In this paper, we will show that it becomes possible to execute concrete analysis of relationship between power consumption and activities of residents by using the label data of resident's life pattern.},

It works in a user-independent fashion, but can also take advantage of activities labeled by the user. It was evaluated on a real-life dataset consisting of ten weeks of recordings. While most activities were recognized quite accurately, the recognition of some revealed two challenges of recognizing diverse lifestyle activities: the ambiguity of some activities, and the inadequacy of smartphone sensors for others.},

abstract = {Activity recognition (AR) has become an essential component of many applications present in our everyday lives such as life-logging, fitness tracking, health and wellbeing monitoring. To build an AR system, one needs to first identify a set of activities of interest and collect labeled training data for these activities. However, activities of interest are not often known in advance. For example, a system designed to monitor a user's life style for potential diabetes risk needs to recognize all physical activities a user performs in her daily life. Given the large number of possible human activities, many of them cannot be foreseen during the model training time. In this work, we study the problem of discovering these unknown activities after the system is deployed by asking users to provide additional labels. Our goal is to discover all the unknown activities (i.e., obtain at least one label per class) while minimizing the amount of labels a user needs to provide. We propose SuperAD (Supervised Activity Discovery) approach, which combines active learning, semi-supervised learning and generative modeling to discover new unknown activities. We show that the proposed approach is especially effective when discovering activities with imbalance class distribution.},

However, since those users generally undertake multiple tasks simultaneously and perform them concurrently, the verification of a work increases in complexity. In this study, we propose a method to define a task and to verify multiple tasks that are performed concurrently. We first consider the definition of a single task by regarding it as an ordinal state machine and categorize events into three categories. Then, we propose a verification method for those concurrent tasks by assigning priorities on the transition categories. Our method has been confirmed to perform appropriately by use of a simulation that includes practical vital measurement tasks.},

Current work has generally focused on applying a range of traditional classification and semantic reasoning based techniques in order to recognise these activities. However, the ability to recognise unexpected actions while the activity is being conducted remains a challenge. In this paper, we present an approach that is able to recognise activities regardless of the order of tasks/actions used to perform the activity. The proposed recognition framework extends an existing activity recognition approach by deploying a frequent pattern mining technique to find patterns among different streams of captured sensor events in order to increase the adaptive learning of the proposed recognition approach.},

This paper presents the design of an algorithm to recognize and estimate travel distance when riding an elevator and its corresponding implementation within an app for a smartphone running Apple's mobile operating system (iOS). The algorithm receives solely the signal of the smartphone's accelerometer, recognizes that it belongs to an elevator ride, and proceeds to calculate the distance traveled by the rider. The algorithm has been designed in a way that simplifies the necessary operations to calculate the travel distance with the objective of minimizing processing power, while keeping the corresponding estimations highly accurate. This is an initial attempt towards the building of a robust, but simple and fast, real-time human activity recognition service on a wearable platform.},

abstract = {Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) has recently attracted attention of researchers. PDR refers to indoor positioning technology that uses the acceleration sensor and gyroscope from a smartphone for relative positioning. However, the positioning results are often degraded, owing to the accumulation of errors such as estimation errors and those incurred by the limited resolution of the sensors. One of the remedies for this problem is a map-matching technique that corrects the current position using pedestrian-space network data, where pathways are represented as a network of links. However, as a correction method, the map-matching technique is limited insofar as it ignores certain features to the users trajectory when automatically mapping the current position onto a link. The trajectory can be used to navigate a user walking along a pathway by providing directions, such as "your destination is on the opposite side of the pathway," depending on the current position of the user.In this study, we propose a method for correcting the crude PDR trajectory to a more likely trajectory by introducing pedestrian-space constraints and adding information about walls and barriers to the link information used by the conventional map-matching technique. We conducted an evaluation of the proposed method at the Umeda underground mall in Osaka, Japan. As a result, we demonstrate that the average positioning error was reduced by up to 60% with the proposed method. Moreover, we confirmed that the shape of actual trajectory remain in the corrected trajectory, and that the proposed method is practical for improving the accuracy of PDR positioning.},

Thus it is regarded as one of the promising sensing technologies for Smart Cities targeting a variety of applications such as disaster prevention, the planning of commercial and barrier-free facilities, and monitoring people with disabilities. However, because Wi-Fi packet sensors cannot detect devices that have disabled their Wi-Fi functionality or people with no Wi-Fi devices, they can only probabilistically estimate the number of people in a target area. We conducted a two-month field experiment in a shopping mall, and derived a coefficient for estimating the actual number of people in the area by comparing the number of recognized devices in the mall, as counted by Wi-Fi packet sensors, with data from motion detectors placed at all of the mall's entrances and exits. In the calculation process, we separated the collected data into weekdays and holidays by considering the visiting patterns, and calculated an estimation coefficient α for the actual number of people. This gives the least absolute error between the observed values given by the Wi-Fi packet sensors and hourly data of motion detectors over the course of a week. The accuracy of α is evaluated by comparing known data from the motion detectors with the estimated people numbers calculated from the Wi-Fi packet sensor data. As a result, we demonstrate that the maximum error in the number of people in the mall for each hour, accumulated over a day, is less than 7.9%.},

Our method can be widely applied into many applications for Safer Cities, ranging from facility monitoring to emergency handling. Different from camera-based approaches, our solution can preserve user privacy, scaling better in terms of costs than existing solutions. Using the data collected from real environments, we examine different supervised learning algorithms and identify that Random Forest is the best model. Our solution has been deployed and tested in a Singapore shopping mall, showing that 95% of the overcrowded situations can be detected.},

abstract = {Interactive autonomous systems are likely to be more involved in future energy systems to assist human users. Given this, we prototyped a future scenario in which householders are assisted in switching electricity tariffs by an agent-based interactive system. The system uses real-time electricity monitoring to instantiate a scenario where participants may have to make, or delegate to their agent (in a variety ways), tariff switching decisions given uncertainty about their own consumption. We carried out a field trial with 12 households for 6 weeks in order to study the notion of autonomy. The results show nuanced ways in which monitoring system performance and taking control is balanced in everyday practice. Our field study provides promising directions for future use of smart systems that help householders manage their energy.},

abstract = {We present a novel approach for real-time and proactive navigation in crowded environments such as event spaces and urban areas where many people are moving to their destinations simultaneously. Our challenge is to develop a real-time navigation system that enables movements of entire groups to be efficiently guided without causing congestion by making near-future predictions of people flow. Our approach tries to detect future congestion by using a spatio-temporal statistical method that predicts people flow. When future congestion is detected, our approach creates an optimal navigation plan based on "what-if" simulations, which accounts for the effect of total people flow change caused by navigation. We experimentally compare the spatio-temporal statistical method with the conventional matrix factorization based approach using a real data set. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation approach by computer simulation using artificial people-flow data.},

abstract = {Residential appliance scheduling is considered as a promising energy saving technique with significant commercial potential, by introducing ubiquitous computing techniques into home energy management to monitor, control and optimize the operation of appliances. The shortages of user preference and appliance characteristic are two big challenges for the scheduling to satisfy users' requirements. In this paper, we propose an appliance classification method, by introducing the shift-ability of demand and load. The historical operations of various appliances are identified to determine whether the demands of user could be shifted. The electrical consumption is analyzed to estimate the parameters of appliances. The classification results are applied to guide the personalized scheduling strategy generation, integrated with dynamic electricity price.},

abstract = {The last decade has seen a considerable increase in the number of sensors we interact with on a daily basis. However, it is not always possible for a single sensing system to capture the complete story. While statically mounted infrastructure sensors typically capture the what, where, how much etc aspects of a detected event, e.g. (what appliance was used, how much energy did it consume), they do not always answer the who question. On the other hand, the advent of wearables has helped answer the what and who aspects - e.g. (who used the appliance). Fusing such sensor streams that observe the same event but different attributes of it, opens up many interesting applications. In this paper, we present a globally optimal data fusion algorithm for such pairs of systems, and show why traditional bipartite algorithms do not work. We evaluate our algorithm against two greedy baselines and show that our algorithm has lesser variance in the presence of time skew, false positives and false negatives.},

Generally, these accidents will occur at blind corners where pedestrians have difficulty to see them. In the cities, more effective and smart way for decreasing the accident is expected. We proposed a system that warns with the calls of smartphone for both the pedestrian and people who ride on the bicycle on the corner if they approach and expect danger of collision. The system we proposed and have implemented uses two-way communication method that is provided by the GPS location information commonly installed within the smartphones. In this paper, we will describe the purpose, design and implementation, and show the experimental results and discussion of the future vision.},

These kinds of interactive public displays make interaction between people and digital public displays.

In this paper, we tried to explore the relation between environmental information and user's interaction by using interactive public display application. From the result of field study, we discuss about what makes people to motivate people to action and how to frame user models.},

In many cases, however, those data are not easily accessible from a computer program due to the lack of APIs to fetch them. In this paper, to cope with this problem, we propose an architecture for discovering, excavating, and streaming the entombed web contents (EWC). This architecture, called Sensorizer, leverages crowd sourcing for accurate EWC discovery, periodic web scraping with a headless browser for excavation from dynamic web pages, and a standardized communication protocol (XMPP) for data streaming to wide variety of applications.},

To make cities more comfortable to live, it is necessary for municipality to collect and reflect citizens' demands in their administrative works. MinaQn enables city officers to make various questionnaire to citizen easily, and citizen can answer the questionnaire with their location information through any devices by using WEB interface. The answers from citizen are collected as sensor data with unified format and protocol, so that the data can be shared and used for various applications. We designed and implemented MinaQn with web and XMPP technology, and carried out a two weeks experiment in corporation with 3 cities in Japan. Based on the experiment, we measured the effectiveness of MinaQn with qualitative and quantitative data. In addition, we also evaluated how citizens consider about providing their location information to the administrative works of the cities.},

abstract = {Technology development produces terabytes of data generated by human activity in space and time. This enormous amount of data often called big data becomes crucial for delivering new insights to decision makers. It contains behavioral information on different types of human activity influenced by many external factors such as geographic information and weather forecast. Early recognition and prediction of those human behaviors are of great importance in many societal applications like health-care, risk management and urban planning, etc. In this paper, we investigate relevant geographical areas based on their categories of human activities (i.e., working and shopping) in order to understand human-environmental relationships. We use spectral clustering approach followed by k-means algorithm based on TF/IDF cosine similarity metric. We evaluate the quality of the relevant area clusters with a use of silhouette coefficients which are estimated based on the similarities of the mobile communication activity temporal patterns. The area clusters are further used to explain typical or exceptional communication activities. We demonstrate our study using a real dataset containing 1 million Call Detailed Records. This type of analysis and application is important for discovering hidden relationships and unknown correlations.},
