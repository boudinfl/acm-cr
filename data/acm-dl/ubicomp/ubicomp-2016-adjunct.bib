abstract = {Large scale information sharing can become a concern in terms of privacy which often causes abusive usage of information. We look at photo sharing in facebook which has become source of abusive usage when users are not aware privacy issues. A software level system can explore the user requirements and play a role on presenting data in ways approved by users. The concept of sensing at software level is presented in our system named Softsense.},

To this end, we conducted a couple of initial user tests, exploring if live-streaming runs on popular streaming sites can be engaging for the audience. To make the streams more immersive, we experiment with 360 degree and third person view. We present and evaluate an initial hardware setup for 360-degree video streaming running stories.},

abstract = {Smartphone usage is a hot topic in pervasive computing due to their popularity and personal aspect. We present our initial results from analyzing how individual differences, such as gender and age, affect smartphone usage. The dataset comes from a large scale longitudinal study, the Menthal project. We select a sample of 30, 677 participants, from which 16, 147 are males and 14, 523 are females, with a median age of 21 years. These have been tracked for at least 28 days and they have submitted their demographic data through a questionnaire. The ongoing experiment has been started in January 2014 and we have used our own mobile data collection and analysis framework. Females use smartphones for longer periods than males, with a daily mean of 166.78 minutes vs. 154.26 minutes. Younger participants use their phones longer and usage is directed towards entertainment and social interactions through specialized apps. Older participants use it less and mainly for getting information or using it as a classic phone.},

The system is low-power, modular, performs auto-calibration, can track any WiFi-enabled device and can be used for other applications alongside indoor positioning.},

To analyze these data collections, data analytics algorithms should be combined with reporting tools for discovering critical conditions and informing citizens and municipality actors. This paper proposes a new data mining engine to discover air quality patterns from air pollution-related data. This class of patterns includes many established patterns proposed in the data mining literature. In this study, we focused on a specific type of patterns, namely the frequent weighted itemsets, to identify combinations of pollutants that are, on average, in a critical condition. To show the usefulness of the proposed approach, the proposed engine was tested on real data acquired in a major Italian city.},

While, for many applications, recognition methods are faced with simultaneously dynamic changes in feature dimension, activity class and data distribution. Existing approaches mainly handle at most one of these three challenges, which significantly affects their performance. In this paper, we propose an Opportunistic Computing model for wEarable Activity recognitioN (OCEAN); by fusing random mapping, fuzzy clustering, and weight updating techniques, OCEAN can online adaptively adjust Single-hidden Layer Feedforward neural network's connection, structure and weight in a coherent manner. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that OCEAN improves the recognition accuracy by 5% to 15% compared to traditional approaches towards dynamic changes.},

abstract = {Touchscreens on mobile devices allow intuitive interactions through haptic communication, but their limited workspace confines user experiences. In this extended abstract, we introduce vTrack, a virtual trackpad interface that tracks user input on any surface near the mobile device and extends the range of interaction over the touchscreen. The system adopts the acoustic signal as the main medium used for the interaction, which can be handled without expensive sensors or additional resources on mobile devices. By leveraging a multi-channel microphone array on the receiving device, we build a fingerprint-based localization model using various cues, such as time difference of arrival, angle of arrival, and spectral power level of the audio signal. The technique integrates the frequency difference of arrival incurred by the Doppler shift to track the sound source in motion. Our experiments show that vTrack achieves millimeter-level granularity: 1.5mm of localization error on average in moving sound source scenario.},

abstract = {Recently several major industry players have introduced smart home personal assistants to the Internet of Things market. However, these products are often little more than voice interfaces to device control apps. More focus is needed on supporting the high-level applications and goals that end users express in natural language. In this preliminary work, we collect and analyze over 1,600 utterances from nontechnical end users encompassing a variety of smart home interactions. We find that given the right context, end users voluntarily use computational language in response to open-ended prompts. From these commands and queries, we extract the computational structures and the entities, actions, and conditions that end users employ when interacting with the home. Our preliminary results suggest a path forward for end-to-end architectures that automatically map natural language utterances to executable smart home programs. We hope to help bring natural language interfaces for the home into alignment with end users' mental models.},

It uses this information together with knowledge stored in an ontology to recommend actions that improve the environment quality. Experimental evaluation showed that the system objectively significantly improves the T-H-C parameters, and that the occupants consider its recommendations subjectively appropriate.},

Such behaviour is very challenging to model as people's body movements during speech vary greatly. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a transfer learning approach has been considered in the context of speaking status detection using a single body worn accelerometer. We show that by transferring knowledge across subjects, competitive performance scores compared to a person dependent training can be obtained.},

We then evaluated our implemented recommender algorithm at a public event.

MetroEye leverages smartphone sensors to record ambient contextual features, and infers the state of passengers (including stop, running, and interchange) during a metro trip using a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model. MetroEye further provides arrival alarm services based on individual passenger state, and aggregates crowdsourced interchange durations to guide passengers for intelligent metro trip planning. Experimental results within 6 months across over 14 subway trains in 3 major cities demonstrate that MetroEye outperforms the state-of-the-art.},

abstract = {Eco-Maps, diagrammatic assessments of family relationships, are used by social workers in individual and family contact to understand the subjective experiences of both supportive and disruptive family, friendship, and community relationships. In this paper we present the first phase of the development of the People in my Life app. We have developed a tangible version of Eco-Maps to unlock the potential of eco-maps in the digital domain and to enhance social work practice with children and young people. The central idea is to develop an improved, technology-based means to assess relationships that supports and enhances social work practice and foregrounds children and young people's experiences. In particular, the project has three aims: (a) to collaboratively develop with social workers an application for creating eco-maps using touch-screens with tangible objects, (b) to test its usability with children, in the first instance, and (c) to provide a first exploration of the psychometric properties of parameters captured by the app.},

Our results show that AIR obtains much higher accuracy in recognizing activity than approaches that rely primarily on accelerometers. Moreover, AIR has good generalization ability when applying recognition model to new users.},

The people on the monitoring side wanted the monitoring system to allow them to monitor in detail. Conversely, it was observed for the people being monitored that the more detailed the monitoring, the greater the feelings of being surveilled intrusively. Evaluation experiments were performed using the location data of three people in different living areas. The results of the experiments show that it is possible to control the levels of monitoring and privacy protection without being affected by the shape of a living area by adjusting the quantization level of location information. Furthermore, it became clear that the granularity of location information satisfying the people on the monitored side and the monitoring side is different.},

In Virtual Reality, an infrared (IR) camera is used for hand tracking, and direct manipulation can be accomplished by using hands. Additionally, wearable devices have also attracted attention because of their portability. We have developed a method based on the use of a wearable device to estimate the joint angle, which can be determined using the amplitude of vibration. However, the joint angle, which can be estimated, is limited to particular joints. Therefore, our proposed method determines the hand pose based on active bone-conducted sound sensing toward intuitive user interfaces. We employed the power spectral density as a feature, thereby enabling the hand pose to be classified with a support vector machine. We confirmed the recognition accuracy and the feasibility of our proposed method through evaluation experiments.},

Even though most people realize that this activity is risky and should be avoided, more than a few continue to engage in it. Since eradicating TWW appears difficult, using a safe-walking support system is an alternative to reduce accidents during TWW. In this paper, we first identify a TWW risk based on our preliminary experimental results, and then propose safe-walking support system. For our evaluation, we compared the collision rates among four risk assessment algorithms and three typical walking situations in an experiment and collected subjective impressions from participants by questionnaires. The observed collision rate was 12.5% with no system support, 10.8% with a typical simple system, and 6.7 at best with our proposed systems. From our questionnaire results, the proposed system's notification mechanism is easier to understand than the conventional system's.},

However, it is difficult to collect such trajectory data from mobile phone users due to the high cost of continuously pinpointing the mobile phones' explicit locations. In this poster, we propose a method for mining trajectory patterns from cell-id trajectory data without explicit location information by exploiting handoff features. Experiment results based on real datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Recently, available studies suggest that reminiscence activity can improve cognitive functions and/or mood of people with dementia (PwD). Most current approaches focus on two types: using physical items (e.g. their photos, belonging objects), or using technology (e.g. tablet application). Physical item solutions are associated with more effort as each individual needs their own set of items. Technology solutions are promising but even a device with three buttons may be too complicated for people with moderate-severe dementia [1]. They usually need support to use the application. Based on contextual design, we came up with a chest of drawers using tangible user interface and Ubicomp technologies that can be interactive and adaptive. This approach also lets PwD do reminiscence activity by themselves, consequently enhance their autonomy, independent, and quality of life.},

To further figure out how the contributors of UbiComp collaborate with each other, we first construct a collaboration network based on 765 UbiComp papers published since 1999. Afterwards, to examine the patterns of collaborations, a PCA-based time series segmentation scheme is proposed, which suggests 2009 as a break point. By applying comparative analysis, we then investigate the collaboration evolution in different periods and propose a new method to quantify the actual effect of each paper. Experimental results reveal the existence of four types of collaboration patterns and proved that, as UbiComp getting more collaborative, long-term collaboration is more inclined to facilitate high quality achievements.},

Though methods of beautiful gait evaluation are proposed in previous works by utilizing 3D motion capture and force plates, they are not suitable for daily monitoring of beautiful gait. From this viewpoint, we propose a new method to estimate beautiful gait by utilizing machine learning classifiers with only one accelerometer on the body (chest, waist, or wrist). We conducted an experiment to verify the accuracy of our method with 41 subjects. Each subject wore accelerometers and walked on a straight path whose length was about 10 m 6 times. The accuracy of estimation in total 246 trials was calculated by two kinds of cross validation; leave-one-out cross validation and 41-fold cross validation. The former accuracy is 80.1% (chest), 82.1% (waist), and 82.9% (wrist). The latter accuracy is 73.2% (chest), 78.0% (waist), and 58.1% (wrist).

Hence, a user must determine specific destinations and it makes hard to create an itinerary because he/she does not know where, when and what he/she can experience. We have developed a travel planning system for drivers called "Xnavi" that takes into account experience flows. Xnavi extracts keywords related to the travel area using natural language processing based on the TFIDF method and suggests appropriate combinations of keywords for the driver as experience flows using association analysis based on driving histories. We created a prototype system in which a tourist create an itinerary by selecting experience flows. The results of a user study show that the planning time was significantly shortened and the average satisfaction was increased when using this prototype in contrast to examining the area on his/her own.},

Based on this observation, we propose an activeness recognition method by accumulating information on "rare sounds" extracted by unsupervised learning techniques. Also, to acquire robustness for rare environmental noises such as rain drops, the proposed method extracts "variety of rare sound" (VoRS) measures for activeness recognition. The experimental result shows the robustness of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Current smartphones and smartwatches come equipped with a variety of sensors, from light sensor and inertial sensors to radio interfaces, enabling applications running on these devices to make sense of their surrounding environment. Rather than using sensors independently, combining their sensing capabilities facilitates more interesting and complex applications to emerge (e.g., user activity recognition). But differences between sensors ranging from sampling rate to data generation model (event triggered or continuous sampling) make integration of sensor streams challenging. Here we investigate the opportunity to use deep learning to perform this integration of sensor data from multiple sensors. The intuition is that neural networks can identify nonintuitive features largely from cross-sensor correlations which can result in a more accurate estimation. Initial results with a variant of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), show better performance with this new approach compared to classic solutions.},

Users share information not only through private messages, but also over public available services or in particular applications contributing to data collection projects. On one hand, sensors in modern smartphones enable us to collect a large amount of information without the need to directly interact with the user. On the other hand, users actively share all kinds of information in social networks. However, it is still challenging to motivate a large number of people to participate in collecting data when active contribution is needed. This is particularly critical, when the needed information is of personal nature. In this work, we discuss four approaches to actively encourage users to provide information. Furthermore, we present first results of an online survey evaluating which of the approaches would be appreciated by users to contribute to a health data collection.},

Top-tier training is only found in few locations around the world, and comes at an exceptional price. In this context, remote education might represent an affordable alternative: it would allow skilled dance teachers to connect with a wider audience. Although prior research has begun to develop technologies for dancers, there is no consensus on the type of feedback that should be provided to allow remote ballet learning. We prototyped four variations of a technologically simulated mirror to evaluate different combinations of feedback commonly used in traditional ballet settings. Our preliminary results suggest that systems for remote ballet learning should provide combinations of visual, verbal, value, and corrective feedback.},

In the experiment described a physically demanding construction task is completed by a team of 4 volunteers. The task, to build a large video wall, requires communication, coordination, and physical collaboration between group members. Minimal outside assistance is provided to better reflect the ad-hoc and loosely structured nature of real-world construction tasks. On-body inertial measurement units (IMU) record each subject's head and arm movements; a wearable eye-tracker records gaze and ego-centric video; and audio is recorded from each person's head and dominant arm. A first look at the data reveals promising correlations between, for example, the movement patterns of two people carrying a heavy object. Also revealed are clues on how complementary information from different sensor types, such as sound and vision, might further aid collaboration recognition.},

For example, hiking, biking, mountaineering and climbing activities require orientation and wayfinding at certain points to certain degrees. With the rise of personal GPS devices, numerous navigation apps now exist that are tailored to the specific needs of outdoor enthusiasts. Nevertheless, they all have the common problem, that they require the users to "store" the mobile device in their pockets to have the "hands free" for interaction. While wearable devices such as smartwatches overcome this problem, they have the disadvantage that they often offer very small screen space.

abstract = {Recently, smartphones with built-in sensors are exploited to detect human activities. Since sensing human activities may exhaust energy of a smartphone, this work brings up the concept of "activity sense organs" to the uprising smartphone sensing paradigm. As the human sense organs are the most important sensors to perceive real-world information, this work identifies the most important sensors to perceive a particular human activity based on the "quality of the features" contributed by sensors. To optimize the energy usage of activity sensing, we exploit the importance of sensors to profile the duty-cycles of sensors for activity detection. Specifically, a smartphone will operate in a duty-cycled sensing mode, where sensors in the activity sense organs will collect data at the higher sampling rate than those sensors not in the activity sense organs. We design a knowledge lifecycle to find out the activity sense organs, profile the sensing modes of activity detection, and adjust the sensing mode for real-time activity detection. The experimental results indicate that the activity sense organs provide sufficient information for activity detection.},

However, due to the high uncertainty of human mobility patterns, it is hard to identify on-site users while social event happens. In this paper, we propose a F&gt;used fEature Gaussian prOcess Rgression (FEGOR) model, which employs three features from online social networks: mobility influence, content similarity, and social relationship to estimate the distance between user and social event, based on which, we could accomplish the problem of identifying the on-site users. Experiment results on a real-world Twitter dataset demonstrate our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

Recently, many researchers have worked on event summarization from this kind of data. However, those works fail to present the dynamic evolution of the event and characterize the rich correlations among posts. To this end, we propose a multi-layered model for social event characterization. Based on this model, an evolutionary and multi-clue-based approach is adopted for fine-grained event summary, and a progressively multi-layer fusion approach is utilized to generate the storyline to summarize the event.

We propose a system that (1) incorporates the gaze signal and the egocentric camera of the eye tracker to identify the objects the user focuses at; (2) employs object classification based on deep learning which we recompiled for our purposes on a GPU-based image classification server; (3) detects whether the user actually draws attention to that object; and (4) combines these modules for constructing episodic memories of egocentric events in real-time.},

Protobject works as a multipurpose camera-based sensor able to recognize any visually observable properties of stationary objects around us (e.g. white goods, lights, windows, curtains).

The most important features of the sensor are: low power and computational requirements in comparison to vision based gesture recognition systems and that it is a septic safe interface.

abstract = {Energy harvesting (EH) is a key technology for the autonomous operation of smart devices. However, designing a system based on energy harvesting is much more difficult than designing battery-powered systems. The system has to weigh the balance between harvested energy and consumed energy, while taking into account various uncertainties in the actual environment. In order to achieve this requirement, it is necessary to precisely refine and integrate hardware modules and software structures; however, it is still difficult for non-experts to design such a system from scratch. In this paper, we propose PLEH, a PLanning simulation tool for Energy Harvesting applications, which will facilitate in determining the most relevant hardware modules and the software structure. PLEH estimates energy consumption varying over time based on our abstract EH application model. We show three usage scenarios that are common to novice developers of EH applications.},

To overcome the uncertainties and risks associated with a purely best-effort, opportunistic model of such crowd-sourcing, we advocate a more centrally-coordinated approach, that (a) takes into account the predicted movement paths of workers and (b) factors in typical human behavioral responses to various incentives and deadlines. To experimentally tackle these challenges, we design, develop and experiment with a real-world mobile crowd-tasking platform on an urban campus in Singapore.

abstract = {WiFi enabled smartphones regularly send probe request messages to actively discover nearby access points. Previously, these probes have been exploited to understand users' mobility patterns and were also identified to be a privacy threat. To highlight the increased threats to user's privacy, we aim to identify the user behavior by characterizing the changes in probe patterns, which occur as an effect of user's smartphone usage. In this demo, we developed a browser based interactive front-end client, with a Node JS backend server, to interact with the sniffing hardware and to display realtime packets visualization with smartphone screen state predictions. We were able to detect the screen ON and OFF states by analyzing the probe patterns using a Decision-Tree classifier with accuracy ranging from 93% to 100% on specific smartphone models.},

abstract = {The ongoing development of industrial manufacturing towards more individualization and smaller lot sizes opens up a new range of challenges. Not only do the processes in the factories need adaptation, but the workers need more support as well. We showcase a system that is able to address both aspects: an instrumentation of a manual workplace provides direct feedback for planning engineers, while at the same time acquiring data that is helpful for giving the worker feedback. Within this demo we focus on bi-manual picking and assembly processes observed by a lightweight optical recognition system enhanced by ultrasonic sensors, but also give an outlook on other possible modules.},

Efficient resource usage between the devices worn by the same person has not yet been effectively addressed by the current wearable applications. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of application function virtualization by utilizing common capabilities of multiple wearables on the body through a cross-platform Android application - AFit. AFit is developed in a way that it can opportunistically leverage the resources of smartphone, smartwatch and smartglass depending on the context of the user, which is user activity. In this demonstration, AFit shows that it is possible to adaptively select the device to track the user movement for fitness tracking, rather than using randomly selected device or all devices, utilizing the common sensor of accelerometer on all devices.},

However, with the ever growing number of networked smart things in our home, office and public environments it becomes more and more important to practically explore the opportunities that these device ecologies can potentially offer in the future. With meSchup we present an IoT prototyping platform that drastically reduces the effort and time for the creation and exploration of smart multi-device environments. We show a novel interaction script approach that interweaves arbitrary devices in real time and introduce interactive programming by demonstrations features integrated in a single web based IDE. We finally illustrate three exemplary use cases that indicate the wide range of possible applications.},

Counter-intuitively, when a subject is moving closer to the LoS, the performance of respiration sensing is not always getting better. In fact, the detectable and undetectable regions are determined by the Fresnel zone model based theory developed in [7].},

COSMS is a system acquiring physiological information continuously and unconsciously through ordinary equipment of a laptop such as in-camera and mouse. By using a laptop which embeds a depth camera, COSMS monitors a user's vital information such as heart rate, face expression, eye gazing as well as mouse movement and typing amount. In addition, we embed sensors into a mouse to monitor an environmental stress via temperature and humidity of user hand.},

We determine to which extent an object of interest, observed by a user, intersects with each region of the underlying visual field model. The results are weighted (thereby considering the visual acuity in each visual field) to determine the total visibility of the object. As a proof of concept, we exemplify the proposed model in a virtual reality application which incorporates a head-mounted display with integrated eye tracking functionality. In this context, we implement several proactive system behaviors including contextual information presentation with an adaptive level of detail and attention guidance; the latter is implemented by detecting visual acuity limitations or attention drifts.},

As a user moves through a room to locate a target item, our system shows relative distances to the target item and images of items on the way to the target. At the same time, the system scans RFID tags nearby and captures images for scanned RFID-tagged objects. This information is accumulated in a database and is accessible for future item location activities. Since all information was gathered during users' searching activities, the proposed system does not require users' effort for managing and registering tags. We asked 10 users to compare our method with the conventional method, which shows RSSI of the target item, of searching for the target item. The results suggest that our method is effective for location target RFID-tagged items.},

abstract = {We present in this paper, our initial attempt in wireless power transfer for powering up various movable smart objects. Power supply is a core issue for every movable smart object. Two classical solutions to power such devices are either to plug the device or to use batteries. Plugging a movable device restricts its free movement and batteries need frequent replacement once drained. Wireless charging is an alternate solution to overcome these limitations. While state-of-the-art wireless charging solutions remain for smart phones with fixed sizes, we propose in this paper, a guideline for enabling wireless charging for smart objects of arbitrary dimensions, at the space where they are normally used. We validate the proposed guidelines with the help of an office chair as an example.},

Healthy ageing and physical activity has a strong association and ageing has become one of the highly concentrated area of research community in the past decade due to the expected increase in the elderly population. A statistical survey published by European Union (EU) in 2012 shows that the elderly population (over 65 years) of Europe, is expected to increase from 87.5 million to 152.6 million (65.1 million increase) during the period from 2010 to 2016 [1]. Physical inactivity and more sedentary life style can lead towards many chronic and life threatening diseases in older adults such as diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular and other lethal diseases. These damages can be controlled by performing various activities and vigorous exercises in daily life, in addition to medications to promote a healthier lifestyle [2].},

abstract = {The problem domain of my PhD thesis is divided into two parts. First, we introduce position aware systems including the well-known Location-based Services (LBS) and Proximity-based Services (PBS) as subclass of LBS. The study [33] reports that 19% of the world's mobile users already using LBS and the most popular application is the navigation via maps and GPS signal. Furthermore, one in five (22%) of LBS users enrich their social lives by finding friends in the nearby environment. For example, MobiClique [26] alerts users when other users are in physical proximity and share a relationship with them based on profile and friend list. The LBS are based upon the absolute position of an user to answer the question "where we are?". In contrast, PBS are based upon context information to find co-location with other points of interest to answer the question "who are we with?". The goal of LBS and PBS is to improve the users' daily lives by providing a personalized service to enable sharing of location information and location-aware information retrieval. Therefore, the LBS focus on a centralized architecture, the location server acts as Trusted Party (TP) which receives coordinates from the users to provide location-specific information, e.g. nearby friends. Figure 1(a) shows the common LBS architecture consisting of four major entities: mobile devices, global positioning systems, communication networks and service providers [29]. However, the assumption of a TP is questionable [36]. Besides that, most of the LBS use global positioning systems, which limits their functionality to outdoor environments, although people spend the majority of their time indoors [2].},

Mobile networks of wearable connected devices and sensors have the potential to offer data driven personalized support and contextually aware real-time advice that could help people in their everyday lives. My initial research has suggested three key areas for the implementation of such systems: reducing workload, automating extraction of meaningful information, and the communication of insights in an intuitive, timely and emotionally sensitive manner. While there are many technical issues involved with realization, the human factors related to user interaction with personal data will be critical in building systems that motivate users to choose beneficial lifestyle choices, and will therefore be a major focus of my research.},

abstract = {The goal of ubiquitous computing, as first envisioned by Mark Weiser and afterwards pursued and developed by Gregory D. Abowd and Elizabeth D. Mynatt among many others, is to provide the computing service the user needs in the situation, place and configuration she needs it [23, 1]. Human-Computer Interaction in ubiquitous systems should therefore be as natural as possible. This can be achieved by using interaction modes that are perceived as more natural than others, by supporting multimodal interaction and also by implementing context-awareness. One main characteristic of ubiquitous environments is the presence and usage of many different interactive devices. In Weiser's vision, those are for example tabs, pads and boards [23]. Today, smart watches, smartphones, laptops, personal computers and tablets are ubiquitous in our lives. Multi-touch displays and tables, big display walls or screens and many other interactive devices, such as smart glasses, are becoming more common, too. A challenge in ubiquitous computing is to realize the interconnection between these devices, as this is the "key to his vision", described by Ebling &amp; Baker in their assessment of Weiser's vision 20 years after it's first publication [7]. Most of the interactive technologies used today are not out of the box compatible with each other and plug and play usage is not supported.},

Although this usually metaphorically refers to a person's emotional state, there is literal truth in this statement with reference to a person's biological state. The eyes are dynamic and sensitive organs that are connected to the rest of the body via the circulatory and nervous systems. This means that diseases originating from an organ within the body can indirectly affect the eyes. Although the eyes may not be the origin for many such diseases, they are visible to external observers, making them an accessible point of diagnosis. For instance, broken blood vessels in the sclera could indicate a blood clotting disorder or a vitamin K deficiency. Instead of "windows to the soul", the eyes are "sensors to the body" that can be monitored to screen for certain diseases.},

The designers propose a woven textile (as applied in the garment presented) with the capability to illuminate threads in both warp and weft directions. The work described investigates the creation of garments for day-to-day use, which is a use-case probably never considered when developing off-the-shelf electronic components. In developing a new tartan pattern and fabrication technique, the authors respond to the lack of purpose-made electronic components by choosing to evolve tradition into technology. Manufacturing techniques and components for the proposed textile have been carefully considered, researched, and contrasted to previous work by the authors, as well as recent trends in the field of wearable technology. The garment is a component of a tartan pattern generating system which searches the space of all registered tartans in order to find relevant, but yet unregistered tartan color and thread count combinations from a variety of inputs either embedded on the dress, or from a mobile phone.},

A circuit with sensors, actuators and microcontroller was implemented using electronic textiles. Embedded notification outputs are selectable from three modes (visual, audio, haptic) to aid with navigation, guidance through danger zones and triggering a warning alarm for approaching objects outside the range of view of the wearer.While it was important to design and build a functional prototype to demonstrate the potential, another focus was set on garment construction using fashion design principles, to improve usability and user acceptance of interactive workwear in the context of Industry 4.0.},

Inspired by superhero characters, this device has a dark, sleek aesthetic to appeal to a distinctive target audience, vigilantes. A small set of microphones embedded in the mask amplify soft sounds that are then processed and pushed out to a set of speakers. The enhanced audio is supplemented with haptic feedback to indicate the direction of the sound, while embedded NeoPixels provide the same information at a lower resolution for assistants. This device is a self-contained solution uniquely built for the vigilante.},

We (a) present a small-scale mixed-method pilot study in which we explored learning with step trackers; (b) suggest four levels of learning that Personal Informatics tools can foster: data level, routine level, correlational level, and problem-screening level; and (c) discuss how future research can use and extend this initial framework to study what and how people learn with self-tracking technology.},

Our position paper describes a new approach of visualizing such Quantified Self data, in a meaningful and enjoyable way that can give the users personal insights into their own data. The visualization of the information is proposed as an avatar that maps the different activities the user is engaged with, along with each such activity level, as graphical features. An initial prototype (both in terms of graphical design and software architecture) as well as possible future extensions are discussed.},

This is by way of information-based digital tools that help sense and continually monitor various measurable parameters of everyday living. This paper attempts to investigate the potential benefits of using Natural User Interfaces (NUIs) when dealing with these measures. NUIs are understood here as recent innovations in human-computer interaction that attempt to incorporate natural forms of interactivity (with technology and/or information). For QS, these emerging technologies can be of significant value when exploring ways to seamlessly integrate such sensors into the practices of daily life- as also to make sense of the multiple, dynamic and complex data that is obtained from them. When considering constant and continual monitoring for chronic-disease management (usually a long term process) this even becomes a necessary factor for any sustained use and benefit.},

Research will then involve the utilisation of both travel and lifestyle data to identify the points in a person's life at which these habits can be influenced -- namely, the question of whether information provision during times of lifestyle/contextual change can be effective in influencing travel habits. Furthermore, it will involve the analysis of key stressors within the travel context, and how they can be avoided through the provision of appropriate information at the right time. The objectives of this form research involve improving customer experience for the individual through personal optimisation of everyday travel, while also providing train operating companies with a more comprehensive understanding of customer issues.The project will give the academic literature a comprehensive understanding of the psychological motivations, and situational factors that influence the daily commuter; thus providing a more in-depth understanding of how the concept of digital identity can be used to understand the life of a typical railway traveller.},

abstract = {The lifelogging activity enables a user, the lifelogger, to passively capture multimodal records from a first-person perspective and ultimately create a visual diary encompassing every possible aspect of her life with unprecedented details. In recent years it has gained popularity among different groups of users. However, the possibility of ubiquitous presence of lifelogging devices especially in private spheres has raised serious concerns with respect to personal privacy. Different practitioners and active researchers in the field of lifelogging have analysed the issue of privacy in lifelogging and proposed different mitigation strategies. However, none of the existing works has considered a well-defined privacy threat model in the domain of lifelogging. Without a proper threat model, any analysis and discussion of privacy threats in lifelogging remains incomplete. In this paper we aim to fill in this gap by introducing a first-ever privacy threat model identifying several threats with respect to lifelogging. We believe that the introduced threat model will be an essential tool and will act as the basis for any further research within this domain.},

abstract = {In Personal Informatics (PI) systems, users can obtain information about themselves and the way they live their lives. Such data can be difficult to interpret: what constitutes a high value for one person may be normal for another. And what if the data does not match the user's self-image? Our study shows that participants' interpretations of feedback about their stress level were biased by their expectations of what the graph 'should' show. Nevertheless, participants were susceptible to value interpretations of their data suggested by the visualization. This latter finding may be problematic if the standardized interpretation suggested by such a system is not accurate for the individual user in question. We therefore argue that value interpretations of PI data should be personalized and future designs of PI data visualizations should incorporate ambiguity and visualize uncertainty.},

abstract = {This position paper argues that self-tracking data can enrich a pre-fitting process of hearing aids. It is argued that hearing loss consist of three parts. Tonal sensitivity, signal to-noise-sensitivity, and cognitive capabilities which can be assessed by using smartphones. Combining this with contextual data and subjective data (perceived fatigue for example), could generated a hearing profile for the end user. This could be used for continuous fitting based on user feedback of the hearing instruments at a later point in time.We suggest, that pre-fitting and a continuous process could create a paradigm shift empowering and transforming the user into an essential part of the solution, through increased awareness and inclusion. The end result could be a potentially better fitting, and a better hearing experience for the individual.},

Towards this, we present our initial work to generating temporal rules that capture the user's dominant call response behavior at various times of the day and days of the week, utilizing phone call log. Our preliminary experimental results on real datasets show that context information in call log can be used to model individual's phone call response behavior with high accuracy.},

abstract = {The recent progress of IoT technologies, including broad penetration of smart appliances such as remotely controllable lights, thermostats and cameras, have changed the way we interact with the appliances in our homes and perform our daily activities. However, the significant heterogeneity in the emerging IoT devices has led to fragmented smart-home systems in which each single appliance vendor provides proprietary solution for appliance specific connectivity and user experience. One of the desired solutions in smart-home systems is to have a unified smartphone app that can control any arbitrary IoT appliances. In this extended abstract we focus on the design of such an app only from the user interaction viewpoint. In particular, we present SPOT app, a smartphone-based platform for multi-vendor smart-home appliances, that features an adaptive and device-agnostic user interface enabled by a novel device driver mechanism. To validate the flexibility and feasibility of our design, we have built a SPOT prototype based on 8 real IoT devices and present the quality of generating such adaptive graphical user interface by the measure of screen smoothness in the prototyped android app.},

abstract = {The energy drivers use to charge their Electric Vehicles (EVs) comes from various sources. Of those, some are renewable green energy sources such as solar photovoltaic systems (SolarPV) and home storage battery whilst some are called brown sources such as gas turbine, coal and oil. To analyse the behaviour of EV drivers as to how they use household green and brown energy, separating the mix is a necessity. This paper argues that the Internet of Things (IoT) can be helpful in achieving that goal and demonstrates a pilot study showing the process of separating the green and brown energy from the EV charging.},

abstract = {Electronic textiles become smart by embedding circuits and sensors which offer some passive or active capabilities. Smart textiles become intelligent due to their computational abilities allowing awareness of their environment, extract input data from it, and consequently demonstrate untaught behaviours. Intelligent systems require machine intelligence through artificial intelligence algorithms to complete these input data manipulations. However, producing intelligent electronic textiles is a current research challenge. Hypothesising their eventuality and ubiquity, challenges such as remote communication, power generation, data processing, security, and ethics arise. In what remains we focus on the ethical implications and approaches to risk mitigation.},

Here, we report a tripartite study design that aims at comparing visual, auditory and movement-related characteristics of 11 carefully designed zoomorphic prototypes. First, participants are shown different tasks and are asked to propose suitable prototype actions to carry out each of them -- and vice versa. Then, participants' responses to videos of pre-designed biomimicry patterns of the zoomorphs in a Wizard-of-Oz desktop setup will be captured. Lastly, a subsequent repertory grid interview allows us to capture the users' understanding of the zoomorphs through eliciting users' constructs about them. The findings contribute to the expansion of the design space for autonomous desktop companions.},

We understand autonomous vehicles as moving embodied agents; ubicomp systems whose behavior can be observed in the real world. The vehicles' ability to sense the outside world is improving rapidly but they lack human abilities to sense and interpret the subtle cues of other road users. Nevertheless, other road users may perceive them as acting intelligently when encountering them in traffic. The autonomous vehicle becomes part of a complex socio-technical system and has to interact with all these actors in a socially accepted manner.

They provide however signals related to more complex and subtle human behaviours which will enable next-generation human-oriented computing in scenarios of high societal value. This requires large scale human activity corpuses and improved methods to recognise activities and their context. This workshop deals with the challenges of designing reproducible experimental setups, running large-scale dataset collection campaigns, designing robust activity and context recognition methods and evaluating systems in the real world. As a special topic, we wish to reflect on the challenges and approaches to recognise activities outside of a pre-defined set to achieve an open-ended activity and context awareness. Following the success of previous years, this workshop is the place to share experiences on human activity corpus and their applications and to discuss the future of activity sensing, in particular towards open-ended contextual intelligence.},

The pedestrian sensing data is collected. The number of our prepared route pattern is 5. Over two days, we collected the sensing data of 105 subjects. The total number of collected pedestrian sensing data was 343. After removing faulty data, this number was 241 and the number of unique subjects was 103. Sensor types are accelerometer, gyro, magnetic, and air pressure. We, PDR Challenge organizers, provide the corpus as UbiComp/ISWC 2015 PDR Challenge Corpus.

However, most of the existing research on human activity recognition is based on a small number of subjects, and lab-created-data. To overcome this problem, we hold HASC Challenge as a technical challenge to collect the data for activity recognition. In addition to HASC Challenge, we collected indoor pedestrian sensing data of 107 people with a balance of gender and age (HASC-IPSC). Through these data collection, we gathered 111,968 sensor files of 510 subjects. For the convenience of the future researchers in this field, we combined them as a single corpus named HASC-PAC2016 and make it public. Baseline recognition result of HASC-PAC2016 segmented data is 73.4% accuracy for overall, 81.4% for limited by terminal position, and 85.1% with file-based recognition. For sequence data, we only get 73.4% even for limited subjects. This shows we need further research of activity recognition using HASC-PAC2016.},

Especially for time-series data, which is common in Activity Recognition, synchronizing several independently recorded sensors is challenging. Adding second level evidence, like video recordings from multiple angles and time-coded annotations, further complicates the matter of curating such data.A possible alternative is to make use of standardized multi-media formats. Sensor data can be encoded in audio format, and time-coded information, like annotations, as sub-titles. Video data can be added easily. All this media can be merged into a single container file, which makes the issue of synchronization explicit. The incurred performance overhead by this encoding is shown to be negligible and compression can be applied to optimize storage and transmission overhead.},

Objects that provide functional utility to their user, also indicate the type of activity that their user is doing. For example, the use of a hair dryer indicates that its user is grooming their hair. In this paper, we discuss an approach to sense the objects that the person interacts with, using only a single wearable device on the wrist of the person. Wearable devices typically have an IMU sensor, which can sense several aspects of the person's hand gestures, such as acceleration, and orientation. We collect a dataset of 17 different object interaction gestures using 5 participants in a test home. We evaluate the object gestures using supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches. Our study reveals that we can recognize object interactions with 83-91% accuracy in the supervised approach, and 58-66% accuracy in the unsupervised approach.},

Implicit Positioning adapts to its user by automatically finding, learning, and recognizing patterns in data from a smartphone's compass sensor. These patterns model characteristics of the areas the person walked through, such as the direction the person headed, and can be understood as Implicit Positions. Implicit Positioning neither relies on user feedback nor on additional infrastructure, digital maps or war-driving. All the person needs to do is carry a smartphone. To evaluate our approach, we collected data from smartphones carried by a test person in different positions. The test person covered a distance of 17.4 km in two different buildings.

However, because of the resources to collect, process and analyze data, it remains difficult to obtain large data sets for study. In an attempt to alleviate this problem, researchers have recently used mobile sensing, however this technique is currently only able to detect either stationary or moving crowds with questionable accuracy. In this work we present a system for detecting stationary interactions inside crowds using the Received Signal Strength Indicator of Bluetooth Smart (BLE) sensor, combined with the Motion Activity of each device. By utilizing Apple's iBeacon™ implementation of Bluetooth Smart, we are able to detect the proximity of users carrying a smartphone in their pocket. We then use an algorithm based on graph theory to predict interactions inside the crowd and verify our findings using video footage as ground truth. Our approach is particularly beneficial to the design and implementation of crowd behavior analytics, design of influence strategies, and algorithms for crowd reconfiguration.},

abstract = {In recent years, the study of location prediction has received heightened attention due to its applications in LBS and other areas. However, most of the techniques and subsequent conclusions drawn from previous research works are specific to the data used in the study. For instance, resolution of location data and inclusion of external data (e.g., from social networks) may limit application of previous techniques to new situations. Therefore, we explore ways of enhancing location prediction techniques which leverage big data without the need for external data sources. To this end, we study a large CDR dataset with more than 3.5 billion calls from a leading cellular network provider in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The research question we tackle is how we can leverage big data to enhance performance of location predictors? Based on spatio-temporal analysis of call activity, we devise a scheme to compute prior probabilities from cell call activity. With this reasoning, we develop an enhanced Bayes predictor which uses a distance threshold and the users' regular location to improve generation of prior probabilities. Experimental results show that overall the enhanced Bayes predictor improves accuracy by 17 percentage points.},

This study main goal is to estimate firefighters' pollutants inhalation when in operational scenarios by combining environmental and physiological information. Both exposures to CO (carbon monoxide) and physiological data, such as ECG (electrocardiogram), HR (Heart Rate) and body temperature, were monitored during firefighters' activities in experimental forest fire. From the QRS complex of ECG the ECG-derived respiration (EDR) was estimated and convoluted with pollutants concentration to estimate individual smoke inhalation. The analysis of smoke inhalations allowed to detect extensive exposures and to identify critical situations namely risk of faint due to smoke intoxication. Our results support the usefulness of continuous monitoring of both physiological and environmental information to prevent and detect hazardous situations while firefighters are in operational scenario like forest fires. The results encourage the development of a decision support system to be applied in real-time during firefighting scenarios.},

abstract = {Recognition of activities of daily living (ADLs) performed in smart homes proved to be very effective when the interaction of the inhabitant with household items is considered. Analyzing how objects are manipulated can be particularly useful, in combination with other sensor data, to detect anomalies in performing ADLs, and hence to support early diagnosis of cognitive impairments for elderly people. Recent improvements in sensing technologies can overcome several limitations of the existing techniques to detect object manipulations, often based on RFID, wearable sensors and/or computer vision methods. In this work we propose an unobtrusive solution which shifts all the monitoring burden at the objects side. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of using tiny BLE beacons equipped with accelerometer and temperature sensors attached to everyday objects. We adopt statistical methods to analyze in realtime the accelerometer data coming from the objects, with the purpose of detecting specific manipulations performed by seniors in their homes. We describe our technique and we present the preliminary results obtained by evaluating the method on a real dataset. The results indicate the potential utility of the method in enriching ADLs and abnormal behaviors recognition systems, by providing detailed information about object manipulations.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition plays a significant role in enabling pervasive applications as it abstracts low-level noisy sensor data into high-level human activities, which applications can respond to. In this paper, we identify a new research question in activity recognition -- discovering and learning unknown activities that have not been pre-defined or observed. As pervasive systems intend to be deployed in a real-world environment for a long period of time, it is infeasible, to expect that users will only perform a set of pre-defined activities. Users might perform the same activities in a different manner, or perform a new type of activity. Failing to detect or update the activity model to incorporate new patterns or activities will outdate the model and result in unsatisfactory service delivery. To address this question, we explore the solution space and propose an estimation-based approach to not only discover and learn new activities over time, but also benefit from no need to store any historic sensor data.},

abstract = {This paper describes the hardware acceleration of various feature calculation functions used in activity recognition. In this work we have used a large scale sensing matrix which recognizes and counts gym exercises. Human activity is played on pressure matrix and the sensor data is sent to computer using a wired protocol for further processing. The recorded data from matrix is huge making it impractical to process on a smart phone. We propose a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) based processing methodology which not only accelerates sensing data processing but also reduces the size of 2D sensor data matrix to 10 features. The resultant feature set can be transferred using wireless medium to a smart phone or other processing unit where the classification can be done. Our system takes a matrix of arbitrary size and output a 'features' set for each matrix frame. We used HLS (High Level Synthesis), an approach to write algorithm for FPGA using SystemC/C/C++ instead of traditional VHDL/Verilog. Results show promising improvement in processing time as compared to Matlab. Since the size of data is reduced, wireless medium can be use to transmit data. Additionally, the development time for FPGA designs is greatly reduced due to the usage of an abstracted high level synthesis approach. This system is currently developed for pressure sensing system but this strategy can be applied to other sensing application like temperature sensor grid.},

abstract = {Annotating activity recognition datasets is a very time consuming process. Using lay annotators (e.g. using crowd-sourcing) has been suggested to speed this up. However, this requires to preserve privacy of users and may preclude relying on video for annotation. We investigate to which extent using a 3D human model animated from the data of inertial sensors placed on the limbs allows for annotation of human activities. We animate the upper body of the 3D model with the data from 5 inertial measurement sensors obtained from the OPPORTUNITY dataset. The animated model is shown to 6 people in a suite of experiments in order to understand to which extent it can be used for labelling. We present 3 experiments where we investigate the use of a 3D model for i) activity segmentation, ii) for "open-ended" annotation where users freely describe the activity they see on screen, and iii) traditional annotation, where users pick one activity among a pre-defined list of activities. In the latter case, results show that users recognise the model's activities with 56% accuracy when picking from 11 possible activities.},

abstract = {Along with the spread of smart phones and wearable devices, systems that recognizes gestures such as punch and chop using an accelerometer have recently been attracting a great deal of attention. However, these systems do not consider the situation that gestures are performed continuously from/to other gestures or untrained movements and can not recognize such gestures accurately. This paper proposes a method that recognizes gestures performed continuously without explicit intervals. The proposed method detects segments similar to template data of target gestures and chooses the most likely segment. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an experiment is conducted with five subjects. The subjects conducted three types of gestures drawing a graphic symbol in the air; circle, triangle, and cross in five kinds of situations, and ten types of gestures drawing a numeric character in the air; zero to nine. The average F-measure of graphic symbol achieved 0.78 and the average F-measure of numerical character achieved 0.79.},

Because traditional activity recognition utilizes supervised machine learning, unknown activity classes which do not appear in the training dataset is unable to be estimated. For this problem, zero-shot machine learning method is proposed, but it requires the preparation of semantic codes. As semantic codes, we utilize word vectors constructed from semantic word vectors and Twitter timestamps. To evaluate the proposed method, we evaluated whether we could estimate unknown activity classes, with the sensor data set collected from 20 households for 4 months, along with the user-generated labels using the web system which can estimate, modify, and add new activity types. As a result, the proposed method could even estimate unknown activity classes. Moreover, by utilizing Twitter timestamps and semantic word vectors from the Japanese Wikipedia in word vectors, the method could estimate 9 unknown activity classes.},

This paper proposes a RSSI compensation scheme that estimate a crowd density level based on detected 2.4 GHz RSSI. We developed a scanner system to sense BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) tag for 2.4 GHz RSSI compensation. We deployed 40 BLE scanners and over 100 BLE tags, and collected data for 100 participants at an actual event over a period of four days. Using the collected data, we estimated crowd density level that can be applied to the proposed compensation scheme based on theoretical methods on propagation loss. Our scheme resulted in 59.8% higher accuracy than simple positioning method without the compensation.},

However, the relationship between the individual heart rate and the exercise intensity is subject to stronger fluctuations and is influenced by other external and internal factors. Using solely a HRM to control the exercise intensity may lead to dangerous misinterpretations, in which other important physiological conditions are ignored and self-awareness is eliminated. In this work, we propose an interface to asses and track the rated perceived exertion (RPE), that periodically motivates the athlete to listen more carefully to his subjective feeling and creates awareness of the body. Even though results may be vague in the beginning, we think that the proposed method is preferable for hobbyists over HRMs if used over longterm.},

However, it is unclear if the available set of tracking parameters (such as an average speed, or calories burnt during a sports activity) is expressive enough when it comes to sharing in different sports. In our ongoing meta-study across three outdoor mountain sports, we have investigated whether those tracking apps meet the actual sharing requirements of amateur skiers, climbers, and trail runners. Ultimately, we aim to identify both universal and sport-specific needs for sharing. In this paper, we discuss our initial insights.},

abstract = {Wearables for monitoring physiological parameters of the human body gained a lot of attention and maturity over the last years. To date mostly electrically or mechanically measurable data like heart or breathing rate are obtained --. The acquisition of biochemical, most likely in vivo, data is as interesting as the prior mentioned data, but far more difficult to obtain due to the fact that most of these data acquire invasive methods. Here we present a wearable, screen printed ion-selective sensor for monitoring and analysis of biomarkers in sweat. We show how the setup based on potentiometric evaluation of ion concentrations can be integrated with wearables and present an use case, where ions like ammonia or complementary electrolytes can provide insight into intra-corporal physiological processes and help to control training intensity in sports.},

abstract = {Stride parameters represent basic and useful information on track and field sprint performance. Contact mats or opto-electronic systems allow precise and unobtrusive measurements of those parameters, but their use is limited in space. Hence, there is a lack of research regarding the changes of temporal parameters throughout the competition distance (especially for long sprint), e.g. as a result of fatigue. Wearables, respectively inertial measurement units (IMUs), are not bound to limitations in space and therefore offer challenging opportunities for in-field diagnosis. This paper presents a wearable device for detecting and monitoring stance durations and step frequencies during sprinting. An application in (repetitive) long sprints is presented that analyzes changes of the temporal structure of performance parameters as a result of fatigue and level of expertise. Results indicate that the device provides reliable and accurate measurements of temporal parameters during sprinting and offers a deeper insight to movement characteristics of long sprint.},

One promising approach is to appropriate the skin for input interface. While researches explore the potential of using the skin as an input surface, we show an alternative interaction modality - SkinMotion. SkinMotion reconstructs human motions from skin-stretching movements. In this workshop, we discuss the potential applications of SkinMotion. In addition, we explore one specific instance -- finger motion detection using the skin movement on the dorsum of the hand. Results show that SkinMotion can achieve 5.84° estimate error for proximal phalanx flexion on average. We expect SkinMotion to open new possibilities for skin-based interactions and to extend new boundaries of on-body technologies.},

Recent advances in the manufacturing of thin, bendable electronics and a novel architecture for arranging pixels permit the fabrication of a 'display material' that challenges conventional perceptions of this medium. Envisioning digital displays as a material means that their design is no longer limited to rectangular screens, but can be scaled in size; cut, folded or molded; or combined with other materials and devices to create compelling interactions. In this paper, we explore some of this potential in the context of configuring body-worn items such as clothing. As a more concrete use example, we further present and discuss some initial ideas for aesthetic, expressive and functional configurations of body casts as a specific kind of body cover.},

Tattoos have formed part of tribal culture in Africa for thousands of years. Our design builds on this culture with a new ritual for recording vaccination records in Tattoo form. Our design consists of two artifacts: Firstly, a design for a tattoo which can encode basic child vaccination records. Secondly, a guide book which assists with interpreting the tattoo. Further work could include integrating machine-readable data into the tattoo system.},

The one-day workshop is divided in three steps: first phase is for the generation of ideas on multisensory interfaces, in the second phase, participants will have the possibilities to explore and rediscover their sensorimotor abilities through several exercises and games; in the third and last phase, there will be a further creative session in order to evaluate how the full body and multisensory activities have fostered people's creative processes. The aim of the whole experience is twofold: first, inspiring participants in designing novel concepts for multisensory interfaces; second, providing a preliminary study on the effect of these exercises in fostering creativity and supporting the design process of multisensory interfaces.},

abstract = {When performing a piece of music, body, senses, and cognition are strictly connected to each other. This connection, however, is not always particularly evident. As a consequence, it is extremely important for musicians to be able to control their performance by relying on other sensorial modalities that complement the auditory cue. Sight, in particular, is paramount for most instrumentalists as it helps learning new techniques, recognising errors, correcting expressiveness, and memorize complex passages. As opposed to other musicians, singers can almost exclusively rely on the auditory feedback coming from their voice to adjust their singing. Starting from this statement, we conduct a user study to find possible solutions to provide singers with further feedback during their performance. This paper is a preliminary study in this direction.},

This study resulted in four main themes that reveal the importance of the multisensory experience to textile selection, and the complexity of remembering and communicating such experiences in the design process, given how tacit such experiences are.},

abstract = {In recent years there has been a growing interest in augmenting human cognition (attention, engagement, memory, learning, etc.) through ubiquitous technologies. With the ongoing research and development of near-constant capture devices, unlimited storage, and algorithms for retrieval, the resulting personal data has opened the door to a vast range of applications. In the third rendition of this workshop series, we focus on technologies and applications of capturing and integrating personal memory into everyday use cases. With the question What constitutes as a modern lifelog?, we would like to invite researchers, designers, and practitioners to envision and exchange ideas on how ubiquitous technologies and applications enhance people's memory in everyday life. In this one-day workshop, we will formulate application scenarios for making use of ubiquitous technologies in order to push personal data to an application layer where it is used to support and augment the human mind.},

Near-continuous capture and sharing of photos have generated a need to summarize and review relevant photos to revive important events. However, there is limited work on exploring how regular reviewing of selected photos influence overall recall of past events. In this paper, we present an experiment to investigate the effect of regular reviewing of egocentric lifelogging photos on the formation and retrieval of autobiographic memories. Our approach protects the privacy of the participants and provides improved validation for their memory performance compared to existing approaches. The results of our experiment are a step towards developing memory shaping algorithms that accentuate or attenuate memories on demand.},

The effectiveness of each representation was assessed for three levels of student expertise (experts, intermediates and novices) using entropy-based transition analysis of the gaze data. The results show that students of different skill level (a) prefer different representations for problem-solving, (b) switch between representations with different frequencies, and (c) can be distinguished by the density of representation use. The obtained results confirm earlier findings of physics education research quantitatively which were initially obtained by student interviews and observational studies.},

The server processes the request and returns the result to Google Glass. During training, the server not only aims to build machine learning models with user generated image data, but also to update the models whenever new data is added by the user. Preliminary experimental results show that our system DeepEye is able to train the custom machine learning models in an efficient manner and to classify an image into one of 10 different user-defined categories with 97% accuracy.

abstract = {MobileCoach, an open source behavioral intervention platform, has been developed to provide health professionals with an authoring tool to design evidence-based, scalable and low-cost digital health interventions (DHI). Its potential meets the lack in resources and capacity of health care systems to provide DHI for the treatment of noncommunicable diseases. In the current work, we introduce the first personalization approach for MobileCoach with the purpose of identifying the needs of participants, tailoring the treatment and, as a consequence, enhancing the capability of MobileCoach-based DHIs. The personalization approach is then exemplified by a very first prototype of a DHI for people with asthma that is able to detect coughing by just using a smartphone's microphone. First empirical results with five healthy subjects and 80 coughs indicate its technical feasibility as the detection accuracy yielded 83.3%. Future work will focus on the integration of personalized sensing and supporting applications for MobileCoach.},

abstract = {One of the numerous applications of wearable computers is providing safety in occupations where heat-related injuries are prevalent. Core temperature, as a parameter that cannot be measured by on-body sensors is a variable that is specifically interesting for realizing such applications. In the context of the design of a sensor-shirt that can be used by firefighters, in this paper we study the importance of different types of sensor measurements and their placement for estimating core temperature. We propose a model for inferring the dangerous states of core temperature. Our evaluation results show that our model can to a great extent estimate hazardous situations caused by heat accumulation.},

Current research has shown that walking to a rhythm can lead to significant improvements in various aspects of gait.Our primary aim is to provide a suitable, technology based intervention to enhance gait rehabilitation of people with chronic and degenerative neurological health conditions (such as stroke). This intervention will be in the form of small, lightweight, wireless, wearable devices the user can take out of the clinic, extending their rehabilitation to their own home setting. The devices can deliver a series of vibrations at a steady rhythm giving the patient a more stable and symmetric pace of walking.The simplest version of this approach typically comprise of a very small network of just two nodes and a central controller. The existing prototypes (called the Haptic Bracelets) capture and analyse motion data in real time to provide adaptive haptic (through vibrations) cueing. In the future and after more refinement, the system could allow a single therapist to monitor and advise groups of stroke survivors undergoing therapy sessions.},

This research proposes an obesity management framework which highlights digital technologies to promote self-management of obesity. This work discusses preliminary research using image classification to promote food logging and crowdsourcing to determine calorie content of food images through aggregating the predictions of experts and non-experts. Preliminary results from image classification show SMO classifier achieved 73.87% accuracy in classifying 15 food items, which is promising as computer vision methods could be incorporated into food logging methods. Crowdsourcing results show that aggregated expert group mode percentage error was +2.60% (SD 3.87) in predicting calories in meals and non-expert group mode percentage error was +29.07% (SD 20.48). Further analysis on the crowdsourcing dataset will be completed to ascertain how many experts or nonexperts is needed to get the most accurate calorie prediction.},

abstract = {Remarkable advances in smartphone technology, especially in terms of passive sensing, have enabled researchers to passively monitor user behavior in real-time and at a granularity that was not possible just a few years ago. Recently, different approaches have been proposed to investigate the use of different sensing and phone interaction features, including location, call, SMS and overall application usage logs, to infer the depressive state of users. In this paper, we propose an approach for monitoring of depressive states using multi-modal sensing via smartphones. Through a brief literature review we show the sensing modalities that have been exploited in the past studies for monitoring depression. We then present the initial results of an ongoing study to demonstrate the association of depressive states with the smartphone interaction features. Finally, we discuss the challenges in predicting depression through multimodal mobile sensing.},

Advances in mobile technology afford the opportunity to collect heterogeneous data while people are in their natural settings. The aim of the current paper is to propose an integrated framework, DEMONS (DEpression MONitoring Study), for combining passive and active data sources using a wearable sensor and a smartphone application. The ability to combine passive and active longitudinal data with mobile devices allows for better understanding of the temporal relations between self-reported affect and physiological variables (e.g., heart rate variability) linked to depressive symptoms. Adoption of the proposed framework will provide crucial information regarding the development and maintenance of depression in college students, as well as increased opportunities for early detection and intervention.},

abstract = {Serious mental illnesses (SMIs) like depression, bipolar disorder, etc. are one of the dire health concerns throughout the world. According to WHO, depression is one of the prime causes of disability with 350 million people suffering from it globally. Patients with SMIs require prolonged care and management which in long term adversely affects the caregiver's health. Existing studies leverage the potential of mobile technology to build healthcare systems for mental illnesses. Most of these studies are patient centric with an aim to assist patients in self-management of their illness. The studies focused only on patients have neither exploited the potential of caregiver's role, nor have explored the solutions for managing their burden. We aim to provide a solution that leverage the role of caregivers in providing healthy cooperation between the patients and the doctors in managing SMIs. In this paper we present our work in progress --Harmony - a system designed to encourage the patients in adopting an efficient morning routine. Aim of the current prototype is to reduce the morning efforts of the caregiver by assisting the patient in becoming independent.},

abstract = {Traditionally, mood is assessed by either considering physiological data or smartphones-based self-reports. Physiological data is objective and continuous, but difficult to be collected in-field and lacks a subjective component. Smartphones provide subjective feedback and objective data, but lack physiological data. We propose to combine smartphones as a rich sensor system and smartwatches as a wearable heart rate monitor. Both serve as a platform for reporting mood states. Within an explorative user study with six subjects over four weeks, we collected smartphone data and heart rate in addition to subjective ground truth via self-reports. We assessed all three mood dimensions valence, energetic arousal and calmness, but only consider valence in the context of this paper. Analyzing the information gain, we identified the relevance of temporal features (daytime, weekday, type of day) as well as the heart rate. Decision tree classifiers trained on the first three weeks and tested on the fourth achieve recognition accuracies of up to 0.91.},

This study analyses the extent to which the changes of an individual's real-world psychological mood can be inferred by tracking their online activity on Facebook and Twitter. By capturing activities from the OSNs and ground truth data via experience sampling, it was found that mood changes can be detected within a window of 7 days for 61% of the participants by using specific, combined online activity signals. The participants fall into three distinct groups: those whose mood correlates positively with their online activity, those who correlate negatively and those who display a weak correlation. We trained two classifiers to identify these groups using features from their online activity, which achieved precision of 95.2% and 84.4% respectively. Our results suggest that real-world mood changes can be passively tracked through online activity on OSNs.},

In this paper we propose a method for continuous detection of stressful events using data provided from a commercial wrist device. The method consists of three machine-learning components: a laboratory stress detector that detects short-term stress every 2 minutes; an activity recognizer that continuously recognizes user's activity and thus provides context information; and a context-based stress detector that exploits the output of the laboratory stress detector and the user's context in order to provide the final decision on 20 minutes interval. The method was evaluated in a laboratory and a real-life setting. The accuracy on 55 days of real-life data, for a 2-class problem, was 92%. The method is currently being integrated in a smartphone application for managing mental health and well-being.},

abstract = {The UbiComp community's research in mental health has often focused on depression, but we believe there are many additional opportunities. As participants in this workshop, we will present our initial work to create a portable and self-administered version of the Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF) test. We focus on hepatic encephalopathy, but the test has potential for long-term self-monitoring in a variety of conditions impacting mental health, including cerebro-organic syndromes, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, chronic fatigue, and testing of psychoactive drugs. CFF can detect transient effects on the brain and retina which serve as indicators for the above conditions. However, commercial devices for performing the CFF test are expensive and unwieldy. This limits clinical availability of CFF testing, prevents frequent self-administered testing, and reduces access. We explore the possibility of an affordable and portable device for self-administered CFF testing, implemented using commodity components paired with a mobile phone app. Such a device surfaces many future research challenges analogous to those in other areas of mental health. As background for discussions in this workshop, we discuss our initial exploratory design efforts and potential future steps for the project.},

abstract = {A significant fraction of college students suffer from serious mental health issues including depression, anxiety, self-harm and suicidal thought. The prevalence and severity of these issues among college students also appear to increase over time. However, most of these issues often remain undiagnosed, and as a result, untreated. One of the main reasons of this gap between illness and treatment results from the lack of reliable data over time. While health care services in college campuses have been focusing on detection of illness onset and appropriate interventions, their tools are mostly manual surveys which often fail to capture the granular details of contexts and behaviors which might provide important cues about illness onset. To overcome the limitations of these manual tools, we deployed a smartphone based tool or unobtrusive and continuous data collection from 22 students during an academic semester. In this paper, we present the preliminary findings from our study about assessing mental health on college campuses using passively sensed smartphone data.},

abstract = {Eustress is literally the "good stress" that associated with positive feelings and health benefits. Previous studies focused on general stress, where the concept of eustress has been overlooked. This paper presents a novel approach towards stress recognition using data collected from wearable sensors, smartphones, and computers. The main goal is to determine if behavioral factors can help differentiate eustress from another kind of stress. We conducted a natural experiment to collect user smartphone and computer usage, heart rate and survey data in situ. By correlation and principle component analysis, a set of features could then be constructed. The performance was evaluated under leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, where the combined behavioral and physiological features enabled us to achieve 84.85% accuracy for general stress, 71.33% one kind of eustress as an urge for better performance, and 57.34% for eustress as a state of better mood. This work provided an encouraging result as an initial study for measuring eustress.},

We evaluate the system as a behavioral aid for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), who can greatly benefit from real-time non-invasive emotional cues and are more sensitive to sensory input than neurotypically developing children. In addition, we present a mobile application that enables users of the wearable aid to review their videos along with auto-curated emotional information on the video playback bar. This integrates our learning aid into the context of behavioral therapy. Expanding on our previous work describing in-lab trials, this paper presents our system and application-level design decisions in depth as well as the interface learnings gathered during the use of the system by multiple children with ASD in an at-home iterative trial.},

abstract = {In today's fast paced environment, society is confronted with information overload, stress, and health issues. These are generally caused by accelerating technological evolution, increasing time pressure, and physical inactivity. So-called anticipatory systems, which guide users or intervene in their daily life, are seen as a very promising solution to overcome these issues. This workshop aims to share experiences of current researches on anticipatory systems in order to understand the extent of how such systems could be a solution and how they could provide personal guidance given the discovered traits of human behavior. We invite the submission of papers in the emerging research field of anticipatory mobile computing that focus on understanding, design, and development of such systems. We also welcome contributions that investigate underlying prediction models or give an insight into human behavior. The expected workshop outcome is a summary of recent challenges of anticipatory applications and interventions.},

abstract = {The ability to infer and anticipate the activities of elderly individuals with cognitive impairment has made it possible to provide timely assistance and support, which in turn allows them to lead an independent life. Traditional non-intrusive activity recognition approaches are dependent on the use of various machine learning techniques to infer activities given the collected object usage data. Current activity recognition approaches are also based on knowledge driven techniques that require extensive modelling of the activities that needs to be inferred. These models can be seen as too restrictive, prescriptive and static as they are based on a finite set of activities. In this paper, we propose a novel "top down" approach to recognising activities based on object usage data, which detects patterns associated with the activity-object relationship and utilizes web knowledge in order to build dynamic activity models based on the objects used to perform the activity. Experimental results using the Kasteren dataset shows it is comparable to existing approaches.},

On the other hand, predicting dynamics of internal parameters, such as office spaces, can be tricky, as there are many variables that influence them, and we do not have information on their status. Being able to predict how parameters are changing would allow us to recommend appropriate actions to improve their work/living environment. In this paper, we present an anticipatory system, that is built from virtual sensors, which estimates number of occupants in the room and detects the state of the windows. Together with data from real sensors ontology, as coded knowledge, outputs reasonable actions that may improve internal environment. We built models, which anticipate dynamics of internal parameters temperature (T), humidity (H) and CO2 concentration (C), regarding all combinations of actions.},

These platforms have been tailored for iterative graph computations and can offer an order of magnitude performance gain over generic data-flow frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Spark. Nevertheless, the increasing availability of such platforms and their functionality overlap necessitates a comparative study on various aspects of the platforms, including applications, performance and energy efficiency. In this work, we focus on the energy efficiency aspect of some large scale graph processing platforms. Specifically, we select two representatives, e.g., Apache Giraph and Spark GraphX, for the comparative study. We compare and analyze the energy consumption of these two platforms with PageRank, Strongly Connected Component and Single Source Shortest Path algorithms over five different realistic graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate that GraphX outperforms Giraph in terms of energy consumption. Specifically, Giraph consumes 1.71 times more energy than GraphX on average for the mentioned algorithms.},

abstract = {Many recent work has focused on graph algorithms via parallelization including PowerGraph [9] and Ligra [14]. The frameworks process large graphs in shared memory, requiring a terabyte of memory and expensive maintenance cost. Reducing graph size to fit in memory thus is crucial in cutting the cost of large-scale graph computation. Compression has been widely used to reduce graph size. However, it could meanwhile compromise graph computation efficiency caused by nontrivial decompression overhead before graph computation. In this paper, we propose a simple and yet efficient coding scheme. It not only leads to smaller size of compressed graphs; meanwhile we can perform graph computation directly on the compressed graphs with no or partial decompression, namely compression-aware computation, leading to faster running time. Our experiments validate that the coding scheme achieves 2.99X compression ratio, and three compression-aware graph algorithms achieve 7.02X, 2.88X and 2.34X faster running time than the graph algorithms on the graphs without compression.},

abstract = {Aggregate computing is proposed as a computational model and associated toolchain to engineer adaptive large-scale situated systems, including IoT and wearable computing systems. Though originated in the context of WSN-like (peer-to-peer and fully distributed) systems, we argue it is a model that can transparently fit a variety of execution platforms (decentralised, server-mediated, cloud/fog-oriented), due to its ability of declaratively designing systems by global-level abstractions: it opens the possibility of intrinsically supporting forms of load balancing, elasticity and toleration of medium- and long-term changes of computational infrastructures. To ground the discussion, we present ongoing work in the context of scafi, a language and platform support for computational fields based on the Scala programming language and Akka actor framework.},

For seven of the 13 days video ground truth has been recorded and extensively annotated. Questions that we addressed include the mapping from the number of detected devices to the number of people, the ability to generalize the calibration from a small number of ground truth points recorded on one day to other days and the ability to localize individuals in different conditions.

abstract = {Japan is aging rapidly, so "tojikomori" has become an important issue. In the field of gerontology, "tojikomori" means shutting oneself in a room or house. Tojikomori is caused not only by physical factors but also by social and psychological ones. Once an elderly person becomes tojikomori, it takes a lot of time and energy to recover. It is important to take primary preventive measures, especially for currently active older adults because a little help has a great benefit. A previous study identified two key factors of tojikomori in an urban area: no exercise habits and no participation in community activities. Therefore, we developed a walking game to enhance physically healthy behavior and motivate the elderly to explore a city and lead to the discovery of favorite spots they want to visit again. In addition, we designed a group-walking program utilizing the walking game aimed for face-to-face communication with other community-dwelling elderly people. Our results show that our approach was well received, enjoyable, and effective for older adults in a real-world situation.},

abstract = {With the deployment of modern infrastructures for public transit, several studies have analyzed the transition patterns of people by using smart card data and have characterized the areas. In this paper, we propose a novel embedding method to obtain a vector representation of a geospatial area using transition patterns of people from the large-scale data of their smart cards. We extend a network embedding by taking into account geographical constraints on people transitioning in the real world. We conducted an experiment using smart card data in a large network of railroads in Kansai areas in Japan. We obtained a vector representation of each railroad station using the proposed embedding method. The results show that the proposed method performs better than the existing network embedding methods in the task of multi-label classification for purposes of going to a railroad station. Our proposed method can contribute to predicting people flow by discovering underlying representations of geospatial areas from mobility data.},

The result indicated that the pickup rate of taxi in this area is usually peak according to department store operation hours. The highest chance to get customers is in the weekday rush hours between 7am and 10am and at the midnight for the weekend. The increased profits were mainly based on the distance. Finally, the hotspot of taxicabs destinations can be observed at the interchange of major public transportation. These results uncover taxi driving behavior on one of the densest network in Bangkok and yields great benefit for both taxi drivers and passengers.},

BikeNow predicts the next green light phases of traffic lights along the track of cyclists and provides a suggestion to keep or change the current speed. The purpose of BikeNow is to motivate cyclists to allow the submission of ride related data like current time, position and speed that is of high value for traffic evaluation, prediction and future planing of cycle paths. The evaluation is based on a preliminary survey with 79 participants to study the target user group and a user study with 14 participants to assess the usability of the application. In addition we analyze the value of collectible data for urban traffic analysis and cycle path network planning.},

abstract = {Studies on human mobility have demonstrated that transitions between important locations are highly regular, and that in overall, people spend the majority of their time in a small set of important locations. However, what currently is not known is how regular the movements leading from one location to another are, i.e., how regular is the route mobility of individuals. The present paper contributes by conducting the first ever empirical study on regularity of route regularity. We demonstrate that routes indeed contain a high degree of regularity and that the uncertainty associated with a route is concentrated along a small set of so-called fork points. Accordingly, our results suggest that routes can be encoded using a combination of sub-segments with high regularity, and a set of fork points that serve as transition points for the sub-segments. We carry out our analysis using the CabSpotting dataset, which contains mobility traces from 538 cabs in San Francisco metropolitan area collected during one month period.},

abstract = {Recently, an understanding of mass movement in urban areas immediately after large disasters, such as the Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE), has been needed. In particular, mobile phone data is available as time-varying data. However, much more detailed movement that is based on network flow instead of aggregated data is needed for appropriate rescue on a real-time basis. Hence, our research aims to estimate real-time human movement during large disasters from several kinds of mobile phone data. In this paper, we simulate the movement of people in the Tokyo metropolitan area in a large disaster situation and obtain several kinds of fragmentary movement observation data from mobile phones. Our approach is to use data assimilation techniques combining with simulation of population movement and observation data. The experimental results confirm that the improvement in accuracy depends on the observation data quality using sensitivity analysis and data processing speed to satisfy each condition for real-time estimation.},

abstract = {Although emergency services have already recognized the importance of citizen-initiated activities during disasters, still questions with regard to the coordination of spontaneous volunteers and their activities arise. Situated and ubiquitous crowdsourcing seem to be appropriate concepts for supporting the management of voluntary activities during emergencies. Within this paper we present two tools that encompass both types of crowdsourcing mechanisms.},

Due to limited time and budget, developers of mobile crowdsourcing applications sometimes cannot completely test their prototypes in real world situations. We describe a data integration technique for developers to validate their design in prototype testing. Our approach constructs the intended context by combining real-time, historical and simulated data. With correct context-aware design, mobile crowdsourcing applications presenting crowdsourcing questions in relevant context to users are likely to obtain high response quality.},

In this context, there is an urgent need to develop smart socio-technical systems that enable effective use and management of vacant houses, thereby preventing them from having negative impacts on local communities. In this paper, we propose an approach to support community-centric use and management of vacant houses based on an integrated crowdsourcing platform. We describe our ongoing project in Kashiwa City, and argue for an open, inclusive, and community-centric distributed platform to cater for some of the important needs in the community.},

abstract = {The exploitation of the opportunistic infrastructure via Device-to-Device (D2D) communication is a critical component towards the adoption of new paradigms such as edge and fog computing. While a lot of work has demonstrated the great potential of D2D communication, it is still unclear whether the benefits of the D2D approach can really be leveraged in practice. In this paper, we develop a software sensor, namely Detector, which senses the infrastructure in proximity of a mobile user. We analyze and evaluate D2D on the wild, i.e., not in simulations. We found that in a realistic environment, a mobile is always co-located in proximity to at least one other mobile device throughout the day. This suggests that a device can schedule tasks processing in coordination with other devices, potentially more powerful, instead of handling the processing of the tasks by itself.},

abstract = {Constructing a location-dependent fingerprint map is one of the essential steps for fingerprint-based indoor localization. A comprehensive site survey is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and subjects to environmental changes. In this work, we develop a mobile participatory game, MobiBee, to collect fingerprints with the help of quick response (QR) codes (posted on walls or pillars as location tags). Various incentive strategies, including monetary, entertainment and competition, are utilized. The location marker is deliberately designed to ensure that fingerprints are collected at the targeted locations in a stationary manner. Interestingly, a few instances of QR code forgery have been identified during the game play, which exposes the vulnerability of using QR code in indoor localization. A fraud detection mechanism is hence proposed. Experiments show that the proposed approach can accurately detect the QR code forgery and improve indoor localization accuracy.},

Preference for the phone is due to its mobility as opposed to a listen in place interaction; but the phone takes the attention away from the exhibition and isolates from the group.

abstract = {Users of digital devices are increasingly confronted with a tremendous amount of notifications that appear on multiple devices and screens in their environment. Today many users own different ubiquitous devices such as a smart-phone, a tablet, a notebook and a smartwatch. If an email client is installed on every device an incoming email produces up to four notifications -- one on each device. In the future, we will receive notifications from an increasing number of ubiquitous devices. Therefore, we need smart attention management for incoming notifications as well as novel ways to present and interact with notifications. One way for a less interrupting attention management could be the use of ambient representations of incoming notifications. This workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to explore how the flood of notifications on different computing devices and in smart environments can be managed, to avoid information overload.},

The current state-of-the-art approaches do this by identifying breakpoints either in user tasks, activities or by processing social relationships and contents of interruptions. However, from a psychological perspective, not all of these breakpoints represent opportune moments for interruptions. In this paper, we propose a new concept in the field of interruptibility. The concept is based on role theory and psychological interruption research. In particular, we argue that social roles which define sets of norms, expectations, rules and behaviours can provide useful information about the user's current context that can be used to enhance interruption management systems. Based on this concept, we propose a prototype system architecture that uses social roles to detect opportune moments for interruptions.},

abstract = {Notifications are an important feature to proactively inform smartphone users. However, reading notifications on phones often has a disruptive effect on tasks at hand or social situations. Today's smart home and office environments with their increasingly connected devices provide rich opportunities to deliver notifications in a context-sensitive and multi-modal way into the direct surroundings of a user eliminating the need to fish up the smartphone from the pocket. Due to the missing tool support these opportunities have however neither been sufficiently investigated nor picked up for use in daily lives. With this work we introduce an infrastructure for homes and offices that enables designers and web-developers to design and deploy context sensitive notification strategies using arbitrary connected things and smart home products such as TVs, tablets, projections, lamps, speakers and many more. We introduce the opportunities offered by this platform to go beyond simple Event-Condition-Rules and describe how the system can be used to carry out remotely controlled "in the wild" experiments.},

abstract = {The knowledge of a user's mental involvement, i.e. task engagement, opens up an array of possibilities for a seamless mobile computing device -- human interaction. Today's most ubiquitous personal sensing devices, such as smartphones, are equipped with an array of sensors that may be used to infer different aspects of human behavior. However, inferring task engagement using smartphone sensors remains unexplored. In this paper we present our initial work on automated task engagement inference using only smartphone sensors. We design, develop and deploy a mobile sensing application TaskyApp, and collect 216 data points of sensor readings and task engagement labels from eight users in an office setting. Using machine learning we demonstrate that with up to 67.6% accuracy, relying mostly on the movement sensors, we can correctly infer a user's task engagement.},

abstract = {Affective computing systems blend technical and social elements and present challenges for designing notifications. As the number of applications expand that utilize notifications, we need to consider that competing for attention is a concern. With respect to promoting positive health behaviors, notifications need to be adapted to times when a user is vulnerable and receptive for a health intervention but also to users' attentional states. In this paper we outline affective computing projects and in the workshop will discuss challenges of designing interventions to promote positive behaviors in real world environments.},

Emojis offer an attractive way to express emotions to avoid misunderstandings of message tone. In this paper we shed the light on the roles of Emojis in phone notification, we conducted an in-situ study to gather phone notification data. We outline the relationship between Emojis and various social network applications including WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter. Early results allow us to draw several conclusions in relation to number, position, type and sentimental value of Emojis. It turns out that most popular Emojis in one social app is not as popular in the others. Emojis sentimental polarity in Twitter is high and overall number of Emojis is less than Facebook. The sentimental value of Emojis is more meaningful when there are multiple Emoji in one notification.},

A key aspect of ambient notifications is the unobtrusive provision of information, embedded into the users' environment. The number of services which are providing notifications on numerous devices, both mobile and embedded into the environment, is increasing. Therefore, is important to find unobtrusive ways for notification, avoiding redundancy, and the appropriate detail of information and alert level. In this work, we describe some of the challenges that arise when designing ambient notification environments and provide alternative approaches by describing specific scenarios and use cases for these kind of systems.},

These devices often make use of natural language output, more specifically textual messages, as a way to notify users. These messages are commonly simple predetermined strings. Some IoT devices however are designed to report on complex applications, which may be difficult for users without technical domain knowledge to understand. In this work, we present an initial evaluation in which we investigated how users' inclination to attend to a monitoring system is affected by different levels of information. Based our findings, we discuss future avenues of research which we believe will further our understanding of natural language output's application in the IoT domain.},

They allow us to be connected to a load of people and with a vast amount of apps - all of them requiring our attention. There is a growing need for a smart management to not be overwhelmed by the flood of information and notifications. A first step in that direction is to identify detectable contexts in which interruptibility is very high or low.In this paper, we present results of a survey taken by 68 persons. Within the survey, we assess how much smartphone notifications interrupt and disturb users at a specific location. The locations were selected based on the places that can be recognized by the Google Places API. This shall serve as a basis for future interruptibility research.We noticed that people are fairly interruptible while waiting, e.g. at bus stations or at parking lots. In contrast, they must not be disturbed at movie theaters, libraries or restaurants.},

abstract = {Roof-mounted photovoltaic (PV) generation is becoming more prevalent within the domestic setting. Recently battery systems have enabled households to store excess self-generated electricity for subsequent use. However the associated user-interfaces and displays can be hard to understand, potentially preventing households from optimizing their solar usage. This paper introduces a known method being deployed in a new context. It reports on on-going research that investigates the effect of in-home ambient light displays linked to the home battery system. The paper covers the design stage and potential feedback solutions to raise awareness and influence consumer behaviour to promote energy conservation. An Ambient Light System is proposed to enable better user feedback. The study outlines the design recommendation for an ambient light display to be used in an energy consumption context. Using such a display, households can optimize use of low Carbon solar energy within the home, thus minimizing grid electricity usage.},

abstract = {The commercial introduction of connected lighting that can be integrated with sensors and other devices is opening up new possibilities for creating responsive and intelligent environments. However, the current approach for controlling such systems is to simply replace the light switch with a somewhat more sophisticated smartphone-based remote control. In this position paper we present a study of a new connected lighting control interface -- tap sensors. The tap sensor is a wireless device equipped with an accelerometer sensor that can detect a tap interaction and send a signal to the connected lighting system, for controlling light or other outputs. The tap sensors are small enough to be discretely attached to objects, such as a table, a picture frame, or a door, and it will then turn that object into an interactive control device. Therefore, by tapping on the object, the tap sensor that is attached to it will detect the tap input and an output can subsequently be triggered. These sensors were given to participants who lived with them in their own homes for a few weeks. The results of the study showed a great appreciation for this type of interaction from both practical and hedonic perspectives. Participants informed us that the tap sensors were effective, helpful, fun and playful ways of controlling their light.},

In each iteration, the system offers the user a certain amount of light and the user gives his feedback to the system. When the user is satisfied, implicit feedback is given by not intervening the system. Otherwise explicit feedback such as "too bright" or "too dark" will be given. Each user feedback is modeled as a probabilistic event, which means that it is possible that sometimes the user will give different feedback for the same light level. To avoid disturbing the user to much, we propose a learning algorithm which learns the most preferred light level of the user with only a few explicit interventions.},

This workshop will be an opportunity to discuss and practice novel interactions with light, exploring human bodily and cognitive skills to grasp better the ephemerality of light and of the IoT.},

abstract = {Previous work on eye tracking and eye-based human-computer interfaces mainly concentrated on making use of the eyes in traditional desktop settings. With the recent growth of interest in wearable computers, such as smartwatches, smart eyewears and low-cost mobile eye trackers, eye-based interaction techniques for mobile computing are becoming increasingly important. PETMEI 2016 focuses on the pervasive eye tracking paradigm as a trailblazer for mobile eye-based interaction to take eye tracking out into the wild, to mobile and pervasive settings. We want to stimulate and explore the creativity of these communities with respect to the implications, key research challenges, and new applications for pervasive eye tracking in ubiquitous computing. The long-term goal is to create a strong interdisciplinary research community linking these fields together and to establish the workshop as the premier forum for research on pervasive eye tracking.},

A novel method for eyelid identification and aperture estimation is proposed and evaluated against challenging data from an eye-tracking experiment conducted in driving scenarios in the wild. The proposed method outperforms an state-of-the-art approach by up to 40 percentage points and runs in real-time on state-of-the-art eye tracking systems.

Unfavorable conditions, such as eyewear reflections, extreme angles and make-up were incorporated. Unlike conventional RGB and gray scale eye tracking a seven-channel spectral video capture over the wavelength range of 380-1000 nm, in addition with spectral still images in the range of 450-950 nm, provided a detailed acquisition of spectral signatures of the eye and its surroundings. These signatures can be exploited to create new methodologies for imaging, training, analysis and interpretation of eye tracking data in harsh conditions.},

Known approaches often focus on specific applications and provide only rough estimates for the achieved accuracies or impose sever restrictions on the user's movements. We present the design and detailed evaluation of a mobile gaze tracking system that can be generally applied in pervasive and ubiquitous applications that rely on free-space interactions. Using automated image processing, we also present a fast method for evaluating the achieved accuracies of the eye tracking device and the marker-based mapping onto a screen placed in the vicinity. Evaluation results not only provide details necessary for later applications in ubiquitous environments, but also reveal that manufacturer's specification of the eye tracker's accuracy is barely met in actual use.},

The cornea, which is encasing the iris and pupil, is protected by tear fluid, and thus is a highly reflective surface. In this paper we present a first exploration of using corneal imaging to extract information for life logging. Our system is comprised of a head-mounted eye-camera (capturing corneal reflections) connected to a wearable computer, to record humans' daily activities. We conducted a live logging experiment, where we collected data in uninstrumented environments. Based on the analysis of the recordings we demonstrate what kind of information can be extracted out of the corneal image reflections and derive suitable applications use cases.},

abstract = {Studies of visual attention during web-browsing belong to long standing applications of eye-tracking. Before researchers can analyze characteristics of visual attention, they often have to manually annotate each Area of Interest (AOI) at the web page. The longer, more complex, and dynamic the web pages are, the more time the researcher spends on creating the bounding box around each AOI. To speed up this process, we designed a browser extension that automatically extracts coordinates of visible web elements at the page as the user interacts with the page, along with the mouse activity. In our case study, the WTP automatically annotated all web elements, mouse clicks and mouse movements, and we linked the annotations with the stream of eye-tracking data. As a demonstration, we report on distribution of fixations over specific web elements during daily browsing activities. To our knowledge, this is a first tool that supports real-time automatic annotations of dynamic web-content, with a particular fit for eye-tracking research.},

abstract = {Eye movements are a powerful source of information as well as the most intuitive form of interaction. Although eye-tracking technology is still in its infancy, it offers the greatest potential for novel communication solutions and applications. Whereas head-mounted eye-trackers are widely used in research, several applications require most unintrusive eye tracking, ideally realized by means of a single, low-cost camera placed away from the subject. However, such remote devices usually provide low resolution images and pose several challenges to gaze position estimation. The key challenge in such a scenario is the robust detection of the pupil center in the recorded image. We evaluated eight state-of-the-art algorithms for pupil detection on three manually labeled data sets recorded in remote tracking scenarios. Among the evaluated algorithms, ElSe [6] proved to be the best performing approach on overall 3202 images from remote eye tracking, which include changing illumination, occlusion, head movements, and off-axial camera position. In addition, we contribute a new data set with 445 annotated images, recorded in a fixed setup with a low cost camera capable of using natural and infrared light.},

In this paper, we present a blink detection algorithm that is tailored towards head-mounted eye trackers and is robust to calibration-based variations like translation or rotation of the eye. The proposed approach reached 96,35% accuracy for a realistic and challenging data set and in real-time even on low-end devices, rendering the proposed method suited for pervasive eye tracking.},

In this work we discuss these challenges, and explore the design space of gaze-enabled public displays. We conclude by discussing how the current state of research stands wrt. the identified challenges, and highlight directions for future work.},

To enhance the senserization of various things, we have proposed a platform, called SenStick, that consists of ultra tiny all-in-one sensor board and sophisticated mobile app. If using it, every researcher can try embedding various sensor into various things and can focus on data analysis.

abstract = {Part of an actor's job is being able to cold read: to take words directly from the page and to read them as if they were his or her own, often without the chance to read the lines beforehand. This is particularly difficult when two or more actors need to perform a dialogue cold. The need to hold a paper script in hand hinders the actor's ability to move freely. It also introduces a visual distraction between actors trying to engage with one another in a scene. This preliminary study uses Google Glass displayed cue cards as an alternative to traditional scripts, and compares the two approaches through a series of two-person, cold-read performances. Each performance was judged by a panel of theatre experts. The study finds that Glass has the potential to aid performance by freeing actors to better engage with one another. However, it also found that by limiting the display to one line of script at a time, the Glass application used here makes it difficult for some actors to grasp the text. In a further study, when asked to later perform the text from memory, actors who had used Glass recalled only slightly fewer lines than when they had learned using paper.},

abstract = {Learning a foreign language such as English is an important task for many people. The process of learning takes time and it is important to have a simple way to evaluate the progress of the skill. We propose a method to evaluate the reader's English skill based on a mobile eye tracking system. The eye tracker captures the reader's behavior while reading a document. The front camera of the eye tracker records the scene image that contains the read document. By using a retrieval algorithm we can recognize the read document and project the eye gaze data from the scene image to the document space. Then, some features related to the reading and solving behavior on several documents are computed. As a first result, we show that the TOEIC score can be estimated with an error of 36.3 points.},
