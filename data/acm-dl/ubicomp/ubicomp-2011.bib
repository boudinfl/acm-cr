abstract = {William James, the noted psychologist and philosopher, believed that smiling has a positive effect on our mind. James' view, which was confirmed by several psychological studies, was that we become happier when we laugh. In this paper, we propose a new digital appliance that encourages the act of smiling in our daily lives. This system is designed for people who may not always realize when they are in low spirits and/or have difficulty with smiling. In addition, we believe that this system will foster casual conversation and prompt communications with other people. Our appliance, called the HappinessCounter, combines visual smile recognition, user feedback, and network communication. We conducted two trials of the HappinessCounter system, the first with a single occupant and the second with a couple living together. The system had positive effects on user's mood and prompted communication among family members, thereby increasing their positive mood as well.},

abstract = {There are a number of mobile shopping aids and recommender systems available, but none can be easily used for a weekly shop at a local supermarket. We present a minimal, mobile and fully functional lambent display that clips onto any shopping trolley handle, intended to nudge people when choosing what to buy. It provides salient information about the food miles for various scanned food items represented by varying lengths of lit LEDs on the handle and a changing emoticon comparing the average miles of all the products in the trolley against a social norm. When evaluated in situ, the lambent handle display nudged people to choose products with fewer food miles than the items they selected using their ordinary shopping strategies. People also felt guilty when the average mileage of the contents of their entire shopping trolley was above the social norm. The findings are discussed in terms of how to provide different kinds of product information that people care about, using simple lambent displays.},

abstract = {The pervasiveness of computing has extended into domestic realms, including the dining room. Beyond simply a place to consume food, the dining room is a social hub where family members meet and share experiences. Yet busy lifestyles can make it difficult to spend social time with your family. To provide a new solution for family bonding, this paper presents the CoDine system, a dining table embedded with interactive subsystems that augment and transport the experience of communal family dining to create a sense of coexistence among remote family members. CoDine connects people in different locations through shared dining activities: gesture-based screen interaction, mutual food serving, ambient pictures on an animated tablecloth, and the transportation of edible messages. Rather than focusing on functionality or efficiency, CoDine aims to provide people with an engaging interactive dining experience through enriched multi-sensory communication.},

Although the added benefit of sensing is often clear (e.g., entertainment, security, encouraging sustainable behaviors, etc.), the home is a private and intimate place, with multiple stakeholders who may have competing priorities and tolerances for what is acceptable and useful. In an effort to develop systems that account for the needs and concerns of householders, we conducted an anonymous survey (N = 475) focusing on the activities and habits that people do at home that they would not want to be recorded. In this paper, we discuss those activities and where in the home they are performed, and offer suggestions for the design of UbiComp systems that rely on sensing and recording.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe LightWave, a sensing approach that turns ordinary compact fluorescent light (CFL) bulbs into sensors of human proximity. Unmodified CFL bulbs are shown to be sensitive proximity transducers when they are illuminated. This approach utilizes predictable variations in electromagnetic noise resulting from the change in impedance due to the proximity of a human body to the bulb. The electromagnetic noise can be sensed from any point along a home's electrical wiring. This allows users to perform gestures near any CFL lighting fixture, even when multiple lamps are operational. Gestures can be sensed using a single interface device plugged into any electrical outlet. We experimentally show that we can reliably detect hover gestures (waving a hand close to a lamp), touches on lampshades, and touches on the glass part of the bulb itself. Additionally, we show that touches anywhere along the body of a metal lamp can be detected. These basic detectable signals can then be combined to form complex gesture sequences for a variety of applications. We also show that CFLs can function as more general-purpose sensors for distributed human motion detection and ambient temperature sensing.},

Vision-based 3D modeling has only seen limited success in applications, as it faces many technical challenges that only a few experts understand, let alone solve. In this work we utilize (Kinect style) consumer depth cameras to enable non-expert users to scan their personal spaces into 3D models. We build a prototype mobile system for 3D modeling that runs in real-time on a laptop, assisting and interacting with the user on-the-fly. Color and depth are jointly used to achieve robust 3D registration. The system offers online feedback and hints, tolerates human errors and alignment failures, and helps to obtain complete scene coverage. We show that our prototype system can both scan large environments (50 meters across) and at the same time preserve fine details (centimeter accuracy). The capability of detailed 3D modeling leads to many promising applications such as accurate 3D localization, measuring dimensions, and interactive visualization.},

Augmenting these interactive surfaces with tactile feedback has been found to increase interaction speed, reduce operating errors and minimize visual and cognitive load. Communicating detailed tactile characteristics of virtual elements, however, requires complex electromechanical or electrostatic actuator setups. This increase in complexity makes tactile interfaces intricate, costly or poorly scalable. In order to provide sophisticated tactile sensations with simple actuator technology, we exploit a haptic psychophysical phenomenon called Phantom Sensation. We present a comparison of three standard tactile actuator technologies to see which one can recreate the Phantom Sensation with maximum effect. Our results show the way to a simple and scalable implementation of illusion-based tactile feedback for interactive surfaces. We explore the notion of the Phantom Sensation and its possible applications within a ubicomp scenario.},

In this paper, we aim to discover anomalous driving patterns from taxi's GPS traces, targeting applications like automatically detecting taxi driving frauds or road network change in modern cites. To achieve the objective, firstly we group all the taxi trajectories crossing the same source destination cell-pair and represent each taxi trajectory as a sequence of symbols. Secondly, we propose an Isolation-Based Anomalous Trajectory (iBAT) detection method and verify with large scale taxi data that iBAT achieves remarkable performance (AUC&gt;0.99, over 90% detection rate at false alarm rate of less than 2%). Finally, we demonstrate the potential of iBAT in enabling innovative applications by using it for taxi driving fraud detection and road network change detection.},

Second, it recommends people with some locations (within a walking distance) where they can easily find vacant taxis. In our method, we learn the above knowledge (represented by probabilities) from GPS trajectories of taxis. Then, we feed the knowledge into a probabilistic model which estimates the profit of the candidate locations for a particular driver based on where and when the driver requests for the recommendation.

State of the art research on kinematics in sports is using optical motion capture systems that are inaccessible to most athletes. This paper demonstrates the potential of wearable sensors for runners' kinematics analysis. We present a user study including 21 subjects of different running experience that performed an exhausting run on a conventional outside track wearing ETHOS units. For performance level assessment, training assistance, and fatigue monitoring we extracted the foot contact duration, the foot strike type, and the heel lift as kinematic parameters. A questionnaire revealed that subjects perceived the sensors as comfortable to wear and would use them on a regular basis. We concluded that wearable sensors provide a valuable tool for runners, from beginners to experts, for running technique assessment.},

First, we show that cellular handoff patterns on a given route are stable across a range of conditions and propose a way to measure stability within and between routes using a variant of Earth Mover's Distance. Second, we present two accurate classification algorithms for matching cellular handoff patterns to routes: one requires test drives on the routes while the other uses signal strength data collected by high-resolution scanners. Finally, we present an application of our algorithms for measuring relative volumes of traffic on routes leading into and out of a specific city, and validate our methods using statistics published by a state transportation authority.},

Our experiences suggest that such complex feature-sets are unnecessary in many cases and may be counter productive in signage systems. We describe an alternative, simpler paradigm for encouraging widespread use of signage systems based on shared 'content channels' between content providers and display owners. Our system has been in continuous use for approximately 3 years. We reflect and draw lessons from how our user community has adopted and used the resulting public display network. We believe that these reflections will be of benefit to future developers of ubiquitous display networks.},

A multimodal experience was created, comprising ambient sounds and narratives -- heard through headphones -- and an assortment of themed tactile objects, intended to be felt. In addition, audience members were each provided with a novel haptic device that was designed to enhance their discovery of a pitch-black space. An in the wild study of the cultural experience showed how blind and sighted audience members had different 'felt' experiences, but that neither was a lesser one. Furthermore, the haptic device was found to encourage enactive exploration and provide reassurance of the environment for both sighted and blind people, rather than acting simply as a navigation guide. We discuss the potential of using haptic feedback to create cultural experiences for both blind and sighted people; rethinking current utilitarian framing of it as assistive technology.},

While existing efforts have predominantly focused on understanding the explicit user intent expressed by a textual or voice query, this paper presents an approach to context-aware and personalized entity recommendation which understands the implicit intent without any explicit user input on the phone. The approach, highly motivated from a large-scale mobile click-through analysis, is able to rank both the entity types and the entities within each type (here an entity is a local business, e.g., "I love sushi," while an entity type is a category, e.g., "restaurant"). The recommended entity types and entities are relevant to both user context (past behaviors) and sensor context (time and geo-location). Specifically, it estimates the generation probability of an entity by a given user conditioned on the current context in a probabilistic framework. A random-walk propagation is then employed to refine the estimated probability by mining the temporal patterns among entities. We deploy a recommendation application based on the proposed approach on Window Phone 7 devices. We evaluate recommendation performance on 10 thousand mobile clicks, as well as user experience through subjective user studies. We show that the application is effective to facilitate the exploration and discovery of surroundings for mobile users.},

abstract = {Much research in ubiquitous computing assumes that a user's phone will be always on and at-hand, for collecting user context and for communicating with a user. Previous work with the previous generation of mobile phones has shown that such an assumption is false. Here, we investigate whether this assumption about users' proximity to their mobile phones holds for a new generation of mobile phones, smart phones. We conduct a data collection field study of 28 smart phone owners over a period of 4 weeks. We show that in fact this assumption is still false, with the within arm's reach proximity being true close to 50% of the time, similar to the earlier work. However, we also show that smart phone proximity within the same room (arm+room) as the user is true almost 90% of the time. We discuss the reasons for these phone proximities and the implications of this on the development of mobile phone applications, particularly those that collect user and environmental context, and delivering notification to users. We also show that we can accurately predict the proximity at the arm level and arm+room level with 75 and 83% accuracy, respectively, with features simple to collect and model on a mobile phone. Further we show that for several individuals who are almost always within the arm+room level, we can predict this level with over 90% accuracy.},

With an average of 4.3 potentially dangerous loose objects in a car's cabin, our findings suggest that despite being generally aware of potential risks, considerations of convenience, easy access, and lack of in-the-moment awareness lead people to continue to place objects in dangerous locations in cars. Our study highlights opportunities for addressing this problem by tracking and reminding people about loose objects in cars.},

To answer these questions we analyse the privacy policies of users of a real-time location sharing application, in which users actively shared their location with their contacts. The results show that users who are central to their network are more likely to reveal most about their whereabouts. Furthermore, we show that the friend most likely to know the whereabouts of a specific individual is the one with most common contacts and/or greatest number of contacts.},

In this paper, we examine the level of privacy protection provided by the current query obfuscation techniques against adversarial location service providers. As a representative and realistic implementation of query obfuscation, we focus on SybilQuery. We present two types of attacks depending upon whether or not a short-term query history is available. When history is available, using machine learning, we were able to identify 93.67% of user trips, with only 2.02% of fake trips misclassified, for the security parameter k = 5. In the absence of history, we used trip correlations to form a smaller set of trips effectively increasing the user query identification probability from 20% to about 40%. Our work demonstrates that the use of aggregate statistical information alone is not sufficient to generate simulated trips. We identify areas for improvement in the existing query obfuscation techniques.},

abstract = {As ubiquitous computing becomes increasingly mobile and social, personal information sharing will likely increase in frequency, the variety of friends to share with, and range of information that can be shared. Past work has identified that whom you share with is important for choosing whether or not to share, but little work has explored which features of interpersonal relationships influence sharing. We present the results of a study of 42 participants, who self-report aspects of their relationships with 70 of their friends, including frequency of collocation and communication, closeness, and social group. Participants rated their willingness to share in 21 different scenarios based on information a UbiComp system could provide. Our findings show that (a) self-reported closeness is the strongest indicator of willingness to share, (b) individuals are more likely to share in scenarios with common information (e.g. we are within one mile of each other) than other kinds of scenarios (e.g. my location wherever I am), and (c) frequency of communication predicts both closeness and willingness to share better than frequency of collocation.},

abstract = {Just as coordinate-oriented location-based applications have exploded recently with mapping services, new semantic location services will be critical for the next wave of killer applications. People are going to want everyday applications to have location-awareness that goes beyond simple numerical latitude and longitude. Loci is a new semantic location service layer that employs user feedback to bridge the gap between machine-learned and human-defined places. Advances in place learning techniques have provided us the tools to detect nearly 95% of the visits we make to places and the distances we travel. The difficulty of recovering the remaining 5% comes from designing parameters that work for every user in every place. Based on a user study with 29 participants over three weeks, we show that the level of user feedback required by the service is acceptable and most of the users are willing to provide help to improve their experiences with the service. Our results suggest that user feedback has the potential to significantly improve semantic location services, but requires well-timed prompting mechanisms to improve the quality of the feedback.},

In this paper, we argue for expanding the current landscape of sensing to include living organisms such as plants and animals, along with traditional tools and digital devices. We present a field study of ten individuals who routinely work with living organisms such as plants, fish, reptiles and bees, and rely on these organisms as well as analog instruments and digital sensors to infer environmental conditions and inform future actions. Our findings offer a new perspective on everyday biomarkers, and we use the lens of organic and non-digital sensing to reflect on current sensing paradigms in ubiquitous computing. We conclude with three opportunity areas to help frame future work in ubiquitous sensing: (1) incorporating traditional technologies and living systems into ubiquitous sensing applications, (2) developing information technologies that teach new ways of 'seeing', and (3) supporting richer forms of metadata to unite stakeholders through their actions, interests and concerns.},

P.Pods enable computational control of devices by hijacking their mechanical switches -- a term we refer to as mechanical hijacking. P.Pods offer simple, low-cost, non-destructive computational access to installed hardware, enabling functional, real world Ubicomp deployments. In this paper, we illustrate how three P.Pod primitives, built with the Lego MindStorm NXT toolkit, can implement mechanical hijacking, facilitating real world Ubicomp deployments which otherwise require extensive changes to existing hardware or infrastructure. Lastly, we demonstrate the simplicity of P.Pods by observing two middle school classes build working smart home applications in 4 hours.},

In contrast with existing stationary or outdoor air quality sensing systems, MAQS users carry portable, indoor location tracking sensors that provide personalized IAQ information. To improve accuracy and energy efficiency, MAQS incorporates three novel techniques: (1) an accurate temporal n-gram augmented Bayesian room localization method that requires few Wi-Fi fingerprints; (2) an air exchange rate based IAQ sensing method, which measures general IAQ using only CO2 sensors; and (3) a zone-based proximity detection method for collaborative sensing, which saves energy and enables data sharing among users. MAQS has been deployed and evaluated via user study. Detailed evaluation results demonstrate that MAQS supports accurate personalized IAQ monitoring and quantitative analysis with high energy efficiency.},

We deployed PreHeat in five homes, three in the US and two in the UK. In UK homes, we controlled heating on a per-room basis to enable further energy savings. We compared PreHeat's prediction algorithm with a static program over an average 61 days per house, alternating days between these conditions, and measuring actual gas consumption and occupancy. In UK homes PreHeat both saved gas and reduced MissTime (the time that the house was occupied but not warm). In US homes, PreHeat decreased MissTime by a factor of 6-12, while consuming a similar amount of gas. In summary, PreHeat enables more efficient heating while removing the need for users to program thermostat schedules.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of automated fare collection (AFC) systems by public transport authorities around the world means that, increasingly, people carry and use passive sensors (embedded inside of public transit tickets) to record their daily movements. Unlike mobile phones, the records held by AFC systems provide a rich and detailed source of data about peoples' transport habits: times of travel, modalities, destinations, trip durations, and fares paid. In this work, we explore the extent that this data offers the possibility to both build and measure future of travel-based ubiquitous computing applications. We focus on two potential end-users: first, how travellers may be aided by feedback mechanisms in order to re-align misperceptions of their travel behaviour and leverage this data to change their habits. In particular, we analyse differences between 85 travellers' surveyed perceptions of their public transport habits and their actual usage of the system. Second, how transport authorities can use this data to measure and implement incentive mechanisms that produce the expected impact. We use anonymised AFC data to measure the extent that financial incentives implemented by London's transport authority (such as peak-hour fares and student discounts) correlate with measurable changes in millions of travellers' behaviours.},

However, tracking becomes more complex when dealing with multiple small objects of similar form. We propose to use tangible mediators for integrating such objects to tabletops. This paper reports on our initial explorations of mediated tabletop interaction consisting of a mediator prototype and a design space definition. We built a mediator, the Rabbit, a device that translates thevalue of an RFID tag into a visual 2D code. The Rabbit rests on the interactive surface, holds the object, reads its passive RFID tag, and converts the read value into a 2D code that can be read by the DIT's built-in camera. When handling multiple objects, the Rabbit iterates through the generated 2D codes. Through a series of participatory activities with end users (molecular biologists), we collected initial feedback from participants and defined a design space for mediated tabletop interaction.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a novel sensor device which recognizes hand shapes using wrist contours. Although hand shapes can express various meanings with small gestures, utilization of hand shapes as an interface is rare in domestic use. That is because a concise recognition method has not been established. To recognize hand shapes anywhere with no stress on the user, we developed a wearable wrist contour sensor device and a recognition system. In the system, features, such as sum of gaps, were extracted from wrist contours. We conducted a classification test of eight hand shapes, and realized approximately 70% classification rate.},

abstract = {Trip detection is a fundamental issue in many context-sensitive information services on mobile devices. It aims to automatically recognize significant places and trips between them. The key challenge is how to minimize energy consumption while maintaining high accuracy. Previous works that use GPS/WiFi sampling are accurate but energy efficiency is low and does not improve over time. Learning from the human decision making process, we propose an energy-efficient trip detection framework that consists of two modes: The deliberation mode learns cell-id patterns using GPS/WiFi based localization methods; the intuition mode only uses cell-ids and learned patterns for trip detection; transition between the two modes is controlled by parameters that are also learned. We evaluated our framework using real-life traces of six people over five months. Our experiments demonstrate that its energy consumption decreases rapidly as users' activities manifest regularity over time.},

abstract = {Since one-third of a smart phone's battery energy is consumed by its WiFi interface, it is critical to switch the WiFi radio from its active or Constantly Awake Mode (CAM), which draws high power (726mW with screen off), to its sleep or Power Save Mode (PSM), which consumes little power (36mW). Applications like VoIP do not perform well under PSM mode however, due to their real-time nature, so the energy footprint is quite high. The challenge is to save energy while not affecting performance. In this paper we present SiFi: Silence prediction based WiFi energy adaptation. SiFi examines audio streams from phone calls and tracks when silence periods start and stop. This data is stored in a prediction model. Using this historical data, we predict the length of future silence periods and place the WiFi radio to sleep during these periods. We implement the design on an Android Smart phone and acheive 40% energy savings while maintaining high voice fidelity.},

However, the high energy consumption of GPS sensing prohibits it to be used continuously in many applications. In this paper, we propose a Low Energy Assisted Positioning (LEAP) solution that carefully partitions the GPS signal processing pipeline and shifts delay tolerant position calculations to the cloud. The GPS receiver only needs to be on for less than a second to collect the sub-millisecond level propagation delay for each satellites signal. With a reference to a nearby object, such as a cell tower, the LEAP server can infer the rest of the information necessary to perform GPS position calculation. We analyze the accuracy and energy benefit of LEAP and use real user traces to show that LEAP can save up to 80% GPS energy consumption in typical trajectory-based service scenarios.},

abstract = {Sensor-enabled smartphones are opening a new frontier in the development of mobile sensing applications. The recognition of human activities and context from sensor-data using classification models underpins these emerging applications. However, conventional approaches to training classifiers struggle to cope with the diverse user populations routinely found in large-scale popular mobile applications. Differences between users (e.g., age, sex, behavioral patterns, lifestyle) confuse classifiers, which assume everyone is the same. To address this, we propose Community Similarity Networks (CSN), which incorporates inter-person similarity measurements into the classifier training process. Under CSN every user has a unique classifier that is tuned to their own characteristics. CSN exploits crowd-sourced sensor-data to personalize classifiers with data contributed from other similar users. This process is guided by similarity networks that measure different dimensions of inter-person similarity. Our experiments show CSN outperforms existing approaches to classifier training under the presence of population diversity.},

Although people know about these risks, sunlight related skin damages have increased over the past decades. We have conducted a survey that sheds light on this phenomenon and suggests that the missing natural sense for UV radiation negatively influences people's sun related behavior. To address this issue, we have implemented Sundroid. Sundroid measures the incident UV radiation using a body-worn sensing unit that communicates wirelessly with the user's smartphone. The phone thereby acts as a user interface to present the measured data in an intuitive manner, and to notify the user once a critical amount of sunlight has been reached. Sundroid can also be applied in other contexts, such as behavioral research or medicine. We show that after calibration, errors are within 5% compared to a high-precision reference signal.},

We present a novel algorithm for detecting coughs from the audio stream of a mobile phone. Our system allows cough sounds to be reconstructed from the feature set, but prevents speech from being reconstructed intelligibly. We evaluate our algorithm on data collected in the wild and report an average true positive rate of 92% and false positive rate of 0.5%. We also present the results of two psychoacoustic experiments which characterize the tradeoff between the fidelity of reconstructed cough sounds and the intelligibility of reconstructed speech.},

abstract = {The idea of continuously monitoring well-being using mobile-sensing systems is gaining popularity. In-situ measurement of human behavior has the potential to overcome the short comings of gold-standard surveys that have been used for decades by the medical community. However, current sensing systems have mainly focused on tracking physical health; some have approximated aspects of mental health based on proximity measurements but have not been compared against medically accepted screening instruments. In this paper, we show the feasibility of a multi-modal mobile sensing system to simultaneously assess mental and physical health. By continuously capturing fine-grained motion and privacy-sensitive audio data, we are able to derive different metrics that reflect the results of commonly used surveys for assessing well-being by the medical community. In addition, we present a case study that highlights how errors in assessment due to the subjective nature of the responses could potentially be avoided by continuous mobile sensing.},

School-based interventions seem like a natural choice, and ubiquitous computing technologies hold much promise for these interventions. Yet the literature contains little guidance for how to approach school-based ubicomp deployments. Grounded in our analysis of a large-scale US school-based intervention for promoting youth physical activity, we present an approach to the design and evaluation of school-based ubicomp that treats the school as a social institution. We show how the school regulates students' daily lives, drawing from work in the sociology of schools to create a framing for planning, executing and analyzing school-based ubicomp deployments. These insights will assist other researchers and designers engaging in deployments of ubiquitous computing systems in settings with established institutional structures.},

People reflect on this data using different tools for personal informatics. However, current tools do not have sufficient understanding of users' self-reflection needs to appropriately leverage Ubicomp technologies. To design tools that effectively assist self-reflection, we need to comprehensively understand what kinds of questions people have about their data, why they ask these questions, how they answer them with current tools, and what kinds of problems they encounter. To explore this, we conducted interviews with people who use various kinds of tools for personal informatics. We found six kinds of questions that people asked about their data. We also found that certain kinds of questions are more important at certain times, which we call phases. We identified two phases of reflection: Discovery and Maintenance. We discuss the kinds of questions and the phases in detail and identify features that should be supported in personal informatics tools for which Ubicomp technologies can play an important role.},

Providing intelligibility has been proposed to help explain to users how context-aware applications work in order to improve user impressions of them. However, we hypothesize that intelligibility may actually be harmful for applications that are very uncertain of their actions. We conducted a large controlled study of a location-aware and a sound-aware application, investigating the impact of intelligibility on understanding, and user impression of applications with varying certainty. We found that intelligibility impacts user impressions, depending on the application's certainty and behavior appropriateness. Intelligibility is helpful for applications with high certainty, but it is harmful if applications behave appropriately, yet display low certainty.},

abstract = {Future ubiquitous home environments can contain 10s or 100s of devices. Ubiquitous services running on these devices (i.e. localizing users, routing, security algorithms) will commonly require an accurate location of each device. In order to obtain these locations, existing techniques require either a manual survey, active sound sources, or estimation using wireless radios. These techniques, however, need additional hardware capabilities and are intrusive to the user. Non-intrusive, automatic localization of ubiquitous computing devices in the home has the potential to greatly facilitate device deployments.This paper presents the PANDAA system, a zero-configuration spatial localization system for networked devices based on ambient sound sensing. After initial placement of the devices, ambient sounds, such as human speech, music, foot- steps, finger snaps, hand claps, or coughs and sneezes, are used to autonomously resolve the spatial relative arrangement of devices using trigonometric bounds and successive approximation. Using only time difference of arrival measurements as a bound for successive estimations, PANDAA is able to achieve an average of 0.17 meter accuracy for device location in the meeting room deployment.},

We look at how these strategies affect compliance, data quality, and retention, and show that when used carefully, micro-payments can be highly beneficial. We find that data quality is different across the micro-incentive schemes we experimented with, and therefore the incentive strategy should be chosen with care. We think that adaptive micro-payment based incentives can be used to successfully incentivize future studies at much lower cost to the study designer, while ensuring high compliance, good data quality, and lower retention issues.},

An important yet missing contextual dimension is the cognitive context that comprises all aspects related to mental information processing, such as perception, memory, knowledge, or learning. In this work we investigate the feasibility of recognising visual memory recall. We use a recognition methodology that combines minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection (mRMR) with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We validate the methodology in a dual user study with a total of fourteen participants looking at familiar and unfamiliar pictures from four picture categories: abstract, landscapes, faces, and buildings. Using person-independent training, we are able to discriminate between familiar and unfamiliar abstract pictures with a top recognition rate of 84.3% (89.3% recall, 21.0% false positive rate) over all participants. We show that eye movement analysis is a promising approach to infer the cognitive context of a person and discuss the key challenges for the real-world implementation of eye-based cognition-aware systems.},

abstract = {As computers begin to move away from screen-based interfaces and become cheaper and more pervasive, their systems will inevitably become more intricate and difficult to understand. Our current modes of communication may become insufficient. Human beings utilize emotions to transform intelligence into appropriate action, to consider circumstances and relationships with others. If our computers can develop stronger emotional connections to their users, our interactions with them will become more meaningful and will develop along with the progress of technology.Emoti-bots are a line of prototypical products for future homes that simulate and stimulate emotion. They are experiments developed in an effort to transform common everyday objects into potential interfaces for computing. They look to the affordances and current uses of those objects to develop more natural, instinctive and emotional methods of human-computer interaction.},

However, designing a successful availability-sharing system requires finding the right balance to maximize the benefits and reduce costs for both the interrupter and interruptee. The main challenges for finding such balance lie in the acquisition of availability information from the interruptee and its delivery to the interrupter. In this demonstration, we show how common technical approaches in ubicomp can address some of the problems typically encountered in availability sharing. We present InterruptMe, a novel availability sharing system that uses sensor information to calculate multiple availability measures for each interruptee and that delivers this information in the periphery of the interrupter's attention by using a projected peripheral display and monitoring implicit inputs to the system.},

This work introduces the "Social fMRI" --- a ubiquitous computing approach that enhances existing methodologies by combining extremely rich data collection in terms of signals, dimensionality, and throughput, together with the ability to conduct targeted experimental interventions with study populations. The proposed research aims to demonstrate the value of the Social fMRI approach via its first instantiation: The Friends and Family living laboratory study, in which a young-family residential community was transformed into a living laboratory for over a year. Using the highly fine-grained and unprecedented longitudinal dataset collected in the study, I aim to show how this approach allows us to gain insights on intricate social mechanisms and interpersonal relationships within the community in ways not possible with traditional approaches. In addition, the mobile-phone based sensing and intervention delivery system developed for this study --- a Social fMRI reference implementation --- is field-proven and robust enough to be reused by other researchers and developers as an open and extensible sensing platform.},

abstract = {People who suffer from Diabetes are required to make frequent decisions on their personal treatment based on results from self-care devices. Yet these results form only a part of the decision-making process and surrounding contextual information is a highly important aspect. Those who suffer from diabetes have described the daily challenges of dealing with unexpected results and a feeling of 'failure' at managing the disease. This paper describes ongoing research which focuses on using technology to assist in the capture of the contextual information to both aid the understanding of results and to potentially reduce the emotional impact of perceived 'bad' results.},

Factors that have hindered its development are the lack of standards and protocols that support QoS and the complexity of designing and implementing WSAN applications. This thesis focus on overcoming these factors by means of a middleware that provides: 1) QoS support, necessary for applications such as the Protection of Critical Infrastructures (CIP), and 2) a flexible programming abstraction that helps the developer to implement WSAN applications and specify their QoS requirements without having to deal with low level repetitive tasks.},

Similar to many interactive paper systems, MixPad adopts a mobile camera-projector unit to recognize paper documents, detect pen and finger gestures and provide visual feedback. Unlike these systems, MixPad allows using mice and keyboards to help users interact with fine-grained document content on paper (e.g. individual words and user-defined arbitrary regions), and to facilitate cross-media operations. For instance, to copy a document segment from paper to a laptop, one first points a finger of her non-dominant hand to the segment roughly, and then uses a mouse in her dominant hand to refine the selection and drag it to the laptop; she can also type text as a detailed comment on a paper document. This novel interaction paradigm combines the advantages of mice, keyboards, pens and fingers, and therefore enables rich digital functions on paper.},

Through the analysis of social media data, Qooqle retrieves relevant information to the users based upon the physical world context they are situated in. Combining mobile, cloud computing, and social media, Qooqle draws people closer to computing and makes computers less visible. The Qooqle system uses Speech Recognition and Gesture Recognition to achieve its natural user interface.

Both are used in a situation in which two users depart from different points simultaneously, but they want to reach common goal. One mode of navigation is used in a situation in which both users want to reach the goal independently. The navigation system calculates each route and arrival time for each user. If the two arrival times differ, then the system suggests another route with a dropping point such as a store or park to the user who will reach the goal earlier. The other navigation is used in a situation in which two users want to join somewhere before reaching a common goal. The navigation system suggests not only a juncture point, but also suggests routes from each departure point to the juncture point, and a route from the juncture point to the goal. We developed a prototype system using the city center of Wakayama as a test area. Using it, we evaluated the proposed navigations.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition through the wearable sensor will enable a next-generation human-oriented ubiquitous computing. However, most of research on human activity recognition so far is based on small number of subjects, and non-public data. To overcome the situation, we have gathered 4897 accelerometer data with 116 subjects and compose them as HASC2011corpus. In the field of pattern recognition, it is very important to evaluate and to improve the recognition methods by using the same dataset as a common ground. We make the HASC2011corpus into public for the research community to use it as a common ground of the Human Activity Recognition. We also show several facts and results of obtained from the corpus.},

abstract = {This paper presents NFC+, a new approach to ubiquitous mobile media sharing. Data can be instantaneously shared in a fast and secure way between users without the presence of Internet. It uses NFC, which has fast setup time but low bandwidth, to exchange both network settings and the media URI, then programmatically configures wireless interfaces to securely connect and transfer the media. Specifically, we propose NFC+Hotspot, which combines NFC with secure Wi-Fi Hotspot mode. It is secure, easy to use, and significantly faster than existing sharing methods. We evaluated various sharing methods, in 2 categories, for both photo and video: 1. Direct Transfer (e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Hotspot), and 2. NFC+ Direct Transfer. Experimental results show that our NFC+Hotspot approach has the fastest photo and video sharing performance, with improvement ranging from 1.8x-3.7x for 1MB photo and 0.7x -- 6.9x for 1 minute HD video compared to (non-NFC+) Direct Transfer methods.},

The system consists of wireless tags and a high-speed projector (DMD Discovery 3000), operating in 8kHz, attached on mobility platform. The projector transmits structured light patterns that contain different information in each pixel. Wireless tags can recognize their own locations in projected area by receiving structured light patterns projected from the projector. Since 3D coordinates of individual tag is stored in the system, projection point is estimated with 3D coordinates and pixel coordinates of each tag in projected area. According to the estimated position and orientation, augmented reality content is superimposed. The set of structured light patterns are projected in sufficient speed that human eye can only perceive the superimposed content. We have also evaluated the accuracy of superimposing augmented reality content on real world from moving projection points.},

There is an immediate need for corresponding progress on the foundational software for exploiting the potential of these new hardware products. This requires research into natural and effective gestural interaction, with careful consideration of the core facilities needed for effective and consistent use. At the same time, an exploration of real-world tabletop applications will provide a basis for studying and advancing the core functionality.In this video, we illustrate several aspects of our ongoing research on interactive surfaces. This includes studying the core functionality of tabletops, such as gestures and interaction primitives, file access, application switching, transfer of information between devices, and user modeling for personalisation. These core functions have been used as the foundation for a number of real-world deployed applications. The key contributions of this work are the novel primitives for tabletops interaction as well as the applications that have been created by building upon them.},

abstract = {In most of the existing video surveillance systems, captured video streams by CCTV or video cameras are aggregated through cables to a central station and monitored by associated human operators. However, the high deployment cost, low scalability and reuseability still remain to be the main roadblock for their wider application. Using human to monitor events can also be unreliable. Accordingly, we designed a ubiquitous wireless video surveillance system. This system uses wireless sensor nodes to detect pre-defined events and utilizes wireless mesh network to transmit high-quality video streams. Without cables, the deployment cost is significantly decreased. Different application users can also define various events and automatically receive notification and corresponding video streams when the events occur. In addition, mobile users, even when roaming, can access this system. In this demo, we introduce the hardware and software of this system and its implementation in our intelligent transportation system testbed.},

abstract = {There have been various approaches to enhance physical performances by adding visuals and/or audio according to the motions of performers. However, these methods were too simple to explain the performers' will of their body expression. Furthermore, they did not consider exceeding the physical limitation of body expression, such as providing the sense of faster movement of arms by changing colors in costumes dynamically. We propose a new LED performance system to expand the expression capability of human body. We can create new generation performances by combining body expression and lighting effects.},

Building upon First International Workshop on Ubiquitous Crowdsourcing, in this edition we challenge researchers and practitioners to identify requirements for a platform for crowd computing, arising from experiences in deployment crowdsourcing applications, which engage crowd members as sensors, controllers and actuators in smart cities and environments. This workshop brings together researchers to produce a vision for the universal crowdsourcing platform, documenting it in a theme publication.},

abstract = {The Casemans 2011 workshop opens a platform to researchers of context-aware computing and self-managing systems to investigate the usefulness of context-awareness in emerging applications such as rescue applications, disaster avoidance and overcoming mechanisms, social networking, etc. These applications typically require timely context information to localise people and to share information based on shared interest as well as situations. An interesting research question is how to define and capture mutual context and how to share information in an efficient manner. Hence, the workshop focuses on context acquisition, modelling, reasoning, actuating techniques.},

PETMEI 2011 provides a forum for researcher from human-computer interaction, context-aware computing, and eye tracking to discuss techniques and applications that go beyond classical eye tracking and stationary eye-based interaction. We aim to discuss the implications of pervasive eye tracking for context-aware computing and to identify the key research challenges of mobile eye-based interaction. The long-term goal is to create a strong interdisciplinary research community linking these research fields together and to establish the workshop as the premier forum for research on pervasive eye tracking and mobile eye-based interaction.},

abstract = {The UbiComp research community has a long history of interdisciplinary research on technology, engineering, and human behavior. But, one disciplinary voice that often seems to be missing is design. Due to the value of design to integrate knowledge and insights from across disciplines and focus on the future world, it seems that design might play a critical role in helping UbiComp research through its holistic approach. China is the world leader in manufacturing, and it is almost never the place where the innovative, high-tech products and services are designed. With UbiComp in China, now seems the perfect time to discuss bridging east and west and bringing design to UbiComp. This workshop aims to provide a disciplinary forum for researchers and experts from design computer science, psychology and anthropology to exchange ideas on the issue of collaboration. It will build understanding across disciplines and explore the potential opportunity for design in UbiComp research and practice.},
