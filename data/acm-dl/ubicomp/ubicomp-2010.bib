abstract = {The shared online calendar is the de facto standard for event organisation and management in the modern office environment. It is also a potentially valuable source of context, provided the calendar event data represent an accurate account of 'real-world' events. However, as we show through a field study, the calendar does not represent reality well as genuine events are hidden by a multitude of reminders and 'placeholders', i.e. events that appear in the calendar but do not occur. We show that the calendar's representation of real events can be significantly improved through data fusion with other sources of context, namely social network and location data. Finally, we discuss some of the issues raised during our field study, their significance and how performance could be farther improved.},

abstract = {Context-aware applications should be intelligible so users can better understand how they work and improve their trust in them. However, providing intelligibility is non-trivial and requires the developer to understand how to generate explanations from application decision models. Furthermore, users need different types of explanations and this complicates the implementation of intelligibility. We have developed the Intelligibility Toolkit that makes it easy for application developers to obtain eight types of explanations from the most popular decision models of context-aware applications. We describe its extensible architecture, and the explanation generation algorithms we developed. We validate the usefulness of the toolkit with three canonical applications that use the toolkit to generate explanations for end-users.},

Participatory sensing initiatives organize individuals to gather sensed information using mobile devices through cooperative data collection. A major factor in the success of these data collection projects is sustained, high quality participation. However, since data capture requires a time and energy commitment from individuals, incentives are often introduced to motivate participants. In this work, we investigate the use of micro-payments as an incentive model. We define a set of metrics that can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of incentives and report on findings from a pilot study using various micro-payment schemes in a university campus sustainability initiative.},

CAM uses a mobile-tagging application which allows designers to collaboratively store relevant information onto their physical design objects in the form of messages, annotations and external web links. The purpose of our field trial was to explore the role of augmented objects in supporting and enhancing creative work. Our results show that CAM was used not only to support participants' mutual awareness and coordination but also to facilitate designers in appropriating their augmented design objects to be explorative, extendable and playful, supporting creative aspects of design work. In general, our results show how CAM transformed static design objects into 'remarkable' objects that made the creative and playful side of cooperative design visible.},

The paper shows that people are capable of providing creative input on their environment using unstructured speech or text and that a good proportion of these comments are actionable. The paper also investigates the use of public displays to auto-summarize comments left by the public so far. Although there is anecdotal evidence that this encourages participation, an experiment found that filtering comments (e.g., to display only positive responses) had no effect on what people had to say.},

In this paper, we present the results of a study conducted in three public schools that use an educational and behavioral intervention for the instruction of social skills in changing situational contexts. The results of this study led to the concept of interaction immediacy to help children maintain appropriate spatial boundaries, reply to conversation initiators, disengage appropriately at the end of an interaction, and identify potential communication partners. We describe design principles for Ubicomp technologies to support interaction immediacy and present an example design. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we present an understanding of social skills in mobile and dynamic contexts. Second, we introduce the concept of interaction immediacy and show its effectiveness as a guiding principle for the design of Ubicomp applications.},

However, people use a rich variety of terms to refer to their locations, such as "home," "Starbucks," or "the bus stop near my house." Our long-term goal is to create a system that can automatically generate appropriate place names based on real-time context and user preferences. As a first step, we analyze data from a two-week study involving 26 participants in two different cities, focusing on how people refer to places in location sharing. We derive a taxonomy of different place naming methods, and show that factors such as a person's perceived familiarity with a place and the entropy of that place (i.e. the variety of people who visit it) strongly influence the way people refer to it when interacting with others. We also present a machine learning model for predicting how people name places. Using our data, this model is able to predict the place naming method people choose with an average accuracy higher than 85%.},

This trend is now impacting location sharing applications (LSAs) such that users are sharing their location data with a much wider and more diverse audience. In this paper, we describe this as social-driven sharing, distinguishing it from past examples of what we refer to as purpose-driven location sharing. We explore the differences between these two types of sharing by conducting a comparative two-week study with nine participants. We found significant differences in terms of users' decisions about what location information to share, their privacy concerns, and how privacy-preserving their disclosures were. Based on these results, we provide design implications for future LSAs.},

Today our understanding of people's location sharing privacy preferences remains very limited, including how these preferences are impacted by the type of location tracking device or the nature of the locations visited. To address this gap, we deployed Locaccino, a mobile location sharing system, in a four week long field study, where we examined the behavior of study participants (n=28) who shared their location with their acquaintances (n=373.) Our results show that users appear more comfortable sharing their presence at locations visited by a large and diverse set of people. Our study also indicates that people who visit a wider number of places tend to also be the subject of a greater number of requests for their locations. Over time these same people tend to also evolve more sophisticated privacy preferences, reflected by an increase in time- and location-based restrictions. We conclude by discussing the implications our findings.},

We discuss the design, implementation and evaluation of the Hapori framework which combines data mining, information preserving embedding and distance metric learning to address the challenge of creating efficient multidimensional models from context-rich local search logs. Our experimental results using 80,000 queries extracted from search logs show that contextual and behavioral similarity information can improve the relevance of local search results by up to ten times when compared to the results currently provided by commercially available search engine technology.},

Since a person's motion path, as observed by the camera, must match the local motion measurements from their phone, we are able to uniquely identify people with the phones' IDs by detecting the statistical dependence between the phone and camera measurements. For this, we express the problem as consisting of a two-measurement HMM for each person, with one camera measurement and one phone measurement. Then we use a maximum a posteriori formulation to find the most likely ID assignments. Through sensor fusion, our method largely bypasses the motion correspondence problem from computer vision and is able to track people across large spatial or temporal gaps in sensing. We evaluate the system through simulations and experiments in a real camera network testbed.},

Mobile and ubiquitous technologies have been proposed to tackle this challenge, mainly in the form of memory aid solutions that remind patients to take their pills. However, most of these methods do not engage patients in shifting their behavior towards better compliance. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a mobile phone-based game called MoviPill that persuades patients to be more adherent to their medication prescription by means of social competition. In a 6-week user study conducted with 18 elders, the use of MoviPill improved both their compliance to take the daily medication and also the accuracy of the drug intake time according to the prescribed time. Moreover, the improvement in the latter increased from 43% to 56% when we considered only participants that had any interest in games, which reveals the importance of applying persuasive techniques in a personalized manner. We conclude with a set of implications for the design of persuasive mobile solutions in this domain.},

abstract = {This paper presents ElectriSense, a new solution for automatically detecting and classifying the use of electronic devices in a home from a single point of sensing. ElectriSense relies on the fact that most modern consumer electronics and fluorescent lighting employ switch mode power supplies (SMPS) to achieve high efficiency. These power supplies continuously generate high frequency electromagnetic interference (EMI) during operation that propagates throughout a home's power wiring. We show both analytically and by in-home experimentation that EMI signals are stable and predictable based on the device's switching frequency characteristics. Unlike past transient noise-based solutions, this new approach provides the ability for EMI signatures to be applicable across homes while still being able to differentiate between similar devices in a home. We have evaluated our solution in seven homes, including one six-month deployment. Our results show that ElectriSense can identify and classify the usage of individual devices with a mean accuracy of 93.82%.},

abstract = {Energy use in the home is a topic of increasing interest and concern, and one on which technology can have a significant impact. However, existing work typically focuses on moderately affluent homeowners who have relative autonomy with respect to their home, or does not address socio-economic status, class, and other related issues. For the 30% of the U.S. population who rent their homes, many key decisions regarding energy use must be negotiated with a landlord. Because energy use impacts the bottom line of both landlords and tenants, this can be a source of conflict in the landlord/tenant relationship. Ubicomp technologies for reducing energy use in rental units must engage with landlord/tenant conflicts to be successful. Unfortunately, little detailed knowledge is available about the impact of landlord/tenant conflicts on energy use. We present an analysis of a series of qualitative studies with landlords and tenants. We argue that a consideration of multiple stakeholders, and the power imbalances among them, will drive important new research questions and lead to more widely applicable solutions. The main contribution of our work is a set of open research questions and design recommendations for technologies that may affect and be affected by the conflict between stakeholders around energy use.},

abstract = {A persistent concern of wireless sensors is the power consumption required for communication, which presents a significant adoption hurdle for practical ubiquitous computing applications. This work explores the use of the home powerline as a large distributed antenna capable of receiving signals from ultra-low-power wireless sensor nodes and thus allowing nodes to be detected at ranges that are otherwise impractical with traditional over-the-air reception. We present the design and implementation of small ultra-low-power 27 MHz sensor nodes that transmit their data by coupling over the powerline to a single receiver attached to the powerline in the home. We demonstrate the ability of our general purpose wireless sensor nodes to provide whole-home coverage while consuming less than 1 mW of power when transmitting (65 ¼W consumed in our custom CMOS transmitter). This is the lowest power transmitter to date compared to those found in traditional whole-home wireless systems.},

Consisting of a power harvesting circuit, piezoelectric sensor, ultra-low-power 16-bit microcontroller, 16-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and a 433 MHz wireless transmitter, WATTR is capable of sampling home water pressure at 33 Hz and transmitting over 3 m when any water fixture in the home is opened or closed. WATTR provides an alternative sensing solution to the power intensive Bluetooth-based sensor used in the HydroSense project by Froehlich et al. [2] for single-point whole-home water usage. We demonstrate WATTR as a viable self-powered sensor capable of monitoring and transmitting water usage data without the use of a battery. Unlike other water-based power harvesters, WATTR does not waste water to power itself. We discuss the design, implementation, and experimental verification of the WATTR device.},

We introduce a novel set of location-based features for analyzing the social context of a geographic region, including location entropy, which measures the diversity of unique visitors of a location. Using these features, we provide a model for predicting friendship between two users by analyzing their location trails. Our model achieves significant gains over simpler models based only on direct properties of the co-location histories, such as the number of co-locations. We also show a positive relationship between the entropy of the locations the user visits and the number of social ties that user has in the network. We discuss how the offline mobility of users can have implications for both researchers and designers of online social networks.},

Grounded in real decisions about real data, our findings highlight the potential for end-user involvement in obfuscation of their own location data.},

abstract = {Cell tower triangulation is a popular technique for determining the location of a mobile device. However, cell tower triangulation methods require the knowledge of the actual locations of cell towers. Because the locations of cell towers are not publicly available, these methods often need to use estimated tower locations obtained through wardriving. This paper provides the first large scale study of the accuracy of two existing methods for cell tower localization using wardriving data. The results show that naively applying these methods results in very large localization errors. We analyze the causes for these errors and conclude that one can localize a cell accurately only if it falls within the area covered by the wardriving trace. We further propose a bounding technique to select the cells that fall within the area covered by the wardriving trace and identify a cell combining optimization that can further reduce the localization error by half.},

Most reported TUI systems have the nature of research prototypes, available in laboratories or museums. This paper reports an attempt to understand the impact of TUIs in users' everyday environments through 2 low-cost simple set-up tangible interfaces for music that can be freely downloaded from a website. The systems are based on computer vision, printed paper and audio output. A few hundreds of users downloaded them and played with them. We logged users interaction with the interfaces and analysed content posted by them on our own and other web sites to observe and evaluate how they relate to such novel systems, taking measures to protect their privacy. Both the interaction logs and the users' comments indicate that the tangible interfaces were accepted as normal: they were perceived just as interfaces to make music rather than esoteric systems.

Fifteen participants received only on-screen instructions, and 15 received both on-screen and micro-projected instructions. In contrast to prior work, which focused only on whole tasks, our study examines the benefit of augmenting common task instructions. The augmented instructions improved participants' performance overall; however, we show that in certain cases when projected guides and physical objects visually interfered, projected elements caused increased errors. Our results demonstrate that examining effectiveness at an instruction level is both useful and necessary, and provide insight into the design of systems that help users perform everyday tasks.},

Moreover, the system is programmable by means of a declarative language that can be used to express adaptive rules to improve power saving. We evaluate a system prototype on Nokia Symbian phones by means of several small-scale experiments aimed at testing performance in terms of accuracy and power consumption.

We cross-validate our measurements with the results obtained through questionnaires filled by the users, and the results presented in social psychological studies using traditional methods. In particular, we show how speakers and participants' emotions can be automatically detected by means of classifiers running locally on off-the-shelf mobile phones, and how speaking and interactions can be correlated with activity and location measures.},

Although changes in individual behavior are intertwined with contagion, epidemiologists today do not have sensing or modeling tools to quantitatively measure its effects in real-world conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel application of ubiquitous computing. We use mobile phone based co-location and communication sensing to measure characteristic behavior changes in symptomatic individuals, reflected in their total communication, interactions with respect to time of day (e.g., late night, early morning), diversity and entropy of face-to-face interactions and movement. Using these extracted mobile features, it is possible to predict the health status of an individual, without having actual health measurements from the subject. Finally, we estimate the temporal information flux and implied causality between physical symptoms, behavior and mental health.},

abstract = {Accurate, real-time measurement of energy expended during everyday activities would enable development of novel health monitoring and wellness technologies. A technique using three miniature wearable accelerometers is presented that improves upon state-of-the-art energy expenditure (EE) estimation. On a dataset acquired from 24 subjects performing gym and household activities, we demonstrate how knowledge of activity type, which can be automatically inferred from the accelerometer data, can improve EE estimates by more than 15% when compared to the best estimates from other methods.},

abstract = {Anyone within range of an 802.11 wireless network ("Wi-Fi") can use free software to collect the unencrypted web traffic of others on the network. However, many Wi-Fi users are completely unaware of the risk that this creates. This work aims to improve users' awareness about what they expose to others on Wi-Fi networks and provide them with some control. Our system, the Wi-Fi Privacy Ticker, displays information about the exposure of sensitive terms that are sent to and from a user's computer and prevents the unencrypted transmission of terms from the user's computer that she has identified as highly sensitive. In a three-week field study with 17 participants, we found that the Wi-Fi Privacy Ticker improved participants' awareness of the circumstances in which their personal information is transmitted. We show that this heightened awareness contributed to changes in their behavior while on Wi-Fi.},

abstract = {A fairly common modern setting entails users, each in possession of a personal wireless device, wanting to communicate securely, via their devices. If these users (and their devices) have no prior association, a new security context must be established. In order to prevent potential attacks, the initial context (association) establishment process must involve only the intended devices and their users.A number of methods for initial secure association of two devices have been proposed; their usability factors have been explored and compared extensively. However, a more challenging problem of initial secure association of a group of devices (and users) has not received much attention. Although a few secure group association methods have been proposed, their usability aspects have not been studied, especially, in a comparative manner. This paper discusses desirable features and evaluation criteria for secure group association, identifies suitable methods and presents a comparative usability study. Results show that some simple methods (e.g., peer- or leader-based number comparisons) are quite attractive for small groups, being fast, reasonably secure and well-received by users.},

abstract = {Battery interfaces provide important feedback about how much time users can continue using their mobile devices. Based on this information, they may develop mental models of the types of activities, tasks, and applications they can use before needing to recharge. Many of today's battery interfaces tend to report energy in coarse granularities or are highly inaccurate. As a result, users may find it difficult to depend on the estimates given. We conducted a survey with 104 participants to understand how users interact with various mobile battery interfaces. Based on the survey results, we designed and prototyped a task-centered battery interface on a mobile device that shows more accurate information about how long individual and combinations of tasks with several applications can be performed. Our pilot study of eight users demonstrated that fine-grained information separated by tasks can help users be more effective with and increase their understanding of their device's battery usage.},
