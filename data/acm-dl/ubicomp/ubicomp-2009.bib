abstract = {Mobile privacy concerns are central to Ubicomp and yet remain poorly understood. We advocate a diversified approach, enabling the cross-interpretation of data from complementary methods. However, mobility imposes a number of limitations on the methods that can be effectively employed. We discuss how we addressed this problem in an empirical study of mobile social networking. We report on how, by combining a variation of experience sampling and contextual interviews, we have started focusing on a notion of context in relation to privacy, which is subjectively defined by emerging socio-cultural knowledge, functions, relations and rules. With reference to Gieryn's sociological work, we call this place, as opposed to a notion of context that is objectively defined by physical and factual elements, which we call space. We propose that the former better describes the context for mobile privacy.},

abstract = {Detecting visits to semantically meaningful places is important for many emerging mobile applications. We present PlaceSense, a place discovery algorithm suitable for mobile devices that exploits pervasive RF-beacons. By relying on separate mechanisms to detect entrance to and departure from a place and buffering overlapping data for subsequent visits, it is more robust than the state-of-the-art, especially in detecting short visits, places where people are mobile, or where inconsistent beacons are prevalent due to interference. We experimentally evaluate PlaceSense's effectiveness in discovering semantically meaningful places, and compare with other approaches that use coordinates or RF-beacon fingerprints. Our results demonstrate that PlaceSense correctly discovers 92% (compared to between 28% and 65% for previous work) of the visited places and accurately detects their entrance and departure times from both real-life and scripted data sets.},

abstract = {To usefully query a location-based service, a mobile device must typically present its own location in its query to the server. This may not be acceptable to clients that wish to protect the privacy of their location. This paper presents the design and implementation of SybilQuery, a fully decentralized and autonomous k-anonymization-based scheme to privately query location-based services. SybilQuery is a client-side tool that generates k-1 Sybil queries for each query by the client. The location-based server is presented with a set of k queries and is unable to distinguish between the client's query and the Sybil queries, thereby achieving k-anonymity. We tested our implementation of SybilQuery on real mobility traces of approximately 500 cabs in the San Francisco Bay area. Our experiments show that SybilQuery can efficiently generate Sybil queries and that these queries are indistinguishable from real queries.},

abstract = {In this work we investigate eye movement analysis as a new modality for recognising human activity. We devise 90 different features based on the main eye movement characteristics: saccades, fixations and blinks. The features are derived from eye movement data recorded using a wearable electrooculographic (EOG) system. We describe a recognition methodology that combines minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection (mRMR) with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. We validate the method in an eight participant study in an office environment using five activity classes: copying a text, reading a printed paper, taking hand-written notes, watching a video and browsing the web. In addition, we include periods with no specific activity. Using a person-independent (leave-one-out) training scheme, we obtain an average precision of 76.1% and recall of 70.5% over all classes and participants. We discuss the most relevant features and show that eye movement analysis is a rich and thus promising modality for activity recognition.},

abstract = {We explore a dense sensing approach that uses RFID sensor network technology to recognize human activities. In our setting, everyday objects are instrumented with UHF RFID tags called WISPs that are equipped with accelerometers. RFID readers detect when the objects are used by examining this sensor data, and daily activities are then inferred from the traces of object use via a Hidden Markov Model. In a study of 10 participants performing 14 activities in a model apartment, our approach yielded recognition rates with precision and recall both in the 90% range. This compares well to recognition with a more intrusive short-range RFID bracelet that detects objects in the proximity of the user; this approach saw roughly 95% precision and 60% recall in the same study. We conclude that RFID sensor networks are a promising approach for indoor activity monitoring.},

In this paper, we ask an interesting question: can we transfer the available labeled data from a set of existing activities in one domain to help recognize the activities in another different but related domain? Our answer is "yes", provided that the sensor data from the two domains are related in some way. We develop a bridge between the activities in two domains by learning a similarity function via Web search, under the condition that the sensor data are from the same feature space. Based on the learned similarity measures, our algorithm interprets the data from the source domain as the data in the domain with different confidence levels, thus accomplishing the cross-domain knowledge transfer task. Our algorithm is evaluated on several real-world datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness.},

We propose inAir, a tool for measuring, visualizing, and learning about indoor air quality. inAir provides historical and real-time visualizations of indoor air quality by measuring tiny hazardous airborne particles as small as 0.5 microns in size.

Our initial results for our novel scheme which we call "FootSLAM" are very surprising in that true SLAM with stable relative positioning accuracy of 1-2 meters for pedestrians is indeed possible based on inertial sensors alone without any prior known building indoor layout. Furthermore, the 2D maps obtained even for just 10 minutes of walking converge to a good approximation of the true layout forming the basis for future automated collaborative mapping of buildings.},

The key idea of SessionMagnifier is to enable an extended browser on a mobile device and a regular browser on a public computer to collaboratively support a Web session. This approach simply requires a SessionMagnifier browser extension to be installed on a trusted mobile device. A user can securely perform sensitive interactions on the mobile device and conveniently perform other browsing interactions on the public computer. We implemented SessionMagnifier for Mozilla's Fennec browser and evaluated it on a Nokia N810 Internet Tablet. Our evaluation and analysis demonstrate that SessionMagnifier is simple, secure, and usable.},

We examine information infrastructures in mid-sized urban slums of Mumbai and Bangalore in three ways--1) highlighting technologies supporting social networks, 2) examining underlying notions of trust and privacy in building information networks, and 3) discussing protocols and practices around shared access. We then discuss our thoughts on designing for low-income, low-literacy, and resource-challenged communities, presenting new ways to think about the design of ubiquitous technologies for international development. We argue for collaborative exchange between the established strengths of the Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) and Ubicomp communities to generate new ways of shaping technologies towards poverty alleviation in previously neglected socio-economic contexts--Ubicomp4D.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a study of responses to the idea of being recorded by a ubicomp recording technology called SenseCam. This study focused on real-life situations in two North American and two European locations. We present the findings of this study and their implications, specifically how those who might be recorded perceive and react to SenseCam. We describe what system parameters, social processes, and policies are required to meet the needs of both the primary users and these secondary stakeholders and how being situated within a particular locale can influence responses. Our results indicate that people would tolerate potential incursions from SenseCam for particular purposes. Furthermore, they would typically prefer to be informed about and to consent to recording as well as to grant permission before any data is shared. These preferences, however, are unlikely to instigate a request for deletion or other action on their part. These results inform future design of recording technologies like SenseCam and provide a broader understanding of how ubicomp technologies might be taken up across different cultural and political regions.},

abstract = {Economic incentives are a powerful way of shaping consumer behavior towards more commercially efficient and environmentally sustainable patterns. In this paper, we explore the idea of combining pervasive computing techniques with electronic payment systems to create activity-based micro-incentives. Users who consume additional resources by e.g., occupying an air-conditioned space instead of a normal space are levied additional micro-payments. In an alternative approach, consumers who choose to save resources are rewarded with micro-rebates off the price of a service. As a result, the cost of using a service corresponds more closely with the resources used, leading market mechanisms to allocate resources efficiently. A key challenge is designing incentive mechanisms that alter consumer behavior in the desired fashion. We introduce four incentive models, and present evaluation results suggesting that consumers make different decisions depending on which model is used.},

abstract = {This study of mobile persuasion system explores the use of a mobile phone, when attached to an everyday object used by an everyday behavior, becomes a tool to sense and influence that behavior. This mobile persuasion system, called Playful Bottle system, makes use of a mobile phone attached to an everyday drinking mug and motivates office workers to drink healthy quantities of water. A camera and accelerometer sensors in the phone are used to build a vision/motion-based water intake tracker to detect the amount and regularity of water consumed by the user. Additionally, the phone includes hydration games in which natural drinking actions are used as game input. Two hydration games are developed: a single-user TreeGame with automated computer reminders and a multi-user ForestGame with computer-mediated social reminders from members of the group playing the game. Results from 7-week user study with 16 test subjects suggest that both hydration games are effective for encouraging adequate and regular water intake by users. Additionally, results of this study suggest that adding social reminders to the hydration game is more effective than system reminders alone.},

However, users may not be interested in all the information that the applications can produce. Using scenarios of four real-world applications that span the design space of context-aware computing, we conducted two experiments to discover what information users are interested in. In the first experiment, we elicit types of information demands that users have and under what moderating circumstances they have them. In the second experiment, we verify the findings by soliciting users about which types they would want to know and establish whether receiving such information would satisfy them. We discuss why users demand certain types of information, and provide design implications on how to provide different intelligibility types to make context-aware applications intelligible and acceptable to users.},

abstract = {Mobile teamwork requires people to maintain good situational awareness (SA) about their real world environments. Current mobile devices are highly portable, but their user interfaces (UIs) require too deep of focus of attention to allow their users to use them and simultaneously maintain SA. As a result, some mobile practitioners have little or no access to useful computer-based interactive services. Inspired by existing projector-camera systems, this paper studies the feasibility of developing a wearable projector-camera system that enables users to access human-computer interaction (HCI) services without negatively affecting their SA. A functional prototype of the "Interactive Dirt" system was developed using inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf technologies. A field experiment was conducted as a formative evaluation to test the utility of the prototype under extreme mobile teamwork requirements for SA--military stability and support operations (SASO). Results show strong potential to increase performance of mobile teams.},

The SwimMaster consists of acceleration sensors with micro-controllers and feedback interface modules that swimmer wear while swimming. With four different evaluation studies and a total of 22 subjects we demonstrate the functionality and power of the SwimMaster system. We show how a wide range of swim parameters can be monitored and used for a continuous swim performance evaluation. These parameters include the time per lane, the swimming velocity and the number of strokes per lane. Also swim style specific factors like the body balance and the body rotation are extracted. Finally three feedback modalities are tested and evaluated. With these means we show the ability of the SwimMaster to assist a swimmer in achieving the desired exercise goals by constantly monitoring his/her swim performance and providing the necessary feedback to achieve the desired workout goals.},

abstract = {In 2007, approximately 30% of US adults were obese, with related health care costs exceeding 100 billion dollars. Clearly, the obesity epidemic represents a growing societal concern. One challenge in weight control is the difficulty of tracking food calories consumed and calories expended by activity. This paper presents a system for automatic monitoring of calories expended using a single body-worn accelerometer. Our system uses activity inference combined with signal analysis to estimate calories expended in real-time using regression formulas developed by the American College of Sports Medicine. To validate our system, we have collected data from 51 subjects in a laboratory setting using a treadmill and a more natural field test. Actual caloric expenditure was determined using the medical "gold standard" measurement, of oxygen consumption. We are able to achieve 89% accuracy with lab data and 79% with field data -- both high enough to be useful in practice.},

abstract = {Recent work has examined infrastructure-mediated sensing as a practical, low-cost, and unobtrusive approach to sensing human activity in the physical world. This approach is based on the idea that human activities (e.g., running a dishwasher, turning on a reading light, or walking through a doorway) can be sensed by their manifestations in an environment's existing infrastructures (e.g., a home's water, electrical, and HVAC infrastructures). This paper presents HydroSense, a low-cost and easily-installed single-point sensor of pressure within a home's water infrastructure. HydroSense supports both identification of activity at individual water fixtures within a home (e.g., a particular toilet, a kitchen sink, a particular shower) as well as estimation of the amount of water being used at each fixture. We evaluate our approach using data collected in ten homes. Our algorithms successfully identify fixture events with 97.9% aggregate accuracy and can estimate water usage with error rates that are comparable to empirical studies of traditional utility-supplied water meters. Our results both validate our approach and provide a basis for future improvements.},

abstract = {A key prerequisite for residential energy conservation is knowing when and where energy is being spent. Unfortunately, the current generation of energy reporting devices only provide partial and coarse grained information or require expensive professional installation. This limitation stems from the presumption that calculating per-appliance consumption requires per-appliance current measurements. However, since appliances typically emit measurable signals when they are consuming energy, we can estimate their consumption using indirect sensing. This paper presents ViridiScope, a fine-grained power monitoring system that furnishes users with an economical, self-calibrating tool that provides power consumption of virtually every appliance in the home. ViridiScope uses ambient signals from inexpensive sensors placed near appliances to estimate power consumption, thus no in-line sensor is necessary. We use a model-based machine learning algorithm that automates the sensor calibration process. Through experiments in a real house, we show that ViridiScope can estimate the end-point power consumption within 10% error.},

Despite the attention paid to this area, few researchers have specifically explored these issues within a community that makes up approximately 30% of U.S. households -- those below the federal poverty line. We present a study of 26 low-income households in two very different locations -- a small town in the Southern U.S. and a northerly metropolitan area. Through a photo-elicitation study and directed interviews, we explore the relationship between energy saving behaviors, external factors, and users' intrinsic values and beliefs. Most of our participants are committed to saving energy for non-financial reasons, even when not responsible for paying bills. Challenges to saving energy include safety and lack of control over the environment. We discuss how Ubicomp technologies for saving energy can address some of these challenges.},
