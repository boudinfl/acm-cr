abstract = {While developing distributed systems, like for example a smart environment, a powerful middleware is required - not only for the communication between different devices, but also to support the developers. In this paper, we discuss our system, which has been developed with a special focus on the needs in research and teaching in ubiquitous computing. It is based on a tuple space as underlying storage and a simple network protocol. The system turns out to be very well suited for both application areas.},

Second one is Smart-M3, which is a semantic information sharing architecture for smart spaces. It aims at opening physical world information for the use of services and applications in the information world, thus enabling new types of mash-up applications.

However, the utilization of these novel input devices would provide opportunities for new and more natural user experiences beyond the traditional keyboard-mouse-touch paradigm. For example, it should be possible to use the accelerometer in a mobile phone as the input device for a game running on a PC. In this demonstration, we showcase a virtual device framework which enables the sharing of embedded peripherals between heterogeneous computing devices over any IP-based network in an application agnostic manner. We further show examples of use cases which utilize this framework to provide a richer and more natural user experience for existing desktop applications.},

abstract = {An important feature of a modern mobile device is that it can position itself. Not only for use on the device but also for remote applications that require tracking of the device. To be useful, such position tracking has to be energy-efficient to avoid having a major impact on the battery life of the mobile device. To address this challenge we have build a system named EnTracked that, based on the estimation and prediction of system conditions and mobility, schedules position updates to both minimize energy consumption and optimize robustness. In this demonstration we would like to show how the system can lower the energy consumption and remain robust as pedestrians targets move around in the city center of Copenhagen.},

abstract = {When deploying an indoor 3D WSN, it is important to be able to determine positions of the sensor nodes that achieve the full-coverage of the target space and the connectivity between the sensor nodes with the minimum deployment cost. The sensor node deployment problem for 3D coverage and connectivity is NP-hard even without obstacles in the target field. Furthermore, no study has systematically examined the optimal 3D WSN deployment considering both obstacles and deployment cost. We have developed a heuristic algorithm for computing a near optimal solution that minimizes the cost for achieving the full coverage and node connectivity in a 3D target space with obstacles. We have implemented the algorithm in the smartspace simulator UbiREAL so that the designers can interactively determine the near-optimal sensor node positions thorough visualization of the achievable coverage and the sensor positions on a 3D virtual space. In this demonstration, we show, for different configurations of the target space and WSN parameters, how the tool computes the sensor positions and visualizes the results such as achievable covered area, sensor positions, and the total cost.},

These properties expand the typical range of possible interactions with digital displays in museums. Our goal is to encourage the collaborative investigation of a rich information space presented on an Ambient Display in a museum exhibit. We consider two different models of interacting with an exhibit: Tangible Control, wherein passive RFID tags are embedded in some artifacts and multiple users can control the information on the screen by moving those artifacts, and Embodied Control, wherein people directly carry an RFID tag and interact with the information by walking within the simulation space. Each model has different implications for how the visitors might relate (a) to the information being displayed, and (b) to one another. Here we present preliminary results on the suitability of a single-reader and passive tag setup for providing localization input.},

Goals such as talking to someone or visiting a specific place are set by a therapist and patients are required to complete them usually following a certain sequence. Currently, therapists are unable to control this process as the procedures are usually supported by paper artifacts and, most of the times, take place outside the office. This leads to the therapist's inability to promote collaborative efforts and to reinforce positive attitudes, affecting both the therapy process and its results.In this paper we present a software system that relies on mobile devices to support geo-referenced collaborative in-situ group therapy.

Acoustic localization solutions are also increasingly becoming important and feasible due to recent advances in personal portable computing devices (e.g. smart phones, PDAs and laptops), where rapidly deployable distributed fine-grain acoustic localization systems can help to locate mobile users and devices for using in location-aware interfaces and applications. However, while a number of acoustic localization systems have been proposed over the last few decades, these generally require the use of expensive dedicated microphone arrays and have been developed only for a single or limited number of acoustic events, tailored to specific scenarios. Many different types of acoustic events exist in our everyday environments, hence, in this work we address the general problem of how to localize multiple classes of acoustic events in a distributed sensor environment. We propose a framework for detecting and locating events (e.g., speech, clicks, footsteps, or the sound of an object put down on a table) according to generic acoustic characteristics and present a preliminary evaluation.},

abstract = {In densely populated urban areas high amounts of traffic pose a major problem, which affects the environment, economy, and our lives. From a user's perspective, the main issues include delays due to traffic jams, lack of parking space and high costs due to increasing fuel prices (e.g., if commuting long distances). Collective transportation (CT), e.g., public transport systems, provides a partly solution to these issues. Yet, CT does not support door-to-door transportation hence reducing convenience; it might be limited in off-peak hours, and it is still a cost factor when traveling long distances. A solution to these issues is ride sharing, an evolving form of CT making alternative transportation more affordable. In this paper we present a modular, context-aware ride sharing platform. We aim at enhancing convenience, reliability, and affordability of different forms of ride sharing by means of context data. Addition-ally our approach supports an easy server- and client-side expansion due to the modular platform structure.},

Unlike ants, humans can use their intelligence in selecting routes. Our idea is to compile such intelligence by accumulating the history of people's rational behaviors and leaving this history as digital pheromones in the environment for later use. In simulations of navigation services, we found that the original ant colony optimization (ACO), which is a metaheuristic based on the foraging activity of ants, does not completely fit our purpose. Therefore, two modifications were made to the original ACO. Our simulation results show that people can be successfully navigated by simulated services implemented using these modified ACOs.},

Students specify initial simulation conditions by sticking pieces of paper to a wall, and can experiment with the simulation by repositioning the pieces of paper. Computer vision recognizes the paper-based symbols and converts them into parameters used by the simulation. This tangible input approach contrasts with current slider- and programming-based approaches for interacting with simulations.

One such barrier is the problem of communicating with people in different time zones. To address this problem, we propose the CU-Later system which considers the time difference between two locations. CU-Later is a system which allows synchronizing activities across time zones by displaying recorded video of a remote activity after a time shift. As one example of its use, the system connects two remote dining tables and lets users see and hear each other having dinner despite actually having done so at different times. We discuss the design of this system and a preliminary field test of time-shifted video.},

The "Social Medicine Box" is a system which notifies the status of the elderly taking medicines as well as their feeling a picture sent automatically to their family. The elderly can also get feedback and communicate with their family as well as their social network (e.g. Twitter and Facebook).

However, on many occasions, the need to share this information will occur away from a computer. As an alternative, a mobile phone could be used. However, inputting the information via the phone can be time-consuming and even intrude on the user's other tasks. This will increase the likelihood that the information is lost or retrospective. By tagging physical objects using Near-Field Communication (NFC) technology, MyState provides a way for users to make the environment (to which the information is associated) interactive. Bysimply touching these objects with their NFC phone, they can quickly and conveniently publish this information to the virtual world. A Facebook application was used to exemplify the concept and explore the different ways in which users personalize these tagged interfaces to address their own needs.},

To explore this design space, we prototyped a mobile media space called Peek-A-Boo that provides two-way live video sharing between a mobile phone and a digital frame in the home. Family members can use the media space to gather availability awareness and also share episodes of everyday life by augmenting voice calls with shared video. These features can help family members feel more connected when separated by distance through sharing experiences in the moment.},

abstract = {Even though the coordination of kids' activities is largely successful, the modern dual income family still regularly experiences breakdowns in their practices. Families often rely on routines to help them coordinate when plans prove less effective. Routines, however, are rarely documented, challenging to express in detail, and frequently evolving, making them cumbersome to manually describe and so largely unavailable to computational systems as input. This work proposes that this disconnect can be overcome, and argues that unsupervised models of family routine can be learned using a single, lightweight sensor. This way, the successful but tacit knowledge of the routine might be captured and exploited by learning systems, providing a new kind of information for families and computational systems alike. A method is proposed to develop a Bayesian Network to reason about the state of family coordination. This model relies on learned routines of pickup and drop-off at kids' activities.},

However, this invisibility keeps users from understanding and adopting them. To address this problem we introduce the notion of Infrastructure Awareness (IA). IA is the user's awareness about properties of an infrastructure. Our hypothesis is that IA facilitates the users' understanding of infrastructures, and thereby supports their adoption. This dissertation investigates three dimensions of IA: conceptual, methodological, and technological. The conceptual dimension defines IA in terms of an awareness model and a design space. The methodological dimension reflects on the usage of user-centred design when designing for invisibility, and proposes a new user-centred design activity for IA systems. The technological dimension creates two proof-of-concept applications, GridOrbit and GridNotify, to illustrate the notion of IA systems.},

Thereby, it's possible that several context providers offer information of the same type (e.g. location) but differ in quality levels (e.g. accuracy), representations (e.g. position represented in coordinates and as an address) and cost (e.g. battery consumption) for providing the information. Therefore comprehensive support is required for selecting and activating ((de-)activation of local providers to save resources) one of the context providers.},

abstract = {Providing sustainable energy is one of the fundamental challenges for mankind. With energy usage being a part of everyday activities and with the increasingly diversity of energy creation this is an inherently multi-disciplinary problem. Transportation and travel, heating and cooling, manu-facturing and production are major areas in which energy is used and all these domains become more and more linked to ubiquitous computing. With an increase in decentralized energy provision, ranging from energy harvesting in devices to personal green power plants, a great potential for creating sustainable energy arises, however at the cost of a higher complexity of the distribution network and storage mechanisms. Overall we believe that research in ubiquitous computing can provide important contributions for a world with sustainable energy. In this workshop we hope to get people from different disciplines together to share their visions and insights on how to conserve, efficiently produce, use, and distribute energy.},

abstract = {This workshop continues the series of UbiHealth work-shops organized at the Ubicomp conferences. So far, the majority of work presented in earlier workshops and in the field of ubiquitous healthcare has focused on supporting people affected by somatic diseases. This year we call special attention on emerging research towards ubiquitous technologies for mental health and wellbeing. It is known that mental disorders are common diseases affecting all countries and societies. In recent years there have been various studies on correlating mental disease symptoms to objective physiological and behavioral measures in clinical settings. However, the current standard for diagnosis is still based on subjective clinical rating scales developed in the early 1960s. We see a new opportunity to exploit ubiquitous technology to provide the therapist with objective physiological and behavioral measures from the patient's daily life. The workshop will bring together researchers from ubiquitous computing and mental health professionals to present and discuss the latest work, focusing on how ubiquitous computing technology can be employed to design and support diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders and maintenance of mental wellness.},

abstract = {Social relationships between co-workers, family members and friends play an important role in our everyday lives. They are responsible for our well-being, for a productive working atmosphere and for feeling part of our various communities. Nevertheless, it can be difficult to establish and maintain such relationships if individuals are spatially separated, e. g. working in different branch offices of a corporation, as they usually cannot interact and communicate in a natural, everyday manner. In the past, significant effort has been put into the development of planned, explicit interaction methods such as email, chat or video-conferencing. In contrast to that, much less is known about techniques to enable casual, spontaneous interactions between spatially separated social groups, e.g., occasional meetings on the office floor, by the means of implicit and more subtle methods. SISSI 2010 brings together academia and industry to present new ways of facilitating, establishing and maintaining social relationships by the means of ubiquitous systems, in order to achieve a feeling of togetherness, presence and closeness between members of spatially separated professional or private social groups. The audience of SISSI is interdisciplinary, including researchers from human computer interaction, pervasive communication, spatial cognition and communication sciences.},

However, an overview of successful strategies to overcome research challenges inherent to wide deployment is not yet available. App store platform characteristics, devices, reaching target users, new types of evaluation data and dynamic, heterogeneous usage contexts have to be dealt with.

abstract = {Web 2.0 provides the technological foundations upon which the crowdsourcing paradigm evolves and operates, enabling networked experts to work on various problem solving and data-intensive tasks. During the past decade crowdsourcing grew from a number of purpose-built initiatives, such as Wikipedia and Mechanical Turk, to a technique that today attracts and engages over 2 million people worldwide. As the computing systems are becoming more intimately embedded in physical and social contexts, promising truly ubiquitous computing, crowdsourcing takes new forms. Increasingly, crowds are engaged through mobile devices, to capture, share and validate sheer amount data (e.g. reporting security threats or capturing social events).This workshop challenges researchers and practitioners to think about three key aspects of ubiquitous crowdsourcing. Firstly, to establish technological foundations, what are the interaction models and protocols between the ubiquitous computing systems and the crowd? Secondly, how is crowdsourcing going to face the challenges in quality assurance, while providing valuable incentive frameworks that enable honest contributions? Finally, what are the novel applications of crowdsourcing enabled by ubiquitous computing systems?},
