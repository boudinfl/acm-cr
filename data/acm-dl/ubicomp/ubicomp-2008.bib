In this paper placement refers to the position within a single body part (e.g, lower arm). We show how, within certain limits and with modest quality degradation, motion sensorbased activity recognition can be implemented in a displacement tolerant way. We first describe the physical principles that lead to our heuristic. We then evaluate them first on a set of synthetic lower arm motions which are well suited to illustrate the strengths and limits of our approach, then on an extended modes of locomotion problem (sensors on the upper leg) and finally on a set of exercises performed on various gym machines (sensors placed on the lower arm). In this example our heuristic raises the displaced recognition rate from 24% for a displaced accelerometer, which had 96% recognition when not displaced, to 82%.},

abstract = {Recognizing and understanding the activities of people from sensor readings is an important task in ubiquitous computing. Activity recognition is also a particularly difficult task because of the inherent uncertainty and complexity of the data collected by the sensors. Many researchers have tackled this problem in an overly simplistic setting by assuming that users often carry out single activities one at a time or multiple activities consecutively, one after another. However, so far there has been no formal exploration on the degree in which humans perform concurrent or interleaving activities, and no thorough study on how to detect multiple goals in a real world scenario. In this article, we ask the fundamental questions of whether users often carry out multiple concurrent and interleaving activities or single activities in their daily life, and if so, whether such complex behavior can be detected accurately using sensors. We define several classes of complexity levels under a goal taxonomy that describe different granularities of activities, and relate the recognition accuracy with different complexity levels or granularities. We present a theoretical framework for recognizing multiple concurrent and interleaving activities, and evaluate the framework in several real-world ubiquitous computing environments.},

These memory cues enable the recollection of significant experiences, which is important for people with EMI to regain a sense of normalcy in their lives. However, lifelogging technologies often collect an overwhelmingly large amount of data to review. The best memory cues need to be extracted and presented in a way that best supports episodic recollection. We describe the design of a new lifelogging system that captures photos, ambient audio, and location information and leverages both automated content/context analysis and the expertise of family caregivers to facilitate the extraction and annotation of a salient summary consisting of good cues from the lifelog. The system presents the selected cues for review in a way that maximizes the opportunities for the person with EMI to think deeply about these cues to trigger memory recollection on his own without burdening the caregiver. We compare our system with another review system that requires the caregiver to repeatedly guide the review process. Our self-guided system resulted in better memory retention and imposed a smaller burden on the caregiver whereas the caregiver-guided approach provided more opportunities for caregiver interaction.},

We use this dataset to optimize a first-principles physical model of the commonly used velocity damped resonant generator (VDRG) by selecting physical parameters such as resonant frequency and damping coefficient to maximize harvested power. Our results show that with reasonable assumptions on size, mass, placement, and efficiency of VDRG harvesters, most body-mounted wireless sensors and even some consumer electronics devices, may be powered continuously and indefinitely from everyday motion.},

abstract = {In this work we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel eye tracker for context-awareness and mobile HCI applications. In contrast to common systems using video cameras, this compact device relies on Electrooculography (EOG). It consists of goggles with dry electrodes integrated into the frame and a small pocket-worn component with a DSP for real-time EOG signal processing. The device is intended for wearable and standalone use: It can store data locally for long-term recordings or stream processed EOG signals to a remote device over Bluetooth. We describe how eye gestures can be efficiently recognised from EOG signals for HCI purposes. In an experiment conducted with 11 subjects playing a computer game we show that 8 eye gestures of varying complexity can be continuously recognised with equal performance to a state-of-the-art video-based system. Physical activity leads to artefacts in the EOG signal. We describe how these artefacts can be removed using an adaptive filtering scheme and characterise this approach on a 5-subject dataset. In addition to explicit eye movements for HCI, we discuss how the analysis of unconscious eye movements may eventually allow to deduce information on user activity and context not available with current sensing modalities.},

A particular approach by Patel et al. suggested leveraging of the residential powerline as the signaling mechanism for a domestic location capability. In this paper, we critically examine that initial work, called powerline positioning (PLP). We find the proposed technique lacking in temporal stability, requiring frequent and undesired recalibration in some environments. We also determine that there is no a priori method to determine a pair of signaling frequencies that will reliably work in any space. We propose a wideband approach to PLP (WPLP) that injects up to 44 different frequencies into the powerline. We show that this WPLP approach improves upon overall positioning accuracy, demonstrates greatly improved temporal stability and has the added advantage of working in commercial indoor spaces.},

Instead, CILoS uses fingerprints of signal delay that are robust to cell resizing. We demonstrate that CILoS achieves a median accuracy of 5 meters, and compares favourably to RSSI fingerprinting systems. We highlight the significance of wide fingerprints, constructed through scanning multiple channels, for achieving high localization accuracy. We also show that our system can accurately differentiate between floors of a multifloor building.},

Indeed, some of the central challenges that ubicomp currently faces in moving from prototypes that work in restricted environments to the complexity of real-world environments -- e.g. difficulties in scalability, integration, and fully formalizing context -- echo some of the major issues that have challenged AI researchers over the history of their field. In this paper, we explore a key moment in AI's history where researchers grappled directly with these issues, resulting in a variety of novel technical solutions within AI. We critically reflect on six strategies from this history to suggest technical solutions for how to approach the challenge of building real-world, usable solutions in ubicomp today.},

We report on a study investigating the effect of sampling frequency of self-reports of two routine activities (sitting and walking) on recall accuracy and annoyance. We used a novel wearable sensor platform that runs a real time activity inference engine to collect in situ ground truth. Our results suggest that a sampling frequency of five to eight times per day may yield an optimal balance of recall and annoyance. Additionally, requesting self-reports at regular, predetermined times increases accuracy while minimizing perceived annoyance since it allows participants to anticipate these requests.

In this paper, we use a qualitative method from public policy to elicit reflective feedback from end-users about technologies that they may not yet have used nor fully comprehend. Our study uncovers information about end-user perceptions of RFID, including a range of "folk theories" held by the public about this technology, and their associations of it with certain social groups and values. We argue that these perceptions can limit technological adoption, and conclude with a discussion of challenges for the design and deployment of ubiquitous computing systems.},

We show that we can observe private activities in the home such as cooking, showering, toileting, and sleeping by eavesdropping on the wireless transmissions of sensors in a home, even when all of the transmissions are encrypted. We call this the Fingerprint and Timing-based Snooping (FATS) attack. This attack can already be carried out on millions of homes today, and may become more important as ubiquitous computing environments such as smart homes and assisted living facilities become more prevalent. In this paper, we demonstrate and evaluate the FATS attack on eight different homes containing wireless sensors. We also propose and evaluate a set of privacy preserving design guidelines for future wireless ubiquitous systems and show how these guidelines can be used in a hybrid fashion to prevent against the FATS attack with low implementation costs.},

'Plastic' captures the way technologies, specifically computers, have integrated into the heterogeneous rhythms of daily life. Plastic technologies harmonize with and support daily life by filling opportunistic gaps, shrinking and expanding until interrupted, not demanding conscious coordination, supporting multitasking, and by deferring to external contingencies.},

abstract = {Rising global energy demands, increasing costs and limited natural resources mean that householders are more conscious about managing their domestic resource consumption. Yet, the question of what tools Ubicomp researchers can create for residential resource management remains open. To begin to address this omission, we present a qualitative study of 15 households and their current management practices around the water, electricity and natural gas systems in the home. We find that in-the-moment resource consumption is mostly invisible to householders and that they desire more real-time information to help them save money, keep their homes comfortable and be environmentally friendly. Designing for domestic sustainability therefore turns on improving the visibility of resource production and consumption costs as well as supporting both individuals and collectives in behavior change. Domestic sustainability also highlights the caveat of potentially creating a green divide by making resource management available only to those who can afford the technologies to support being green. Finally, we suggest that the Ubicomp community can contribute to the domestic and broader sustainability agenda by incorporating green values in designs and highlight the challenge of collecting data on being green.},

An evaluation of our system found that users prefer to use a mediated resolution approach when their preferences about outcome are very different from others', but have no preferred method when their preferences about outcome are similar to others'.},

In support of this involvement we present an infrastructure and a tangible deployment tool. Active participation of users is essential in a domestic environment as it offers simplicity, greater usercentric control, lower deployment costs and better support for personalization. Our proposed infrastructure provides the foundation for end user deployment utilizing a loosely coupled framework to represent an artefact and its augmented functionalities. Pervasive applications are built independently and are expressed as a collection of functional tasks. A runtime component, FedNet maps these tasks to corresponding service provider artefacts. The tangible deployment tool uses FedNet and allows end users to deploy and control artefacts and applications only by manipulating RFID cards. Primary advantages of our approach are two-fold. Firstly, it allows end users to deploy ubicomp systems easily in a Do-it-Yourself fashion. Secondly, it allows developers to write applications and to build augmented artefacts in a generic way regardless of the constraints of the target environment. We describe an implemented prototype and illustrate its feasibility in a real life deployment session by the end users. Our study shows that the end users might be involved in deploying future ubicomp systems if appropriate tools and supporting infrastructure are provided.},

abstract = {Context-aware computing is a key paradigm of ubiquitous computing in which applications automatically adapt their operations to dynamic context data from multiple sources. Managing a number of distributed sources, a middleware that facilitates the development of context-aware applications must provide a uniform view of all these sources to the applications. Local schemas of context data from individual sources need to be matched into a set of global schemas in the middleware, upon which applications can issue context queries to acquire data. In this paper, we study this problem of schema matching for context-aware computing. We propose a multi-criteria algorithm to determine candidate attribute matches between two schemas. The algorithm adaptively adjusts the priorities of different criteria based on previous matching results to improve the efficiency and accuracy of succeeding operations. We further develop an algorithm to categorize a new local schema into one of the global schemas whenever possible via a shared attribute dictionary. Our results based on schemas from real-world websites demonstrate the good matching accuracy achieved by our algorithms.},

abstract = {Both recognizing human behavior and understanding a user's mobility from sensor data are critical issues in ubiquitous computing systems. As a kind of user behavior, the transportation modes, such as walking, driving, etc., that a user takes, can enrich the user's mobility with informative knowledge and provide pervasive computing systems with more context information. In this paper, we propose an approach based on supervised learning to infer people's motion modes from their GPS logs. The contribution of this work lies in the following two aspects. On one hand, we identify a set of sophisticated features, which are more robust to traffic condition than those other researchers ever used. On the other hand, we propose a graph-based post-processing algorithm to further improve the inference performance. This algorithm considers both the commonsense constraint of real world and typical user behavior based on location in a probabilistic manner. Using the GPS logs collected by 65 people over a period of 10 months, we evaluated our approach via a set of experiments. As a result, based on the change point-based segmentation method and Decision Tree-based inference model, the new features brought an eight percent improvement in inference accuracy over previous result, and the graph-based post-processing achieve a further four percent enhancement.},

Spyn uses computer vision techniques in combination with patterns of infrared ink printed on yarn to correlate locations in knit fabric with messages recorded during the knitting process.

TM produces abstract visualizations on a large LCD every few minutes, driven by a set of four overhead cameras that capture a sense of the social life of a domestic space. The openness and ambiguity of TM allow for a cycle of co-interpretation with householders. We report on three longitudinal deployments of TM for a period of six weeks. Participant families engaged with TM at the outset to understand how their behaviors were influencing the machine, and, while TM remained puzzling, householders interacted richly with TM and its images. We extract some key design implications for an experience-focused smart home.},

abstract = {For a robot providing services to people in a public space such as a train station or a shopping mall, it is important to distinguish potential customers, such as window-shoppers, from other people, such as busy commuters. In this paper, we present a series of techniques for anticipating people's behavior in a public space, mainly based on the analysis of accumulated trajectories, and we demonstrate the use of these techniques in a social robot. We placed a ubiquitous sensor network consisting of six laser range finders in a shopping arcade. The system tracks people's positions as well as their local behaviors such as fast walking, idle walking, or stopping. We accumulated people's trajectories for a week, applying a clustering technique to the accumulated trajectories to extract information about the use of space and people's typical global behaviors. This information enables the robot to target its services to people who are walking idly or stopping. The robot anticipates both the areas in which people are likely to perform these behaviors, and also the probable local behaviors of individuals a few seconds in the future. In a field experiment we demonstrate that this system enables the robot to serve people efficiently.},
