abstract = {The carved acrylic boards have become popular along with the diffusion of carving machines (e.g., laser cutters). When a carved acrylic board is illuminated from its side, the carved patterns emerged beautifully. We propose an interactive technique, "AcrySense", which can add input functions to a carved acrylic board in a simple and inexpensive configuration. The AcrySense mainly consists of LEDs, Photo Transistors and a microcomputer attached under a carved acrylic board. This paper describes the concept and implementation of the system.},

abstract = {As displays in public space are augmented with sensors, such as the Kinect, they enable passersby to interact with the content on the screen. As of today, feedback on the user action in such environments is usually limited to the visual channel. However, we believe that more immediate and intense forms, in particular haptic feedback, do not only increase the user experience, but may also have a strong impact on user attention and memorization of the content encountered during the interaction. Haptic feedback can today be achieved through vibration on the mobile phone, which is strongly dependent on the location of the device. We envision that fabrics, such as underwear, can in the future be equipped with electrical muscle stimulation, thus providing a more natural and direct way of haptic feedback. In this demo we aim to showcase the potential of applying electrical muscle stimulation as direct haptic feedback during interaction in public spaces in the context of a Kinect-based game for public displays.},

Our application runs on a smartphone or a tablet and its target space is a shelf. By aiming a mobile phone or tablet camera at a collection of items present on a shelf, a user can browse and interact with the items through the smartphone or tablet.The shelf is termed as smart shelf and it is equipped with the RFID system that makes it a smart space. All the items present on a shelf are RFID-tagged, so they can be inventoried and their locations are calculated with the help of the RFID system.

Using the concept of Third Place, this research focuses on the social potential of urban public space using the concepts of, especially the role of space in connecting people and fostering social capital. Our hypothesis is that interactive urban lighting can assist this role of urban public space. Openlight is a concept of networked interactive lighting that provides urbanites with open access to penetrate psychological barriers between individuals and groups in urban public space. Hence the interaction would provide more possibilities for urbanites becoming more aware of and getting to know each other. For this first attempt, we have created a scaled prototype for a Caf\'{e}/Restaurant setting.},

Designing a low-cost system that serves the goal of saving energy while not forcing people to compromise their personal comfort is important for future smart commercial buildings. Proactive energy saving actions from users in the buildings are the key to achieving this goal. In this paper, we present Mahalo, an energy saving system, which leverages users through social gaming. By incentivizing energy saving actions from end users with a sensing-based feedback control system, the system reduces installation needs and improves understanding of the users preferences.},

Integrating interactive elements in a public display, such as (virtual) Keyboards and Webcams, can additionally stimulate in-situ content production. Both social media content and such in-situ content are cheap to produce, always fresh, and potentially community sourced, thus increasing relevance for passersby. However, not all social media applications and content entries may be appropriate in a particular display setting and showing user contributed content on public displays requires new forms of content control and scheduling. In this demo we show: 1) a control interface for display owners to manage the overall behavior of their displays, and 2) post-moderation mechanisms for controlling and removing potentially inappropriate user contributed content from public displays. The control interface and moderation mechanisms are designed for a university environment and were inspired by two short pilot test deployments and a focus group with the university officials.},

One of the challenges with such a novel communication medium is integrating it with existing user communicative ecology -- current information and communication technologies that are already well established and highly used by the general population, e.g., Facebook and Instagram. As one of the most popular activities on these networks is photo sharing a possible solution for integrating networked public displays could be in allowing users to use it as both input and output device for images, i.e., allowing them to a) post situated snapshots onto Facebook through an on-display camera and b) show images on the screens taken through Instagram. In order to replicate what is happening with the images online comments and likes posted about images are also shown on the screen. In this demo we show two applications: 1) Moment Machine -- a public display application that allows taking situated snapshots through on-display camera and posting them to Facebook; and 2) Moments Gallery -- a public display application that shows images, comments, and likes for photos submitted through Instagram and Facebook.},

Our preliminary findings suggest that people were (to our surprise) not questioning the inner workings of our system. Through engaging with the system, individuals felt being part of the exhibition.

However, the invisible and embedded nature of UbiComp systems prevents users from naturally perceiving active sensors or even the presence of systems.

We propose PriFi beacons to support users in perceiving ongoing observations and potential disturbances from systems in the user's current environment. Privacy awareness information is piggybacked on WiFi beacons by leveraging their information elements. The information is extracted by an Android-based privacy client and presented to the user in a privacy awareness interface.},

abstract = {Daily work such as household chores are generally boring and monotonous and tend to be thought of as routine work. Work songs have been written and sung by workers to reduce their labor load. In addition, text-to-song synthesizer software such as Yamaha's VOCALOID is commonly used by a wide variety of computer music creators. We developed a real-time music synthesizer called -- conteXinger -- that sings lyrics based on the listener's context, including the use of home appliances (such as a vacuum cleaner, refrigerator, microwave oven, or dish washer), and Internet information (such as SNS messages, Web news, and weather reports). By presenting the synthesized music to a user through a home audio system or headphones, our system entertains users who may be bored from their everyday work routine.},

TaskShadow-W provides the functionality of session management to guarantee the continuous experience of web browsing. It supports an NFC-based interaction to activate the migration in a user-friendly way.

Additionally, the sender dynamically adapts the frame rate with respect to inertial sensor readings in order to keep the scene change between consecutive frames small and prevent strong artifacts from the frame interpolation.},

We experimentally show that such an eavesdropper can infer the type of social ties between mobile users better than an internal attacker.},

We then devise models to estimate their social behaviour or attributes based on these measurements and systematically evaluate the feasibility of such a set-up. Since we only use a single triaxial accelerometer per person, our results are surprisingly accurate and suggest that further socially relevant information could also be extracted. Our systematic evaluations provide a deeper understanding of how to better model socially relevant information in the future.},

Context---as a representation of the environment where the system operates---plays a key role in WSN applications, which must often adapt their operation depending on environmental conditions. We argue that promoting a notion of context as a first-class citizen in WSN programming facilitates the design and implementation of context-dependent functionality. To this end, we conceive a context-oriented programming model expressly tailored to WSNs, coupled with dedicated language constructs. Unlike the existing literature on COP, we embed the latter within low-level C-like languages that do not rely on resource-intensive features such as dynamic memory management. To make our design concrete, we describe a context-oriented extension of nesC---a widely used WSN programming language---and report on a preliminary assessment of our design.},

It allows the system to move from the detection of individual swallows which is too unreliable for practical applications to an analysis of the statistical distribution of swallow frequency. Such an analysis allows the detection of "nutrition events" such as having lunch or breakfast. It also allows us to see the general level of activity and distinguish between just being absolutely quiet (no motion) and sleeping. The neckband can be useful in a variety of applications such as cognitive disease monitoring and elderly care.},

The appearance context is about one's facial expression, body image, gaze, posture, gesture, etc. Appearance monitoring in a fine-grained and momentary manner enables total recall of a user, i.e., not only what the user perceives but also how the user is perceived by others. In this poster, we propose FaceLog, a face logging service which automatically and opportunistically captures user's everyday face.},

abstract = {A variety of applications (app) installed on smart phones do greatly enrich our lives, but make it more difficult to organize our screens and folders. Predicting apps that will be in use next can benefit users a lot. In this poster, we propose some light-weighted Bayesian methods to predict the next app based on the app usage history. The evaluation on Mobile Data Challenge (MDC) dataset gives very encouraging results. In addition, we suggest a natural way to integrate the app prediction features to the user interface. Users would find it convenient to access the predicted apps with simple touches.},

As already presented in [6] those devices are highly influenced by constraints, mainly regarding power management. In fact, mobile batteries are limited in time and there are no efficient methods able to manage power consumption. Even knowing the device Time To Live (TTL) is currently left to the user experience. In this paper, we presented MPower, a system able to predict the mobile device TTL, providing also the user with suggestions on the optimal device configuration w.r.t. the desired TTL. This allows the user to manage the available power resources, according to his/her needs, avoiding power wasting.},

The sensor is woven with common weaving machines with a special manner and its material is a common low-cost conductive fiber that does not use special and costly materials, such as optical fiber. The sensor mechanism is supported by the textile structure; thus our sensor has durability for frictional force and scratch occurring sometime in daily context. In this paper, we also introduce two example usages of our textile sensor: a bed-size body pressure sensor for anti-pressure-ulcer treatment and a wearable foot-pressure sensor for walk and skill analyses.},

In string instrument playing, the combination of bowing speed, position, bow pressure and bow to string contact point and angle are the basic factors of the right hand sound production. To measure these parameters, we developed an optical, contactless sensor system to complete existing pressure measurement systems. It consists of emitters, infrared (IR) or colored light emitting diodes (LEDs) on the bow and IR or color receivers on the violin. The precision of the measurement data obtained with this setup is sufficient to investigate the main parameters of bowing and sound production.},

The system uses sensors to acquire disabled parking spot availability information which is disseminated to registered users in real time. Utilising such information, users can drive directly towards spots currently available or even reserve one of them. Upon arrival, legitimate users are able to verify themselves through a simple text message, a special device or a smart phone application.

Our approach involves a handheld interaction device that recognizes smart things in its view using state-of-the-art visual object recognition techniques. It then augments the camera feed with appropriate interaction primitives such as knobs or buttons for control, and can also display measured values, for instance, when recognizing a sensor. The interaction primitives are generated from user interface descriptions that are embedded in the Web representations of the smart things. Our prototype implementation achieves frame rates that allow for interactive use of the system by human users, and indeed proved to facilitate the interaction with smart things in a demonstration testbed in our research group.},

abstract = {Facilitating the interaction of human users and machines with smart devices is important to drive the successful adoption of the Internet of Things in people's homes and at their workplaces. In this poster contribution, we present an approach to support users controlling smart devices in their environment. To do this, we propose to embed semantic metadata in the representations of smart things. By means of this metadata and a semantic reasoning service, our system enables users to specify a desirable state of their smart environment and produces a machine-readable description that details which steps are necessary to reach this state, where each step corresponds to a Web request to a smart device. A client application that could, for instance, run on the user's smartphone, can distill the necessary steps required to reach the user's goal state from this description and execute them to modify the smart environment on behalf of the user.},

abstract = {Nowadays, brick and mortar retailers face a strong competition with online commerce. Instant feedback, product comparison or recommendations are relevant advantages of online commerce over traditional physical retailers. Ubiquitous Computing technologies such as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) can help to bring the benefits of online commerce to brick and mortar stores. We have been using RFID EPC Gen2 to identify and track garments in fitting rooms and point-of-sales in a real store in Barcelona, Spain. In this work we present the initial results of a real-customer model analysis using RFID data. We demonstrate how by analyzing basket and fitting room information we can extract differentiated patterns in the customers behavior. This model is intended to be used as part of an in-store recommender system and stock information. Future work includes improvement of data collection and customer identification},

This work presents a Tele-Immersive Photograph system (TI-Photograph), which allows children and their remote parents to take pictures together in a virtual space with interactive behaviors. First, we propose a robust video object cutout method to segment the video of the child and the remote parent from their background surroundings. Second, we introduce a user behavioral intention driven video composition method to adaptively merge the segmented videos of the users into a same shared background customized by natural gesture interaction. Then we create an illusion that the child and the parent are immersed in the same environment. Experimental results demonstrate that the visual appearance in a shared interactive environment provides closer and efficient communication between remote family members.},

Recent studies have shown that auxiliary cueing in the form of video, audio, or haptic feedback can improve the gait performance in PD patients. We have developed a new platform to support gait rehabilitation in PD patients based on a wearable system able to produce real-time feedback to the user in a comfortable and effective way. Using a set of custom wearable inertial sensors, with advanced on-board processing capabilities, our application employs a smartphone to analyze in real time the patient's gait and to return an appropriate real time audio bio-feedback (ABF) message to the user to correct and improve gait performance. The main advantages of the system are mobility and unobtrusiveness: it can be comfortably worn and carried by the patient with no range restrictions, giving the possibility to monitor and rehabilitate the patient in real-life scenarios, both indoors and outdoors.},

abstract = {The paper proposes EverCopter, which provides continuous and adaptive over-the-air sensing with detachable wired flying objects. While a major advantage of sensing systems with battery-operated MAVs is a wide sensing coverage, sensing time is limited due to its limited amount of energy. We propose dynamically rechargeable flying objects, called EverCopter. EverCopter achieves both long sensing time and wide sensing coverage by the following two characteristics. First, multiple EverCopters can be tied in a row by power supply cables. Since the root EverCopter in a row is connected to DC power supply on the ground, each EverCopter can fly without battery. This makes their sensing time forever, unless the power supply on the ground fails. Second, the leaf EverCopter can detach itself from the row in order to enjoy wider sensing coverage. An EverCopter, while it is detached, runs with its own battery-supplied energy. When the remaining energy becomes low, it flies back to the row to recharge the battery.},

We design and implement a system that tracks I/O activities of smartphones in real-time and dynamically changes storage configuration by matching I/O patterns in order to reduce energy consumption. Our system is evaluated on the 20 most popular applications from Android Market, and our results show that the optimal configurations save from 21% to 52% of battery life. We believe that they highlight a new and interesting direction in which the topic of smartphone energy consumption can be further evaluated and expanded upon.},

Second, we present SCPL, a RF-based device-free people counting and localization technique. SCPL takes the calibration data collected with one person and the map information to accurately count people sequentially and localize them in parallel.

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) was initially proposed to connect specific things via the Internet using devices, such as RFID readers, to realise intelligent identification and management. This vision has since expanded to include a more diverse range of devices, services and networks to become an Internet of anything, anywhere, connected, anyhow. Security and privacy management for the IoT remains a core challenge.Many IoT devices maybe may have zero or minimal security by design because they are low resource, low power devices, designed to work as closed vertical services. Security threats and risks may be higher because devices are unattended, use local wireless communication that have no or weak encryption making them more susceptible to eavesdropping and because users find security too unusable to setup and operate and hence leave devices relatively unsecure. It may also be less problematic to reproduce and fake data sources, access nodes and data sinks that interact with IoT devices in order to attack devices or the services they access. Devices can be moved between or removed from private, communal, public and hostile physical spaces. There is a higher risk of a loss of privacy for human users and organisations because of an increased ability to eavesdrop, because of wireless networks with soft boundaries, and because embedded environment devices can sense smaller amounts of physical trails with a greater degree of sensitivity and accuracy. A specific focus is on the need for IoT security to adapt. The adaptation has multiple dimensions. We can adapt existing conventional security models to more effectively secure an IoT. We can adapt security pre-planned and unplanned context changes such as different moving around in different physical spaces. IoT systems can be designed to self-adapt. IoT systems need to adapt to the active (re) configuration and maintenance of IoT devices and systems of devices by users and by artificial agents.The proposed workshop intends to bring together researchers and practitioners from relevant fields to present and disseminate the latest on-going research focussing on adapting security, privacy &amp; management for the Internet of Things. It aims to facilitate knowledge transfer and synergy, bridge gaps between different research communities and groups, to lay down foundation for common purposes, and to help identify opportunities and challenges for interested researchers and technology and system developers.},

At the present time, wearable computing is undergoing a new paradigm shift: the wearable systems that used to be transportable devices are actually weaving itself into "the fabric of everyday life" (as predicted by Weiser). Indeed, the current trend of wearable computing is integrating the technology directly in the garments without introducing new body-worn systems. Clothes, shoes, eye-glasses, bracelets and watches are becoming smarter, seamlessly embedding more and more powerful computational resources and communication possibilities. The change has already begun and this workshop aims to bring together researchers from the academia and the industry in order to establish a multidisciplinary community interested in discovering and exploring the challenges and opportunities coming from this natural evolution of wearable computing.},

In this paper, we propose an alternative that allows for inference though a collaborative mechanism which does not require the profiling of individual users. This alternative utilises a suffix tree as its core underlying data structure, where predictions are computed over an aggregate record of behaviours of all users. We evaluate the performance of our model on the Nokia Mobile Data Collection Campaign data set and find that the collective approach performs well compared to individual user models. We also find that the commonly used Hit and Miss score on its own does not provide sufficient indication of prediction accuracy, and that employing additional metrics using the mean error may be preferable.},

Using yearly data from public sources it was possible to predict user location in a time frame of 8 hours with accuracy of up to 69%.One assumption of the above modeling is that user location is stationary in time. However, it is more natural to assume user location patterns may vary over time. For example one user may change job, or the relationship status, and avoid certain places frecuented in the past.In this paper we propose a learning mechanism adapting user location forecasting to behavior changes over time. Our model is able to predict for up to 94 weeks with 43% of accuracy.},

abstract = {Context prediction is a key technique for proactive environments adapting to user's needs. To prevent wrong predictions is one key factor to achieve a high user acceptance. A wrong prediction could be caused by faulty or disturbed sensor data. With the triumph of the Smartphone, a wide range of context sources has become ubiquitous. Often, context prediction approaches today do not utilize these multiple context sources to cope with faulty or disturbed sensor data. We propose and evaluate an approach that uses multiple context sources and exploits the correlations between context sources of one user to get a more fault tolerant prediction.},

The evaluation of approaches in this area typically requires massive datasets of measurements from deployed sensors in real prototypes. While a few datasets obtained by real smart homes are freely available, they are not sufficient for comparing different approaches and techniques in a variety of configurations. In this work, we propose a smart home dataset generation strategy based on a simulated environment populated with virtual autonomous agents, sensors and devices which allow to customize and reproduce a smart space using a series of useful parameters. The simulation is based on declarative process models for modeling habits performed by agents, an action theory for realizing low-level atomic actions, and a 3D virtual execution environment. We show how different configurations generate a variety of sensory logs that can be used as input to a state-of-the-art activity recognition technique in order to evaluate its performance under parametrized scenarios, as well as provide guidelines for actually building real smart homes.},

abstract = {Context sensing is an important part of building ubiquitous smart and assistive environments. It is the major data source for intention recognition and strategy generation systems. Device-free localization systems (DFL) join the efforts of non-instrumentation of users maintaining their privacy.In recent publications we propose an innovative approach utilizing a cluster of passive Radio Frequency Identification Transponders (pRFID) for device-free radio-based positioning. Due to the point that the RFID technology is typically not designed for that purpose we have to deal with certain drawbacks. A high number of transponders typically conclude in lower measurement frame rates while generating substantially more information for accurate positioning.To fix this tradeoff this work presents a transponder clustering approach based on inherent EPC protocol based bit masking, which allows us to calculate fast coarse grained localization results and increase the precision by time, so that the user is able to adjust between localization speed and accuracy.We made simulations and conducted experiments in an indoor room DFL scenario for validation.},

Our method uses the properties of the signal subspace, which are estimated using signal eigenvectors of the covariance matrix obtained from an antenna array (array sensor) at the receiver side. To classify human activities (e.g., standing and moving) and/or positions, we apply a machine learning method with support vector machines (SVM). We compare the classification accuracy of the proposed method with signal subspace features and received signal strength (RSS). We analyze the impact of antenna deployment on classification accuracy in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) environments to prove the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, we compare our classification method with k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The experimental results show that the proposed method with signal subspace features provides accuracy improvements over the RSS-based method.},

abstract = {WiFi-based device-free localization is a main indoor localization technique that has attracted much attention recently. Typically, due to the complex wireless propagation in indoor environments, WiFi-based device-free localization requires a construction of a fingerprint map that captures the signal strength characteristics when the human is standing at certain locations in the area of interest. This fingerprint requires significant overhead in construction, and thus has been one of the major drawbacks of WiFi-based device-free localization. In this paper, we leverage an automated tool for fingerprint constructions to study novel scenarios for WiFi-based device-free localization training and testing that are difficult to evaluate in a real environment. In particular, we examine the effect of changing the access points (AP) mounting location, AP technology upgrade, and outsider effect; on the accuracy of the localization system. Our analysis provides recommendations for better localization and provides insights for both researchers and practitioners.},

Consumers now know very little about where their food has come from, leading potentially to less sustainable practices and less engagement with what they eat and drink.We present the concept of reconnecting food (in this particular example, coffee) and consumers through design interventions in the High Street, employing digital innovations based on concepts from the Internet of Things and pervasive public displays. Two interventions carried out within the setting of J. Atkinson &amp; Co. coffee and tea merchants in Lancaster City are discussed. We document the research processes, interaction design and their implementation in relation to notions of reconnecting products and consumers. Future interventions within the setting are also presented in order to demonstrate the on-going dialogue between researchers and retailers. We show that through exploring reconnection through storytelling within a retail environment there is potential to tackle the issues raised in the paper and engage with retailers and consumers.},

By using such wearable sensors, these devices can estimate its posture or status. However, most of current devices only utilize these sensors for simple orientation and gesture recognition. More deep understandings and recognition of human activity through these sensors will enable the next-generation human-oriented computing. To enable the real-world application by these kinds of wearable sensors, a large scale human activity sensing corpus might play an important role. Additionally, we have now a lot of high-performance mobile devices in real-world such as smart-phones. It is a great challenge to utilize such an enormous number of wearable sensors to collect a large-scale activity corpus. In recent years, there are several ongoing projects which are collecting human activities. In this workshop, we are planning to share these experiences of current research on the human activity corpus and its applications among the researchers and the practitioners and to have a deep discussion for future of activity sensing.},

abstract = {In the area of activity recognition, many systems using accelerometers have been proposed. Common method for activity recognition requires raw data labeled with ground truth to learn the model. To obtain ground truth, a wearer records his/her activities during data logging through video camera or handwritten memo. However, referring a video takes long time and taking a memo interrupts natural activity. We propose a labeling method for activity recognition using an execution sequence of activities. The execution sequence includes activities in performed order, does not include time stamps, and is made based on his/her memory. Our proposed method partitions and classifies unlabeled data into segments and clusters, and assigns a cluster to each segment, then assign labels according to the best-matching assignment of clusters with the user-recorded activities. The proposed method gave a precision of 0.812 for data including seven kinds of activities. We also confirmed that recognition accuracy with training data labeled with our proposal gave a recall of 0.871, which is equivalent to that with ground truth.},

abstract = {In the wearable computing environment, a computer provides many kinds of services by using the values from wearable sensors to recognize the user's movements or situations. In the research on activity recognition, accelerometers are attached on the user's body such as wrists, waist and, feet. Though researches on best sensor placement for context aware systems has been released thus far, they do not use enough number of sensors to really decide the best sensor placement. When using these context aware systems in our daily life, we also need to consider the discomfort that the user gets from attaching the sensors. The sensor might get in the user's way or feel uncomfortable for the user, however, as far as we know, the sensor's wearability is not taken into consideration in these researches. This paper proposes an evaluation function that scores sensor placement considering both recognition accuracy and sensor wearability, with twenty sensors on the user's body and thirty kinds of exercises including aerobic exercise, weight training, and yoga. Then we experimentally evaluated sensor placement, resulted in high degree of accuracy achieved without feeling stressful.},

abstract = {Existing wearable sensor-based activity recognition techniques lack fault tolerance in the case of sensors data loss, such as communication disconnection and sensor failure. Compensating for missing data is one method to improve robustness and can be done by three levels in activity recognition: raw data level, feature value level, and classifier level. Our study proposes a method to compensate for the missing sensor data using an ARAR algorithm and compares this method with a previous method for compensating for the feature value using kernel regression in the feature value level. The ARAR algorithm method predicts future data from existing sequence data. We conducted some experiments to verify the usefulness of the proposed methods. Specifically, the prediction performance was evaluated by applying the ARAR algorithm to compensate for one to five successive windows. As a result of our test data, the F-measure rate was 73.4% in the case of sensor data loss. The ARAR algorithm compensation for one and two successive windows increased the F-measure to 76.8%. Overall, the ARAR algorithm method effectively compensates for instantaneous communication disconnection. On the other hand, the kernel regression method is especially compensates for burst communication disconnection. Therefore, we need to change the compensation method depending on sensor error patterns. Thus, we improved robustness of the activity recognition system by compensating for sensor data loss.},

The pointing gesture is one of activities during pointing and calling that is carried out by workers to keep occupational safety and correctness. Compressed sensing is used for gesture recognition and considered the impacts of the gesture duration difference among user. However, the different force among users may affect to the recognition. As a result of the experiment, F-measure is improved 0.18 compared with the DTW even only the data obtained from others is used. Moreover, we found that the user-dependency varies for each subject. Therefore, we tested to recognize the pointing gestures of all subjects by using the training data of only specific users. The test showed that the recognition model with training data from 4 specific subjects provided the same accuracy as the one from 11 subjects. This result suggested the feasibility of reduction for subjects who need to acquire the training data.},

abstract = {In activity recognition techniques, existing wearable sensors have a problem performing the recognition process. Because existing wearable sensors perform recognition process by dividing sensor data into partial sequences, there is lag between the changes in action and the output of the recognition result. Therefore, we focused on the point activities change and have proposed a method to reduce the response time of the activity recognition technique. However, parameters such as window size immediately after the activity changing point and the activity changing point detection in the proposed method have not been studied well. Thus, in this paper, we conducted experiments using the HASC Corpus, which contains large-scale data of human activity. We report results of examining various parameters in the proposed method and features of the proposed method revealed by comparison with a conventional method. To give a concrete example, for IIR band-pass filter bank to be used for activity changing point detection, we clarified the frequency and the appropriate number of filters. In addition, we clarified the relationship between identification accuracy and the size of a special window that is set after activity changing point detection. The proposed method reduced the response time to the 2035ms on average from 2773ms, the of average of the conventional method. In addition, the proposed method can reduce the amount of calculation, achieve both high recognition accuracy and short response time, and output the recognition results in consistent times to reduce the jitter of response time.},

In this study, we assume that a user wears sensors (accelerometers) on several parts of the body such as the wrist, waist, and thigh, and by sharing sensor data obtained from only selected accelerometers (e.g., only waist and thigh sensors) among two different activity classes based on a sensor data similarity measure, the quantities of training data can be increased. For further reduction of the burden on the user, we also adopt semi-supervised approach to train the classifier in our study.},

(2) Under the veneer of many social media tools, hardly any meaningful strategies or approaches are found that go beyond awareness raising and allow citizens to do more than clicking a "Like" button.

abstract = {Geographic retrieval and visualization systems are essential to satisfy user's spatial information needs. However, the end users spatial information need is much more diverse and demanding in complex decision making scenarios such as: Persons moving to a new area need information about which place meets their individual demands. To analyze such requirements, we conducted a study with 18 users of different age group, knowledge, and expertise. In this paper we report the study methods, results, analysis and insights to build an end user-friendly geospatial decision support system.},

With the prototype described here we are provoking inquiry into whether the "technology" that is a bus stop, with high tech augmentations can engender civic engagement and more interconnected cities. Our preliminary user studies showed that people, while waiting for the bus, do not interact with each other, and as such are "alone together". Our concept is to connect people in the city, and also between two different cities by utilizing their waiting time. "Virtual Garden" creates the experience of "being connected" by providing users with the possibility to "grow" a collaborative garden using a smartphone and natural gestures as the control interaction. Lo-fi prototypes were used to gather user feedback which informed the design of the 'Virtual Garden'.},

abstract = {Home networks show an increasing level of heterogeneity regarding the devices connected, network technologies used, and services supported. Heterogeneity inhibits quality assurance for new services, such as online gaming, energy management, and health care. This paper focuses on the role that the concept of Managed Services Lanes (MSLs) plays in Dutch smart-city initiatives to solve these issues. MSLs provide third-party service providers quality guarantees without infringing network neutrality. Our preliminary experiments with extending MSLs into the home network indicate that end users indeed have a better quality of experience for the supported Neighborhood TV service than without MSLs. We also show that extension of MSLs into the home network requires advanced home networking monitoring technologies including dynamic home network traffic models. Our research provides evidence that such models will be very different from the standard Internet models.},

There is a problem of scale in software development for smart spaces because it is done by few. It is also problematic that those few decide about what is supported and developed. We propose to provide users with tools for community based development of driver and orchestration services. We analyze the requirements for a middleware framework to allow distributed development. We present necessary extensions that promote community based development: (1) a repository for interface definitions, (2) App Store and App Manager, and (3) multi-dimensional ratings. Finally we present how smart space software development can be facilitated using our Distributed Smart Space Orchestration System (DS2OS).},

It is imperative that designers of such systems understand the impacts of the technologies they introduce, particularly where intended to save energy and promote sustainability. Using four case studies drawn from recent Ubicomp and HCI literature, this reflective paper quantifies the direct energy and estimates the embodied emissions arising from specific installations of home sensing. We contextualise this by comparing with typical impacts arising from existing ICT devices commonly found in the home, and highlight a number of ways in which designers can reduce the impacts of the systems they introduce into the home.},

This provides knowledge of device behaviour and enables profiling of device relationships. Furthermore, monitoring communication to locations outside of the home will enable us to estimate associated indirect energy costs.

We evaluate the effectiveness of a supervised learning based approach for user identification from a dataset of appliance usage collected across five users and three kitchen appliances over a period of eight weeks. Our results show that using appliance usage information alone provides a moderate average accuracy of 32% for group sizes of up to five users in the home. However augmenting usage information with hints about user presence can improve accuracy by 15-20%.},

In participatory sensing, there is a problem in that the supply of data is insufficient if users are not motivated to participate in sensing services. We previously proposed Top of Worlds, a method for encouraging user participation by presenting rankings in multidimensional hierarchical sets.

abstract = {The popularity of location-based services such as Foursquare has made location sharing a common practice. Commercial companies can use the shared location for marketing purposes and often motivate users to share using discounts or special offers. We examine the reward users demand in such a scenario to try and estimate the value they ascribe to their own location information. Our user study is conducted using a mobile phone application that randomly offers users hypothetical money coupons in exchange for publishing their location. Responses by 25 participants to 481 such offers show that the willingness to share increases with coupon value, yet varies greatly with the location being shared. We use logistic regression to estimate the value above which most users will share their location and find it to be ∈8/∈5.4 ($10.4/$7) for a user's home and work respectively. This work contributes to the growing body of knowledge about the economic aspects of location-based services.},

As an automated computing framework using smartphones, it is designed to provide comprehensive understanding of customer behavior. We prototype the framework in a real-world urban shopping mall. Development consists of three steps; customer data collection, customer trace extraction, and behavior model analysis. We extract customer traces from a collection of 701-hour sensor data from 195 in-situ customers who installed our logging application at Android Market. The practical behavior model is created from the real traces. It has a multi-level structure to provide the holistic understanding of customer behavior from physical movement to service semantics. As far as we know, it is the first work to understand complex customer malling behavior in offline shopping malls.},

However, building sensor data collection tools remains arduous and challenging: it requires an understanding of the varying sensor programming interfaces as well as the research issues related to building sensor-sampling systems. To alleviate this problem and facilitate the development of social sensing and data collection applications, we are developing a set of open-source smartphone libraries to collect, store and transfer, and query sensor data. Furthermore, we have also developed a library that can trigger notifications based on time or sensor events to assist experience sampling methods.

abstract = {Emotional stress is commonly experienced while speaking in public, producing changes to the various speech productions subsystems, affecting the speech signal in predictable ways and being easily conveyed to listeners. Speech stress indicators, however, are typically studied under laboratory settings, allowing little generalization to real life settings. To bridge this gap, we propose an interdisciplinary approach to assess speech stress during public speaking events, based on a platform that records speech simultaneously annotated with physiological and psychological measures. This approach enables the collection of a large corpus of annotated speech in ecological settings, i.e. in objectively stressing situations. We also propose and implement a methodology to assess listeners evaluation of stress including psychologists, and overall public.The platform has been in use for the past 5 months, and we have collected 13 complete samples after the initial iterative development procedure. Preliminary results indicate that the proposed user-friendly platform is an accurate and robust method to collect annotated speech under ecological settings that can be processed to obtain speech stress indicators. The findings will be used primarily in the design of computer and mobile assisted voice coaching applications, but the outreach extends to mobile emotion sensing for individuals and crowds.},

Transforming the noisy audio data to the sparse representation with a dictionary learned from clean speech data, we show that speech and non speech can be discriminated even in low signal-to-noise conditions with up to 92% accuracy. In addition to an evaluation with simulated data, we evaluate the algorithm on a real-world data set recorded during firefighting missions.

However, there is a great need to explore many novel research challenges and issues before the idea of personal fabrication becomes truly pervasive and applicable to the wider public.PerFab is a workshop for providing a forum to bring together researchers from various disciplines working in this area. We intend to identify, explore and contribute to the research challenges that will allow personal fabrication to be pervasive. We will invite paper submissions to our workshop, review the submissions with a peer review process, and include the accepted papers in the ACM Digital Library. The long-term goal is to gather a community of researchers and establish this workshop as a leading forum for research dissemination in the area.},

In the recent years, active research has shown that indoor positioning systems based on Wi-Fi fingerprints can achieve a high positioning accuracy. However, the main barrier of broad adoption is the labor-intensive process of collecting labeled fingerprints. In this work, we propose an approach for reducing the amount of labeled data instances required for training a Wi-Fi fingerprint model. The reduction of the labeling effort is achieved by leveraging dead reckoning and an active learning-based approach for selecting data instances for labeling. We demonstrate through experiments that we can construct a Wi-Fi fingerprint database with significantly less labels while achieving a high positioning accuracy.},

Furthermore a plug-in module is being developed which gives tracking data from a group of up to ten people on the basis of video images (that is, with no need for tags or similar). Once the location data is in the TrackLab software it can be visualized in a variety of ways and a statistical analysis report is generated. The analysis variables are based on established parameters for quantification of behavior based on location. The analysis helps you to gain insight into the spatial behavior of customers. For real-time applications of the system, the analysis variables can be used to control external software, for example presentation of information on a display when a person has followed a particular path through the shop.},

Due to the low power consumption, wireless accessibility and appropriate resolution, these displays represent an alternative to state-of-the-art paper printed price labels. Nevertheless, there are several types of displays regarding size, resolution and communication channel. In this paper, we present a framework to automatically generate display content for different display types. Besides the connection to the displays, the framework also includes the possibility to generate the content to be displayed based on application plugins. The plugin approach facilitates both the integration of new display types and the creation of new applications. We explain the prototypical implementation of several plugins as well as the application at an instrumented shopping environment.},

abstract = {While shopping websites provide rich customer support through their adaptiveness, static paper-based leaflets are still one of the most important advertising mechanisms for retailers even in todays digital world. With their physical qualities, they create a higher emotional connection and with that more positive memories for brands and retailers. In this paper, we investigate two concepts for Augmented Reality advertising for such leaflets to bridge the digital divide. One of them is following a Guerrilla marketing approach, which allows users to easily compare products of different retailers. The second concept investigates different strategies for visualizing cross-selling recommendations inside the leaflets. We report on initial user feedback and discuss ideas for future work in the field of Augmented Reality advertising.},

abstract = {The popularization of eCommerce has led to effective customer shopping experiences. Pervasive computing could bring the benefits of eCommerce to brick and mortar stores, merging both online and physical worlds into a unique system. We define crick as the extension of the (c)lick and b(rick) concept, by means of pervasive technologies. In this paper, we summarize our work-in-progress research on using pervasive Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to sense human-product interaction. These cricks can be performed through diverse interfaces in the retail domain, and automatically receive feedback in different manners. We believe that integrating RFID and other pervasive technologies in retail stores is the next step to obtain comprehensive customer's user models and preferences. Retail management improvement, or personal and collaborative recommendations, are envisioned to be successful applications of cricking.},

abstract = {Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) offers an extraordinary opportunity to enhance the shopping experience of customers in a retail store. There are two types of possible enhancements: increasing the efficiency of traditional processes, or offering new use cases at the store. RFID offers a great opportunity in both cases. RFID can be used to improve the availability of products, reducing stock outs, to streamline the check-out process, reducing the lines, or to substitute the typical Electronic Article Surveillance (EAS) "horse gates" by hidden antennas, freeing the entrance to the store from intimidating barriers. Besides these operational improvements, RFID can also be used to offer shoppers new and enticing functionalities, such as a "magic mirror" to virtually try garments on, or an interactive screen in the fitting room that displays information and offers functionalities related to the particular garments brought in by the customer. This paper describes an actual installation in an apparel retail store in Barcelona, and presents some of the initial conclusions after several months of operation with real customers.},

The crowd can contribute with collecting data in the field, completing map information or votes for ideas or products. Even though the participation of large numbers of users with heterogeneous devices in crowdsourcing is a highly recurrent task, generic infrastructures for crowdsourcing can be hardly found. Especially the management of users, mobile devices and contributed data has to be repetitively implemented in new projects. To ease the development of crowdsourcing applications, in this paper we propose a generic platform for crowdsourcing supporting diverse crowdsourcing scenarios, the ability to handle large numbers of users and the involvement of heterogeneous mobile devices. The evaluation is based on scalability and performance experiments in order to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.},

abstract = {Energy consumption and mobile data cost are two key factors affecting users' willingness to participate in crowdsensing tasks. While data-plan users are mostly concerned about the energy consumption, non-data-plan users are more sensitive to data transmission cost incurred. Traditional ways of data collection in mobile crowdsensing often go to two extremes: either uploading the sensed data online in real-time or fully offline after the whole sensing task is finished. In this paper, we propose effSense - a novel energy-efficient and cost-effective data uploading framework leveraging the delay-tolerant mechanisms. Specifically, effSense reduces the data cost of non-data-plan users by maximally offloading the data to Bluetooth/WiFi gateways or data-plan users encountered to relay the data to the server; it reduces energy consumption of data-plan users by uploading data in parallel with a call or using less-energy demand networks (e.g. Bluetooth). By leveraging the prediction of critical events such as user's future calls or encounters, effSense selects the optimal uploading scheme for both types of users. Our evaluation with MIT Reality Mining and Nodobo datasets show that effSense can save 55%~65% energy and 45%~50% data cost for the two types of users, respectively, compared with the traditional uploading schemes.},

abstract = {Gathering representative data using mobile sensing to answer research questions is becoming increasingly popular, driven by growing ubiquity and sensing capabilities of mobile devices. However, there are pitfalls along this path, which introduce heterogeneity in the gathered data, and which are rooted in the diversity of the involved device platforms, hardware, software versions and participants. Thus, we, as a research community, need to establish good practices and methodologies for addressing this issue in order to help ensure that, e.g., scientific results and policy changes based on collective, mobile sensed data are valid. In this paper, we aim to inform researchers and developers about mobile sensing data heterogeneity and ways to combat it. We do so via distilling a vocabulary of underlying causes, and via describing their effects on mobile sensing---building on experiences from three projects within citizen science, crowd awareness and trajectory tracking.},

abstract = {In this paper we focus on mobile crowdsensing applications for community sensing where sensors and mobile devices jointly collect and share data of interest to observe and measure phenomena over a larger geographic area. Such applications, e.g., environmental monitoring or crowdsourced traffic monitoring, involve numerous individuals that on the one hand continuously contribute sensed data to application servers, and on the other hand consume the information of interest to observe a phenomenon typically in their close vicinity. Energy-efficient and context-aware orchestration of the sensing process with data transmission from sensors through mobile devices into the cloud, as well as from the cloud to mobile devices such that information of interest is served to users in real-time, is essential for such applications, primarily due to battery limitations of both mobile devices and wearable sensors. In addition, the latency of data propagation represents their key quality measure from the user's perspective. Publish/subscribe middleware offers the mechanisms to deal with those challenges: It enables selective real-time acquisition and filtering of sensor data on mobile devices, efficient continuous processing of large data volumes within the cloud, and near real-time delivery of notifications to mobile devices. This paper presents our implementation of a publish/subscribe middleware system which is tailored to the requirements of mobile and resource-constrained environments with a goal to reduce the overall energy consumption in such environments, and proposes a general architecture for mobile crowdsensing applications. We demonstrate the usability of both the architecture and middleware through our application for air quality monitoring, and discuss the energy footprint of the proposed solution.},

Our main contribution is a novel approach that locates emergencies by analyzing AP (access point) association events collected from a campus Wi-Fi network. It is motivated by the observation that human behavior and mobility pattern are significantly altered in the face of emergency, which is reflected in how their smartphones associate with the APs in the network. More specifically, our approach locates emergency by discovering APs with abnormal association patterns using Extreme Value Theory (EVT). Preliminary evaluation using real data collected from a university campus network demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.},

These require enabling the accurate estimation of proximity between two or more people. Since mobile phones have emerged as the most ubiquitous sensing and computing platform, carried by almost all people close to their body, it is logical to use the same for proximity detection. Further, in order to motivate people to use such application, it is necessary to estimate distances accurately, using only short blocks of sampled signal strengths. In this paper the authors present a mobile based proximity detection system, codenamed BlueEye which is based on Bluetooth. To achieve better distance estimates, BlueEye proposes a new form of path loss model which takes into account the relative orientation of mobile phones. The results show enhanced distance estimates when the separation between devices is less than 8 feet.},

abstract = {There is an increasing trend among employees to bring in their own personal device to work, thereby making the enterprise more vulnerable to security attacks such as data leakage from phones. Additionally, users are increasingly running phone apps in a mixed-mode i.e. both for enterprise and personal commitments. For example, phone cameras and microphones are used to record business meetings, often resulting in the case that both employers and employees become unaware of the existence of business data on the phone at a later point in time. The lack of employer control over personal devices raises enterprise data leakage threats, when an employee's phone is lost or stolen. In this paper we describe a system that leverages sensors available on the phone as well as on the enterprise infrastructure to identify business data resident on the phone for further secure handling. Office spaces have traditionally been instrumented with badge swipe readers, cameras, wifi access points etc. that can be used to provide passive sensory data about employees. For example, badge swipes can be used provide approximate location information of an employee where as calendar entries provide information about their schedule and activities. We propose a distributed architecture that leverages the context of the user for speculatively identifying enterprise data from personal data. The basic idea is to understand whether a user is engaged in enterprise or personal work by inferring her context from a combination of phone and infrastructure sensors. The contextual attributes in our system, such as location, can be sourced from a plurality of sensors on the phone as well as on the infrastructure. We exploit this diversity and propose a cost optimized distributed rule execution framework that chooses the optimal set of predicates to sense on the phone as well as on the infrastructure to reduce sensing cost. Furthermore, the framework also chooses the appropriate site for rule evaluation, either on the infrastructure or phone, to optimize for network transfer cost incurred due to shipping of sensed predicates between the two sites. Combined together,the above two optimizations reduce the battery drain caused due to context inferencing on the phone.},

abstract = {With the rise of smartphone platforms, adaptive sensing becomes an predominant key to overcome intricate constraints such as smartphone's capabilities and dynamic data. One way to do this is estimating the event probability based on anomaly detection to invoke heavy processes, such as switching on more sensors or retrieving information. However, most conventional anomaly detection methods are power hungry and computation consuming. This paper proposes a new online anomaly detection algorithm by capturing the likelihood of frequency histogram given features extracted from a stream of measurements from sensors of multiple smartphones. The algorithm then estimates the mixed density probability of anomalies. By doing so, the algorithm is lightweight and energy efficient, which underpins large scale mobile sensing applications. Experimental results run on Android phones are consistent with our theoretical analysis.},

We focus on the use of this paradigm at a technical conference, and describe the design, implementation and deployment of ConferenceSense, an application that uses multiple sensor and human-generated inputs from attendees' smartphones to infer context, such as the start time of a session or the degree of interaction during a tea break. Based on data collected from multiple attendees at a 3-day conference, we explore how ConferenceSense can be used for monitoring and collecting event statistics, and describe challenges and open questions.},

abstract = {In the context of the Internet of Things, an increasing number of platforms like Xively or ThingSpeak are available to manage ubiquitous sensor data. Strict data formats allow interoperability and informative visualizations, supporting the development of custom user applications. Yet, these strict data formats as well as the common device-centric approach limit the flexibility of these platforms: there are no means to incorporate people and their subjective impressions about the collected data. In order to build the Internet of Things and People and ultimately the Internet of Everything, we aim at providing an extendable concept of data which allows to enrich existing data points with any kind of additional information. This enables us to gain semantic and user specific context by attaching subjective data to objective values. For this end we support data ranging from text-based formats like JSON to images and video footage. This paper provides an overview of our architecture including concept, implementation details and present applications. We distinguish our approach from several other systems and describe two sensing applications namely AirProbe and WideNoise that were implemented for our platform.},

Accurate knowledge of human mobility patterns would have applications, e.g., in urban design, in the optimization of public transportation operating costs, and in the improvement of public transportation services. The present paper combines a large scale bus transportation dataset with publicly available data sources to predict bus usage. We propose a Gaussian process-based approach for modeling and predicting bus ridership. To validate our approach we perform experiments on data collected from Lisbon, Portugal. The results demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to a probabilistic baseline predictor.},

However, very little work has focused on analyzing the social response to an urban earthquake as it takes place. In this paper we present a preliminary study of the social response using the information collected from a cell-phone network during the 2012 Oaxaca earthquake in Mexico. We focus our analysis on four urban environments located between 100-200km away from the epicenter of the earthquake. The social response is analyzed using four different variables: call volume, call duration, social activity and mobility. Initial results indicate a social response characterized by an increase in the number of calls, a decrease in call durations, a moderate increase in the number of people contacted by highly connected citizens and a moderate increase in the mobility.},

abstract = {Location-based social networks, in addition to revealing users' online social network, also informs users' actual movements in the offline physical world. Due to this, they have recently been used in large-scale mobility and urban studies. In this paper, using a rigorous statistical methodology, we have found that a rank-distance distribution, which in recent research has been suggested to be a universal mobility law across cultural, demographic and national boundaries, does not follow a power-law distribution as originally claimed. Using a large-scale dataset obtained from Foursquare in Switzerland and New York City, we have shown that place transitions can be better explained using a log-normal and power-law with exponential cutoff model. Our study suggests that urban mobility patterns are more nuanced than previously reported and that goodness-of-fit tests need to be done in view of the generality of human mobility models.},

An uncommon trajectory or gathering of people in a specific area might correspond to a special event such as a festival, traffic accident or natural disaster. In this paper, we aim to develop a system for detecting such anomalous events in grid-based areas. A framework based on a hidden Markov model is proposed to construct a pattern of spatio-temporal movement of people in each grid during each time period. The numbers of GPS points and unique users in each grid were used as features and evaluated. We also introduced the use of local score to improve the accuracy of the event detection. In addition, we utilized Hadoop, a cloud-computing platform, to accelerate the processing speed and allow the handling of large-scale data. We evaluated the system using a dataset of GPS trajectories of 1.5 million individual mobile phone users accumulated over a one-year period, which constitutes approximately 9.2 billion records.},

In this work, an analysis of the relationship between flue gases? concentrations (represented by nitrogen dioxide) and taxi volume in Lisbon, Portugal was carried out from which a strong correlation between the two was observed. Based on four months of data, we found that the flue gases' concentrations varied with taxi volume and in particular, taxi volume can be used to estimate the change in flue gases' concentrations of the next hour.},

Since smartphones have become the most pervasive computing platform today, it is only a logical extension to use the same in healthcare domain for bringing ubiquity. Besides smartphone, skeleton based activity detection and localization using depth sensor like Kinect make ubiquitous monitoring effective without compromising privacy to a large extent. Finally sensing mental condition is made possible by analysis of the subject's social network feed.

Detailed information on an individual's consumption can then be used to highlight potential health risks and behavioral statistics to increase the smoker's awareness, and might be applied in smoking cessation programs. In this paper, we present an evaluation of two different monitoring prototypes which detect a user's smoking behavior, based on augmenting a lighter. Both prototypes capture and record instances when the user smokes, and are sufficiently robust and power efficient to allow deployments of several weeks. A real-world feasibility study with 11 frequently-smoking participants investigates the deployment and adoption of the system, hinting that smokers are generally unaware of their daily smoking patterns, and tend to overestimate their consumption.},

A Gas lighter and a USB lighter which have been outfitted with a micro-controller, storage unit and real-time clock. Both lighters store the day-of-time whenever they are used to light up a cigarette.

abstract = {Cities act as hubs designed to accommodate and support millions of inhabitants, nomads and tourists that rely on the city's infrastructure to move around, communicate and flourish as individuals and as a community. This shapes the culture, habits and pulse of a city creating an organic urban landscape often invisible to the naked eye, but traceable digitally. With the proliferation of sensing and pervasive technologies, we should be able to tell the levels of crowdedness of the city, its mood, or how clean it is by sensing and visualising these aspects. However, this poses interesting research and design questions; how would one design a device for tracking and visualising crowdedness on buses, for example. This workshop aims to explore the use of sensing technologies for visually resurfacing some of the hidden dynamics of the city by providing a collaborative and facilitated environment for applied research and creative exploration. This complements other workshops in the "urban" or "cities" theme, such as PURBA (Pervasive Urban Applications), that investigate urban environments from a theoretical perspective. After initial discussions on a joint workshop, the SenCity and PURBA organisers concluded that these workshops were complementary yet different enough to give participants the benefit of taking part in both; gaining the theory from PURBA and collaboratively applying practical research and creative flair at the SenCity workshop to sense, visualise and share the hidden pulse of Z\"{u}rich.},

In this paper, we propose an objective way to measure people's emotional reactions in places by monitoring their physiological signals that are related to emotion. By integrating wearable biosensors with mobile phones, we can obtain geo-annotated data relating to emotional states in relation to our spatial surroundings. We are the able to visualize the emotional response data by creating an emotional layer over a geographical map. This can then help us to understand how individuals emotionally perceive urban spaces and help us to illustrate the interdependency between emotions and environmental surroundings.},

In festivals such as Glastonbury or Burning Man we see temporary cities where the inhabitants are engaged afresh with their environment and each other. Our position is that not only are there direct equivalences between larger festivals and cities, but in festivals the phenomena are often exaggerated, and the driving impulses often exploratory. These characteristics well suit research into sensing and intervening in the urban experience. To this end, we have built a corpus of sensor and social media data around a 18,000 attendee music festival and are developing ways of analysing and communicating it.},

In this context, we address the general problem of knowledge representation in Smart Spaces. In order to monitor and act over human behavior in intelligent environments, we design a sufficiently simple and flexible visual language to be managed by non-expert users, thus facilitating the programming of the environment. The prototype of the visual language serves to represent rules about human behavior to provide the Smart Space with more usability. These rules can be mapped into SPARQL queries and rule subscriptions. In addition, we add support to represent imprecise and fuzzy knowledge. The proposed general-domain language can help managing resource allocation, assisting people with special needs, in remote monitoring and other domains.},

In particular, the availability of digital sources of behavioural transport data opens up new directions for the development of transport information services which are focused on the passengers' engagement in public transport. This will enable novel perceptions of transport services, encompassing aspects of personal transport behaviour - information related to the transport routines of individual travellers, social transport behaviour - information which creates an understanding of the collective transport usage of social groups - and dimensions of quality-of-transport information which include novel measures of travel experiences such as overcrowding. In this paper, we introduce and discuss a design space of how behavioural transport data can shape more user-centric transport information services in order to inform future research activities in this area.},

Processing of rates of travel and destinations will enable different types of pedestrian to be identified and plotted dynamically such as tourists, shoppers and individuals simply trying to get from A to B quickly.

abstract = {In literature there are different projects showing how new information and communications technology (ICT) systems can be used for enhancing communication between and among patients and clinicians over Internet. Besides advantages these systems offer to both patients and clinicians there is also great concern that utilizing new technologies can limit and negatively influence patient-clinician face-to-face communication. This paper underlines these concerns and describes two projects in our research center that promote more effective offline patient-clinician communication.},

abstract = {The iPad is typically perceived as a personal device, evoking the image of its owner tapping away - silently submerged in their private digital bubble. Here we portray iPads in a different light: Face-to-face play in groups, using connected and shared surfaces. Applying the bubble metaphor to multi-user cases, we ask the following questions: (a) How many people can be in one bubble together before it bursts? (b) Can multiple bubbles be connected, nested, etc. and what configurations are beneficial? (c) What design qualities are helpful in keeping beneficial bubble configurations intact and together, rather than bursting or floating away? By contrasting user observations from two multi-iPad scenarios, we illustrate the usefulness of 'bubble dynamics' as a lens for evaluating large offline social applications. We hope to inspire discussion of future use cases, evaluation methods and design recommendations.},

abstract = {Current methods of swim stroke learning rely on a combination of external observation by coaches and repetitive drills performed by swimmers. At elite levels, these may be augmented using complex and expensive augmented pool environments and video analysis, but these are not available to most non-professionals.In this paper, I argue that with the wide range of sensors and outputs on a current smartphone, and existing sports-targeted waterproofing, commodity mobile hardware may allow even un-coached amateur swimmers to access timely feedback on their stroke and to improve their swimming. An early prototype of a swim-sensing system demonstrates the potential of mobiles to sense aspects of the swimming stroke. By using commodity hardware it is open to many potential learners, who may in turn provide high quality data to feed back into the development of swim coaching techniques by sports researchers and practitioners.},

To investigate the impact of these factors on the recognition accuracy, we performed tests with 20 different users focusing on the recognition of basic locomotion activities using the accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetic field sensors. We investigated the effect of feature types, to represent the raw data, and the use of linear acceleration for user, device and orientation-independent activity recognition.},

Furthermore, in a mass casualty situation, the emphasis shifts from ensuring the best possible outcome for each individual patient to ensuring the best possible outcome for the greatest number of patients. In the past several years, an ongoing movement among crisis management organizations is the incorporation of ubiquitous Web 2.0 tools into their practices for the improvement of their critical situations response. In unison with this trend and the latest discoveries in crowdsourcing, we have developed a system, called CrowdHelp, for real time patient assessment which uses mobile electronic triaging accomplished via crowdsourced and sensor-detected information. With the use of our system, emergency management professionals receive most of the information they need for preparing themselves to perform a timely and accurate treatment of their patients even before dispatching a response team to the event.},

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) is a successful application area of Wearable Computing, especially for professional, industrial settings, in which mobility is an important factor. With the proliferation of mobile technology in the workplace, wearable computing research can offer a valuable contribution to the usability of mobile solutions, such as the use of context information to inform devices and services of the current task and user situation, relieve professionals of tedious and repetitive information entry tasks and increase worker safety in complex and hazardous environments. Wearable AR systems in general are widely utilized in various domains, including architecture, military, tourism, navigation, and entertainment. Such diverse usages impose several challenges on researchers from both areas of Augmented Reality and Wearable Computing, such as interaction, activity and context recognition, wearability, design, and modeling. For the second Workshop on Wearable Systems for Industrial Augmented Reality Applications, we have chosen the motto "How to industrialize wearable AR?" We have invited researchers from the relevant disciplines to present novel works and discuss the applications of state-of-the-art Wearable Computing research to Augmented Reality systems. The workshop will provide an opportunity for directed discussion sessions to identify current issues, research topics, and solution approaches, which lead to the proposal of future research directions.},

The approach taken by the Web of Things initiative is to look at the problems and research issues that emerge when considering the interaction of heterogeneous devices within composite applications. Continuing the successful Web of Things workshop series, this workshop aims at further exploring the use of technologies and principles at the core of the Web to provide methods for a seamless integration of physical devices.

abstract = {The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a new Web protocol standardized by the IETF. It is not a mere compression of HTTP, but a re-design from scratch following the REST architectural style. Thus, its features are tailored for Internet of Things (IoT) applications and machine-to-machine (M2M) scenarios with highly resource-constrained devices. While this makes CoAP very interesting for the Web of Things (WoT) initiative, it is still detached from the Web world of browsers and intuitive user interaction. We present the first attempts to unite these two worlds, so that everyday objects endowed with tiny, low-cost computing devices can become first class citizens of the Web. Our Copper (Cu) project brings CoAP support to the Web browser and has been out in the wild since late 2010. Thus, we were able to conduct a user study among industry and research developers who know both, Web-based CoAP and earlier proprietary protocols for networked embedded systems. The result shows that industry developers and those with longer experience agree even more that Internet protocols and patterns from the Web ease application development for tiny, resource-constrained devices.},

abstract = {Facilitating the interaction of human users and machines with smart devices is important to drive the successful adoption of the Internet of Things in people's homes and at their workplaces. In this paper, we present a system that helps users control their smart environment, by embedding semantic metadata in the representations of smart things. The system enables users to specify a desirable state of their smart environment and produces a machine-readable description that details which steps are necessary to reach this state, where each step corresponds to a Web request to a smart device. A client application that, for instance, runs on the user's smartphone, then implements these steps to reconfigure the user's smart environment. We report on our experiences when integrating semantic technologies with smart devices and on two use cases from the home and office automation domains that we implemented in our office space.},

abstract = {We present a language of temporal conditions for detecting concurrent events in embedded Web-enabled devices, and for triggering pervasive services on these systems. Based on the assumption that evaluating conditions on distributed devices is relevant for providing robustness and to foster scalability and web real-time, we discuss the feasibility of in-situ evaluation of the proposed conditions and conduct a performance study. In a smart environments use case, it is illustrated how the language can be used to state activation concerns of services on distributed Web resources. Our proposed architecture integrates the language with the Web of Things to foster simplified development of applications that mash up Web-enabled devices.},

In this paper, we discuss the evolution of the Web on several dimensions, leading to our vision for the SWoT. We discuss the challenges that need to be addressed, a possible approach for addressing them and we illustrate the applicability of the SWoT through a motivating scenario.},

abstract = {In the Web of Things, standard web technologies and protocols are used to represent and communicate with physical and virtual things. One challenge toward this vision is integrating things with different characteristics, protocols, interfaces and constraints while maintaining the simplicity and flexibility required for a variety of applications. In this paper we present the Thing Broker, a core platform for Web of Things that provides RESTFul interfaces to things using a Twitter-based set of abstractions and communication model. We present the key abstractions, a reference implementation and explain how a typical WoT application can be created using Thing Broker. We finish with a preliminary evaluation and draw some lessons from our experiences.},

The presence of various building networks leads to problems of heterogeneity, especially for developing BMS. In this paper, we propose to leverage on the Web-of-Things (WoT) framework, using well-known standard technologies of the Web like HTTP and RESTful APIs for standardizing the access to devices seen from an application point of view. We present the implementation of two gateways using the WoT approach for exposing KNX and EnOcean device capabilities as Web services, allowing a fast integration in existing and new management systems.},

We are working to validate this approach in the context of a large-scale IoT ecosystem project consisting of eight IoT hubs in different domains where a key requirement is hub-to-hub and hub- application interoperability.},
