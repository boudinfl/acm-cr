abstract = {In this paper, we propose a battery-free place recognition system that utilizes solar-cells as a sensor for localization. Our system combines multiple solar cells having different characteristics against the light environment. As an initial work, we select five kinds of solar cells available in the market and investigate the characteristics of them. Then, we show a potential for estimating the place based on the variation of electricity amounts generated from solar cells. Finally, we show that our proposed system distinguish nine places with 88.0% accuracy.},

abstract = {Grief resulting from the death of a deceased loved one has a great impact on both the personal and social life styles of the bereaved persons. However, this has become important to explore within the technological context considering how technologies are recently helping to understand the grieving needs of the bereaved persons. This paper presents an initial work drawn from the continuing bonds theory. The theory explains how the bereaved persons are continually being reminded of their lost loved ones while they encounter certain memory triggers (such as familiar sound from the past, faces that resemble the deceased person and places that they had once visited with the deceased). Hence, as life logging technologies (technology that continually captures and preserve memorable moments) become pervasive, it is necessary to understand how it can support these memory-related events associated with grieving.},

abstract = {Moving livestock from one location to another is a tedious but necessary task in many farmland environments. Agersens, an agri-tech startup, is launching eShepherd: a world first autonomous shepherd based on virtual fencing technology. This IoT device enables farmers to geo-fence, move and monitor their cattle using their smartphone or tablet device. eShepherd uses Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technology to localise livestock relative to a virtual fence boundary, and subsequently apply control signals based on shepherding decisions. The critical barrier to long-term operation of the collar is power management, as GNSS/GPS-based localisation consumes excessive power during continuous operation. This paper proposes an intelligent power management of eShepherd collars, based on animal behaviour classification and adaptive GPS sampling. Simulations derived from field trial data confirm significant reductions in position observations are achievable, while maintaining localisation of the animal relative to the boundary, and without unobserved boundary crossings.},

abstract = {Computational offloading has become an important strategy to augment computational capabilities of resource constrained devices. While several techniques and frameworks have been proposed in the literature, currently quantifying the cost of offloading in the wild remains challenging. Indeed, the performance of computational offloading is affected by contextual factors ranging from network quality to energy consumption of the device and load of the offloading infrastructure. This makes it infeasible for a single device to capture all possible contexts and to make optimal offloading decisions. To improve the design of offloading mechanisms, we propose MobileCloudSim, a novel and innovative context-aware simulation toolkit that can be used to asses the impact of computational offloading in a large-scale variety of complex contexts. Unlike traditional simulators that generate synthetic data, MobileCloudSim relies on crowdsensing to create realistic offloading conditions that characterize different offloading contexts.},

By exploring a LoRaWAN Gateway, we transfer the sensor data to SORACOM cloud platform successfully. Then from the cloud data, a few statistical features are computed to classify three activities such as walk, stay and run. We aggregate the time series data into different action labels that summarize the user activity over a time interval. After, we train data to induce a predictive model for activity recognition. We explore the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for classification. We achieve recognition accuracy 80% by KNN and 73.3% by LDA.

Our first field study with 42 students showed that about 38% of the students adopted it. Students had several misunderstandings and concerns of the technology that challenged its adoption. We revised the design by integrating a participatory sensing approach, where users can manually check in to their class by explicitly sharing their location using GPS. We conducted a second field study with 45 students under the same instructor in the following semester. The overall adoption of the attendance taking system was increased to 80%.},

Respiration is one of interesting physiological information which are affected by voluntary and in-voluntary motions. Hence, respiration reflects the consciousness and unconsciousness of person's state such as sleep, speaking, etc. The ultrasound transducer installed into the sensor can detect small abdominal movement as the impedance variation by pressure. In addition, the wide dynamic range allows to measure respiration under various situations in daily living. Moreover, our wearable sensor has generic devices such as accelerometer and the software development kit enables users to handle data obtained from these sensor. We demonstrate that the proposed sensor can measure respiration information precisely in various conditions through an experiment.},

In this paper, we proposed a framework for estimating customer interests by using various sensor devices. The participants in our pilot study expected that recommendation services that adopt their interests would help to reduce their shopping time. As a result, shop assistants will have a stronger ability to understand, analyze, and even predict customer interests in the near future.},

To design WBANs, Intra-body Communication (IBC) uses electro-magnetic (EM) wave signals and utilizes the human body as the communication medium, rather than using the surrounding air with RF signals. IBC allows the air medium to be freely used by other services while offering WBAN services and shows lower energy consumption compared to RF-based nodes. In this work, we conducted a pair of experiments to obtain knowledge on the signal attenuation and signal propagation latency characteristics of EM waves on the human body. Our results show that the average attenuation observed from a human body was -27dB in a capacitively-coupled circuit and -36dB in galvanically-coupled circuit, and the propagation delay of EM waves on the human body was 0.94ns per cm. These findings can be further utilized to design more complex protocols for IBC networks.},

abstract = {Self-reported perceived stress does not often correlate with physiologic and behavioral stress response. Current perceived stress self-report assessment methods require users to answer many questions at different time points of the day. Reducing it to one question at multiple time points throughout the day, using microinteraction-based Ecological Momentary Assessment (micro-EMA) allows us to identify smaller or more subtle changes in physiology and corresponding emotional reactions that reflect experiences of stress. We identify the optimal micro-EMAs by finding single item questions that correlate with intended stressors, and are most predictive from physiological signals. Physiological signals were collected in lab with a flexible wearable sensor that captured R-R IBI and motion from 22 female participants performing multiple stressful and non-stressful activities. Results show that simply asking how stressed a person is with a 7-scale Likert scale response results in 0.63 correlation with intended stressful activities, and a 68% F1-Score in predicting stress. We further report on acceptability and feasibility of using this sensor.},

This project aims to demonstrate one potential application of audio fingerprinting algorithm in the media industry in the form of a mobile application which is able to detect and identify advertisement tracks and notify the user of related details and offers. The audio fingerprinting algorithm extracts different attributes from an audio file, processes them into audio fingerprints, and compares them with a database of audio fingerprints to find the closest-matching audio file. The proposed application has tested on a small-scale database and shown a respectable performance.},

The performance of inertial sensors for complex activities drops considerably compared with simple activities due to inter-class similarities. In such cases deploying more sensors may improve the performance. But such strategy is often not feasible in reality due to costs or privacy concerns among others. In this context, we propose a new method to use additional sensors only in training phase. We introduce the idea of mapping the test data to a codebook created from the additional sensor information. Using the Berkeley MHAD dataset our preliminary results show this worked positively; improving in 10.0% both the average F1-score and the average accuracy. Notably, the improvement for the stand, sit and sit to stand activities was higher, typical activities for which the inertial sensor is less informative when using the wrist-worn accelerometer.},

Recently, most studies utilize regression analysis or collaborative filtering to recommend the optimal site based on some features extracted from commercial data, geographic data and other heterogeneous data. Compared to manual features which could not be well-defined, deep learning is able to automatically extract features and give nonlinear and in-depth description of the relationship between variables. Therefore, this paper applies deep learning to the study of commercial site recommendation. We firstly study the usage of NeuMF, a neural collaborative filtering method in commercial site recommendation. Then we propose NeuMF-RS method based on NeuMF method. Finally, we evaluate our proposed model on a real-world dataset collected from Dianping.com. The results indicate that NeuMF-RS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in commercial site recommendation.},

However, it is important to know if the user has a knowledge misconception or give an answer by chance. This information can be assessed through the user's confidence.We aim to construct a confidence estimation system that will help the users reviewing more effectively. We analyze the keystroke information of 12 participants answering 120 vocabulary questions on a smartphone, and estimate whether they feel confident about their answers. We obtained an accuracy of 89.1% in a user-independent case.},

Analysis of sleep is useful for health care and for self analysis. Especially, knowing how daytime activities are influenced by sleep quality, and vice versa, are important as well as analyzing the sleep status itself. Existing analysis of correlation between sleep and the daytime activities collected at maximum 1 week and the recorded activities are primitive such as 'activity levels'. In this paper, we performed a sensing experiment at a caregiving facility to collect big data for 30 subjects and for 5 months. Furthermore, by collecting care records for subject, it is possible to collect the daytime activities data. Finally, we analyzed the data of five subjects for 26 days, and found that (1) the sleeping situation can estimate whether users will do daytime exercise with an accuracy of 91% for specific users, and (2) that the information of the daytime exercise influences the time when users start to sleep for specific users.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) is challenging, particularly in natural settings, due to issues like confounding gestures present in different activities, diversity in performing the same activity, and the wide range of possible human activities. Acceleration and rotation rate, two of the most widely used sensing modalities for HAR, are limited in addressing these issues. Also, many solutions for wearables are focused on some particular activities, and they do not generalize to others. One challenge is to develop underlying generic techniques for activity recognition that can be used in many different wearable based applications. We present a set of general purpose techniques for activity recognition using wearables. The techniques are based on quaternions that represent the orientation of a device in three-dimensional space. The techniques can be used for different purposes like reducing computation, increasing robustness and accuracy, and better understanding movements for HAR.},

This in turn makes the tactile books bulky and cumbersome. To address this issue, we present the design of ColorTact, a finger-worn assistive device for visually impaired to explore tactile diagrams with audio feedback. The device leverages color-printed tactile diagrams and associates audio supplement to various colors to provide additional information about a single-page tactile diagram. The ColorTact device consists of a color sensor paired with a smart phone app which can play a preset audio information about the distinctive areas of a tactile diagram. Furthermore, the device was designed not to hinder any natural finger movements or tactile sensation. Eliminating the need of additional appendixes for tactile diagrams, the ColorTact device aims to support visually impaired students to learn graphic intensive subjects in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).},

Biometric sensors such as EEG, GSR and eye trackers have been used to indicate cognitive and affective states of individuals. In order to make EEG relevant and affordable for such HCI applications we need to be able to use consumer-grade devices. We conducted a pilot study using a wearable consumer grade MUSE© headband to record EEG signals. We used the ratio of the frequencies alpha and theta (theta/alpha) to investigate cognitive load and the frontal asymmetry in the alpha frequency band to investigate learners' affective states. We found evidence supporting the use of theta/alpha as a cognitive load metric. However, alpha frontal asymmetry was not indicative of affective states. We discuss the results and possible implications of our study.},

However, to grasp students' engagement is too difficult in the situation where there are so many students. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to grasp the students' engagement by a chair with a pressure mat, not by teachers. We recorded students' upper body pressure distribution while they were taking e-learning lectures. We recorded 145 lectures in total. Then we extracted 56 features for each lecture, selected proper features and trained classifiers to determine whether he or she was engaged in the lecture. As a result, the average accuracy was 75.2% for student-dependent. This result shows it is possible to predict student's engagement automatically, and it will help teachers to give lectures more effective.},

In this research, we have developed a complete assistance system with rear-view monitoring, back obstacle sensor, an over speed sensor and a maintenance scheduler which are integrated into a user-friendly app. We have designed a system to overcome the downsides with minimal costing and easy installation process. To appraise the effectiveness, we installed this system in real Auto Rickshaw in the road. Astounded responses were accomplished by the Auto Rickshaw drivers while tested and demonstrated. This novel work creates a new pathway to increase road safety and consciousness of driving rules.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new method of early change detection for people flow analysis. Some conventional methods often focus on a single location (spot) to demonstrate how the number of people changes over time. In contrast, our proposed method takes into account the links between the spots to grasp a foretaste of congestion of a specific spot as early as possible. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it not only describes the characteristics of each spot, but also the relationships among spots, i.e., whether the connectivities are strong/weak. We introduce an idea of PageRank, which is based on a centrality of graph theory and extend that idea to represent the amount of people flow among spots. We call the extended method "SpotRank". SpotRank assigns an importance score to each spot. The score of a particular spot is calculated by the number of paths and the amount of people flow from other spots. Therefore, the more paths and people flow, the importance score (ranking) increases. The proposed method begins with the calculation of SpotRank every 10 min, followed by change detection, i.e., how much the ranking changes over time. In our experiments, we measured people flow using Wi-Fi packet sensors for a period of over 16 weeks. We confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method, which successfully grasped a foretaste of congestion at a restaurant in our university.},

However, recent researches raise security concerns because QR codes can be easily sniffed and decoded which can lead to private information leakage or financial loss. To address the issue, we present mQRCode which exploit patterns with specific spatial frequency to camouflage QR codes. When the targeted receiver put a camera at the designated position (e.g., 30cm and 0° above the camouflaged QR code), the original QR code is revealed due to the Moir\'{e} phenomenon. Malicious adversaries will only see camouflaged QR code at any other position. Our experiments show that the decoding rate of mQR codes is 95% or above within 0.83 seconds. When the camera is 10cm or 15° away from the designated location, the decoding rate drops to 0 so it's secure from attackers.},

This mode suppresses the smartphone's incoming SMS/call notifications so that it does not distract driving activities. However, currently available driving mode implementations keep all notifications from being delivered, which decreases its practical usability. We identify this as a problem and perform a survey on the preference of drivers on incoming smartphone notifications when driving. Specifically, we ask 74 survey participants on the need for a smartphone driving mode and also the need to differentiate incoming call/SMS contacts when the driving mode operates. Our results show that the need for a designated driving mode scored on average 4.3 on a 0-6 scale. When asked what criteria would be ideal for differentiating the contacts for notification prioritization, ~59% chose the communication frequency with the contact as the main criteria. Overall, our results suggests for a careful design when implementing smartphone driving mode for incoming notification control.},

Ubiquitous technologies such as smartphones promise to fundamentally change PD assessments. To enable frequent remote assessment of PD tremor severity, here we present a 39-month smartphone research study in a real-world setting without supervision. More than 15,000 consented participants used the smartphone application, mPower, to perform self-administered active tasks. In the scope of this abstract, we developed an objective smartphone measure of PD tremor severity called mPower Tremor Scores (mPTS) using machine learning. Efficacy, and reliability of mPTS was further tested and validated in a separate cohort in the real world and in-clinic setting. This study demonstrates the utility of using structured activities with built-in smartphone sensors to measure PD tremor severity remotely and objectively in a real-world setting using more than 1100 participants.},

abstract = {The traditional hospital set-up is not appropriate for long-term epilepsy seizure detection in naturalistic ambulatory settings. To explore the feasibility of seizure detection in such a setting, an in-hospital study was conducted to evaluate three wearable devices and a data collection platform for ambulatory seizure detection. The platform collects and processes data for study administrators, clinicians and data scientists, who use it to create models to detect seizures. For that purpose, all data collected from the wearable devices is additionally synchronized with the hospital EEG and video, with gold-standard seizure labels provided by trained clinicians. Data collected by wearable devices shows potential for seizure detection in out-of-hospital based and ambulatory settings.},

Still they're only flat displays with digital content behind a glass screen. Tangibles extended the interface into the third dimension. However, the content still sticks mostly to the screen or is projected onto rigid objects. In this work, we present OverTop, a concept for providing a full three-dimensional interaction experience for both content and interface. We introduce three different layers, where both content and interfaces can be presented: Below, On, and Above. Using these three layers, OverTop extends the design space of tabletop interfaces to the area above traditional tabletop workplaces, opening up new interaction and visualization possibilities.},

abstract = {Recent epidemiological studies suggest that age-related cognitive decline---particularly, the stages between normal cognitive changes in aging and early dementia--- is adversely affected by environmental exposures, such as long-term air pollution and traffic noise. Although monitoring outdoor air pollution is now commonplace, and smart home solutions for monitoring indoor air quality is becoming prevalent, ways that the elderly can record long-term environmental exposures and adopt healthy lifestyle changes are little explored. We present myCityMeter, a pollution exposure management tool for older adults and their caregivers. myCityMeter measures the pollutants shown to be associated with cognitive impairment in older adults: PM2.5 and ambient noise. Using a set of neighborhood-level stationary and personal mobile sensors, myCityMeter helps users to monitor their environmental exposures, know potential exposures when planning activities, journal cognitive performances, and take day-to-day actions to avoid the environmental risk factors for early dementia.},

abstract = {E-learning using digital learning materials is widespread due to freedom in choosing time and space for learning. Often, these learning materials are provided uniformly regardless of the learners' knowledge and the attention. However, to maximize the power of digitized materials, the presented materials can be dynamically adapted to the learner's state of learning, in particular, the degree of concentration. Based on the background, we propose MARTO, a system to change the content of learning based on the concentration level of the learner using an EEG. We have also examined how properly the concentration level is obtained with EEG by comparing it with the result obtained with eye gaze movement.},

Adaptive auditory feedback is based on switching between speech only and non-speech only (i.e., Spearcons) sounds. The auditory feedback adaptively changes that changing based on user mode. Active users are assigned with speech only while the engaged users with the non-speech only auditory feedback. Ten participants perform tasks on desktop computers using within-subject design. The proposed adaptive auditory feedback is more efficient in comparison to speech only and non-speech auditory feedbacks. It can also improve a user experience in the desktop environment. Finally, it may help different researchers to use adaptive auditory feedback as a substitute for speech only or non-speech auditory feedback during the designing of accessibility softwares, tools, and systems.},

In this paper, we present observations of two deployment studies which focus on different roles that NUI can play as a part of learning activities. We deploy the Kinect based applications:- Yoga Soft: A Digital Yoga Instructor and Mudra: A Kinect based Learning System in real life scenarios.

abstract = {To expand the possibilities of thermochromic displays, we design Eunoia, which is a series of animations on textiles patterns that control the area and time of the color change activation by using the properties of fabrics, thermochromic pigments and conductive threads. The six different design patterns are related to the length of the conductive threads, voltage regulation, fabric density, the temperature of thermochromic pigment, fade-in and fade-out time, and maintenance time. For example, we could control the changing color area around a conductive thread by regulating the giving voltage or we could control the time that a pattern is activated by using different fabrics. We collaborate with a graphic artist to design the animations using each of these properties and. aim to provide some guidance to graphic designers, fashion designers, and artists to create new ways of dynamic fabrics. In this way, we aim that Eunoia will provide guidance to graphic designers, fashion designers, and artists to create novel ways of dynamic fabrics.},

Our method extracts adjectives from travel movies utterances, calculates emotional scores using a sentiment dictionary, and rearranges scenes based on emotional arc templates. The templates consist of 194 popular cinema screenplays. We conduct a user study for which travelers evaluate short travel movies reconstructed by our method. Their impressions were changed according to templates of the emotional arcs.},

The proposed method estimates the location where the user was using other users' sensed sparse location logs. The user can obtain his/her detailed dense location history without increasing sensing frequency and CPU load of his/her device compared to those for normal daily use. Experimental results show a rich location dataset of the user can be estimated.},

abstract = {Language development has long been recognized as one of the core areas of deficiency in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A large number of technology-based intervention applications have been developed to support, enhance and facilitate the language and literacy development among individuals with ASD. However, although it has been argued that allowing flexible and personalized customization of applications to accommodate ASD children's individual development trajectories is highly desirable, relatively few systems had been built to allow for such personalization and adaptivity. In this demo, we present two flexible and individually adaptable picture-based word-learning mobile applications which are lightweight in terms of the technologies utilized (i.e. Swipe-N-Tag, and Snap-N-Recognize). Specifically, both applications allow the caregivers and teachers to build up the picture database based on a child's learning progress in the classroom and the items available at home (or outdoor during an activity). As such, the words acquired in the classroom could hopefully be transferable to real-life situations. The iOS version of Swipe-N-Tag (for both iPhone and iPad) is currently being alpha tested among a limited number of parents and teachers in a private autism center in the city with satisfying results.},

abstract = {Detecting human interaction borders in urban environment, the geographical perimeter of dense human mobility interaction, is important for mobility-related city resource allocation and urban planning. However, with the advance of transportation technology, dwellers' movements become convenient and flexible, leading to the doubts that whether such interaction borders exist and how they come into being. This poster investigates these problems via a cellular mobility dataset in Shanghai, China. From this large-scale dataset, we first build an urban flow network, where the node is city block and the edge is human mobility interaction frequency. Based on this network, we discover several spatial communities, and extract the borders of them as the interaction borders. We surprisingly find that the interaction borders do exist because city blocks in each spatial community are geographically connected. We further find that the borders are influenced not only by administrative policy but also by other factors in geographical and cultural aspects.},

abstract = {PECS or Picture Exchange Communication System, involving teaching individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to use the picture cards for requesting items and activities; it has been used with not only the individuals with ASD, but also their families and teachers with notably success. Despite the much progress achieved so far, to our knowledge, there are very few dedicated PECS (software) application available in Chinese. Motivated by these previous research, we are developing a highly customizable and contextually expandable PECS system embedded with augmented aids and some additional communication abilities. In particular, our system can not only offer content-authoring tools but also expands picture vocabularies by automatically offering context-sensitive picture cards (via location- and event sensing) for users to make on-demand request through WeChat, one of the most used social communication tools in China. Last but not the least, the simpler version with typical PECS capabilities with message-sending module has also been loaded in a children's tablet which makes our PECS very affordable for Chinese children's use in rural areas.},

abstract = {Head mounted display (HMD) virtual reality (VR) games have shown promise beyond entertainment. Work has shown that playing VR games even for 10 minutes can provide players with valuable levels of physical exertion that is much higher then their perceived exertion. Despite VR showing promise at providing engaging forms of exercise, there is a risk that players can become over-exerted because they are so immersed in VR games, potentially leading to injury. Activity trackers like smart watches and chest heart-rate monitors can help with keeping track of exertion. However, the player is inherently locked out of the real-world while they are in the game. This means that the data can only be viewed if the player takes off the HMD, interrupting their game session. At present, the design of suitable feedback about exertion has had little attention in HMD VR games. In this paper, we show how fully-immersive VR and data from activity trackers can be combined in real-time so players can track their level of exertion, to help prevent over-exertion during gameplay.},

We then developed a phone-based support system that facilitates communication between patients and their family members. The patient self-administers breath alcohol tests using a portable breathalyzer and self-reports moods and alcohol cravings. This information can then be shared with select family members who subsequently provide responses, such as encouragement or suggestions. The patients do not directly reply to the encouragement or suggestions, but rather use the same app to indirectly rate family's responses according to their effectiveness in assisting them to remain sober. These indirect ratings as well as other data provided by patients and family members can be used during following group interventions to assist counselors (the treatment team) in making suggestions about future intra-family communications, with the aim of breaking many of the negative loops that would otherwise impede positive interactions and the effectiveness of treatment.},

Eye tracking technique can locate targets more easily and quickly across long distance, and has a high potential for fast targets selection on large displays. However, eye tracking still faces to challenges, such as low accuracy, and high error rate of selection operation, especially for gaze-only interaction. This paper proposed a multimodal interaction method that combined gaze with gestures. This method utilized gaze for rough selection first, and then utilized hand gesture to confirm accurate selection. Furthermore, when targets are small and crowded, we used semi-fixed gaze cursor and secondary selection mechanism to optimize the selection process. Finally we conducted a pilot study, and the results showed that the selection speed and accuracy rate of our method was higher than the gaze only input and similar to mouse input.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel approach to the realization of a battery-free soil profile probe that uses the temperature difference between the near-surface air and the underground soil as a power source. The temperature change in the underground soil is slower than that in the near-surface air, and thus a large temperature difference occurs between the near-surface air and the underground soil for most of the day. Hence, we developed a sensor prototype driven by a thermoelectric generator (TEG) that directly converts this temperature difference into electricity. The results of an experimental implementation of the prototype proved that when the difference in temperature between the near-surface air and the underground soil is only 3 °C, which is much lower than the average temperature difference in an actual field, the measured output power is about 80 μW. Because the typical sensing interval of a soil profile probe is 1 h, the average power consumption (e.g., for a Texas Instruments CC2650) is about 5 μW, which is much lower than the expected amount of harvested energy.},

abstract = {Education is the Achilles heel of successful resuscitation in cardiac arrest. Therefore, we aim to contribute to the educational efficiency by providing a novel augmented-reality (AR) guided interactive cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) "trainer". For this trainer, a mixed reality smart glass, Microsoft HoloLens, and a CPR manikin covered with pressure sensors were used. To introduce the CPR procedure to a learner, an application with an intractable virtual teacher model was designed. The teaching scenario consists of the two main parts, theory and practice. In the theoretical part, the virtual teacher provides all information about the CPR procedure. Afterward, the user will be asked to perform the CPR cycles in three different stages. In the first two stages, it is aimed to gain the muscle memory with audio and optical feedback system. In the end, the performance of the participant is evaluated by the virtual teacher.},

RF-Wear processes wireless signals reflected off these tags to a compact single-antenna RFID reader in the user's pocket. In doing so, RF-Wear enables a first-of-its-kind skeleton tracking mechanism that is lightweight and convenient for day-to-day use, without relying on external infrastructure. We implement and evaluate a prototype of RF-Wear on commercial RFID readers and tags and demonstrate its performance in skeleton tracking. Our results reveal a mean error of 8-12° in tracking angles at joints that rotate along one degree-of-freedom, and 21°- azimuth, 8°- elevation for joints supporting two degrees-of-freedom.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a second most common neurological disorder that affects up to 10 million people worldwide. It has an evolving nature and the symptoms may vary from patient to patient. Thus, to increase the effectiveness of PD treatment, it is necessary a personalized medication plan. Currently, PD patients undergo symptom observation on semiannual clinical visits. This work aims at the development of a new way of observation via smartphones, while at the same time offering the PD patient a tool to better understand his medication needs. Our mobile application leverages smartphone's inbuilt sensors in order to keep track of subject's medication adherence throughout the day, taking shape as a short-term accelerometer-based game played several times a day, and allows PD patients to record when they took medication. The combination of collected datasets can be used in further studies in order to estimate the changes in PD severity and medication effectiveness over time.},

Inspired by the caterpillar movement, we develop a crawling robot to demonstrate this approach. The body of the robot is made of a P-Flex™ sheet and actuated by shape memory alloy (SMA). The robot uses the contraction force generated from the SMA and the elasticity of sheet itself in order to produce periodic changes in shape. Since these fold lines maintain elasticity, this robot can also be returned to a flat state for storage. Materials we use are commercially available and cheap enough to achieve mass-production. Besides, this design method provides an easy way to fabricate a variety of new functional origami robots and mechanisms by designing more complex origami patterns and built-in circuits.},

Anime fans create AMVs and share them on the Internet and with their friends. However, AMV creation takes time and effort. It is also hard to synchronize the scene changes with the musical rhythm. We propose a system to ease these difficulties. Our system splits a video by frames and crops the face images of the characters. The system then associates the face images and the scenes of the characters and classifies the face images to each character. Using this information, our system automatically extracts the scenes as clips for each character. This drastically reduces the time and effort to create an AMV.},

abstract = {Supermarkets offer a wide range of products which makes it challenging for consumers to choose between the different options and find the items they are looking for. Augmented Reality (AR) applications, however, have a high potential to enrich real-world objects with information which can be leveraged to improve this process. We developed an application that runs on a regular smartphone and helps users to choose between packaged groceries based on factors such as calories or sugar, rated on a scale from red (bad) to green (good). Compared to previous work, there is no need for a priori knowledge about product locations making the system suitable for many use cases. Moreover, information maps precisely onto the outline of the product's and not on the approximate shelf. To do so, no modifications of the objects, such as specialized tags, are necessary. Additionally, users can find items just by entering the name. Highlighting the packaging virtually helps to find the desired product. It is also possible to make a binary distinction between groceries that contain specific ingredients.},

abstract = {Most existing wireless power transfer (WPT) solutions are limited to 2-D configurations, which limits mobility when charging electronics. What is needed are 3-D WPT, which can deliver power anywhere in large volumes (e.g., factories, rooms, toolbox, etc). WPT using quasistatic cavity resonators (QSCR) proposed a route towards truly ubiquitous WPT, which safely charges devices as they enter a WPT enabled space. However, several drawbacks exist to this approach such as the need for a central pole and the spatially non-uniform power availability. To address these issues, we demonstrate a WPT system based on "multimode" QSCR [4]; this structure possess two resonant modes: pole dependent (PD) mode, which resembles the previous QSCR work and pole independent (PI) mode, which works whether or not the pole exist. This structure enables two operations: (i) pole-less operation, which works to the same degree as the previous QSCR without the central pole and (ii) dual-mode operation, which although requires the central pole, enables high-efficiency WPT all over the volume.},

abstract = {Wireless charging pads such as Qi are rapidly gaining ground, but its limited power supply range still requires precise placement on a specific point. 2-D wireless power transfer (WPT) sheets consisting of coil arrays are one well-known solution for this issue [3]. However, these approaches require custom-made designs by experts; what we need is a system that can be reconfigured by simply placing ready-made modules on the intended surface.In this demo, we present "Alvus", a reconfigurable 2-D wireless charging system which enables such simple construction of wireless charging surfaces. Alvus is based on multihop WPT, which constructs "virtual power codes" and consists of three types of ready-made resonator modules: transmitter, relay, and receiver. Our system instantly and interactively forms wireless charging surface on everyday objects (e.g. floor, wall, table, etc.) only by placing the resonator modules.},

We focus attention on gestures and aim to create a corpus of the relationship between the gestures performed by a speaker and his/her feelings.

We propose a system, YUGE, that allows us to collect and evaluate gestures in a playful way. YUGE's visual interaction enables a user to input various gestures with fun. Through the preliminary experiment, we found that our proposed system can classify gestures with almost the same accuracy as the conventional method.},

abstract = {Throughout the 2010s interest in both organic user interfaces and various tangible haptics systems has grown steadily. Prior art has shown this through transmitting shape as a means of a novel interaction. Oobleck is a mixture of water and cornstarch that exhibits properties of both a solid and liquid depending on whether or not force is applied to it at the time. Prior art mainly employed the use of sound and vibration to activate the oobleck. The results were somewhat effective but really lacked any precise control over the oobleck. However, by embedding magnetic particles and some chemical additives in the oobleck, finer and more dynamic control over the oobleck could be attained. A magnetic matrix was concepted as a user interface to test the oobleck medium. As a proof of concept, 4 solenoid valves with small neodymium attached to them were used. Neodymium were used instead of electromagnets due to their extremely dense and strong magnetic fields. The interface was designed to communicate fingertip touch between parties. 4 touch sensors were placed on a mouse shaped interface, when triggered, these would deactivate relays that controlled solenoids with small neodymium attached to them, springing upwards to be near a thin receptacle holding the oobleck. A user could then feel the shape of the oobleck change in specific locations to reflect the feeling of the person pressing their fingertips against the sensor area.},

Specifically, BreathCoach uses off-the-shelf devices to continuously monitor key bio-signals including breathing pattern (BP), inter-beat interval (IBI), and the amplitude of RSA, and intelligently calculates the optimal breathing pattern based on current and historical measurements. The recommended breathing pattern is then conveyed to the user in the form of an intuitive VR game to provide an immersive training experience. We will showcase a research prototype implemented on Android smartphone and smartwatch with two proof-of-concept VR game designs.},

Quote MAD is one genre of AMV that consists of video clips of quotes. Quote MAD creators will be required to search and extract the necessary scenes from anime. Since both searching and extracting processes take a lot of time, it is a burden for the creators. We developed a system called PoChotto that enables the creators to search for the scenes that they are looking for. This system helps the creators to search for scenes using quote information in anime and provides an interface for extracting scenes. From our preliminary experiments, we found that the time required for searching scenes can be as three times faster than the conventional method. This implies the burden on the creator can be reduced by our system.},

The primary objective of this workshop is to share insights, ideas, and discoveries on the quality of mobile human contributions.

In the past, an app only had one or a few specific functions, while nowadays, given the same interface, an app provides multiple interactive services to their users. However, we still have a weak understanding of user expectations and experiences with these apps. Towards this end, we extended our previous smartphone logging app, to the new 'mQoL Lab' for mobile Quality of Life, to strategically trigger user surveys and to achieve a better understanding of the user's actions in popular Android apps, like: Spotify, WhatsApp, Instagram, Maps, Chrome, Facebook and its Messenger. We present and discuss the results and their implications acquired during our first pilot study conducted with five users for four weeks in our Living Lab settings.},

abstract = {The rise of the smartphone opens up new possibilities for researchers to observe users in everyday life situations. Researchers from diverse disciplines use in-field studies to gain new insights into user behavior and experiences. However, the collected datasets are mostly not available to the public and thus results are neither falsifiable nor reproducible. Community datasets attempt to counter this problem, i.a. by sharing the cost of the data collection. One example is the crowdfunded campaign CrowdSignals. In this paper, we report on our experiences in doing research with crowdfunded data, drawing on the example of this dataset. By "zooming into" specific aspects of the data, we juxtapose the expectations we had when co-funding the data collection with our findings when analyzing the dataset. We highlight shortcomings and benefits of crowdfunded datasets, draw lessons and discuss how future crowdsourced data collection campaigns might be improved.},

LBSLab interacts with users via a mini-program built in the WeChat app, assembling several representative location-related functions such as conducting check-ins. A mobile user can join a data collection experiment by simply scanning a QR code. LBSLab can serve as an efficient system to study the user behavior of LBS-related applications.},

abstract = {In most crowdsensing systems, the quality of the collected data is varied and difficult to evaluate while the existing crowdsensing quality control methods are mostly based on a central platform, which is not completely trusted in reality and results in fraud and other problems. To solve these questions, a novel crowdsensing quality control model is proposed in this paper. First, the idea of blockchain is introduced into this model. The credit-based verifier selection mechanism and twice consensuses are proposed to realize the non-repudiation and non-tampering of information in crowdsensing. Then, the quality grading evaluation (QGE) is put forward, in which the method of truth discovery and the idea of fuzzy theories are combined to evaluate the quality of sensing data, and the garbled circuit is used to ensure that evaluation criteria can not be leaked. Finally, the Experiments show that our model is feasible in time and effective in quality evaluation.},

While much work has focused on optimizing the work quality and quantity in mobile crowdsourcing, surprisingly few studies have explored the type of tasks that might be suitable for different user contexts. This paper presents results from a proof-of-concept user study that aimed to uncover where, when and what type of tasks mobile workers are willing to complete. We find that different contexts do affect the type of work users are willing to complete. Finally, we lay out a complete design, key challenges and opportunities for a longer field trial that we hope to conduct in the near-future.},

In addition, we detail how these guidelines were implemented in a recent AC field study of ours. During our field study, 1081 EMAs were collected from 10 subjects over a duration of 148 days. Based on these EMAs, we perform a qualitative analysis of the effectiveness of our proposed guidelines. Furthermore, we present insights and lessons learned from the field study.},

abstract = {Everyday mobility encompasses different forms of public and private transportation. However, everyday mobility often does not involve substantial levels of physical activity. The goal of this workshop is to investigate ways of integrating physical activity into everyday mobility in accordance with widely accepted health recommendations. We aim to explore wearable and ambient systems that sense and support active navigation as well as conceptual aspects from a variety of perspectives, such as persuasive technologies. Researchers from different disciplines are invited to contribute their point of view by means of position papers, posters, and demonstrations. One planned outcome of this workshop is a set of design guidelines for navigation systems that explicitly consider health aspects. The workshop explores requirements and design challenges in a creative setting.},

abstract = {With the significant rise in the number of senior citizens living independently, there is a considerable research focus in the wellness and care of this geriatric population. While monitoring these citizens by heavily instrumenting them with tech could possibly aid in better prediction and prevention of certain ailments, this type of setup interferes with the need of independent living. We therefore explore the possibilities of a ubiquitous and pervasive monitoring system using smart-watches to allow making useful inferences in the subject's activities of daily living (ADL).},

Our dataset comprises of 198 individuals (184 females and 14 males) and the study lasted over six months. By analyzing carefully crafted user-studies and correlating with personal sensor data collected with Nokia devices, we found that the level of fatigue is one of the main sources of discomfort across the majority of the patients. We further perform an exploratory analysis, which provides an early indication that by actively monitoring and perturbing users' daily activity levels, such as increasing daily step-counts, sleep duration and decreasing body weight, patients can potentially reduce their daily fatigue level.},

Quantitative methods which can guide us towards our personal health goals will help us optimize our daily life actions, and environmental exposures. Ubiquitous computing is essential for monitoring these factors and actuating timely interventions in all relevant circumstances. We need to combine the events recognized by different ubiquitous systems and derive actionable causal relationships from an event ledger. Understanding of user habits and health should be teleported between applications rather than these systems working in silos, allowing systems to find the optimal guidance medium for required interventions. We propose a method through which applications and devices can enhance the user experience by leveraging event relationships, leading the way to more relevant, useful, and, most importantly, pleasurable health guidance experience.},

Furthermore, beyond the initial metric of computing, such as "efficiency" and "productivity", the benefits that people (users) benefit on a well-being perspective based on such ubiquitous technology has been greatly paid attention in the recent years. In our first "WellComp" (Computing for Well-being) workshop, we intensively discuss about the contribution of ubiquitous computing towards users' well-being that covers both physical, mental, and social wellness (and their combinations), from the viewpoints of various different layers of computing. Having strong international organization members in various ubicomp research domains, WellComp 2018 will bring together researchers and practitioners from the academia and industry to explore versatile topics related to wellbeing and ubiquitous computing.},

Since an average student spends 4 hours a day in the classroom, the emotional climate during lectures is likely to affect a student's overall well-being. We propose using the physiological synchrony among students as a measure of the classroom emotional climate. We analyze an existing data set containing electrodermal activity signals and affective states self-reports of 24 different students during 42 lectures. We show that an increment in group physiological synchrony is related to an improvement of the classroom emotional climate. The possibility to measure the classroom emotional climate unobtrusively has important implications for classroom experience sensing systems: it allows teachers to monitor and potentially control the classroom emotional climate, thereby improving students' teaching-learning performance and overall well-being.},

abstract = {Subjective well-being (SWB) refers to people's subjective evaluation of their own quality of life. Previous studies show that environmental pollution, such as air pollution, has generated significant negative impacts on one's SWB. However, such works are often constrained by the lack of appropriate representation of SWB specifically related to air quality. In this study, we develop UMeAir, which collects one's real-time SWB, specifically, one's momentary happiness at a given air quality, pre-processes input data and detects outliers via Isolation Forests, trains and selects the best model via Support Vector Machine and Random Forests, and predicts the momentary happiness towards any air quality one experienced. Unlike traditional representation of air quality by pollution concentration/Air Pollution Index, UMeAir intends to represent air quality in a more user-comprehensible way, by connecting the air quality experienced at a particular time and location with the corresponding momentary happiness perceived towards the air. The higher the momentary happiness, the better the air quality one experienced. Our work is the first attempt to predict momentary happiness towards air quality in real-time, with the development of the-first-of-its-kind UMeAir Happiness Index (HAPI) towards air quality via machine learning.},

abstract = {Towards wellbeing-awareness in computing, researches for estimating users' emotions using smartphone sensor data have been actively conducted as smartphones are getting more and more ubiquitous. Most studies have constructed emotion estimation models based on machine learning with contextual data from the smartphones and user's self-reporting ground truth label often collected via Experience Sampling Method (ESM). However, snice our emotion changes frequently in our daily lives, trying to collect the ground truth of such volatile emotions leads a storm of ESMs which could be burden to the users. In order to find better ESM methods, we propose and compare 3 ESMs, namely Randomized ESM that executes in randomly timings, Trigger ESM that executes when the user's behavior changes, and Unlocking ESM that sets up ESM on the unlocking screen. We constructed various emotional estimation models with four types of time granularity (1 day, 1/3 day, 3 hours, 1 hour) in four weeks experience with eight persons. As for the response rate, Unlocking ESM was the highest. In addition, it was clear that Unlocking ESM had the highest estimation accuracy in most cases.},

Interventions such as providing persuasive messages and controlling the use of applications need to assess the level of addiction to smartphone. To measure this addiction level, Smartphone Addiction Proneness scale (SAPS) has been proposed. However, it requires the user to answer 15 questions, which makes it burdensome, unreliable (because it is based on user response rather than their behavior), and slow (the estimation takes time). To overcome these limitations, we propose a technique for automatic recognition of SAPS score based on the actual daily use of the smartphone device. Our technique estimates the SAPS score using a regression model that takes the smartphone's states of use as explanatory variables (features). We describe the effective features and the regression model.},

We designed and prototyped an interactive ice skating dress, which detects the spinning movement of the skater, and displays it with changing colors.},

In this position paper, we explore design possibilities for wearable displays for increasing bodily awareness while the users are engaged in sports. This builds our vision of future sports displays, and provides a framework and inspiration for developing interactive sport technologies utilizing wearable displays. Our work contributes new directions in developing wearable devices for enhancing the experience of physical activity.},

abstract = {Telemedicine is an emerging challenge for the shortage of qualified professionals, particularly in under-resourced regions. Physical assessment by a non-medical doctor is a practice in telemedicine which discovers essential symptom of a patient who needs to consult a doctor. We aim at facilitating this stage with a conversational chatbot which identifies the patient by conversation. Adopting the procedures of physical assessment one critical types of conversation involves in the self-diagnosis. Further, it turned out that useful kinds of questions in chatbot at this stage are related to Yes/No questions. We discovered that particular difficulties lie in the ambiguous replies by the patients: a patient modifies a question which makes them answer yes or no, a response does not the corresponding reply to the question, a reply involves some part yes and some part no, and so on. Focusing on this particular type of question we introduce a text classifier using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and build a corpus using Twitter.},

The meditation, amongst many other relaxation techniques, is emerging as a popular practice for dealing with stress and anxiety. However, so far meditation and its effect on well-being have been mostly measured based on subjective feedback or in some cases in laboratory settings where bulky and expensive devices are used for capturing physiological data, therefore, unfit for daily life uses.

abstract = {UPDATED---August 17, 2018. Blood pressure (BP) is the most commonly performed medical office test. We developed a system that uses exclusively wristband-collected photoplethysmogram (PPG) to estimate BP. A dataset was collected and annotated during daily activities of 22 subjects. Preprocessing was applied to remove the signal noise and artefacts. Signal was segmented into cycles and features were computed. The RReliefF algorithm was used to select a subset of relevant features. The approach was validated with a person-independent leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) experiment. The LOSO experiment was updated with personalization to improve the results. The lowest mean absolute error (MAE) was 6.70 mmHg for systolic and 4.42 for diastolic BP. Ensemble of regression trees achieved the best results, which borderline meet the requirements set by two standards for BP estimation devices.},

abstract = {Falling is a serious threat to the elderly people. One severe fall can cause hazardous problems like bone fracture or may lead to some permanent disability or even death. Thus, it has become the need of the hour to continuously monitor the activities of the elderly people so that in case of fall incident they may get rescued timely. For this purpose, many fall monitoring systems have been proposed for the ubiquitous personal assistance of the elderly people but most of those systems focus on the detection of fall incident only. However, if a fall monitoring system is made capable of recognizing the way in which the fall occurs, it can better assist people in preventing or reducing future falls. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a fall monitoring system that not only detects a fall but also recognizes the pattern of the fall for elderly assistance using supervised machine learning. The proposed system effectively distinguishes between falling and non-falling activities to recognize the fall pattern with a high accuracy.},

This trend toward increased application diversity renders it difficult for a system to generate inferences about a user's evolving interests and naturalistic tasks in real-life settings. This workshop paper introduces a novel approach, aimed at training a user model to recognize real-life tasks on the basis of naturalistic user behavioral data via continuous screen monitoring. The resulting task model could be used in real-life settings for personal information assistance, which proactively retrieves useful documents and resources for the user, on a personal computer, with respect to the task context and information demand.},

abstract = {Passwords and PINs are used to protect all kinds of services against adversaries in our everyday lives. To serve their purpose, passwords require a certain degree of complexity which is often enforced through password policies. This results in complicated passwords, which might not only be hard for users to create, but also hard to remember. Furthermore, users might reuse passwords which they feel are secure. We present a scheme for deterministic password generation that solves these problems by assisting the user in generating and remembering passwords. The passwords are generated based on previously stored meta data (e.g., policies) and a master password. Since the password generation is deterministic, only the master password is required to recreate the passwords. As proof of concept we implemented a mobile app and pre-evaluated it. The pre-evaluation indicates that our scheme offers a good usability.},

The complex functionality of the human body paired with very individual circumstances make this a hard task, even for committed patients. Modern sensor technology and personal monitoring equipment such as smartphones can help us retrieve more information about the patients blood glucose level and their habits regarding food intake and physical activities. Based on this information, we propose an assisting system giving the patient helpful advice by predicting the blood glucose level for the near future and incorporating their activities and heart rate. Deep convolutional neural networks will be used for learning the glucose level predictor.

In this work, we conduct an empirical study of the usage of the Swarm app's cross-site sharing feature, i.e., the feature that enables Swarm users to share their check-ins to Twitter, and reveal factors that impact Swarm users' sharing behavior. We classify factors into two groups, i.e., check-in-related factors and profile-related factors, and dedicate to figure out their individual and combined influence on Swarm users' sharing behavior. Our work can provide a reference for researchers who collect Swarm check-ins from Twitter to study the characteristics of Swarm check-ins, assisting them to identify that whether their Twitter-collected check-ins are representative of the randomly selected check-ins collected directly from Swarm. The OSN sites can also improve their design of the sharing feature through the findings of this work.},

abstract = {Recent revelations about data breaches have heightened users' consciousness about the privacy of their online activity. An often overlooked avenue of collection of users' personal information are registration processes and/or social logins, such as login with Facebook or Google, implemented by smartphone apps. Although the extent of social login implementations on websites has been widely studied, there is negligible research on the extent of implementation of login features on smartphone apps. Hence, this work contributes to further the understanding of smartphone apps ecosystem through investigating whether smartphone apps use login features, and what relationships exist between login features and apps popularity. To address this research gap this work presents the systematic analysis of the publicly available Rico dataset, which contains 72,000 unique UI screen designs that describes smartphone apps design properties for 9,717 Android apps.},

abstract = {The proliferation of smart devices prompts the explosive usage of mobile applications, which increases network traffic load. Characterizing the application level traffic patterns from an individual perspective is valuable for operators and content providers to make technical and business strategies. In this paper, we identify several typical traffic patterns and predict per-user traffic demand utilizing application usage dataset in cellular network. Our primary contributions are twofold: First, we novelly designed a three-stage model combining factor analysis and machine learning to extract the traffic patterns of individuals. By detecting the latent temporal structure of their application usage, users in the network are grouped into six typical patterns. Second, we implement a Wavelet-ARMA based model to forecast per-user application level traffic demand. The evaluation on real-world dataset indicates the model improves the prediction accuracy by 7 to 8 times compared with the benchmark solutions.},

abstract = {In recent years, eye tracking technique has been greatly promoted. However, due to the limitations of the hardware performance of mobile device, the image captured by the mobile device camera has low resolution, so the existed image processing based eye tracking technique for mobile device still has low accuracy. This paper proposed an approach, MobiET, to compute the gaze fixation on mobile device. Based on the image processing of eye image, the rectangle area of eye was extracted; and then the geometric center of this area (EC), and the iris center of gravity (IC) were detected. Then the vector of EC-IC was generated, and by means of calibration, the mapping relationship between the vector and the gaze fixation coordinates could be calculated. The evaluation results showed that the proposed approach had high accuracy, e.g., 2.34 to 4.69 degrees of visual angle when the distance between eyes and smart phone screen was from 22 to 28 centimeters.},

abstract = {Smartphone applications (Abbr. apps) have become an indispensable part in our everyday lives. Users determine what apps to use depending on their personal needs and interests. App usage behaviors reveal rich clues regarding one's personal attributes. It is possible to predict smartphone users' demographic attributes through their app usage behaviors. In this paper, we predict users' gender and income level on a large-scale dataset of app usage records from 10,000 Android users. More specifically, we first extracted features from app usage behaviors in terms of app, category, and app usage sequence. Then, we accessed the predictive ability of individual features and combinations of different features for gender and income level. We achieved an accuracy of 82.49%, precision of 82.01%, recall of 81.38% and F1 score of 0.82 for gender, with the best set of features. For income level (three classes), we achieved an accuracy of 69.71%, precision of 70.31%, recall of 70.38% and F1 score of 0.70.},

abstract = {As transborder data flows of personal data are increasing in volume and frequency, a jurisdiction's capacity to enforce personal data protection laws outside its territory is becoming more necessary and more difficult. As is shown in this paper, there have been three main approaches to dealing with this issue: the jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction, organization-to-organization, and the data localization approaches. While the jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction approach makes transborder data flows contingent upon the existence of adequate/equivalent national data protection laws, the organization-to-organization approach makes it the responsibility of individual data controllers to meet basic standards of data protection when those data are processed offshore. The data localization approach on the other hand, obliges third parties to store personal data within the boundaries of the country of operation. The fact that each of these models has its strengths and weaknesses, and that different jurisdictions have adopted different approaches based on different motivations and interests, makes the actual pursuit of international data protection increasingly complex..},

The humanoid robot is only just one view of robots - the Internet of robotic things in public could give rise to robots in public spaces in forms that are more subtle and pervasive. This paper first highlights the issues and considerations arising from robotic things in public and suggests the need for regulations and cyber-institutions for such robotic things in public. The paper also outlines a notion of layers of behaviour and then introduces the notion of favour networks for robotic things.},

abstract = {In the domestic IoT domain, data is often collected by physical sensors and actuators embedded in the household and used to provide contextually relevant services to end users. Given that this data is often personal, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation can implicate IoT app developers, requiring them to adhere to "data protection by design and default" to ensure safeguards that protect a data subject's rights. Yet the simple-to-use task-oriented development environments that are commonly used to build domestic IoT apps provide little support for developers to engage with data protection measures. In this paper we present an overview of an IoT development environment that has been designed to help developers engage with data protection at app design time. We describe a data tracking feature, which makes all personal flows in an app explicit at development time and which provides the foundation for an additonal set of data protection measures, including personal data disclosure risk assessments, transparency of processing and runtime inspection.},

abstract = {Data protection regulations generally afford individuals certain rights over their personal data, including the rights to access, rectify, and delete the data held on them. Exercising such rights naturally requires those with data management obligations (service providers) to be able to match an individual with their data. However, many mobile apps collect personal data, without requiring user registration or collecting details of a user's identity (email address, names, phone number, and so forth). As a result, a user's ability to exercise their rights will be hindered without means for an individual to link themselves with this 'nameless' data. Current approaches often involve those seeking to exercise their legal rights having to give the app's provider more personal information, or even to register for a service; both of which seem contrary to the spirit of data protection law. This paper explores these concerns, and indicates simple means for facilitating data subject rights through both application and mobile platform (OS) design.},

While behavioral models are important in many domains, the ability to predict individuals' behavior is in the focus of growing privacy concerns. The legal and technological measures for privacy do not adequately recognize and address the ability to infer behavior and traits. In this position paper, we first analyze the shortcoming of existing privacy theories in addressing AI's inferential abilities. We then point to legal and theoretical frameworks that can adequately describe the potential of AI to negatively affect people's privacy. We then present a technical privacy measure that can help bridge the divide between legal and technical thinking with respect to AI and privacy.},

However, there is a wealth of information that is available for recognizing emotions when incorporating multimodal data. Considering this, the aim of this workshop is to look at current and future research activities and trends for ubiquitous emotion recognition through the fusion of data from various multimodal, mobile devices.},

Even though people regularly experience changes in their gastrointestinal (GI) tract which influence their mood and behavior multiple times per day, robust measurements and wearable devices are not quite developed for such phenomena. However, other manifestations of the autonomic nervous system such as electrodermal activity, heart rate, and facial muscle movement have been extensively used as measures of emotions or in biofeedback applications, while neglecting the gut. We expose electrogastrography (EGG), i.e., recordings of the myoelectric activity of the GI tract, as a possible measure for inferring human emotions. In this paper, we also wish to bring into light some fundamental questions about emotions, which are often taken for granted in the field of Human Computer Interaction, but are still a great debate in the fields of cognitive neuroscience and psychology.},

For these reasons, stress deteriorates mental health and ability to relax. Meditation has been shown to reduce stress and mitigate its negative effects. EEG activity in the alpha spectrum has been shown to increase during meditative sessions and has been linked to feelings of relaxation. In this study, students without being given training in meditative practices, are asked to try to clear their mind and meditate for 10 minutes. Participants were also given a questionnaire to help determine if they were able to clear their thoughts. Results show that 77.14% of participants were not able to clear their mind for proper meditation. This shows that students do not usually have a natural ability to relax and meditate.},

abstract = {Sensors can be worn on various positions on the body such as wristband, clothes, armband, ring, etc. However the head is a strategic position as our brain, eyes, ears, nose and mouth are near. We introduce a short state of the art of the existing technologies for sensing the mental states and the possible applications on eyewear. Analyzing the physical activity has been broadly covered by sensing the physical movement of the body, but mental states need more fine analysis of physiological signals such as blood volume pressure, skin conductance, and brain activity. These signals can give information about emotions and knowledge of the users.},

We are arguing for using these available devices for designing unobtrusive context-aware systems that are capable of detecting in-situ changes of complex cognitive states. We believe that this is also marking the time for taking studies on context-awareness out of constrained settings into the wild, in order to test these systems in the real world situations, in which they shall later be implemented.},

Typically, these systems require some kind of calibration prior to usage, unsuitable for the end user. Cameras that actively record the user's field of view became a valid alternative for lifelogging applications. But such approaches do not include gaze information and may cause privacy challenges. In this work we propose an in-depth analysis of the first long-term corneal imaging dataset (i.e., the reflection of the environment on the human eye). All data was manually labeled with information about the attended objects. This was compared to an automatic approach using a state-of-the art neural network.},

abstract = {Looking is a two-way process: we use our eyes to perceive the world around us, but we also use our eyes to signal to others. Eye contact in particular reveals much about our social interactions, and as such can be a rich source of information for context-aware wearable applications. But when designing these applications, it is useful to understand the effects that the head-worn eye-trackers might have on our looking behavior. Previous studies have shown that we moderate our gaze when we know our eyes are being tracked, but what happens to our gaze when we see others wearing eye trackers? Using gaze recordings from 30 dyads, we investigate what happens to a person's looking behavior when the person with whom they are speaking is also wearing an eye-tracker. In the preliminary findings reported here, we show that people tend to look less to the eyes of people who are wearing a tracker, than they do to the eyes of those who are not. We discuss possible reasons for this and suggest future directions of study.},

abstract = {Our everyday work is becoming increasingly complex and cognitively demanding. What we pay attention to during our day influences how effectively our brain prepares itself for action, and how much effort we apply to a task. To address this issue we present AttentivU -a system that uses wearable electroencephalography (EEG) to measure the attention of a person in realtime. When the user's attention level is low, the system provides real-time, subtle, haptic or audio feedback to nudge the person to become attentive again. We tested a first version of the system, which uses an EEG headband on 48 adults over several sessions in both a lab and classroom setting. The results show that the biofeedback redirects the attention of the participants to the task at hand and improves their performance on comprehension tests. We next tested the same approach in the form of glasses on 6 adults in a lab setting, as the glasses form factor may be more acceptable in the long run. We conclude with a discussion of an improved third version of AttentivU, currently under development, which combines a custom-made solution of the glasses form-factor with built-in electrooculography (EOG) and EEG electrodes as well as auditory feedback.},

With the introduction of the HoloLens (and increasingly other similar devices) a platform allowing wide spread practical application of such solutions has finally become available. However, today, not many such real world applications exist, and it is not yet fully understood which specific applications can benefit most from the technology in what form. As a promising novel application that optimally leverages the advantages of HMD based AR we propose a HoloLens based solution to support the debugging of electronic circuits. As a first step we have implemented a HoloLens interface to an oscilloscope. In this paper we describe the general idea, the fist implementation of the oscilloscope interface, and summarize initial qualitative feedback that we have received from users.},

abstract = {For efficient operation of taxis, it is important to provide taxi drivers with detailed information about passenger demand. In this paper, we propose a future taxi demand prediction algorithm by using real-time population data generated from cellular networks. We evaluated the effects of real-time population data on the accuracy of taxi demand prediction by using stacked denoising autoencoders. The results of an offline experiment conducted herein indicate that when real-time population data were used, the root mean squared prediction error of the proposed algorithm was 1.370 as opposed to 1.513 when population data were not used. In addition, we conducted a field test. We implement a real-time prediction system based on realtime population data, the first such online real-world test conducted worldwide. In the trial, 26 participant drivers tried our demand forecast system. The results showed that the sales of participant drivers improved by 1,409 JPY per person per day, which represents a 3.9% increase in sales on average compared to the drivers who did not use the system.},

We present two new methods for inferring individual commuting route choice, which collectively constitutes city-level commuting flows. Both morning and evening flows are inferred and visualized. We believe that our methods and results are useful and contributing to both theory and practice, especially in the interdisciplinary field of urban computing and city science.},

Jerney system consists of three main components; passenger app, driver app, and dispatch system. Passenger books a shared ride via a mobile app by specifying origin and destination locations. The dispatch system then assigns a driver to the passenger and informs the passenger with pick-up and drop-off stations. Driver location can be monitored by the passenger once the ride has been booked. Jeryney system has been evaluated with real users in a user experience study from which there were positive feedbacks from the users, as they felt that the Jerney system was useful and easy to start using.},

The two-pronged problem entails systematic modeling and understanding of how land use impacts crowd flow to an area and in turn, how the influx of people to an area (or lack thereof) can influence the viability of business entities in that area. With cities becoming increasingly sensor-rich, for example, digitized payments for public transportation and constant trajectory tracking of buses and taxis, understanding and modelling crowd flows at the city scale, as well as, at finer granularity such as at the neighborhood level, has now become possible. Integrating such understanding with heterogeneous data such as land use profiles, demographics, and social media, enables richer studies on land use and its interdependence on mobility. In this work, we share findings from our preliminary efforts and identify key lines of research inquiry that can help urban planners towards data-driven policy decisions.},

To address this challenge, vision-based traffic systems have focused on detecting traffic-related objects' behaviors, such as vehicle position and velocity relative to pedestrians. In this paper, we propose a new and simple model for effectively recognizing overhead front point of vehicles, while only using a single stationary camera capturing from an oblique angle. The proposed system uses faster R-CNN model for detecting object bounding box and mask, projects the mask's extreme points down to find the car's ground front point, and transforms these coordinates from oblique to overhead frame of reference. Our experimental result shows that this method is effective for recognizing overhead front point of car (accuracy: 92.4%) within a certain tolerance.},

abstract = {In this study, we have developed a method that applies machine learning in combination with an optimization heuristic algorithm such as a genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the vehicle routing problem (VRP). Further, we developed a knowledge-based algorithm for a knowledge learning system. The algorithm learns to classify coordinates (unlabeled) into regions. Consequently, dividing routing calculations into regions (clusters) provides many benefits over traditional methods, and can result in an improvement in routing cost over the traditional company method by up to 25.68% and over the classical GA by up to 8.10%. It is also shown that our proposed method can reduce traveling distance compared to previous methods. Finally, the prediction of future customer regions has an accuracy of up to 0.72 for the predicted unlabeled customer coordinates. This study can contribute toward creation of more efficient and environmentally friendly urban freight transportation systems.},

abstract = {Fixed sensor stations are the primary means to collect environmental data in cities. Yet, their high cost of deployment and maintenance often result in an accurate but geographically-sparse monitoring. We advocate for a drive-by approach to urban sensing in which vehicles are used as sensors to scan the city with a high spatiotemporal resolution. We present City Scanner, a highly-customizable, self-sufficient platform that allows for cost-efficient drive-by sensing. City Scanner modules can be deployed on existing vehicles (e.g. busses and taxis) without interfering with their operations. We describe our first prototype that includes sensing modules for air quality, temperature, humidity, and thermal imaging. We discuss the challenges we encountered during an 8-months deployment of the platform on trash trucks in order to derive implications for the design of future drive-by sensing systems.},

ATSC systems demand the ability to strictly reflect real-time traffic state. The proposed fog computing framework, namely FogFly, aligns with this requirement by its natures in location-awareness, low latency and affordability to the changes in traffic conditions. As traffic data is updated timely and processed at fog nodes deployed close to data sources (i.e., vehicles at intersections) traffic light cycles can be optimized efficiently while virtualized resources available at network edges are efficiently utilized. Evaluation results show that services running in FogFly produce better performance comparing to those in cloud computing approaches.},

abstract = {The mood of a community influences work productivity, socioeconomic outcomes and general quality of life of its members, so being able to measure it opens a wealth of opportunities like, informing policies, scheduling events and possibly discovering the contexts that bring about undesirable moods within a community. Though there are a plethora of methods for measuring emotional states of individuals in lab settings (e.g. self-report, analysis of nonverbal behaviours, physiological sensors), they do not scale well to large numbers of people or in-the-wild settings. This paper examines the feasibility of inferring the mood of a community by measuring the walking speed of pedestrians, which is a technique that is unobtrusive, scalable, and readily available. Our preliminary results from our data collection reveal differences in walking speed at different times of the day; demonstrating the feasibility of our approach. We discuss the implications of our findings, followed by the future steps of this work.},

The application also captures their mood before and after each social media use, until it can automatically infer the mood of the user through their social media interaction pattern. Consenting users can transmit the data collected on their device to a central location for further analysis by researchers of human behaviour or mobile application developers to provide intervention to users or design guidelines for mobile applications.},

In this paper we mainly highlight two limitation factors- geometry and tampering and apply them in a case scenario considering diverse sensing modalities.},

abstract = {Pollution exposure assessment at the population level is an established enterprise for environmental scientists and public health officials---but efforts to help individuals monitor and track their personal pollution exposures have just begun to garner research interest. Self-tracking pollution exposure is challenging for several reasons, including current limitations in sensor size, accuracy, and cost, frequent calibration requirements, and that people's daily activities often interfere with data quality in wearable sensing. The goal of this research is to develop a human-centered computing framework for the emerging field of personal pollution exposure assessment. To that aim, in this position paper, we propose a Bayesian approach to combine environmental sensing data from different spatiotemporal resolutions, such as from citywide national monitoring stations, neighborhood-wide lightweight sensing nodes, and personal wearables.},

abstract = {Mobile-phone based activity recognition has been successfully applied to many useful scenarios like measuring the 'calories burnt' by a person. Unlike activities that are performed by a person alone, many activities are performed in a group-setting for example 'classroom teaching'. Because people often make friends with whom they are together, it's natural to look for communities in which people are engaged in similar physical-activities. Automated ways to learn such communities involve fusing physical-sensor-data from multiple users and hence, is a challenging problem. In this research, we measured physical-activities of seventy-two students located on two different university campuses for ten days. Using this data, we propose a model to detect communities based on similar physical-activities. Detecting such communities could be of great use e.g. it allows to invite new members who could be interested in similar activities and find those members who are in the community but are not actively engaged.},

They work by analysing the perturbations that the presence of a person causes on the communications exchanged by a high number of radio devices installed around the area. Typical numbers are some tens of devices for an area the size of a single-family house, with an accuracy around one meter and a high sensitivity to even the slightest movement. The literature about device-free localisation systems typically concentrates on improving sensitivity, accuracy and discriminating power, without worrying too much about the number of involved radio devices. In this paper, for the first time, we demonstrate that device-free localisation can work with reduced performance with as low as four anchors in an environment composed by two wide rooms. Being able to use so few anchors opens the possibility of several use cases where installing tens of devices is not desirable.},

abstract = {User interaction is an essential part of many mobile devices such as smartphones and wrist bands. Only by interacting with the user can these devices deliver services, enable proper configurations, and learn user preferences. Push notifications are the primary method used to attract user attention in modern devices. However, these notifications can be ineffective and even irritating if they prompt the user at an inappropriate time. The discontent is exacerbated by the large number of applications that target limited user attention. We propose a reinforcement learning-based personalization technique, called Nurture, which automatically identifies the appropriate time to send notifications for a given user context. Through simulations with the crowd-sourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk, we show that our approach successfully learns user preferences and significantly improves the rate of notification responses.},

abstract = {A hallmark of ambient displays is their constant presence in the periphery of the user's attention, such as the Ambient Orb1 that changes color based on the outdoor weather. Users of such a device can explicitly turn their attention to the device if they are curious about the current weather conditions, and also be notified of a change by noticing the light changing abruptly, e.g., as a thunderstorm suddenly begins. However, especially in a mobile context, it can be difficult to have truly continuous indicators that are not fatiguing, annoying, or consuming considerable power. We propose "pseudo-ambient" displays that are not continuous, yet are nearly always accessible since they are triggered at regular intervals. Our contention is that such displays can potentially provide most of the benefits of a fully continuous ambient display, with limited drawbacks. In this work we focus on haptic pseudo-ambient displays. Yet, we believe the same approach can apply to other modalities, such as visual and audio.},

abstract = {When it comes to attention and notification management, most of the previous attempts to visualise notifications and smartphone usage have focused on digital representations on screens that are not fully embedded in the users' environment. Today, the constant development in hardware and embedded systems including mini displays, LEDs, actuators as well as digital fabrication, have begun to provide new opportunities for representing data physically in surrounding environments. In this paper, we introduce a new way of visualising notification data using physical representations that are deeply integrated within the physical space and everyday objects. Based on our preliminary design and prototypes, we identify a variety of design challenges for embedded data representation, and suggest opportunities for future research.},

However, inferring cognitive load is extremely challenging, especially when performed without obtrusive, expensive, and purpose-built equipment. In this study we examine the potential for inferring one's cognitive load using merely cheap wearable sensing devices. We subject 25 volunteers to varying cognitive load using six different Primary tasks. In parallel, we collect physiological data with a cheap device, extract features, and then construct machine learning models for cognitive load prediction. As metrics for the load we use one subjective measure, the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX), and two objective measures: task difficulty and reaction time. The leave-one-subject-out evaluation shows a significant influence of the task type and the chosen cognitive load metric on the prediction accuracy.},

However, current means of assessing cognitive load are, with a few exceptions, based on intrusive methods requiring physical contact of the measurement equipment and the user. In this paper we propose Wi-Mind, a system for remote cognitive load assessment through wireless sensing. Wi-Mind is based on a software-defined radio-based radar that measures sub-millimeter movements related to a person's breathing and heartbeats, which, in turn allow us to infer the person's cognitive load. We built and tested the system with 23 volunteers engaged in different tasks. Initial results show that while Wi-Mind manges to detect whether one is engaged in a cognitively demanding task, the inference of the exact cognitive load level remains challenging.},

There is a need to extensively evaluate such notifications and understand their utility before adopting them in real-world alert systems.In this paper, we describe OpenAlerts, an open-source software that allows creating and evaluating the impact of simulated alerts and notifications. The proposed system is an extension to a testbed that was used by over two-hundred users across two university campuses to evaluate potential improvements to the US-based Wireless Emergency Alerts. The system allows A/B-type user testing of many potential enhancements including embedding maps, fine geo-targeting of alerts, embedding URLS, and speech-to-text.},

However, the current driving mode implementations are limited in the fact that they frequently misjudge driving activities and also only have the option of nullifying all incoming notifications. In this work we present an improvement to this design and propose two major improvements to the current driving mode implementations: the first to improve driving activity detection and the second to diversify the notification mechanisms when the user is detected to be driving. While the work is still at its preliminary stages, we foresee this work as a meaningful effort to initiate the design of smartphone notification systems more tailored to the users' needs.},

Multiple device types in the users' environment use visual, tactile and auditory cues to inform them about messages, events, and updates. All these devices differ in the used modalities to inform the users and in the offered configuration options for these modalities. Prior work investigated the distracting effects of notifications and how people interact with notifications. However, related work often only focuses on one platform at a time. Instead, we use interviews to investigate how users experience and deal with notifications generated by their different devices in their everyday lives. Our results show that users developed strategies to deal with notifications on their devices such as disabling (or not enabling) notifications, uninstalling applications, using do-not-disturb functionality, muting devices or even putting devices away. Only few users change the notification settings on their devices. As a consequence, the default settings selected by the device manufactures can drastically change how notifications are affecting users.},

abstract = {In the past decade, the number of always-connected mobile devices exploded. Smartphones are always with the user and host a large number of applications and services that use notifications to gain the user's attention. These notifications and their effects on users have been extensively researched in the context of human-computer interaction. In a body of prior work, numerous small- and large-scale studies were conducted to understand notifications as well as their effects. A common theme in these studies is the need for accessing users' notifications, often for logging purposes. In this paper, we present an open-source framework for notification research on mobile devices. The framework has been used as the foundation of multiple in-the-wild and in-lab studies, and has been downloaded by over 60,000 users. We explain the requirements, the architecture, and past application scenarios of the framework. The scenarios range from enabling reflection on mobile notifications to rich experiences in multi-device environments.},

abstract = {Real-world ubiquitous computing systems face the challenge of requiring a significant amount of data to obtain accurate information through pure data-driven approaches. The performance of these data-driven systems greatly depends on the quantity and 'quality' of data. In ideal conditions, pure data-driven methods perform well due to the abundance of data. However, in real-world systems, collecting data can be costly or impossible due to practical limitations. Physical knowledge, on the other hand, can be used to alleviate these issues of data limitation. This physical knowledge can include domain knowledge from experts, heuristics from experiences, as well as analytic models of the physical phenomena.This workshop aims to explore the intersection between (and the combination of) data and physical knowledge. The workshop will bring together domain experts that explore the physical understanding of the data, practitioners that develop systems and the researchers in traditional data-driven domains. The workshop welcomes addressing these issues in different applications/domains as well as algorithmic and systematic approaches to applying physical knowledge. Therefore, we further seek to develop a community that systematically analyzes the data quality regarding inference and evaluates the improvements from the physical knowledge. Preliminary and on-going work is welcomed.},

Recently, methods based on time-frequency spectra emerged to compensate motion artefacts. However, existing approaches are highly parametrised and optimised for specific scenarios. In this paper, we first argue that cross-validation schemes should be adapted to this topic, and show that the generalisation capabilities of current approaches are limited. We then introduce deep learning, specifically CNN-models, to this domain. We investigate different CNN-architectures (e.g. the number of convolutional layers, applying batch normalisation, or ensemble prediction), and report insights based on our systematic evaluation on two publicly available datasets. Finally, we show that our CNN-based approach performs comparably to classical methods.},

Therefore, this paper focuses on imputation of missing data in the time series of air pollutants using LSTM networks to improve the PM2.5 concentration prediction accuracy. Experimental result shows that the proposed LSTM-based imputation method presents better PM2.5 concentration prediction accuracy than mean-imputation method and moving average imputation method.},

abstract = {Perspiration level monitoring enables numerous applications such as physical condition estimation, personal comfort monitoring, health/exercise monitoring, and inference of environmental conditions of the user. Prior works on perspiration (sweat) sensing require users to manually hold a device or attach adhesive sensors directly onto their skin, limiting user mobility and comfort. In this paper, we present a low-cost and novel wearable sensor system that is able to accurately estimate an individual's sweat level based on measuring moisture. The sensor is designed in a threadlike form factor, allowing it to be sewn into the seams of clothing, rather than having to act as a standalone sensor that the user must attach to their body. The system is comprised of multiple cotton-covered conductive threads that are braided into one sensor. When a person sweats, the resistance between the braided conductive threads changes as moisture becomes trapped in the cotton covering of the threads. The braided three-dimensional structure allows for robust estimation of perspiration level in the presence of external forces that may cause sensor distortion, such as motion. We characterize the relationship between the volume of sweat and measured resistance between the braided threads. Finally, we weave our sensors into the fabric of a shirt and conduct on-body experiments to study users' sweating level through various activities.},

In this work, we present a framework developed to collect datasets containing heterogeneous sensing data derived from personal mobile devices. The framework has been used by 3 voluntary users for two weeks, generating a dataset with more than 36K samples and 1331 features. We also propose a lightweight approach to model the user context able to efficiently perform the entire reasoning process on the user mobile device. To this aim, we used six dimensionality reduction techniques in order to optimize the context classification. Experimental results on the generated dataset show that we achieve a 10x speed up and a feature reduction of more than 90% while keeping the accuracy loss less than 3%.},

We combine the advantages of a physics guided model and a data-driven model to achieve high accuracy with high spatial-temporal resolution. To evaluate the system, we deploy our air pollution sensing hardware on 29 taxis in the city of Shenzhen, and collected around 26.3 million data samples within 14 days.

However, while the well-behaved radar sensing model affords clear advantages, the cluttered indoor environment presents numerous challenges for reliable human sensing. Classic radar techniques are hard to call upon since the kinematic and clutter behaviours in aerospace are vastly different from their indoor counterparts. We demonstrate the peculiarities of indoor radar using a commercial 2D array commodity device in the 6 to 8.5 GHz band. We then present a set of processing tools suited for indoor radar human sensing. We show that excessive indoor clutter and erratic human kinematics can be largely mitigated building on such processing tools without resorting to much low-level techniques unsupported by commercial commodity radars.},

Therefore, it is important to mine the relationships between plain texts and emojis. In this paper, we present a neural approach to predict multiple emojis evoked by plain tweets. Our model contains three modules, i.e., a character encoder to learn representations of words from original characters using convolutional neural network (CNN), a sentence encoder to learn representations of sentences using a combination of long short-term memory (LSTM) network and CNN, a multi-label classification module to predict the emojis evoked by a tweet. Besides, attention mechanism is applied at word-level to select important contexts. Our approach is self-labeling and free from expensive and time-consuming manual annotation. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our model outperforms several automatic baselines as well as humans in this task.},

Instead of dividing a continuous sensor streams into sliding windows with fixed time duration, it builds activity recognition models using histograms of primitive motion symbols. However, this BoW method losses the sequential information in the symbol sequences and limits the performance of activity recognition. In this paper, we propose an activity recognition approach to get rid of this limitation and consider longer time dependency by capturing local features from the symbol sequences. We use a set of small sliding windows inside the symbol sequences to capture local features. Our algorithm utilizes the physical knowledge where the sequence of the selected window size of symbols reflects the context and order of an activity. We evaluate the activity recognition approaches on two public datasets. The results show that our approach achieved stable improvement on all the datasets, compared with traditional statistical and BoW approaches.},

abstract = {Occupant activity level information is essential in many smart home applications, such as energy management and elderly care. Various methods have been proposed for detecting occupant activities through vision-, acoustic-, or radio frequency-based methods. However, the visual-based methods function only when occupants are in the visual field, the acoustic-based methods are sensitive to noise, and the radio-based methods usually require occupants to carry receivers all the time. These requirements increase the difficulty of deployment and maintenance in typical indoor smart home scenarios.To overcome these shortcomings, we propose a structural vibration-based approach. Specifically, we develop a system with sparse sensor configuration deployed in the floor to monitor the activity levels of different areas. Compared to vision- and acoustic-based methods, our method is not restricted by line-of-sight and less influenced by noise. Compared to the access control system (ground truth), our system enables finer grained activity level estimation with a comparable resolution. We evaluate our system in a real-world deployment in an office building and used the building access control as the ground truth system. Our system shows a correlation coefficient at 0.836 when compared to the ground truth systems.},

abstract = {Volatile organic compound (VOC) recognition systems can be helpful tools in monitoring today's living environments surrounded by harmful chemicals including dangerous VOCs. By designing a mobile system where users can easily detect VOC materials in their surroundings, people can avoid VOC-contained environments or take actions to improve their living conditions. Unfortunately, current VOC detection systems require bulky devices, and the current technology does not allow this detection and classification process to take place in real-time near the user. In this work, we introduce a novel VOC recognition process using a smartphone camera and paper-based fluorometric sensors. Fluorometric sensors will change their color patterns as they are exposed to different VOC materials and the smartphone camera combined with simple machine learning algorithms can be used to classify different VOC materials. Specifically, we introduce how a fluorometric sensor dataset of different VOC materials is gathered, and present a set of preliminary machine learning algorithms for VOC classification using smartphones. Our results show up to ~88% accuracy in classifying eight different types of VOC materials using an LDA model.},

abstract = {Radio frequency (RF) signals have been used extensively to enable (indoor) localization and proximity detection based on Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI). However, localization systems often suffer from large data collection and calibration overhead, especially when being deployed in a new environment. RSSI fingerprinting based localization systems require the construction of a fingerprinting database. This localization data acquisition is a hindrance for the proliferation of localization systems in practice. Similarly, RSSI proximity applications require an RSSI calibration for the receiver hardware and the deployment environment. To overcome these problems, we propose the usage of visual 3D models which enable 6DOF localization and distance measurement with high accuracy. We then fuse this physical knowledge with RF data: (1) for automated acquisition of fingerprinting data and (2) easy calibration of a RF propagation model for proximity estimation.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a structure-adaptive approach for monitoring human gait using footstep-induced floor vibrations. Human gait information is critical for timely and accurate assessment and diagnosis of many health conditions. Footstep-induced vibration monitoring has been introduced in prior works as an accurate and cost-effective mean to provide continuous gait monitoring in indoor environments. Prior works in this field typically rely on inverse modeling approaches to map signal characteristics to gait information, but are limited due to varying signal characteristics in each new deployment structure. These changing characteristics introduce errors when attempting to use a model trained in one structure in another structure. To overcome this challenge, we propose a structure-adaptive approach that enables the transfer of a model trained in one structure to a new structure where no training data is present. To this end, we first find a lower-dimension space in which vibration responses share similarity across various structures and label the data in the target structure. Then, we use the labeled data to train a new model for footstep detection and monitoring in that structure. We evaluated our approach through real-world experiments in three types of structures (wood, concrete, and steel). Our evaluation results show that our approach achieves a footstep detection accuracy of between 85 and 97 percent and F1-score of between 86 and 97 percent, which represents 3-10X and 2. 2-15X improvements over the baseline approach, respectively.},

It provides an easy access to accelerometer signals of ten publicly open human activity data sets. Data sets are easy to access as OpenHAR provides all the data sets in the same format. In addition, units, measurement range and labels are unified, as well as, body position IDs. Moreover, data sets with different sampling rates are unified using downsampling. What is more, data sets have been visually inspected to find visible errors, such as sensor in wrong orientation. OpenHAR improves re-usability of data sets by fixing these errors. Altogether OpenHAR contains over 65 million labeled data samples. This is equivalent to over 280 hours of data from 3D accelerometers. This includes data from 211 study subjects performing 17 daily human activities and wearing sensors in 14 different body positions.},

abstract = {A body weight training (BWT) means the training which utilizes the self-weight instead of the weight machine. The feedback of form and proper training menu recommendation is important for maximizing the effect of BWT. The objective of this study is to realize a novel support system which allows beginners to perform effective BWT alone, under wearable computing environment. To make an effective feedback, it is necessary to recognize BWT type with high accuracy. However, since the accuracy is greatly affected by the position of wearable sensors, we need to know the sensor position which achieves the high accuracy in recognizing the BWT type. We investigated 10 types BWT recognition accuracy for each sensor position. We found that waist is the best position when only 1 sensor is used. When 2 sensors are used, we found that the best combination is of waist and wrist. We conducted an evaluation experiment to show the effectiveness of sensor position. As a result of leave-one-person-out cross-validation from 13 subjects to confirm validity, we calculated the F-measure of 93.5% when sensors are placed on both wrist and waist.},

abstract = {Since taking a detailed record of rehabilitation is difficult due to the busyness of practitioners, the chance of making quantitative analysis of rehabilitation is degraded. Automatic rehabilitation recording by activity recognition using wearable sensors offers the dual prospect of decreasing a practitioners' load and enabling quantitative analysis of rehabilitation. For highly accurate activity recognition, it is desirable to use a large number of sensors. On the other hand, usage of a larger number of wearable sensors increases a patients' discomfort and decreases practicality. Thus, we investigate the suitable number and positions of wearable sensors for activity recognition in rehabilitations. Experiments were carried out with 16 healthy people as subjects for 10 different behaviors in rehabilitation performed with seven inertial measurement units (IMUs) on the subjects' body. Then, we examined recognition accuracy while reducing the number of sensors with all combinations of sensor positions. As a result, 0.833 of F-measure value can be obtained with three sensors at the waist, right thigh and right lower leg.},

In this paper we explore machine learning of classifiers based on human activity data collected and annotated by non-experts. We consider the entire process starting from data collection through annotation including machine learning and ending with the final application implementation. We focus on three issues 1) can non-expert annotators overcome the technical challenges of data acquisition and annotation, 2) can they annotate reliably, and 3) to what extent might we expect their annotations to yield accurate and generalizable event classifiers. Our results suggest that non-expert users can collect video and data as well as produce annotations which are suitable for machine learning.},

We present then how we maximise the value of this dataset through two approaches aiming at improving the quality of the annotations post-hoc. First, we use template-matching (Warping Longest Common Subsequence) to spot a subset of events which are highly likely to be drinking gestures. We then propose an unsupervised approach which can perform drinking gesture recognition by combining K-Means clustering with WLCSS. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

In particular, in addition to being able to estimate the absolute position, the Wi-Fi positioning has attracted attention due to the low introduction cost due to already installed Wi-Fi base stations in various facilities. In Wi-Fi positioning, position estimation is mainly performed by using radio wave intensity (RSSI). However, at the time of radio observation, the body of the user shields the radio waves, which reduces the RSSI, and there is a problem that the positioning accuracy deteriorates. Therefore, in this research, the radio wave environment map is expressed using GMM (Gaussian mixture model), and the positioning accuracy is improved by considering radio wave attenuation by the human body in the Wi-Fi positioning using the particle filter.},

abstract = {We present a solution to the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) recognition challenge (team "S304"). Our experiments reveal two potential pitfalls in the evaluation of activity recognition algorithms: 1) unnoticed overfitting due to autocorrelation (i.e. dependencies between temporally close samples), and 2) the accuracy/generality trade-off due to idealized conditions and lack of variation in the data. We show that evaluation with a random training/test split suggests highly accurate recognition of eight different travel activities with an average F1 score of 96% for single-participant/fixed-position data, whereas with proper backtesting the F1 score drops to 84%, for data of different participants in the SHL Dataset to 61%, and for different carrying positions to 54%. Our experiments demonstrate that results achieved 'in-the-lab' can easily become subject to an upward bias and cannot always serve as reliable indicators for the future performance 'in-the-field', where generality and robustness are essential.},

abstract = {In recent years, activity recognition (AR) has become prominent in ubiquitous systems. Following this trend, the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) recognition challenge provides a unique opportunity for researchers to test their AR methods against a common, real-life and large-scale benchmark. The goal of the challenge is to recognize eight everyday activities including transit. Our team, JSI-Deep, utilized an AR approach based on combining multiple machine-learning methods following the principle of multiple knowledge. We first created several base learners using classical and deep learning approaches, then integrated them into an ensemble, and finally refined the ensemble's predictions by smoothing. On the internal test data, the approach achieved 96% accuracy, which is a significant leap over the baseline 60%.},

We have shown a comparison of different sensor-based features for the identification of a specific activity level. Besides, we have proposed a "Mod technique" method, which increases the accuracy of classifier outputs in offline processing method. We have assumed that the minimum switching time from one transportation activity to another is 1-minute as a base of this technique. Based on this assumption we have been able to correct the wrong prediction of the classifier outputs in each 1-minute data frame. Our proposed method brings 4.56% accuracy increase in the Random Forest (RnF) classifier output.

abstract = {At the SHL recognition challenge 2018, Team Tesaguri developed a human activity recognition method. First, we obtained the FFT spectrogram from 60-second acceleration and gyro sensor data for each of six axes. A five-second sliding window was used for FFT processing. About 70% of the spectrogram figures from the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation dataset were used for training data. Our model was based on CNN using FFT spectrogram images. After training for 50 epochs, F-measure was about 90% for acceleration data and 85% for gyro data. Next, considering the results of each sensor axis, to improve the recognition rate, we combined the information of multiple sensors. Specifically, we synthesized new images by combining the FFT spectrogram figures of two axes and the best combination condition was examined by correlation analysis. The highest score, 93% recognition, came from the vertically arranged images derived from the norm of acceleration and the y-axis gyro.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition based on the smartphone sensors has the potential to impact a wide range of applications such as healthcare, smart home, and remote monitoring. For simple activities like "Sit" and "Walk", it can be distinguished relatively easily. However, for similar activities with respect to transportations, such as "Train", "Bus" and "Subway", it still remains an open problem. To tackle this problem, this paper uses the recently proposed Independently Recurrent Neural Network (IndRNN) to process data of different lengths in order to capture the temporal patterns at different granularities. The unique property of IndRNN in terms of the gradient propagation allows it to construct deep RNN networks and extract good features. The proposed method has been applied and submitted to SHL recognition challenge as "UOW_AMRL".},

One-vs-one quadratic Support Vector Machine (1-1 QSVM) and Bagged Decision Trees with 45 learners (EoC-45) were used for classification of the DU Mobility Dataset. The same features/pipeline provided 91% and 92% classification accuracies respectively on the SHL recognition challenge dataset. Using one-vs-one cubic Support Vector Machine (1-1 CSVM) on SHL, we received the highest classification accuracy of 92.8%. Afterwards, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was applied on the dataset and accuracies of 93.6%, 88.18% and 90.05% were obtained for training, testing and validation phases.

abstract = {The objective of this work is to recognize modes of locomotion and transportation accurately, with special emphasis on precise detection of transitions between different activities. The recognition of activities of daily living (ADLs), specifically modes of locomotion and transportation, provides an important context for many ubiquitous sensing applications. The precise detection of activity transition time is also important for applications that require immediate response. Many prior signal processing techniques use a fixed-length window for signal segmentation, which leads to poor performance for detecting activity transitions due to the limitation of a single window size. In this paper, we construct weak classifiers based on different window sizes and propose a decision level fusion approach to effectively classify and assign a label for each sample by fusing the decisions from all weak classifiers. Moreover, we propose a set of phone orientation independent features to ensure the system can work with arbitrary phone orientation. Our team, The Drifters, attained an F-score improvement of 1.9%, increasing from 94% to 95.9%, using our proposed method compared to using a single fixed-size window segmentation technique.},

abstract = {The objective of this work is to determine various modes of locomotion and in particular identify the transition time from one mode of locomotion to another as accurately as possible. Recognizing human daily activities, specifically modes of locomotion and transportation, with smartphones provides important contextual insight that can enhance the effectiveness of many mobile applications. In particular, determining any transition from one mode of operation to another empowers applications to react in a timely manner to this contextual insight. Previous studies on activity recognition have utilized various fixed window sizes for signal segmentation and feature extraction. While extracting features from larger window size provides richer information to classifiers, it increases misclassification rate when a transition occurs in the middle of windows as the classifier assigns only one label to all samples within a window. This paper proposes a hierarchical signal segmentation approach to deal with the problem of fixed-size windows. This process begins by extracting a rich set of features from large segments of signal and predicting the activity. Segments that are suspected to contain more than one activity are then detected and split into smaller subwindows in order to fine-tune the label assignment. The search space of the classifier is narrowed down based on the initial estimation of the activity, and labels are assigned to each sub-window. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves the F1-score by 2% compared to using fixed windows for data segmentation. The paper presents the techniques employed in our team's (The Drifters) submission to the SHL recognition challenge.},

So, we propose a hybrid deep learning model: Deep Convolutional Bidirectional-LSTM (DCBL) which combines convolutional and bidirectional LSTM layers and is trained directly on raw sensor data to predict the transportation modes. We compare our model to the traditional machine learning approaches of training Support Vector Machines and Multilayer Perceptron models on extracted features. In our experiments, DCBL performs better than the feature selection methods in terms of accuracy and simplifies the data processing pipeline. The models are trained on the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) dataset.

abstract = {This paper describes our submission (team name: Ideas Lab @ UT) to the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) recognition challenge. The SHL recognition challenge considers the problem of human activity recognition from inertial sensor data collected at 100 Hz from an Android smartphone. Our data analysis pipeline contains three stages: a pre-processing stage, a classification stage, and a time stabilization stage. Our main finding is that performing classification on "raw" data features (i.e. without feature extraction) over extremely short time windows (e.g. 0.1 seconds of data) and then stabilizing the activity predictions over longer time windows (e.g. 15 seconds) results in much higher accuracy than directly performing classification on the longer windows. Our submitted model uses a random forest classifier and attains a mean F1 score over all activities of 0.973 on a 10% hold-out sample of the training data, suggesting that activity recognition can be performed quite accurately on the SHL dataset.},

abstract = {In this paper we, as part of the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion-Transportation (SHL) Recognition Challenge organizing team, present reference recognition performance obtained by applying various classical and deep-learning classifiers to the testing dataset. We aim to recognize eight modes of transportation (Still, Walk, Run, Bike, Bus, Car, Train, Subway) from smartphone inertial sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer. The classical classifiers include naive Bayesian, decision tree, random forest, K-nearest neighbour and support vector machine, while the deep-learning classifiers include fully-connected and convolutional deep neural networks. We feed different types of input to the classifier, including hand-crafted features, raw sensor data in the time domain, and in the frequency domain. We employ a post-processing scheme to improve the recognition performance. Results show that convolutional neural network operating on frequency-domain raw data achieves the best performance among all the classifiers.},

abstract = {The bases of the approaches of UCLab(submission 1) towards SHL recognition challenge are using Random Forest and letting it select important features. Using accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, gravity and pressure sensor as input data, features such as mean, variance, max, difference of max and min, and main frequency are calculated. We find that activities of Still, Train, and Subway are highly similar and hard to distinguish. To achieve robust recognition, we make predictions for every segment of 3 seconds and produce final prediction based on these predictions. Moreover, to deal with the case that one line contains two or more activities, we use a rule-based post processing to predict these activity labels. As a result, using the lines of last 20% in training dataset as validation set, predictions for 3-second segments have around 0.879 of F1-score and predictions for lines have around 0.942.},

abstract = {For high precision estimation with SHL recognition challenge, we use a deep learning framework based on convolutional layers and LSTM recurrent units (ConvLSTM). We, UCLab(submission 2), propose the model combined two different ConvLSTMs. One ConvLSTM of convolution layers has large kernel size and the other has small kernel size. We expect that these two ConvLSTMs extract the different kind of features like global features and local features. Then we concatenate each ConvLSTM output, and input to fully connected layer. Finally, we convert output of fully connected layer to probability distribution by applying soft-max function. We finally determine that we input 10 axes of sensors to our model. The axes we use are 3 axes of linear acceleration, 3 axes of gyroscope, 3 axes of normalize gravitational acceleration and pressure of difference from previous value. As a result, using last 20% of lines for validation, predictions have around 0.931 of F1-score.},

An effective way to help people break out of their bubble is engaging with other perspectives. When caught in a filter bubble, however, it can be hard to find an opposed conversation partner in one's social surroundings to discuss a particular topic with. Also, such conversations can be socially awkward and are, therefore, rather avoided. In this project, we aim to train different chat-bots to become highly opinionated on specific topics (e.g., pro/against gun laws) and provide the opportunity to discuss political views with a highly biased opponent.},

abstract = {Mental health issues affect a significant portion of the world's population and can result in debilitating and life-threatening outcomes. To address this increasingly pressing healthcare challenge, there is a need to research novel approaches for early detection and prevention. Toward this, ubiquitous systems can play a central role in revealing and tracking clinically relevant behaviors, contexts, and symptoms. Further, such systems can passively detect relapse onset and enable the opportune delivery of effective intervention strategies. However, despite their clear potential, the uptake of ubiquitous technologies into clinical mental healthcare is rare, and a number of challenges still face the overall efficacy of such technology-based solutions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in identifying, articulating, and addressing such issues and opportunities. Following the success of this workshop in the last two years, we aim to continue facilitating the UbiComp community in developing a holistic approach for sensing and intervention in the context of mental health.},

abstract = {Although mental illness is one of the most serious social problems, stress does not necessarily have a negative effect, on the contrary, an optimal amount of stress can result in individuals being able to perform better in tasks. While there have been several studies on estimating stress level from smartphone usage logs and several effective features were revealed as a result, there are few studies on estimating cognitive performance. Thus, in this paper, we explore several factors affecting the estimation of cognitive performance from smartphone logs. To conduct the analysis, we collected smartphone usage logs and Go/No-Go task data for 6 weeks from 39 participants in the wild. We found that the time to find intended app is related to cognitive performance. This result suggests that measuring the time to find intended app can be the effective feature of estimating cognitive performance from smartphone logs.},

We discuss multiple token designs and feature value schemes and evaluate the predictive power of the resulting features for stress recognition tasks using the StudentLife and Friends &amp; Family datasets. Our findings motivate further discussion and research on bag-of-words approaches for representing raw mobile sensing signals for health outcome inference.},

abstract = {The advances in mobile and wearable sensing have led to a myriad of approaches for stress detection in both laboratory and free-living settings. Most of these methods, however, rely on the usage of some combination of physiological signals measured by the sensors to detect stress. While these solutions work great in a lab or a controlled environment, the performance in free-living situations leaves much to be desired. In this work, we explore the role of context of the user in free-living conditions, and how that affects users' perceived stress levels. To this end, we conducted an 'in-the-wild' study with 23 participants, where we collected physiological data from the users, along with 'high-level' contextual labels, and perceived stress levels. Our analysis shows that context plays a significant role in the users' perceived stress levels, and when used in conjunction with physiological signals leads to much higher stress detection results, as compared to relying on just physiological data.},

abstract = {Timely detection of an individual's stress level has the potential to expedite and improve stress management, thereby reducing the risk of adverse health consequences that may arise due to unawareness or mismanagement of stress. Recent advances in wearable sensing have resulted in multiple approaches to detect and monitor stress with varying levels of accuracy. The most accurate methods, however, rely on clinical grade sensors strapped to the user. These sensors measure physiological signals of a person and are often bulky, custom-made, expensive, and/or in limited supply, hence limiting their large-scale adoption by researchers and the general public. In this paper, we explore the viability of commercially available off-the-shelf sensors for stress monitoring. The idea is to be able to use cheap, non-clinical sensors to capture physiological signals, and make inferences about the wearer's stress level based on that data. In this paper, we describe a system involving a popular off-the-shelf heart-rate monitor, the Polar H7; we evaluated our system in a lab setting with three well-validated stress-inducing stimuli with 26 participants. Our analysis shows that using the off-the-shelf sensor alone, we were able to detect stressful events with an F1 score of 0.81, on par with clinical-grade sensors.},

Usually, a therapist develops a physical training program to help patients retain their locomotor abilities, but in many cases, the challenge is to motivate and engage participants. To assist the therapist to engage participants we introduced the anthropomorphic social robot Kiro. Aiming to support the therapist along with a predefined routine, Kiro follows the instructions of the therapist to perform several exercises moving its arms and legs while motivating patients with personalized and motivational phrases. In this work, we report a preliminary user study consisting of two sessions with seven persons with dementia in which the robot successfully engaged with the patients and kept them motivated. Finally, we discuss the intervention design, adoption, and user interaction.},

abstract = {Collaborative writing has been a common activity in different professions for many years. Researchers from multiple disciplines, including from HCI and CSCW, have experimented and evaluated a number of collaborative writing tools. However, with the emergence of more modern technologies like cloud-based Google Docs, newer versions of Microsoft Word etc., collaborative writing practices are gaining in popularity and use. Yet, we know little about the accessibility of these systems and how they should be designed to best support the increasingly common collaborative practices that constitute everyday work groups and collaboration. Our research goal is to study how people with visual impairments collaboratively write with other sighted and/or visually impaired peers in practice, whether and how they use computer-mediated collaborative tools, and design new assistive technologies to facilitate collaboration among a group of writers with visual impairments or mixed abilities.},

abstract = {With the vision of building "A Smart World", Internet of Things (IoT) plays a crucial role where users, computing systems and objects with sensing and actuating capabilities cooperate with unparalleled convenience. Among many applications of IoT, healthcare is the most emerging in today's scenario, as new technological advancement creates opportunity for early detection of illnesses, quick decision generation and even aftercare monitoring. Nowadays, it has become a reality for many patients to be monitored remotely, overcoming traditional logistical obstacles. However, these e-health applications increase the concerns of security, privacy, and integrity of medical data. For secured transmission in IoT healthcare, data that has been gathered from sensors in a patient's body area network needs to be sent to the end user and might need to be aggregated, visualized and/or evaluated before being presented. Here, trust is critical. Therefore, an end-to-end trustworthy system architecture can guarantee the reliable transmission of a patient's data and confirms the success of IoT Healthcare application.},

Existing research on E-paper devices focuses on evaluating readability, usability and user-acceptance. However, there is little research on applying E-paper devices in scenarios other than reading. In this research, we aim to bridge this gap by investigating the potential of using E-paper devices in input-heavy applications scenarios that are realistic for both office work and school education, in pursuit of high efficiency, better usability and a healthier life style.},

The social media platforms have already proved that people's opinion varies to a large extent on any given topic. We want to present a data-analyzed visualization of this common scenario and find out the causes behind. The primary result of the experiment of this hypothesis points out the significant influence of human factors on the response of an individual to some common scenario. The next steps of this research will include larger user study data collection and find out the most intriguing key factors.

Focusing research on pressure sensitive insoles, within this particular type of foot interface, is beneficial as it is less obtrusive than wearing bulky cameras or multiple IMUs attached to the leg and foot. An insole can simply be worn inside footwear and remain unnoticed by others. The aim of this PhD research is to contribute new concepts that will complement previous research in the domain of mobile computing. To accomplish this, three application scenarios will be explored that related to foot interfaces, which has not broadly been explored yet such as evaluating exercise performance, inferring the user's mental state and distinguishing physical activities and detecting anomalies.},

abstract = {Emotions are the driving force for posting content on a social media platform. Although modeling and predicting in emotion with social media have been proposed, they often require post-investigation such as sentiment analysis. This often limits users to be aware of negative emotional states while publishing content on social media. In this project, we will propose an emotion detection technique by extracting the physiological responses of social media users from smartphone commodity sensors. We aim to provide design opportunities for social media platforms to raise emotional self-awareness of the users while using social media on the smartphone.},

abstract = {The explosion of IoT devices has meant that our daily activities will continue to be influenced by such technologies. This paves the way for a deluge of notifications to interrupt us frequently. Such interruptions can result in frequent task switching where a user might put off one's activities to respond to such notifications. We devise a strategy through which we can mitigate these notifications by relying on the user's typing patterns. Furthermore, with the help of a reinforcement learning algorithm, the feedback from these typing patterns is used by the system to manage the notification system.},

abstract = {Inappropriate alcohol drinking may cause health and social problems. Although controlling the intake of alcohol is effective to solve the problem, it is laborious to track consumption manually. A system that automatically records the amount of alcohol consumption has a potential to improve behavior in drinking activities. Existing devices and systems support drinking activity detection and liquid intake estimation, but our target scenario requires the capability of determining the alcohol concentration of a beverage.I and my colleagues develop Al-light, a smart ice cube to detect the alcohol concentration level of a beverage using an optical method (Fig. 1). Al-light is the size of 31.9 x 38.6 x 52.6 mm and users can simply put it into a beverage for estimation. It embeds near infrared (1450 nm) and visible LEDs, and measures the magnitude of light absorption. Our device design integrates prior technology [1] in a patent which exploits different light absorption properties between water and ethanol to determine alcohol concentration. Through our revisitation studies, we found that light at the wavelength of 1450 nm has strong distinguishability even with different types of commercially-available beverages. Our quantitative examinations on alcohol concentration estimation revealed that Al-light was able to achieve the estimation accuracy of approximately 2 % v/v with 13 commercially-available beverages. Although our current approach needs a regressor to be trained for a particular ambient light condition or the sensor to be calibrated using measurements with water, it does not require beverage-dependent models unlike prior work. Al-light enables different applications around alcoholic beverage drinking in addition to simple tracking as shown in Fig. 2.},

abstract = {Mental-health monitoring, biometric security analysis have lots of impact in the smart world. Speech recognition, voice identification are key technologies in these fields. However these are very challenging research areas because voice features can vary based on gender, physical or mental condition and environmental noise. In our paper, we identify emotional status based on Cepstral and Jitter coefficients. Cepestral co efficient has some important role since it carries the maximum information of voice signals. Rather than using the entire voice signal, we use short time significant frames, which would b e enough to identify the emotional condition of the speaker. Our hybrid framework is very realistic and inexpensive because it computes with a part of voice signal considering jitter. We support our method by providing better accuracy and true acceptance rate.},

abstract = {Life transitions are part of human experience. For women, transitions are an integral part of their lives, mainly due to the inherent biological changes unique to them. Life transitions such as menarche, pregnancy, miscarriage, childbirth, and menopause have profound implications for women's physical and mental wellness. For a woman, transition to motherhood is a joyous as well as stressful period in her life. Lack of care and support during this time can result in long-term adverse consequences for both mother and baby. Previous studies have identified a gap in expected and received support for new mothers, which can sometimes lead to postpartum depression (PPD). Compassion, which is empathy in action, may help reduce this gap. My research aims to develop a framework for understanding and designing compassionate interactions to foster maternal wellness during transition to motherhood.},

These systems are absent not only in auto rickshaws but also most public transports. For this system, surveys have been done in different phases among the passengers, drivers and even the conductors for a useful and successful result. Since the system is very cheap, the low-income drivers and owners of vehicles will be able to afford it easily making road safety the first and foremost priority.},

Therefore, for understanding the behaviour of an individual, besides the information of the individual, we need to look at the interaction of the individual in physical world groups. Likewise, the workers form various formal and informal groups in the organization for mutual interactions. For monitoring context as well as behaviours of the workers, identification of such groups and understanding their dynamics are essential. Moreover, this information is used for analysing the organizational efficiency. In an institutional environment, the knowledge of the student group formation helps the instructor to the analyse the performance of the students. On the other side, the proper selection of groups leads to the improvement of the students. Understanding the group dynamics in sports is also important. The proper interpretation of the group dynamics reveals the strategy of the team. Hence, for the future sports event, it is useful to the opponent team.},

abstract = {We propose a novel method for knitting advanced smart garments (e.g., garments with targeted electrical or mechanical properties) using a single, spatially-varying, multi-material monofilament created using additive manufacturing (AM) techniques. By strategically varying the constitutive functional materials that comprise the monofilament along its length, it is theoretically possible to create targeted functional regions within the knitted structure. If spaced properly, functional regions naturally emerge in the knit as loops in adjacent rows align. To test the feasibility of this method, we evaluated the ability of a commercially available knitting machine (a Passap® E6000) to knit a variety of experimental and commercially available, spatially-variant monofilament. Candidate materials were tested both to characterize their mechanical behavior as well as to determine their ability to be successfully knitted. A repeatable spatial mapping relationship between 1D filament location and 2D knit location was established, enabling the ability to create a variety of 2D functional pathways (straight, linear, nonlinear) in the knit structure using a single monofilament input. Using this approach, a multi-material monofilament can be designed and manufactured to create advanced functional knits with spatially-variant properties.},
