abstract = {The availability of multiple sensors on mobile devices offers a significant new capability to enable rich user and context aware applications. Many of these applications run in the background to continuously sense user context. However, running these applications on mobile devices can impose a significant stress on the battery life, and the use of supplementary low-power processors has been proposed on mobile devices for continuous background activities. In this paper, we experimentally and analytically investigate the design considerations that arise in the efficient use of the low power processor and provide a thorough understanding of the problem space. We answer fundamental questions such as which segments of the application are most efficient to be hosted on the low power processor, and how to select an appropriate low power processor. We discuss our measurements, analysis, and results using multiple low power processors and existing phone platforms.},

abstract = {Effective WiFi power management can strongly impact the energy consumption on Smartphones. Through controlled experiments, we find that WiFi power management on a wide variety of Smartphones is a largely autonomous process that is processed completely at the driver level. Driver level implementations suffer from the limitation that important power management decisions can be made only by observing packets at the MAC layer. This approach has the unfortunate side effect that each application has equal opportunity to impact WiFi power management to consume more energy, since distinguishing between applications is not feasible at the MAC layer. The power cost difference between WiFi power modes is high (a factor of 20 times when idle), therefore determining which applications are permitted to impact WiFi power management is an important and relevant problem. In this paper we propose SAPSM: Smart Adaptive Power Save Mode. SAPSM labels each application with a priority with the assistance of a machine learning classifier. Only high priority applications affect the client's behavior to switch to CAM or Active mode, while low priority traffic is optimized for energy efficiency. Our implementation on an Android Smartphone improves energy savings by up to 56% under typical usage patterns.},

A major concern of evaluating ubicomp systems is to study how practices and context of use emerge and develop over time when new technology is introduced. To introduce a sophisticated version of our own prototype in the course of an iterative design process, we conducted a public field trial of the system---a new platform for mobile democratic discussions in municipal planning---that we distributed via the Android Market. However, it turned out to be surprisingly difficult to evaluate our design in a setting that stretches over time, place, and without a preselected set of users. Analyzing our difficulties, we develop a general model for methods studying ubicomp systems. On the basis of this model, we characterize an openly interactive approach to field trials in order to look ahead rather than back.},

At the 21st anniversary of that published vision, I want to assess ubicomp's maturity and explore the identity challenge it faces. Today, ubicomp as a niche research topic no longer makes sense; we must celebrate its "disappearance" as a well-scoped research agenda because it has become a profound agenda across most of computing, and beyond. This should not be surprising; the 2nd generation of computing, the personal computer revolution, experienced the same profound disappearance. In celebration of this imminent disappearance, I will highlight the unique contributions of the ubicomp community, express some remaining intellectual challenges, and speculate on how to formulate new visions of computing that might succeed this third generation.},

abstract = {Inexpensive wireless sensing products are dramatically reducing the cost of in-home sensing. However, these sensors have been found to fail often and prohibitive maintenance costs may negate the cost benefits of inexpensive hardware and do-it-yourself installation. In this paper, we describe a new technique called SMART that uses application-level semantics to detect, assess, and adapt to sensor failures. SMART detects sensor failures at run-time by analyzing the relative behavior of multiple classifier instances trained to recognize the same set of activities based on different subsets of sensors. Once a failure is detected, SMART assesses its importance and adapts the classifier ensemble in attempt to avoid maintenance dispatch. Evaluation on three homes from two public datasets shows that SMART decreases the number of maintenance dispatches by 55% on average, identifies non-fail-stop failures at run-time with more than 85% accuracy, and improves the activity recognition accuracy under sensor failures by 15% on average.},

In our studies we identified 8 attributes participants use for determining if they think a food is "healthy" or not. Based upon our analysis, we reflect on current system designs and propose four future design opportunities: capturing context of healthy eating, preparation and reflection on healthy eating understanding, sharing understanding and in situ information support.},

However, building a practical home activity monitoring system remains a challenge. Striking a balance between cost, privacy, ease of installation and scalability continues to be an elusive goal. In this paper, we explore infrastructure-mediated sensing combined with a vector space model learning approach as the basis of an activity recognition system for the home. We examine the performance of our single-sensor water-based system in recognizing eleven high-level activities in the kitchen and bathroom, such as cooking and shaving. Results from two studies show that our system can estimate activities with overall accuracy of 82.69% for one individual and 70.11% for a group of 23 participants. As far as we know, our work is the first to employ infrastructure-mediated sensing for inferring high-level human activities in a home setting.},

This has led to the development of methods enhancing location privacy, and to the investigation of reasons for sharing location information. While computational attacks on location privacy and their prevention have attracted a lot of research, attacks based on humans strategies and tactics have mostly been considered implicitly. This note addresses this knowledge gap by reporting on a user study, which we conducted in the context of a location-based game. Participants had to identify other players over the course of several weeks. The results show that human strategies for deanonymization and re-identification can be highly successful and thus pose a threat to location privacy comparable to computational attacks. By incorporating real-world knowledge (that is not easily available in automated attacks), human players were able to efficiently identify other people in the game.},

We present an ultra-low-power method for passively sensing body motion using static electric fields by measuring the voltage at any single location on the body. We present the feasibility of using this sensing approach to infer the amount and type of body motion anywhere on the body and demonstrate an ultra-low-power motion detector used to wake up more power-hungry sensors. The sensing hardware consumes only 3.3 μW, and wake-up detection is done using an additional 3.3 μW (6.6 μW total).},

Although the advantage of the Internet is live communication between a performer and listeners, the current mode of communication is writing comments using Twitter or Facebook, or some similar messaging network. In one type of live broadcast, musical performances, it is difficult for a musician, when playing an instrument, to communicate with listeners by writing comments. We propose a new communication mode between performers who play musical instruments, and their listeners by enabling listeners to control the performer's camera or illumination remotely. The results of four weeks of experiment confirm the emergence of nonverbal communication between a performer and listeners, and among listeners, which increases camaraderie amongst listeners and performers. Additionally, the dramatic impact of a performance is increased by enabling listeners to control various camera actions such as zoom-in or pan in real time. The results also provide implications for design of future interactive live broadcasting services.},

It aims to automatically uncover and quantify characteristic behavior patterns in users' daily lives as well as disclose behavior clustering structure among multiple users. The key challenge is how to define a naturally interpreted representation for users' daily behavior patterns, which can be easily exploited to not only uncover the behavior similarity among multiple users but also predict users' future activities. In this paper, we define such a representation, and propose a probabilistic framework which can automatically learn it from mass amount of mobile data in unsupervised setting and exploit it to predict user activities. By an appropriate information sharing among multiple users, this framework overcomes single-user data sparsity problem and effectively identifies behavior clustering structures in a set of users. Experiments conducted on a public reality mining data set demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our methods.},

abstract = {Human behavior is often complex and context-dependent. This paper presents a general technique to exploit this "multidimensional" contextual variable for human mobility prediction. We use an ensemble method, in which we extract different mobility patterns with multiple models and then combine these models under a probabilistic framework. The key idea lies in the assumption that human mobility can be explained by several mobility patterns that depend on a sub-set of the contextual variables and these can be learned by a simple model. We showed how this idea can be applied to two specific online prediction tasks: what is the next place a user will visit? and how long will he stay in the current place?. Using smartphone data collected from 153 users during 17 months, we show the potential of our method in predicting human mobility in real life.},

abstract = {It is becoming harder to find an app on one's smart phone due to the increasing number of apps available and installed on smart phones today. We collect sensory data including app use from smart phones, to perform a comprehensive analysis of the context related to mobile app use, and build prediction models that calculate the probability of an app in the current context. Based on these models, we developed a dynamic home screen application that presents icons for the most probable apps on the main screen of the phone and highlights the most probable one. Our models outperformed other strategies, and, in particular, improved prediction accuracy by 8% over Most Frequently Used from 79.8% to 87.8% (for 9 candidate apps). Also, we found that the dynamic home screen improved accessibility to apps on the phone, compared to the conventional static home screen in terms of accuracy, required touch input and app selection time.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing technologies have traditionally striven to augment objects and the environment with sensing capabilities to enable them to respond appropriately to the needs of the individuals in the environment. This paper considers how such technologies might be harnessed to support language learning, and specifically Task-Based Learning (TBL). Task-Based Learning (TBL) involves doing meaningful tasks in a foreign language, emphasising the language's use in practice. TBL is seen as a highly engaging and motivating approach to learning a language, but is difficult to do in the classroom. Here, learners typically engage in activities that only simulate 'real-world' tasks, and as such only rehearse language use, rather than applying the language in practice. In this paper, we explore how an instrumented, context-aware environment whose design is grounded in pedagogical principles can support TBL. We present the French Kitchen, an instrumented kitchen for English speakers who are learning French, and describe a 46-participant evaluation of the kitchen. Based on the evaluation, we provide a set of design recommendations for those building instrumented systems for TBL.},

Our proof-of-concept results demonstrate great potentials of RGB-D perception: without need for instrumentation, our system can robustly track and accurately recognize detailed steps through cooking activities, for instance how many spoons of sugar are in a cake mix, or how long it has been mixing.

In this context, eco-feedback technologies that provide information on the driving behavior have shown to be an effective means to stimulate changes in driving in favor of both, reduced costs and environmental impact. This study extends the literature on eco-feedback technologies as it demonstrates that a smartphone application can improve fuel efficiency even under conditions where monetary incentives are not given, i.e. where the drivers do not pay for fuel. The field test, which took place with 50 corporate car drivers, demonstrates an improvement in the overall fuel efficiency by 3.23%. The theoretical contribution underlines the assumption that context-related feedback can favorably influence behavior even without direct financial benefits for the agent. Given the large share of corporate cars, findings are also of high practical importance and motivate future research on eco-driving feedback technologies.},

To this end, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of FigureEnergy, a novel interactive visualisation that allows users to annotate and manipulate a graphical representation of their own electricity consumption data, and therefore make sense of their past energy usage and understand when, how, and to what end, some amount of energy was used. To validate our design, we deployed FigureEnergy "in the wild" -- 12 participants installed meters in their homes and used the system for a period of two weeks. The results suggest that the annotation approach is successful overall: by engaging with the data users started to relate energy consumption to activities rather than just to appliances. Moreover, they were able to discover that some appliances consume more than they expected, despite having had prior experience of using other electricity displays.},

abstract = {The bedroom environment can have a significant impact on the quality of a person's sleep. Experts recommend sleeping in a room that is cool, dark, quiet, and free from disruptors to ensure the best quality sleep. However, it is sometimes difficult for a person to assess which factors in the environment may be causing disrupted sleep. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and initial evaluation of a capture and access system, called Lullaby. Lullaby combines temperature, light, and motion sensors, audio and photos, and an off-the-shelf sleep sensor to provide a comprehensive recording of a person's sleep. Lullaby allows users to review graphs and access recordings of factors relating to their sleep quality and environmental conditions to look for trends and potential causes of sleep disruptions. In this paper, we report results of a feasibility study where participants (N=4) used Lullaby in their homes for two weeks. Based on our experiences, we discuss design insights for sleep technologies, capture and access applications, and personal informatics tools.},

Automatic detection of flocks has several important applications, including evacuation management and socially aware computing. The novelty of this paper is, firstly, to use data fusion techniques to combine several sensor modalities (WiFi, accelerometer and compass) to improve recognition accuracy over previous unimodal approaches. Secondly, improve the recognition of flocks using hierarchical clustering. We use a dataset comprising 16 subjects forming one to four flocks walking in a building on single and multiple floors. With the best settings, we achieve a F-score accuracy of up to 87 percent an improvement of up to twelve percent points over existing approaches.},

Despite the great potential in physiological stress recognition, there are some critical issues that need to be addressed such as the sensitivity and variability of physiology to many factors other than stress (e.g., physical activity). To resolve these issues, in this paper, we focus on the understanding of physiological responses to both stressor and physical activity and perform stress recognition, particularly in situations having multiple stimuli: physical activity and stressors. We construct stress models that correspond to individual situations, and we validate our stress modeling in the presence of physical activity. Analysis of our experiments provides an understanding on how physiological responses change with different stressors and how physical activity confounds stress recognition with physiological responses. In both objective and subjective settings, the accuracy of stress recognition drops by more than 14% when physical activity is performed. However, by modularizing stress models with respect to physical activity, we can recognize stress with accuracies of 82% (objective stress) and 87% (subjective stress), achieving more than a 5-10% improvement from approaches that do not take physical activity into account.},

Most microphone array work has focused on arrays of custom sensors in small spaces, and a few recent works have tested small arrays of commodity sensors in single rooms. This paper describes the first working scalable and cost-effective array that offers high-precision localization of conversational speech, and hence enables ongoing studies of verbal interactions in large semi-structured spaces. This work represents significant improvements over prior work in three dimensions -- cost, scale and accuracy. It also achieves high throughput for real-time updates of tens of active sources using off-the-shelf components. We describe the system design, key localization algorithms, and a systematic performance evaluation. We then show how source location data can be usefully aggregated to reveal interesting patterns in group conversations, such as dominance and engagement.},

abstract = {Only intrusive and expensive ways of precisely expressing emotions has been proposed, which are not likely to appear soon in everyday Ubicomp environments. In this paper, we study to which extent we can identify the emotion a user is explicitly expressing through 2D and 3D gestures. Indeed users already often manipulate mobile devices with touch screen and accelerometers. We conducted a field study where we asked participants to explicitly express their emotion through gestures and to report their affective states. We contribute by (1) showing a high number of significant correlations in 3D motion descriptors of gestures and in the arousal dimension; (2) defining a space of affective gestures.

In addition to traditional survey-based data, this work focuses on social networks derived from real-life data gathered through smartphones. Besides showing that the latter are superior to the former for the task at hand, our results provide a fine-grained analysis of the contribution the various feature sets are able to provide to personality classification, along with an assessment of the relative merits of the various networks exploited.},

We develop a novel framework that contains simple pre- and post-classification strategies to improve the overall performance. We achieve this through class-imbalance correction on the learning data using structure preserving oversampling (SPO), leveraging the sequential nature of sensory data using smoothing of the predicted label sequence and classifier fusion, respectively. Through evaluation on recent publicly available activity datasets comprising of a large amount of multi-dimensional sensory data, we demonstrate that our proposed strategies are effective in improving classification performance over common techniques such as One Nearest Neighbor (1NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Our framework also shows better performance over sequential probabilistic models, such as Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and when these models are used as meta-learners.},

Wearable sensing technologies can be used to gather data for activity recognition without requiring sensors to be installed in the infrastructure. However, the user may need to wear multiple sensors for accurate recognition of a larger number of different activities. We developed a wearable acoustic sensor, called BodyScope, to record the sounds produced in the user's throat area and classify them into user activities, such as eating, drinking, speaking, laughing, and coughing. The F-measure of the Support Vector Machine classification of 12 activities using only our BodyScope sensor was 79.5%. We also conducted a small-scale in-the-wild study, and found that BodyScope was able to identify four activities (eating, drinking, speaking, and laughing) at 71.5% accuracy.},

Changes in the speech production process is one of many physiological changes that happen during stress. Microphones, embedded in mobile phones and carried ubiquitously by people, provide the opportunity to continuously and non-invasively monitor stress in real-life situations. We propose StressSense for unobtrusively recognizing stress from human voice using smartphones. We investigate methods for adapting a one-size-fits-all stress model to individual speakers and scenarios. We demonstrate that the StressSense classifier can robustly identify stress across multiple individuals in diverse acoustic environments: using model adaptation StressSense achieves 81% and 76% accuracy for indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. We show that StressSense can be implemented on commodity Android phones and run in real-time. To the best of our knowledge, StressSense represents the first system to consider voice based stress detection and model adaptation in diverse real-life conversational situations using smartphones.},

We show how vehicle travel times and road congestion can be inferred from anonymized signaling data collected from a cellular mobile network. While other previous studies have considered data only from active devices, e.g., engaged in voice calls, our approach exploits also data from idle users resulting in an enormous gain in coverage and estimation accuracy. By validating our approach against four different traffic monitoring datasets collected on a sample highway over one month, we show that our method can detect congestions very accurately and in a timely manner.},

We consider general principles of opportunistic routing and present the results of several studies with a corpus of real-world trips. Then, we describe how we can compute the expected value of asking a user about the primary destination so as to remove uncertainly about the goal and show how this measure can guide an automated system's engagements with users when making recommendations for navigation and analogous settings in ubiquitous computing.},

abstract = {The ability to foresee the next moves of a user is crucial to ubiquitous computing. Disregarding major differences in individuals' routines, recent ground-breaking analysis on mobile phone data suggests high predictability in mobility. By nature, however, mobile phone data offer very low spatial and temporal resolutions. It remains largely unknown how the predictability changes with respect to different spatial/temporal scales. Using high-resolution GPS data, this paper investigates the scaling effects on predictability. Given specified spatial-temporal scales, recorded trajectories are encoded into long strings of distinct locations, and several information-theoretic measures of predictability are derived. Somewhat surprisingly, high predictability is still present at very high spatial/temporal resolutions. Moreover, the predictability is independent of the overall mobility area covered. This suggests highly regular mobility behaviors. Moreover, by varying the scales over a wide range, an invariance is observed which suggests that certain trade-offs between the predicting accuracy and spatial-temporal resolution are unavoidable. As many applications in ubiquitous computing concern mobility, these findings should have direct implications.},

These specialists rely on direct observation of the behavior, usually in a controlled clinical environment. In this paper, we present a technique for using on-body accelerometers to assist in automated classification of problem behavior during such direct observation. Using simulated data of episodes of severe behavior acted out by trained specialists, we demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be used to segment relevant behavioral episodes from a continuous sensor stream and to classify them into distinct categories of severe behavior (aggression, disruption, and self-injury). We further validate our approach by demonstrating it produces no false positives when applied to a publicly accessible dataset of activities of daily living. Finally, we show promising classification results when our sensing and analysis system is applied to data from a real assessment session conducted with a child exhibiting problem behaviors.},

We test this modeling technique on 10 hours of data collected from accelerometers worn by babies pre-categorized as high-risk in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at UCI.

To tackle the challenges of drifting in estimation, sensitivity to phone position, as well as variability in user walking profiles, we have developed algorithms for reliable detection of steps and heading directions, and accurate estimation and personalization of step length. We've built an end-to-end localization system integrating these modules and an indoor floor map, without the need for infrastructure assistance. We demonstrated for the first time a meter-level indoor positioning system that is infrastructure free, phone position independent, user adaptive, and easy to deploy. We have conducted extensive experiments on users with smartphone devices, with over 50 subjects walking over an aggregate distance of over 40 kilometers. Evaluation results showed our system can achieve a mean accuracy of 1.5m for the in-hand case and 2m for the in-pocket case in a 31m\texttimes{}15m testing area.},

Room localization, which identifies the room a person or mobile phone is in, provides a powerful tool for characterizing human indoor activities and helping address challenges in public health, productivity, building management, etc. Existing room localization methods, however, require labor-intensive manual annotation of individual rooms.We present ARIEL, a room localization system that automatically learns room fingerprints based on occupants' indoor movements. ARIEL consists of (1) a zone-based clustering algorithm that accurately identifies in-room occupancy "hotspot(s)" using Wi-Fi signatures; (2) a motion-based clustering algorithm to identify inter-zone correlation, thereby distinguishing different rooms; and (3) an energy-efficient motion detection algorithm to minimize the noise of Wi-Fi signatures. ARIEL has been implemented and deployed for real-world testing with 21 users over a 10-month period. Our studies show that it supports room localization with higher than 95% accuracy without requiring labor-intensive manual annotation.},

Line segments at a certain height are extracted from the 3D point cloud, and are merged to form a polyline map, which can be further modified and annotated by users.

Many media fa\c{c}ades cover most of the outer shell of a building and come with a 3D form factor. They offer great potential for remote interaction in which the interactive area goes beyond the parts of the fa\c{c}ade that are visible from the user's current perspective. Common interaction techniques often focus on a fixed part of the media fa\c{c}ade. This restricts exploiting the full capabilities and the potential of such gigantic screens. In this paper we describe how to apply cartographic map projections to create 2D map representations of media fa\c{c}ades to address this problem. We describe how a continuous interaction with the media fa\c{c}ade is possible, independent of the form factor.

abstract = {A growing number of mobile apps are exploiting smartphone sensors to infer user behavior, activity, or context. Inference requires training using labeled ground truth data. Obtaining labeled data for new apps is a "chicken-egg" problem. Without a reasonable amount of labeled data, apps cannot provide any service. But until an app provides useful service it is not worth installing and has no opportunity to collect user data. This paper aims to address this problem. Our intuition is that even though users are different, they exhibit similar patterns on certain sensing dimensions. For instance, different users may walk and drive at different speeds, but certain speeds will indicate driving for all users. These common patterns could be used as "seeds" to model new users through semi-supervised learning. We prototype a technique to automatically extract the commonalities to seed personalized inference models for new users. We evaluate the proposed technique through example apps and real world data.},

abstract = {Smartphone security research has produced many useful tools to analyze the privacy-related behaviors of mobile apps. However, these automated tools cannot assess people's perceptions of whether a given action is legitimate, or how that action makes them feel with respect to privacy. For example, automated tools might detect that a blackjack game and a map app both use one's location information, but people would likely view the map's use of that data as more legitimate than the game. Our work introduces a new model for privacy, namely privacy as expectations. We report on the results of using crowdsourcing to capture users' expectations of what sensitive resources mobile apps use. We also report on a new privacy summary interface that prioritizes and highlights places where mobile apps break people's expectations. We conclude with a discussion of implications for employing crowdsourcing as a privacy evaluation technique.},

To better understand the current reality and possible future of living with other types of domestic technology, we went out into the field to conduct need finding interviews among people who have already introduced automation into their homes and kept it there--home automators. We present the lessons learned from these home automators as frameworks and implications for the values that domestic technology should support. In particular, we focus on the satisfaction and meaning that the home automators derived from their projects, especially in connecting to their homes (rather than simply controlling their homes). These results point the way toward other technologies designed for our everyday lives at home.},

At the same time, as the computer diffuses into the physical world, it loses its location-neutrality, exposing the urgent need for a debate of design choices in ubiquitous computing. In this paper, we discuss the process of urban development as a source of inspiration for such design choices. Looking from the ground up, of particular interest is the opportunity to localize and democratize an emerging ubiquitous computing infrastructure. The design choices we negotiate today will determine the society in which we will live in the future.},

The former recognizes not only "resting" or "walking" but also user's various living activities such as "vacuuming" and "brushing teeth" by using a built-in accelerometer and a built-in microphone. The latter engine recognizes the user's means of migration, namely, "resting," "walking," "running," and "boarding" by using a built-in accelerometer. It enables users to continuously recognize indoor-outdoor activities by switching between the two engines depending on an acquisition condition of GPS.},

In the near "sensor everywhere" future, a much simpler method for deploying WSN will be necessary for end-users. We propose LiDSN(Light Communication for Deploying Secure Wireless Sensor Networks) which enables users to achieve deployment tasks via simple interaction. LiDSN leverages light-based communication between an LED and a light sensor in order to add a new sensor node securely into existing WSN. Through touching interaction, a new sensor node ID and secret key can be transmitted to the WSN, and then the WSN is able to identify which node should be added while maintaining the security of the WSN.},

Participatory sensing involves volunteers using mobile phones and the embedded sensing capabilities to collect data, and is well suited for the task as it provides the students with a familiar tool for conducting complex scientific research. To accomplish this goal, we have developed two components: a toolkit for defining, creating, and managing a participatory sensing campaign, including automated generation of mobile applications; and a curriculum designed around the toolkit, where students conduct scientific research with mobile phones as their primary data collection tools. Thus far, the results of this work have shown the potential for participatory sensing as an informal education tool to increase engagement and interest in pursuing careers in science and technology.},

abstract = {This research investigates a space model server for indoor location-based services which require fine-grained spatial data. Functional and non-functional requirements for a space model server that supports such services are identified. A system architecture is proposed that scales well in terms of model size, query loads and types of services. The space model reuses a schema for network-based space layouts which supports high spatial resolution and efficient local queries. Properties of a query language used to extract partial models from the space model server are investigated. System implementation and validation are discussed.},

An application example is providing contextual information to caregivers of person with dementia to identify assistance needs. Environmental audio provides significant and representative information of the context and the challenge is to automatically identify audio cues coming from overlapping sound sources without sophisticated microphone arrangements. My thesis proposes a succinct representation of the audio, based on the spectral entropy of the signal, and we show experimentally its robustness to source overlap and noise. This would permit ubiquitous applications that perform sound-based activity identification directly in mobile phones.},

abstract = {Despite the proliferation of location-based services on mobile platforms, privacy concerns still refrain many people from using them regularly. Moreover, current location sharing tools often present over-simplistic privacy settings by which users are forced to the binary alternative of sharing everything or nothing. The goal of this research is to build novel privacy-aware tools through which users can share their location more easily and in the way they consider more appropriate. Starting from the study of the sharing functionalities and how people use them, I aim at building a platform for efficiently sharing location, supported by a usable interface through which users can easily understand how sharing works and feel in control of their data. Furthermore, the security mechanisms employed are conceived such that privacy is considered as an integral part of the sharing mechanisms, in a privacy-by-design approach.},

abstract = {With the widespread use of a smartphone, users tend to use their smartphone for a long period of time in unhealthy postures; bending forward the neck and watching the relatively small screen closely with concentration. If users keep such unhealthy postures for a long time, they are susceptible to musculoskeletal disorders and eye problems such as cervical disc and myopia, respectively. To prevent users from having these diseases, we propose a new methodology to monitor the posture of smartphone users with built-in sensors. The proposed mechanism estimates various values representing user postures like the tilt angle of the neck, viewing distance, and gaze condition of the user, by analyzing sensor data from a front-faced camera, 3-axis accelerometer, orientation sensor, or any combination thereof, and warns the user if estimated values are maintained within the abnormal range over the allowed time. Via the proposed mechanism, users are able to be aware of their unhealthy postures, and then try to correct their postures.},

The former recognizes not only "resting" or "walking" but also user's various living activities such as "vacuuming" and "brushing teeth" by using a built-in accelerometer and a built-in microphone. The latter engine recognizes the user's means of migration, namely, "resting," "walking," "running," and "boarding" by using a built-in accelerometer. It enables users to continuously recognize indoor-outdoor activities by switching between the two engines depending on an acquisition condition of GPS satellites.},

abstract = {One of the recurrent major environmental problems is the high energy consumption. It has been challenging to find methods of persuading people to have better habits on energy usage. We are proposing the use of personalization to enhance a mobile and pervasive-based gaming approach to better foster domestic energy awareness close to people. The game is based on real-time domestic energy consumption data and presents persuasive feedback information, beyond the competitive feeling of the game. The personalization mechanisms are provided by an external web service that is designed to serve different applications, even if from different systems or domains.},

abstract = {This poster presents an integrated framework to enable using standard non-sequential machine learning tools for accurate multi-modal activity recognition. Our framework contains simple pre- and post-classification strategies such as class-imbalance correction on the learning data using structure preserving oversampling, leveraging the sequential nature of sensory data using smoothing of the predicted label sequence and classifier fusion, respectively, for improved performance. Through evaluation on recent publicly-available OPPORTUNITY activity datasets comprising of a large amount of multi-dimensional, continuous-valued sensory data, we show that our proposed strategies are effective in improving the performance over common techniques such as One Nearest Neighbor (1NN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Our framework also shows better performance over sequential probabilistic models, such as Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and when these models are used as meta-learners.},

abstract = {Nowadays, since each sensor network is managed within a single organization, sensor data cannot be obtained externally. When these sensor networks are virtualized that means everyone is able to obtain data anywhere without minding which sensor network the data belongs, two features will be required. One of these is geographical range query. This research realizes it using Z-order in the same way with related works [1][2][3][4]. The other requirement is distributed sensor data management. Current systems adapt the way that stores the data in a (or some) centralized server(s), or that stores the data in many servers, having one centralized server to store indexes of the address of the data. This research proposes a method not relating real space geographical information and relative position of peer in ID space. By using this method, in the place where density of people and smart phones with many sensors increase suddenly such as Super Bowl and new year countdown in NY, by using DHT, sensor data don't concentrate on a specified peer on managing the data. This research simulates and evaluates this method.},

abstract = {Transportation mode (TM) detection is one of the activity recognition tasks in ubiquitous computing. A number of previous studies have compared the performance of various classifiers for TM detection. However, the current study is the first work aiming to understand how TM detection performance is impacted by how the recorded location traces are segmented into data segments for training a classifier. In our preliminary experiments we examine three trace segmentation (TS) methods---Uniform Duration (UniDur), Uniform Number of Location Points (UniNP), and Uniform Distance (UniDis)---and compare their performance on detecting different transportation modes. The results indicate that while driving can be more accurately detected by using UniDis method, walking and bus can be more accurately detected by using UniDur method. This suggests that choosing a right TS method for training a TM classifier is an important step to accurately detect particular transportation modes.},

For the designer, minimizing additional demands on the rider's attention is just as crucial when the device will be used while operating a vehicle, especially a bicycle or motorcycle. This riding glove uses common sensors to recognize a small set of hand gestures used by riders and then actuates appropriate LED patterns for enhanced gesture visibility. The configuration of LEDs translates the gesture to an illuminated directional chevron, extending functionality into the night hours. By equipping the device to recognize existing hand gestures, activation of directional LED signals is simplified allowing the rider to focus on riding while the glove responds to and extends the visibility of the rider's hand gestures. This context awareness allows the device to cooperate with the rider, rather than asking the rider to interact with the device.},

Under the hood, the operational semantics promotes resiliency: the failure of any element may cause degraded operation of the features that depend on it, but all others remain operational. Automated (re)deployment of TeC designs allows users to keep evolving their apps as they buy new gadgets or change their minds about features.},

User-provided passwords such as Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) are often employed to ameliorate these limitations. The use of passwords though, has its own vulnerabilities that are mainly caused by the passwords' static nature and low entropy. To eliminate the security threats caused by untrusted devices and static passwords, we propose the development of new types of biometric authentication, based on macroscopic human behavior.},

abstract = {Activity recognition using multiple body-worn sensors can directly monitor the movement of each body part and can recognize various activities accurately. However, using multiple sensors increases the chance of sensor failure or communication failure, and most current activity recognition algorithms do not work when failure occurs due to the difference (reduction) of the dimension of the feature vector from that of complete sensor data expected in system design time. Therefore, we compared three possible techniques to solves this problem on the feature value level: a classifier trained with reduced feature values, feature value compensation with multiple regression, and feature value compensation with kernel regression, in a no failure situation. All of these techniques do not depend on classification algorithms. While creating a regression model, which is in the training phase, requires relatively high computational power, compensation itself can work with low computational power. As overall results, kernel regression had the best performance that was the closest to the no failure situation. Also, the results imply that each sensor position has its own effective method and more accurate coping can be viable with the appropriate choice of the method.},

abstract = {Eight hour contextual observations have been conducted in the homes of 5 low socioeconomic status (SES) urban-dwelling older adults. The purpose of the observations was to understand the daily needs and challenges of older adults in order to design appropriate technology that can allow older adults to age-in-place (age at home). The long term goal of the study is to develop a suite of age-in-place technologies tailored to the lifestyle needs of low SES urban and rural-dwelling older adults. This paper presents initial findings and discusses how this ongoing research will be used to inform the design of future age-in-place technologies.},

When Squama is used as a wall, it dynamically controls the transparency through its surface, and simultaneously satisfies the needs for openness and privacy. It can also control the amount of sunlight and create shadows, called programmable shadows, in order to afford indoor comfort without completely blocking the outer view. In this video, we show how in future, architectural space can become dynamically changeable and introduce the Squama system as an initial instance for exemplifying this concept.},

This time-consuming and repetitive task renders processing large datasets economically infeasible. Our main contribution is the use of object detection algorithms to perform this analysis task automatically. We compare several object detection algorithms with regard to both speed and accuracy.

In this paper, we describe a novel algorithm that combines Viola Jones face detector and TLD (Tracking Learning Detection) algorithm. In a standard driving scenario, it achieves a 84% rate of detection. Furthermore, we have designed a filtering stage that allows a low false positive rate. The algorithms hardware requirement is a standard web cam, and it can potentially work in real time.},

The optimum distribution of the error (magnitude and direction) in the field of view varies for different applications. However, the results can be used for finding the optimum parameters that are needed for designing a head-mounted gaze tracker. It has been shown that the difference between the visual and optical axes does not have a significant effect on the parallax error, and the epipolar geometry can be used for describing the parallax error in the HMGT.},

abstract = {Using infrared based mobile eye trackers outdoors is difficult, and considered intractable by some [1, 2]. The challenge of bright uncontrolled daylight illumination complicates the process of locating the subject's pupil. To make mobile eye tracking more ubiquitous, we are developing more sophisticated algorithms to find the subject's pupil. We use a semi-supervised process to initiate the pupil tracking, automatically generate an ensemble of models of the pupil for each video, and use multi-frame techniques to help locate the pupil across frames. A mixture of experts (consensus) is used to indicate a good estimate of pupil location. The algorithm presented here details developing work in automatically finding the pupil in situations where there is a significant amount of light reflecting off the eye, when the subject is squinting, and when the pupil is partially occluded. The output of this algorithm will be cascaded into a subsequent stage for exact pupil fitting.},

Instead of the traditional dwell-time selection method, we experimented with five simple head gestures: nodding, turning left/right, and tilting left/right. The gestures were detected from the eye-tracking data by a range-based algorithm, which was found accurate enough in recognizing nodding and left-directed gestures. The gaze estimation accuracy did not noticeably suffer from the quick head motions. Participants pointed to nodding as the best gesture for occasional selections tasks and rated the other gestures as promising methods for navigation (turning) and functional mode switching (tilting). In general, dwell time works well for repeated tasks such as eye typing. However, considering multimodal games or transient interactions in pervasive and mobile environments, we believe a combination of gaze and head interaction could potentially provide a natural and more accurate interaction method.},

These devices typically contain many sensors, such as vision sensors (cameras), audio sensors (microphones), acceleration sensors (accelerometers) and location sensors (e.g., GPS), and also have some capability to send and receive data wirelessly. Sensor arrays on these mobile devices make innovative applications possible, especially when data mining is applied to the sensor data. But a key design decision is how best to distribute the responsibilities between the client (e.g., smartphone) and any servers. In this paper we investigate alternative architectures, ranging from a "dumb" client, where virtually all processing takes place on the server, to a "smart" client, where no server is needed. We describe the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative architectures and describe under what circumstances each is most appropriate. We use our own WISDM (WIreless Sensor Data Mining) architecture to provide concrete examples of the various alternatives.},

It presents many challenges, e.g., efficient capture of person's mobility, understanding of context changes and preservation of user privacy. We propose an accurate and energy-efficient method able to capture user's mobility, thus the context changes, while preserving his/her privacy. Our solution can be applied to systems that aim to efficiently sense context on smartphones to study large scale phenomena or perform location management.},

abstract = {Human mobility has been widely studied for a variety of purposes, from urban planning to the study of spread of diseases. These studies depend heavily on large datasets, and recent advances in collaborative sensing and WiFi infrastructures have created new opportunities for generating that data. However, these methods and procedures require the participation of a significant community of users through extended periods of time. In this paper, we address the problem of how to engage people to participate in the data collection process. We have conducted a user study on the utilisation of a mobile collaborative sensing application. We have found that users react positively to campaigns, but it is difficult to keep them participating for long periods of time. We also hypothesise that one must close the loop, rewarding the participants with services based on the collected data, eventually showing that there is added value obtainable from crowd sourcing.},

abstract = {People use an increasing number of consumer electronic devices to access their mobile apps. To enhance the applications' immersive user experience, these devices often expose APIs for accessing a wide array of sensors and domain-specific capabilities. Existing mobile application environments, however, only provide limited support for cross-device access of such APIs. To address this limitation, the Webinos platform was designed. Webinos is a virtualized Web-based application platform, aiming to support the collaboration of multiple devices within a single mobile application. In this paper we elaborate on the Webinos platform design. We discuss the encountered design challenges regarding portability, scalability, and privacy, and how these were mitigated.},

Recent advances in mobile and ubiquitous technologies provide an opportunity to efficiently and accurately capture important information preceding and associated with these CB's. The ability to obtain this type of data will help with both intervention and behavioral phenotyping efforts. Through collaboration with behavioral scientists and therapists, we identified relevant design requirements and created an easy-to-use mobile application for collecting, labeling, and sharing in-situ behavior data in individuals diagnosed with ASD. Furthermore, we have released the application to the community as an open-source project so it can be validated and extended by other researchers.},

The key idea of our approach is that when the mobile phone user performs a certain activity at home, the embedded magnetometer is capable of capturing the changes of the magnetic field strength around the mobile phone caused by the household appliance in operation. Our mobile application uses these changes as magnetic signatures for each of these appliance such that the daily household acitivities associated with these appliance such as cooking can be recognized.},

A large number of applications can take advantage of this, including healthcare, traffic control, and social network applications. However, these applications are complex by nature and introduce several challenges of their own, for example, reliable sensing, accurate context recognition, scalability, security, and the challenge of dealing with previously unforeseen side-effects of adaptations. These challenges can be surmounted when researchers of diverse background come together and provide different views of the same problems and help each other understand the complex relationships between contending ideas. The Casemans 2012 workshop opens the necessary platform for researchers of ubiquitous computing, autonomic computing, and similar fields to address these issues.},

Maintaining an appropriate level of privacy in the face of such complex and often highly dynamic systems is challenging. We argue that context awareness not only enables novel UbiComp applications but can also support dynamic regulation and configuration of privacy mechanisms. We propose a higher level context model that abstracts from low level details and contains only privacy relevant context features. Context changes in our model can trigger reconfiguration of privacy mechanisms or facilitate context-specific privacy recommendations to the user. Based on our model, we analyze potential privacy implications of context changes and discuss how these results could inform actual reconfiguration of privacy mechanisms.},

In fact, it can adapt content more accurately and faster in a high diverse and dynamic context. Content adaptation at the application and MAC layers of the AP is introduced in this paper.},

While the context-aware self-adaptive system models are under intensive research in individual computing domains, their integration into a collective adaptive system still remains a major challenge. This position paper visions a meet-in-the-middle approach, where horizontal integration is applied to sub-system models extracted from vertical integration. The integration relies on orthogonal behavior and execution models respectively capturing the functional and non-functional features of sub-systems. The construction towards guaranteed services can be achieved with composition of static (worst-case) execution models, while best-effort services can be constructed with statistical models. Given that each computing domain has, to some extent, formulated its own design flow of context-aware systems, the envisaged meet-in-the-middle integration approach maximizes the reuse of existing models and platforms, thus is promising for the highly-complex system design process.},

To do so, we must increase the accuracy and the granularity of our knowledge about the current state of environment.

Nowadays, houses are still evolving and have, within them, equipments always more smarter. It is not uncommon to see electronic devices such as computer, connected tv and smart sensors: as many powerful resources not completely used. However, those untapped capacities could be used for person monitoring, video processing and other greedy algorithms, without adding any new specialized component. Thus it could ensure the quality of services required by the user and the dependability of its home automation system.This paper presents a method of service deployment in an environment for handicap persons, based on ontologies and supervision.},

If people are aware of emotional states of their friends, they can start a conversation to understand why they feel like that and how to support them. I study on a new interaction method for the awareness of emotions and to manage the emotional states. This paper presents one part of my study that aims to help mobile users to interact offline with their friends when they need emotional support. Emotions of mobile users will be detected with the new emotion detection method in development.},

The most important of these media are public displays, which allow a low-cost barrier for finding potential friends through interaction via the display and through the attendance of displayed social events. In helping two people to both become aware of each other's existence and to pick media which suit their preferences, we believe such a system can increase the odds of two strangers forming a strong social bond.},

abstract = {Public Wifi hotspots in cafes and public places are based on wireless local area network technology (WLAN). In contrast to the common understanding of connecting directly to the internet when connecting to a Wifi hotspot, we are proposing to bring the original notion of connecting to a local network back to the fore. By hooking into the act of a user connecting to a local network, we see a design space emerge that allows us to spur various (off-and on-line) activities in a hyperlocal context. We propose to (re-)explore this notion of the locality of networks in the age of the ubiquitous Wifi hotspot in cafes, bars, community centers, and other (semi-)public places in order to facilitate co-located activities for such varied purposes as fostering local community, civic participation, sociality in general, and entertainment. We propose a network locality that builds on local infrastructure (WLAN) and combines personal devices (mobile phones) with stationary interactive surface technology (wall displays and tables) to facilitate social on-and off-line interactions in local settings. In this position paper, we outline technological opportunities associated with this idea as well as envisioned usage scenarios in different settings.},

This approach is applied to a manufacturing kitting operation, where humans and robots are working together to develop kits. Based upon a set of predefined high-level states relationships that must be true for future actions to occur, a robot can use the detailed state information presented in this paper to infer the probability of subsequent actions occurring. This would enable the robot to better help the human with the operation or, at a minimum, better stay out of his or her way.},

Along the road, one of the robotics community's major tasks is to work on the harmonization of trends, standardization of terms, interfaces and technologies. It is important to keep the scientific and social progress under control through sufficient public outreach and technology dissemination. Along those lines, the IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Society is sponsoring a working group entitled Ontologies for Robotics and Automation that will bridge cutting edge technology to users of the services---the general public.

The Dempster-Shafer evidence Theory (DST) gives a mathematical convenient framework for the evidential fusion representation and inference of uncertain information. However, DST yields counterintuitive results in high conflicting ambient intelligence situations. This paper aims to provide a new strategy to manage conflict in activity recognition process in the ambient intelligence applications. It addresses the challenge of uncertainty and proposes an evidential fusion model based on the management of conflicting situation to optimize decision making in activity recognition. The proposed approach gives intuitive interpretation for combining multiple sources in conflicting situations and avoids the problems of using The Dempster-Shafer rule of combination.},

They are therefore subject to restrictions in use (in real time) when the robot interacts with the user and the environment.The main objective of this paper is to propose a model of adaptive software architecture, which allows the robot to use several modalities and make the fusion of the data to increase its interaction with the environment while considering the context. We also introduce fuzzy logic in the processing of data from input modalities. This multimodal software architecture that considers the context is modeled by colored, timed and stochastic Petri nets (CTSPN) simulated in CPNTools.},

abstract = {As robots become more pervasive and ubiquitous in the lives of humans, they become increasingly involved in everyday tasks formerly executed by humans. Humans should expect robots to take on tasks to simplify our lives, by working with humans just as other humans do, in normal organizations and societies. This labor specialization allows humans more comfort, time or focus on higher level desires or tasks. To further this unification of relationships, the defined line between humans and other non-humans must become more indistinguishable. This ever increasing degree of indistin-guishability provides we care less about who or what executes a task or solves a goal, as long as that entity is capable and available. In this paper, we propose a model and a simple example implementation which minimizes the strict line between humans, software agents, robots, machines and sensors (HARMS) and reduces the distinguishability between these actors.},

abstract = {In the last few years, the increasing interest in location-based services (LBS) has favored the introduction of geo-referenced information in various Web 2.0 applications, as well as the rise of location-based social networks (LBSN). Foursquare, one of the most popular LBSNs, gives incentives to users who visit (check in) specific places (venues) by means of, for instance, mayorships to frequent visitors. Moreover, users may leave tips at specific venues as well as mark previous tips as done in sign of agreement. Unlike check ins, which are shared only with friends, the lists of mayorships, tips and dones of a user are publicly available to everyone, thus raising concerns about disclosure of the user's movement patterns and interests. We analyze how users explore these publicly available features, and their potential as sources of information leakage. Specifically, we characterize the use of mayorships, tips and dones in Foursquare based on a dataset with around 13 million users. We also analyze whether it is possible to easily infer the home city (state and country) of a user from these publicly available information. Our results indicate that one can easily infer the home city of around 78% of the analyzed users within 50 kilometers.},

abstract = {Location prediction systems that attempt to determine the mobility patterns of individuals in their daily lives have become increasingly common in recent years. Approaches to this prediction task include eigenvalue decomposition [5], non-linear time series analysis of arrival times [10], and variable order Markov models [1]. However, these approaches all assume sufficient sets of training data. For new users, by definition, this data is typically not available, leading to poor predictive performance. Given that mobility is a highly personal behaviour, this represents a significant barrier to entry. Against this background, we present a novel framework to enhance prediction using information about the mobility habits of existing users. At the core of the framework is a hierarchical Bayesian model, a type of probabilistic semantic analysis [7], representing the intuition that the temporal features of the new user's location habits are likely to be similar to those of an existing user in the system. We evaluate this framework on the real life location habits of 38 users in the Nokia Lausanne dataset, showing that accuracy is improved by 16%, relative to the state of the art, when predicting the next location of new users.},

abstract = {The analysis of human location histories is currently getting an increasing attention, due to the widespread usage of geopositioning technologies such as the GPS, and also of online location-based services that allow users to share this information. Tasks such as the prediction of human movement can be addressed through the usage of these data, in turn offering support for more advanced applications, such as adaptive mobile services with proactive context-based functions. This paper presents an hybrid method for predicting human mobility on the basis of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The proposed approach clusters location histories according to their characteristics, and latter trains an HMM for each cluster. The usage of HMMs allows us to account with location characteristics as unobservable parameters, and also to account with the effects of each individual's previous actions. We report on a series of experiments with a real-world location history dataset from the GeoLife project, showing that a prediction accuracy of 13.85% can be achieved when considering regions of roughly 1280 squared meters.},

Here, however, the latent variables which group users can be thought of not as themes but rather as factors which drive check in behaviors, allowing for a qualitative understanding of influences on user check ins. Our model is agnostic of geo-spatial location, time, users' friends on social networking sites and the venue categories-we treat the existence of and intricate interactions between these factors as being latent, allowing them to emerge entirely from the data. We instantiate our model on data from New York and the San Francisco Bay Area and find evidence that the model is able to identify groups of people which are of different types (e.g. tourists), communities (e.g. users tightly clustered in space) and interests (e.g. people who enjoy athletics).},

abstract = {The location based social networking services (LBSNSs) are becoming very popular today. In LBSNSs, such as Foursquare, users can explore their places of interests around their current locations, check in at these places to share their locations with their friends, etc. These check-ins contain rich information and imply human mobility patterns; thus, they can greatly facilitate mining and analysis of local geographic topics driven by users' trajectories. The local geographic topics indicate the potential and intrinsic relations among the locations in accordance with users' trajectories. These relations are useful for users in both location and friend recommendations. In this paper, we focus on exploring the local geographic topics through check-ins in Pittsburgh area in Foursquare. We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to discover the local geographic topics from the checkins. We also compare the local geographic topics on weekdays with those at weekends. Our results show that LDA works well in finding the related places of interests.},

abstract = {On behalf of the rapid urbanization, urban areas are gradually becoming a sophisticated space where we often need to know ever evolving features to take the most of the space. Therefore, keeping up with the dynamic change of urban space would be necessary, while it usually requires lots of efforts to understand newly visiting and daily changing living spaces. In order to explore and exploit the urban complexity from crowd-sourced lifelogs, we focus on location-based social network sites. In fact, due to the proliferation of location-based social networks, we can easily acquire massive crowd-sourced lifelogs interestingly indicating their experiences in the real space. In particular, we can conduct various novel urban analytics by monitoring crowd's experiences in an unprecedented way. In this paper, we particularly attempt to exploit crowd-sourced location-based lifelogs for generating a socio-cognitive map, whose purpose is to deliver much simplified and intuitive perspective of urban space. For the purpose, we measure socio-cognitive distance among urban clusters based on human mobility to represent accessibility of urban areas based on crowd's movement. Finally, we generate a socio-cognitive map reflecting the proposed socio-cognitive distances which have computed with massive geo-tagged tweets from Twitter.},

abstract = {The proliferation of Location-based Social Networks (LBSNs) has been rapid during the last year due to the number of novel services they can support. The main interaction between users in an LBSN is location sharing, which builds the spatial component of the system. The majority of the LBSNs make use of the notion of check-in, to enable users to volunteeringly share their whereabouts with their peers and the system. The flow of this spatial information is unidirectional and originates from the users' side. Given that currently there is no infrastructure in place for detecting fake checkins, the quality of the spatial information plane of an LBSN is solely based on the honesty of the users. In this paper, we seek to raise the awareness of the community for this problem, by identifying and discussing the effects of the presence of fake location information. We further present a preliminary design of a fake check-in detection scheme, based on location-proofs. Our initial simulation results show that if we do not consider the infrastructural constraints, location-proofs can form a viable technical solution.},

Recently, many related works address to detect real world events from social media such as Twitter. However, geotagged tweets often contain noise, which means tweets which are not content-wise related to users' location. This noise is problem for detecting real world events. To address and solve the problem, we define the Place-Triggered Geotagged Tweet, meaning tweets which have both geotag and content-based relation to users' location. We designed and implemented a keyword-based matching technique to detect and classify place-triggered geotagged tweets. We evaluated the performance of our method against a ground truth provided by 18 human classifiers, and achieved 82% accuracy. Additionally, we also present two example applications for visualizing place-triggered geotagged tweets.},

abstract = {The importance of spatial information in Online Social Networks is increasing at a fast pace. The number of users regularly accessing services from their phones is rising and, therefore, local information is becoming more and more important, for example in targeted marketing and personalized services. In particular, news, from gossips to security alerts, are daily spread across cities through social networks. Content produced by users is consumed by their friends or followers, whose locations can be known or inferred. The spatial location of users' social connections strongly affects the areas where such information will be disseminated. As a consequence, some users can deliver content to a certain geographic area more easily and efficiently than others, for example because they have a larger number of friends in that area.In this paper we present a set of metrics that quantitatively capture the effects of social links on the spreading of information in a given area. We discuss possible application scenarios and we present an initial critical evaluation by means of two datasets from Twitter and Foursquare by discussing a series of case studies.},

However, people's locations change frequently and the rankings of people change dynamically too, which makes ranking on graphs a challenging work. To address this challenge, we propose the LBSNRank algorithm on graphs with nodes whose contents change dynamically. To validate our algorithm on real datasets, we have crawled and analyzed a dataset from the Dianping website.

abstract = {Researches on recommending followees in social networks have attracted a lot of attentions in recent years. Existing studies on this topic mostly treat this kind of recommendation as just a type of friend recommendation. However, apart from making friends, the reason of a user to follow someone in social networks is inherently to satisfy his/her information needs in asymmetrical manner. In this paper, we propose a novel mining-based recommendation approach named Geographic-Textual-Social Based Followee Recommendation (GTS-FR), which takes into account the user movements, online texting and social properties to discover the relationship between users' information needs and provided information for followee recommendation. The core idea of our proposal is to discover users' similarity in terms of all the three properties of information which are provided by the users in a Location-Based Social Network (LBSN). To achieve this goal, we define three kinds of features to capture the key properties of users' interestingness from their provided information. In GTS-FR approach, we propose a series of novel similarity measurements to calculate similarity of each pair of users based on various properties. Based on the similarity, we make on-line recommendation for the followee a user might be interested in following. To our best knowledge, this is the first work on followee recommendation in LBSNs by exploring the geographic, textual and social properties simultaneously. Through a comprehensive evaluation using a real LBSN dataset, we show that the proposed GTS-FR approach delivers excellent performance and outperforms existing stat-of-the-art friend recommendation methods significantly.},

Our idea is validated with a survey that asked potential travelers about their needs when looking for a travel partner. Moreover, we present a matching algorithm that is evaluated it with real tourists. The evaluation shows that considering complementarity when matching individuals is preferred by users.

In pursuit of this goal, this paper proposes a context model, Rover Context Model (RoCoM), structured around four primitives that can be used to represent and model any situation and activity: entities, events, relationships, and activities. It introduces the notion of templates of context for each primitive and describes, albeit briefly, the RoCoM Ontology (RoCoMO). It also describes the design and architecture of an abstract, generic and intelligent context-aware middleware called Rover II. We propose this framework as a solution to address the context problem as a whole, and be usable in many domains. We also illustrate its application with the aid of a context-aware public safety application that is deployed in the UMD campus.},

abstract = {This work introduces an open benchmark dataset to investigate inertial sensor displacement effects in activity recognition. While sensor position displacements such as rotations and translations have been recognised as a key limitation for the deployment of wearable systems, a realistic dataset is lacking. We introduce a concept of gradual sensor displacement conditions, including ideal, self-placement of a user, and mutual displacement deployments. These conditions were analysed in the dataset considering 33 fitness activities, recorded using 9 inertial sensor units from 17 participants. Our statistical analysis of acceleration features quantified relative effects of the displacement conditions. We expect that the dataset can be used to benchmark and compare recognition algorithms in the future.},

abstract = {Scores of health state for elderly people are regarded as important in nursing or medical fields. On the other hand, gaining the scores needs nurses to execute questionnaires. Owing to this, the execution rate for the health assessment is still low in ordinary homes. To solve this problem, we propose a method to predict the health score by using low-invasive sensors. We adopt regression as the prediction method and construct features to absorb the individual difference. As a part of feasibility study of social participation for elderly people, we execute the survey of health state using questionnaires by a nurse and install low-invasive sensors in real life simultaneously. Experimental result in the feasibility study shows a promise of the score prediction from sensor data. In addition, the result suggests that the extraction of features related to living behaviors improves the accuracy compared to using raw sensor data.},

However, although there has been a great deal of research into activity recognition, surprisingly little practical work has been done in the area of applications in mobile devices.

In this paper, we answer the question whether it is feasible to predict which App the user will open. The ability for such prediction can help pre-loading the right Apps to the memory for faster execution or help floating the desired Apps to the home screen for quicker launch. We explored a variety of contextual information, such as last used App, time, location, and the user profile, to predict the user's App usage using the MDC dataset. We present three findings from our studies. First, the contextual information can be used to learn the pattern of user's App usage and to predict App usage effectively. Second, for the MDC dataset, the correlation between sequentially used Apps has a strong contribution to the prediction accuracy. Lastly, the linear model is more effective than the Bayesian model to combine all contextual information and for such predictions.},

To evaluate the performance of our approach systematically, we generated sensor data with different error rates using a simulation. This data served as input for the activity recognition in a series of experiments. In these experiments we stepwise introduced and combined additional sources of uncertainty, i.e., different duration models and ignoring certain sensors, to demonstrate the robustness of our approach. Our evaluation shows that Computational Causal Behavior Models provide a basis for a robust activity recognition system.},

abstract = {Most of the systems for recognition of activities aim to identify a set of normal human activities. Data is either recorded by computer vision or sensor based networks. These systems may not work properly if an unusual event or abnormal activity occurs, especially ones that have not been encountered in the past. By definition, unusual events are mostly rare and unexpected, and therefore very little or no data may be available for training. In this paper, we focus on the challenging problem of detecting unusual temporal events in a sensor network and present three Hidden Markov Models (HMM) based approaches to tackle this problem. The first approach models each normal activity separately as an HMM and the second approach models all the normal activities together as one common HMM. If the likelihood is lower than a threshold, an unusual event is identified. The third approach models all normal activities together in one HMM and approximates an HMM for the the unusual events. All the methods train HMM models on data of the usual events and do not require training data from the unusual events. We perform our experiments on a Locomotion Analysis dataset that contains gyroscope, force sensor, and accelerometer readings. To test the performance of our approaches, we generate five types of unusual events that represent random activity, extremely unusual events, unusual events similar to specific normal activities, no or little motion and normal activity followed by no or little motion. Our experiments suggest that for a moderately sized time frame window, these approaches can identify all the five types of unusual events with high confidence.},

abstract = {Smart spaces, either public or private, has been a hot topic for more than a decade. They are claimed to bring various advantages for their users. However, only few people are actually using smart spaces. One of the reasons for that is the lack of attention paid to user interfaces used to control the space. Both industrial and academic research is often focused on hardware and device interoperability issues. There is not enough studies about end-user mental models, how and why people want to control and program smart spaces. In this position paper, we propose a strategy of how to bring end-user programming in smart spaces into real life. Our idea is three-fold: 1) concentrate on users' mental models, 2) create intuitive ubiquitous user interface, which combines the direct interaction pattern and the magnetic poetry interface metaphor, and 3) install a control system in a public smart space, where a lot of people can use it on daily basis. We aim to conduct a long term user study, from which we are planning to get unique data about evolution of people's expectations and mental models in the context of smart space control.},

This EMI induces a magnetic field that highly fluctuates the reading of the magnetic sensor in smartphones.

Experimental evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of the developed framework. Results show that MangoTricorder can detect and identify individual devices with 93%-98% accuracy.},

Our findings show that improved interfaces through web and mobile applications changed the interactions between users and their home system. Intelligibility and accuracy of the machine learning and sensing technology influenced the way participants perceive and adapt to the system. The convenient control over the system combined with limitations of the technology may have prevented the desired energy savings. These findings assert that thoughtful, continuous involvement from users is critical to the desired system performance and the success of interventions to promote sustainable choices.

abstract = {Researchers who develop new home technologies using connected devices (e.g. sensors) often want to conduct large-scale field studies in homes to evaluate their technology, but conducting such studies today is quite challenging, if not impossible. Considerable custom engineering is required to ensure hardware and software prototypes work robustly, and recruiting and managing more than a handful of households can be difficult and cost-prohibitive. To lower the barrier to developing and evaluating new technologies for the home environment, we call for the development of a shared infrastructure, called HomeLab. HomeLab consists of a large number of geographically distributed households, each running a common, flexible framework (e.g., HomeOS [4]) in which experiments are implemented. The use of a common framework enables engineering effort, along with experience and expertise, to be shared among many research groups. Recruitment of households to HomeLab can be organic: as a research group recruits (a few) households to participate in its field study, these households can be invited to join HomeLab and participate in future studies conducted by other groups. As the pool of households participating in HomeLab grows, we hope that researchers will find it easier to recruit a large number of households to participate in field studies.},

The trend of excessive information is, however, still ongoing, calling for further solutions to reduce a persons cognitive load or level of attention. Subliminal interaction techniques are considered a promising approach to deliver information to a person without causing much supplementary workload. This workshop aims at discussing the potential of subliminal perception to improve the information flow for human-computer interaction in the light of the fact that, up to now, the results have been mixed. One group of researchers has provided evidence that subliminal stimulation works, but the other has found that it does not, or even cannot, work. To clarify this issue, experts from various domains attending the workshop will discuss how subliminal effects can be scientifically supported or how a certain claim could be empirically refuted.},

abstract = {Following laws and provisions passed on the national and international level, the most relevant goal of future traffic and vehicular interfaces is to increase road safety. To alleviate the cognitive load associated with the interaction with the variety of emerging information and assistance systems in the car, subliminal stimulation is assumed to be a promising technique. To assess the potential of subliminal cues that could be used as their interaction means in future vehicles, we have organized a workshop within the frame of the automotive user interfaces conference (AutoUI 2011) to discuss this topic in a group of experts. This paper summarizes the findings from that workshop and should give researchers a starting point for their own activities in the field by indicating sort of grand research challenges and most critical issues. In particular, the goal of this summary article is to make this challenging research field more 'tangible' for researchers working in a range of disciplines, such as engineering, neuroscience, computer science, and psychophysiology. While currently discussed in the automotive domain only, the principles, research questions, and findings could immediately (and easily) be transferred to and adopted in other research fields. Interaction based on subliminal techniques can have an impact on society at large, making significant contributions toward a more natural, convenient, and even relaxing future style of interaction with any complex systems.},

abstract = {Is subliminal priming able to affect people's choices and decision-making? The prisoners' dilemma is a canonical example of a game analyzed that shows why two individuals might not cooperate each other, even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so. In the regular version of the prisoner's dilemma game, collaboration is dominated by betrayal, and as a result, the only possible outcome of the game is for both prisoners to betray the other. Regardless of what the other prisoner chooses one will always gain a greater payoff by betraying the other. Because betrayal is always more beneficial than cooperation, all objective prisoners would seemingly betray the other. This study examined whether subliminal emotional faces influence human's decision-making in the repeated prisoners' dilemma. In this study, subliminal emotional face was the independent variable. According to different emotional valence (happy, neutral or angry) and different present way of emotional faces (a transparent figure, or a backward masking face), the independent variable has 7 levels. So, 84 undergraduates were randomly divided into seven groups, participants in each group were subliminally primed with one kind of unseen face, after which they completed pre-designed negotiations task. The results showed that whatever the way to show subliminal emotional faces: by a transparent figure, or backward masking, both affected human's decision-making. Under the influence of different ways to present subliminal faces, participants choose their own behavior more cooperative or more uncooperative. These findings contribute to subliminal perception research on decision-making and the implications for this study are discussed.},

abstract = {The primacy hypothesis about affection (Zajonc, 1980) holds that positive and negative affective reactions can be elicited with minimal stimulus input and virtually no cognitive processing. This hypothesis challenges the cognitive appraisal viewpoint (Lazarus, 1982), which maintains that affection cannot emerge without prior cognitive mediation. There have been many studies shown that human emotion could be affected by subliminal visual stimulus, so how about subliminal auditory stimulus (SAS)? In this study two pieces of traditional Chinese music were used as SAS, and the unheard music was played in a continuous loop, which was different from the commonly used priming paradigm. 56 undergraduates were randomly divided into two groups, participants in one group were exposed to the subliminal happy music, and in the other group were exposed to the subliminal sad music. A before-and-after self-paired design was used to assess the emotion of all the subjects. During the experiment their galvanic skin response (GSR) and subjective ratings were recorded. The results showed that SAS caused the obviously change on human's GSR, but there was no change found in their subjective ratings of emotional valence (happy-unhappy). A lot of evidence showed that GSR was more sensitive than subjective ratings for the evaluation to current emotion status. The overall results of our study confirmed this perspective. So, we believed that SAS affected people's emotion, and this kind of affective priming wasn't perceived consciously by people themselves.},

In this paper, we propose a synthetic reality platform that, combined with psychophysiological recordings, enables us to study in realtime the effects of various subliminal cues. We endeavor to integrate various aspects known to be relevant to implicit perception. The context is of consumer experience and choice of an artifact where the generation of subliminal perception through an intelligent 3D interface controls the spatio-temporal aspects of the information displayed and of the emergent narrative. One novel contribution of this work is the programmable nature of the interface that exploits known perceptive phenomena (e.g. masking, crowding and change blindness) to generate subliminal perception.},

Besides unswayable luck and bravery, bluffing is the only skill that could massively improve the own chance of winning. This paper investigates whether a subliminal reaction in terms of changing facial surface skin temperature can be linked to the quality of the dealt private cards (i.e., the probability of winning the actual hand). Therefore, a dataset containing thermal imaging has been recorded during a No Limit Texas Hold'Em Poker tournament-session with six players in total and two players being observed with a high-resolution thermal imaging camera and manual provision of their dealt private cards as ground-truth. Preliminary results show that the facial skin temperature varies massively (±1.2°C), which constitutes the research hypothesis that a significant change in the surface face skin temperature can be linked to the quality of the dealt cards in terms of winning chance for an actually played hand.},

The Perifoveal Display varies how data is visualized based on the user's viewing direction. Data in the center of the user's focus is displayed in a lot of detail. Movement and change in brightness as well as amount of detail and size highlight important data changes that fall into the periphery. The results of our user study show that the system is able to support the user while observing complex data.},

abstract = {In todays product management life-cycle data play a growing role. Fixed product data, sensor readings and external events form continuously growing data collections, the digital object memory. To create a surplus value, this data is exploited in applications, e.g. by asking queries to such memories (e.g. "get unexpected observations"). The necessary logic to answer such questions may vary with time as different entities come in contact with different types of objects. This raises the challenge how to decouple questions from the corresponding logic, how to modify the logic, how to deploy such logic to the memory and how to execute the logic on the memory itself. This article describes work in progress concerning extending an existing memory framework to support analysis, processing and communication behavior of so called Active Digital Object Memories.},

However, since real-world actions are usually performed in contexts difficult to predict by the author of such instructions, a follower will have to adapt these before application.

The purpose of the research is to anticipate a time when correlations between the data sets that are associated with different objects are found and the objects themselves are used to impart this 'new' knowledge back to us. Such an occasion may be considered to represent a form of agency.Located within the technical and cultural context of the Internet of Things, this paper introduces a lineage for our relationship with objects from 1. Read Only, 2. Read and Write and 3. Read, Write and Act. The paper proceeds to establish the conditions for a third generation of Internet of Things by articulating the nature of networks, their structure and their capacity to support the principles of Actor-Network Theory which may lead to a condition in which objects may take on a form of agency.The paper further introduces an iPhone App entitled Take Me I'm Yours that operates as a working but speculative design project mimicking the conditions in which objects may talk to us. The designers speculate a design fiction in which object databases may begin to identify associations and propose 'actions' to a user. The application and demonstration at UbiComp 2012 will offer delegates an opportunity to experience a sense of what it may feel like in the future when objects may begin telling us what to do.},

Declarative approaches require more abstract thinking and higher modeling effort but enable greater flexibility. A survey of related work suggests, however, that the high modeling effort of declarative approaches is prohibitive to their practical application. In contrast, imperative approaches lead to static control-flow and over-specification. Still, they are used, mainly due to their simplicity. Our approach supports a systematic transformation process from imperative models to declarative ones. Our method comprises an imperative, workflow-based language that we extended with novel declarative constructs and an algorithm for converting imperative models into declarative ones. Our approach requires only a modest level of declarative specification literacy for reaching a degree of flexibility that formerly only expert designers could achieve with hand-crafted declarative models.},

However, it is unclear how laypersons perceive the increasingly active artifacts. These perceptions are likely to foreground their future responses to IoT objects as they become relevant actors in the physical world and begin to influence everyday user experience. We conducted an in-depth interview study to investigate individuals' knowledge, attitudes, expectations and concerns relating to IoT technologies. Findings show that affordances such as interactivity and modality can be reconceptualized in order to enhance user perceptions of relatedness with the objects. Different from technology-centric and user-centric approaches, the paper suggests a balance between human agency and object agency by adopting a need-oriented design paradigm when building an integral, self-adjusting, user-relevant archetype of IoT.},
