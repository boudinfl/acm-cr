abstract = {We describe our experience building and using a reasoning system for providing context-based prompts to elders to take their medication. We describe the process of specification, design, implementation and use of our system. We chose a simple Dynamic Bayesian Network as our representation. We analyze the design space for the model in some detail. A key challenge in using the model was the overhead of labeling the data. We analyze the impact of a variety of options to ease labeling, and highlight in particular the utility of simple clustering before labeling. A key choice in the design of such reasoning systems is that between statistical and deterministic rule-based approaches. We evaluate a simple rule-based system on our data and discuss some of its pros and cons when compared to the statistical (Bayesian) approach in a practical setting. We discuss challenges to reasoning arising from failures of data collection procedures and calibration drift. The system was deployed among 6 subjects over a period of 12 weeks, and resulted in adherence improving from 56% on average with no prompting to 63% with state of the art context-unaware prompts to 74% with our context-aware prompts.},

abstract = {Weight training, in addition to aerobic exercises, is an important component of a balanced exercise program. However, mechanisms for tracking free weight exercises have not yet been explored. In this paper, we study methods that automatically recognize what type of exercise you are doing and how many repetitions you have done so far. We incorporated a three-axis accelerometer into a workout glove to track hand movements and put another accelerometer on a user's waist to track body posture. To recognize types of exercises, we tried two methods: a Na\"{\i}ve Bayes Classifier and Hidden Markov Models. To count repetitions developed and tested two algorithms: a peak counting algorithm and a method using the Viterbi algorithm with a Hidden Markov Model. Our experimental results showed overall recognition accuracy of around 90% over nine different exercises, and overall miscount rate of around 5%. We believe that the promising results will potentially contribute to the vision of a digital personal trainer, create a new experience for exercising, and enable physical and psychological well-being.},

abstract = {This article investigates the conflicting area of user benefits arising through item level RFID tagging and a desire for privacy. It distinguishes between three approaches feasible to address consumer privacy concerns. One is to kill RFID tags at store exits. The second is to lock tags and have user unlock them if they want to initiate reader communication (user scheme). The third is to let the network access users' RFID tags while adhering to a privacy protocol (agent scheme). The perception and reactions of future users to these three privacy enhancing technologies (PETs) are compared in the present article and an attempt is made to understand the reasoning behind their preferences. The main conclusion is that users don't trust complex PETs as they are envisioned today. Instead they prefer to kill RFID chips at store exits even if they appreciate after sales services. Enhancing trust through security and privacy 'visibility' as well as PET simplicity may be the road to take for PET engineers in UbiComp.},

abstract = {Most of today's authentication schemes involve verifying the identity of a principal in some way. This process is commonly known as entity authentication. In emerging ubiquitous computing paradigms which are highly dynamic and mobile in nature, entity authentication may not be sufficient or even appropriate, especially if a principal's privacy is to be protected. In order to preserve privacy, other attributes (e.g. location or trustworthiness) of the principal may need to be authenticated to a verifier. In this paper we propose Ninja: a non-identity-based authentication scheme for a mobile ubiquitous environment, in which the trustworthiness of a user's device is authenticated anonymously to a remote Service Provider (verifier), during the service discovery process. We show how this can be achieved using Trusted Computing functionality.},

We examined the types of technologies families own, including TVs, music players, phones and computers; where they were situated within the home; and the degree of shared ownership and use. Our results call attention to the prevalence of shared usage of technology in domestic environments and also suggest opportunistic spaces for ubiquitous computing technology. While not all ubiquitous computing technologies for domestic environments will be shared, the diverse ways families chose to share their computers suggest that future devices might better match how families wish to use shared technology by supporting both the shared usage model of appliances and the ability to access a personal profile.},

abstract = {We describe a novel method for symbolic location discovery of simple objects. The method requires no infrastructure and relies on simple sensors routinely used in sensor nodes and smart objects (acceleration, sound). It uses vibration and short, narrow frequency 'beeps' to sample the response of the environment to mechanical stimuli. The method works for specific locations such as 'on the couch', 'in the desk drawer' as well as for location classes such as 'closed wood compartment' or 'open iron surface'. In the latter case, it is capable of generalizing the classification to locations the object has not seen during training. We present the results of an experimental study with a total of over 1200 measurements from 35 specific locations (taken from 3 different rooms) and 12 abstract location classes. It includes such similar locations as the inner and outer pocket of a jacket and a table and shelf made of the same wood. Nonetheless on locations from a single room (16 in the largest one) we achieve a recognition rate of up to 96 %. It goes down to 81 % if all 35 locations are taken together, however the correct location is in the 3 top picks of the system 94 % of the times.},

abstract = {Spontaneous interaction is a desirable characteristic associated with mobile and ubiquitous computing. The aim is to enable users to connect their personal devices with devices encountered in their environment in order to take advantage of interaction opportunities in accordance with their situation. However, it is difficult to secure spontaneous interaction as this requires authentication of the encountered device, in the absence of any prior knowledge of the device. In this paper we present a method for establishing and securing spontaneous interactions on the basis of spatial references that capture the spatial relationship of the involved devices. Spatial references are obtained by accurate sensing of relative device positions, presented to the user for initiation of interactions, and used in a peer authentication protocol that exploits a novel mechanism for message transfer over ultrasound to ensures spatial authenticity of the sender.},

publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {Battery lifetime has become one of the top usability concerns of mobile systems. While many endeavors have been devoted to improving battery lifetime, they have fallen short in understanding how users interact with batteries. In response, we have conducted a systematic user study on battery use and recharge behavior, an important aspect of user-battery interaction, on both laptop computers and mobile phones. Based on this study, we present three important findings: 1) most recharges happen when the battery has substantial energy left, 2) a considerable portion of the recharges are driven by context (location and time), and those driven by battery levels usually occur when the battery level is high, and 3) there is great variation among users and systems. These findings indicate that there is substantial opportunity to enhance existing energy management policies, which solely focus on extending battery lifetime and often lead to excess battery energy upon recharge, by adapting the aggressiveness of the policy to match the usage and recharge patterns of the device. We have designed, deployed, and evaluated a user- and statistics-driven energy management system, Llama, to exploit the battery energy in a user-adaptive and user-friendly fashion to better serve the user. We also conducted a user study after the deployment that shows Llama effectively harvests excess battery energy for a better user experience (brighter display) or higher quality of service (more application data) without a noticeable change in battery lifetime.},

abstract = {Context-aware power management (CAPM) uses context (e.g., user location) likely to be available in future ubiquitous computing environments, to effectively power manage a building's energy consuming devices. The objective of CAPM is to minimise overall energy consumption while maintaining user-perceived device performance.The principal context required by CAPM is when the user is NOT USING and when the user is about to use a device. Accurately inferring this user context is challenging and there is a balance between how much energy additional context can save and how much it will cost energy wise. This paper presents results from a detailed user study that investigated the potential of such CAPM.The results show that CAPM is a hard problem. It is possible to get within 6% of the optimal policy, but policy performance is very dependent on user behaviour. Furthermore, adding more sensors to improve context inference can actually increase overall energy consumption.},

This sensor detects the electrical noise on residential power lines created by the abrupt switching of electrical devices and the noise created by certain devices while in operation. We use machine learning techniques to recognize electrically noisy events such as turning on or off a particular light switch, a television set, or an electric stove. We tested our system in one home for several weeks and in five homes for one week each to evaluate the system performance over time and in different types of houses. Results indicate that we can learn and classify various electrical events with accuracies ranging from 85-90%.},

In use, the Clock supported not only family co-ordination but also more emotive aspects of family life such as reassurance, connectedness, identity and social touch. This emphasized aspects of family life frequently neglected in Ubicomp, such as the ways in which families' awareness of each others' activities contributes to a sense of a family's identity.

address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {We present a novel algorithm that safeguards the location privacy of users accessing location-based services via mobile devices. Our technique exploits the capability of mobile devices to form wireless ad-hoc networks in order to hide a user's identity and position. Local ad-hoc networks enable us to separate an agent's request for location information, the query initiator, from the agent that actually requests this service on its behalf, the query requestor. Since a query initiator can select itself or one of the k - 1 agents in its ad-hoc network as a query requestor, the query initiator remains k-anonymous. In addition, the location revealed to the location service provider is a rectangle instead of an exact coordinate. We develop an anonymous selection algorithm that selects a query requestor with near-uniform randomness, which is a key component to ensure anonymity in an ad-hoc network. Our experiments show that a system can ensure a high quality of service and maintain a high degree of privacy in terms of anonymity and obfuscation while accessing location-based services.},

abstract = {This paper presents Haggle, an architecture for mobile devices that enables seamless network connectivity and application functionality in dynamic mobile environments. Current applications must contain significant network binding and protocol logic, which makes them inflexible to the dynamic networking environments facing mobile devices. Haggle allows separating application logic from transport bindings so that applications can be communication agnostic. Internally, the Haggle framework provides a mechanism for late-binding interfaces, names, protocols, and resources for network communication. This separation allows applications to easily utilize multiple communication modes and methods across infrastructure and infrastructure-less environments. We provide a prototype implementation of the Haggle framework and evaluate it by demonstrating support for two existing legacy applications, email and web browsing. Haggle makes it possible for these applications to seamlessly utilize mobile networking opportunities both with and without infrastructure.},

abstract = {The popularity of handheld devices has created a flurry of research activity into new protocols and applications that can handle and exploit the defining characteristic of this new environment - user mobility. In addition to mobility, another defining characteristic of mobile systems is user social interaction. This paper investigates how mobile systems could exploit people's social interactions to improve these systems' performance and query hit rate. For this, we build a trace-driven simulator that enables us to re-create the behavior of mobile systems in a social environment. We use our simulator to study three diverse mobile systems: DTN routing protocols, firewalls preventing a worm infection, and a mobile P2P file-sharing system. In each of these three cases, we find that mobile systems can benefit substantially from exploiting social information.},

abstract = {While the user-centered design methods we bring from humancomputer interaction to ubicomp help sketch ideas and refine prototypes, few tools or techniques help explore divergent design concepts, reflect on their merits, and come to a new understanding of design opportunities and ways to address them. We present Speed Dating, a design method for rapidly exploring application concepts and their interactions and contextual dimensions without requiring any technology implementation. Situated between sketching and prototyping, Speed Dating structures comparison of concepts, helping identify and understand contextual risk factors and develop approaches to address them. We illustrate how to use Speed Dating by applying it to our research on the smart home and dual-income families, and highlight our findings from using this method.},

abstract = {Mobile phones are a widely-available class of device with supporting communications infrastructure which can be appropriated and exploited to support ubicomp experiences. However mobile phones vary hugely in their capabilities. We explore how a single dimension of phone application type embodies the critical trade-off between capability and availability, i.e. between what can be done and the fraction of potential participants' phones that can do this. We describe four different mobile phone ubicomp experiences that illustrate different points along this continuum (SMS, WAP/Web, and J2ME, Python and native applications) and the common software platform/toolkit, EQUIP2, that has been co-developed to support them. From this we propose four development strategies for addressing mobile phone diversity: prioritise support for server development (including web integration), migrate functionality between server(s) and handset(s), support flexible communication options, and use a loosely coupled (data-driven and component-based) software approach.},

abstract = {Industrial health and safety is an important yet largely unexplored application area of ubiquitous computing. In this paper we investigate the relationship between technology and organization in the context of a concrete industrial health and safety system. The system is designed to reduce the number of incidents of "vibration white finger" (VWF) at construction sites and uses wireless sensor nodes for monitoring workers' exposure to vibrations and testing of compliance with legal health and safety regulations. In particular we investigate the impact of this ubiquitous technology on the relationship between management and operatives, the formulation of health and safety rules and the risk perception and risk behavior of operatives. In addition, we contrast sensornetwork inspired and smart artifact inspired compliance systems, and make the case that these technology models have a strong influence on the linkage between technology and organization.},

abstract = {We study activity recognition using 104 hours of annotated data collected from a person living in an instrumented home. The home contained over 900 sensor inputs, including wired reed switches, current and water flow inputs, object and person motion detectors, and RFID tags. Our aim was to compare different sensor modalities on data that approached "real world" conditions, where the subject and annotator were unaffiliated with the authors. We found that 10 infra-red motion detectors outperformed the other sensors on many of the activities studied, especially those that were typically performed in the same location. However, several activities, in particular "eating" and "reading" were difficult to detect, and we lacked data to study many fine-grained activities. We characterize a number of issues important for designing activity detection systems that may not have been as evident in prior work when data was collected under more controlled conditions.},

Finally, we develop a framework that can be applied to distributed projector-camera systems, cope with varying levels of description knowledge and different sensors embedded in an object.},
