abstract = {Through an iterative design approach, we have proposed and evaluated ways of incorporating user-created information into context-aware systems. We implemented and tested a location-sensitive college campus tour guide called Campus Aware that allows users to annotate physical spaces with text notes. The goal was to provide visitors to the campus with a sense of the activities going on in the environment. Our evaluation of Campus Aware revealed that users provided unique content that was interesting and useful to others. They also served as moderators posting corrections to inaccurate notes and answering questions posed by other users. We discovered that our system easily became a distraction and was not able to detect location precisely enough to prevent user confusion. Our findings suggest new ways to make contextaware systems easier for users to comprehend and enjoy.},

abstract = {This paper describes a system called ComicDiary that automatically creates a personal diary in a comics style. ComicDiary is built as a sub-system of our ongoing project (C-MAP) to develop a personal guidance system for exhibition touring at museums, trade shows, academic conferences, cities, and so on. The aim of the C-MAP system is to provide users with personalized guidance according to temporal and spatial situations as well as individual interests. ComicDiary is designed as a casual tool for augmenting an individual user's memory as well as for encouraging communities of users to exchange personal memories. This paper presents the preliminary results of deploying the ComicDiary system as a digital assistant service for conference participants.},

We present strengths and weaknesses of several qualitative and quantitative user study techniques for ubicomp.

The components of a context model are used to specify processes for observing activity. The ontology for context modeling is derived from both a bottom up system's perspective and a topdown users' perspective. As we define each element, we describe the corresponding components of a process-based software architecture. Using these components, a context is translated into a federation of observational processes. This model leads to an architecture in which reflexive elements are dynamically composed to form federations of processes for observing and predicting the situations that make up a context.},

We consider the characteristics of these types of interactions, and assess the performance of our system on each application. We have found that face pose tracking is a potentially accurate means of cursor control and selection, is seen by users as a natural way to guide agent dialog interaction, and can be used to create perceptually-driven presence artefacts which convey real-time awareness of a remote space.},

Another advantage of our tracking system is that it does not require a user to manually initialize the tracking process, which is critical for natural and intuitive interaction. Based on our face tracking system, we have implemented several prototype applications which change information shown on a large display adaptively according to the location looked at by a user.},

abstract = {We have designed an active tagging system that responds to a coded optical beam from several meters away. The tags contain a minimalist microprocessor that ambiently operates in shutdown mode and, upon detecting particular frequency components in the AM-modulated interrogation beam, awakens to decode the incident digital message and produce an appropriate response. The lack of linear amplifiers means that these tags draw under 0.5 μA when sleeping, hence can operate up to 10 years on a lithium coin cell. Such devices are practical demonstrations of the potential of ubiquitous computing where common, nearly passive objects have a sense of identity and the ability to respond to external stimuli. In our example, the interrogator is a "flashlight", with which one scans an area; when the light beam hits a tag programmed with a code that matches that sent by the interrogator, an on-tag LED flashes, indicating that the desired object is "found".},

Unlike conventional mobile computers with relatively poor user interfaces, it does not have a display at all, instead wirelessly utilizing displays, keyboards and other IO devices found nearby. By co-opting large screens such as those found on desktop PCs, public display monitors, information kiosks, and other computers, a Personal Server is more effective than relying on a small mobile screen. This model goes beyond the mobile context and has wider implications for how we think about computing in general. A prototype system, including applications, system infrastructure, and a mobile platform, has been built to fully explore this model. This prototype sheds light on the suitability of standard components to support such a computing model, and from this illuminates directions for the design of future ubiquitous computing systems.},

abstract = {Large displays have several natural affordances that can
simplify small group collaborative work. They are large enough to
hold multiple work areas, they are easy to see and can be
manipulated directly via touch. When placed into group and public
spaces, such displays create pervasively available working surfaces
for lightweight, temporary walkup use. The BlueBoard is a large
plasma display with touch sensing and a badge reader to identify
individuals using the board. The onboard software acts as a thin
client giving access to each participant's web-based content (e.g.,
home pages, project pages). The client also has a set of tools and
mechanisms that support rapid exchange of content between those
present. The overall design of the BlueBoard is one that is easily
learnable (under 5 minutes), very simple to use, and permits novel
uses for collaboration. Our initial field study revealed a number
of social issues about the use of a large pervasively available
display surface, yet indicates that a shared public display space
truly has distinct properties that lend themselves to sharing
content. Extreme learnability &amp; overall simplicity of design
makes BlueBoard a tool for collaboration that supports
intermittent, but effective use for side-by-side collaboration

With daunting Orwellian visions looming, it is easy to conclude that tamper-proof technical protection mechanisms such as strong anonymization and encryption are the only solutions to such privacy threats. However, we argue that such perfect protection for personal information will hardly be achievable, and propose instead to build systems that help others respect our personal privacy, enable us to be aware of our own privacy, and to rely on social and legal norms to protect us from the few wrongdoers. We introduce a privacy awareness system targeted at ubiquitous computing environments that allows data collectors to both announce and implement data usage policies, as well as providing data subjects with technical means to keep track of their personal information as it is stored, used, and possibly removed from the system. Even though such a system cannot guarantee our privacy, we believe that it can create a sense of accountability in a world of invisible services that we will be comfortable living in and interacting with.},

The hardware, called SmartMoveX, is an active badge system in which a small radio transmitter is attached to the person being tracked. Receivers placed in the building's existing offices, connected to existing PCs, transmit signal strength readings to a central PC using the building's existing computer network. Combined with the low cost of the hardware, using the existing network makes this active badge system much less expensive than many others. To compute locations based on signal strength, we gathered signal strength readings from predefined location nodes in the building. We defined a graph on these nodes, which allowed us to enforce constraints on computed movements between nodes (e.g. cannot pass through walls) and to probabilistically enforce our expectations on transitions between connected nodes. Modeling the data with a hidden Markov model, we used the Viterbi algorithm to compute optimal paths based on signal strengths over the node graph. The average location error was 3.05 meters, which compared favorably to a simple nearest neighbor algorithm's average location error of 4.57 meters.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing is finally becoming a reality. However, there are many practical issues that stand in the way of mass acceptance. We have been investigating these practical concerns within the context of an autonomous application that takes care of houseplants using a sensor network and a mobile robot. We believe that emphasizing autonomy and thereby minimizing demands on users will help us address the many practical concerns that will arise not only in PlantCare but also in many other ubiquitous applications. In this paper, we discuss the technical challenges that we have encountered while trying to make PlantCare a reality and report on our experience in addressing these challenges.},

title = {Context Acquisition Based on Load Sensing},

abstract = {Load sensing is a mature and robust technology widely applied in process control. In this paper we consider the use of load sensing in everyday environments as an approach to acquisition of contextual information in ubiquitous computing applications. Since weight is an intrinsic property of all physical objects, load sensing is an intriguing concept on the physical-virtual boundary, enabling the inclusive use of arbitrary objects in ubiquitous applications. In this paper we aim to demonstrate that load sensing is a versatile source of contextual information. Using a series of illustrative experiments we show that using load sensing techniques we can obtain not just weight information, but object position and interaction events on a given surface. We describe the incorporation of load-sensing in the furniture and the floor of a living laboratory environment, and report on a number of applications that use context information derived from load sensing.},

abstract = {Tennenhouse [1] coined the term proactive computing where humans get out of the interaction loop and may be serviced specifically according to their needs and current situation. In this paper we propose a framework for proactive guidance which aims to overcome limitations of today's printed instructions. By attaching computing devices and multiple sensors onto different parts of the assembly the system can recognize the actions of the user and determine the current state of the assembly. The system can suggest the next most appropriate action at any point in time. In an experimental case study with the IKEA PAX wardrobe we show the feasibility of the proposed approach. At the end important issues are discussed and future directions are outlined.},

abstract = {This paper describes a distributed, multi-sensor system architecture designed to provide a wearable computer with a wide range of complex context information. Starting from an analysis of useful high level context information we present a top down design that focuses on the peculiarities of wearable applications. Thus, our design devotes particular attention to sensor placement, system partitioning as well as resource requirements given by the power consumption, computational intensity and communication overhead. We describe an implementation of our architecture and initial experimental results obtained with the system.},

abstract = {Nutrition has a big impact on health, including major diseases such as heart disease, osteoporosis, and cancer. This paper presents an application designed to help people keep track of the nutrional content of foods they have eaten. Our work uses shopping receipts to generate suggestions about healthier food items that could help to supplement missing nutrients. We present our system design: a capture and access application that, based on shopping receipt data, provides access to ambiguous suggestions for more nutritious purchases. We also report results from one formative user study suggesting that receipts may provide enough information to extend our work by also estimating what people are actually eating, as opposed to simply what they are purchasing.},
