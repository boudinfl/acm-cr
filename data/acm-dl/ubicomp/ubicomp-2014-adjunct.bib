abstract = {An increasing number of people are using mobile devices in public places such as buses, trains, airports, coffee shops, and restaurants. Though the flexibility to work remotely using mobile devices make people more productive, this new working practice incurs un-authorized visual access of the mobile display by the bystanders, which we call visual privacy attack. Failing to prevent un-authorized people viewing sensitive information such as passwords, emails, and business information could lead to financial loss, public exposure, and embarrassment. In this paper, we propose a solution that captures the surrounding environment through user's mobile phone camera and determines whether any un-authorized person is obtaining visual access to the user's mobile screen. We develop an Android application, iAlert, that runs as a background process on a user's mobile device and alerts the user based on whether or not the displayed text on the screen is readable by bystanders.},

We present a preliminary design of Locator -- a self-adaptive framework for recognizing users' relevant places. Locator learns for different contextual situations, combinations of algorithms and location sensor data that achieve the best performance in recognizing relevant places. We conducted a 5-weeks study and collected sensor and ground-truth data from 6 users. Our preliminary results indicate the shortcomings of relying on one algorithm and sensor for recognizing places and thus motivates the rational behind our approach.},

abstract = {Considerable research has studied online communication for older adults. For some seniors, age-related disability presents barriers to using computers and going online. For others, lack of experience or lack of interest deters them from keeping in touch using modern communication platforms such as social media sites. Physical communication artifacts, such as printed photos, support important forms of offline communication for older adults, and we examine how physical photos can be augmented to facilitate lightweight online social communication. This approach embeds online messaging into a familiar and culturally-relevant artifact, physical photos. This paper presents Portrait Pigeon, a ubiquitous lightweight messaging platform for seniors that integrates in-home photo displays into online communication.},

To interact with these large datasets, touchless interfaces can support fluid interaction at different distances from the display. Touchless gestures, however, lack haptic feedback. Hence, users' gestures may unintentionally move off the interface elements and require additional physical effort to perform intended actions. To address this problem, we propose data-morphed topographies for touchless interactions: constraints on users' cursor movements that guide touchless interaction along the structure of the visualized data. To exemplify the potential of our concept, we envision applying three data-morphed topographies---holes, pits, and valleys---to common problem-solving tasks in visual analytics.},

abstract = {User-centric ambient social contexts can be effectively captured by dynamic bluetooth data. However, conventional approaches for training classifiers struggle with social contexts that are incrementally constructed and continuously discovered in everyday environments. Incremental social contexts can confuse a classifier because it assumes that the number and composition of context classes is fixed throughout training and inference phases. To address this challenge we propose ContextSense, an ELM-based learning method for continuous and unobtrusive discovery of new social contexts incrementally from dynamic bluetooth data. Experimental results show that ContextSense can automatically cope with "incremental social context" classes that appear unpredictably in the real-world.},

They also perceived many challenges common in UbiComp -- such as difficulty interpreting data and tradeoffs between intimacy and privacy.

Current detection techniques, however, require clinical tests with blood samples or other specialized equipment. Consequently, newborns often depend on visual assessments of their skin color at home, which is known to be unreliable.

Then Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model and multimodal exposure features(MME) are used to study the behavior differences, extracting the probable contact patterns of different kinds of people and how they contact with each other. Finally, to make practical, a MME Feed-forward Neural Network is given out to judge people's role in emotion contamination, with using people's own mobile-phones contact list.

According to massive observations, we discover some underlying characteristics of Wi-Fi indoor localization from the view of signal strength and AP. Hence, a new dissimilarity based localization method SAP (Signal-AP) is proposed to implement high performance indoor localization. The results show that SAP not only improves the localization accuracy, but also has desirable scalability of environment.},

We present our experience of co-designing this system with the DPS, challenges and experience of our initial app release. To design effective crowdsourcing of public safety information, we conducted a lab experiment to investigate what factors affect people's sharing decisions. The results suggest that both time of day and type of location significantly affect people's sharing decisions.

abstract = {Personal informatics applications have been gaining momentum with the introduction of implicit data collection and alert mechanisms on smart phones. A need for customized design of these applications is emerging and studies on tailoring UI design based on the personality traits of users are well established. This poster investigates how various affordances in gamified personal informatics applications affect motivation levels to track and achieve goals for users with different personality types. We conducted a study to examine how user personality traits relate to (1) motivational affordances in behavior tracking applications and (2) the specific behaviors users prefer to track.},

abstract = {With recent interest in industry, wearable computers with head-mounted displays are about to become mainstream. As it is typical for novel technologies, development is directed towards early adopters. This typically excludes special target groups such as older adults with age related special needs. However, it is necessary to consider their requirements when the technology matures, as they can benefit from wearable computing. In this paper we present an explorative, qualitative study with three older adults that used a wearable computer with a head mounted display during everyday activities. We derive requirements from the usage of existing applications, describe emerging usage patterns, highlight promising applications, and the reaction of the public.},

We have been developing a toolkit that provides hardware and software for users who have no programming experience to easily invent and test context-aware applications that can help them make changes in their behaviors. We have found that this toolkit needs to balance simplicity of interaction with the facilitation of a wide range of user experiences. To address this issue, we identified key temporal rule patterns from a user-generated collection of behavior change applications, and created programming elements with which users can compose applications of those patterns.},

Using a prototype version, we performed a pilot test in order to determine if the hypothesis is valid. To conclude, songs recommended through this system scored significantly higher on both preference and appropriateness than randomly selected songs or popular songs. This service is expected to enhance user's music experience and promote sense of unity among users, and contribute to build unique cultures within local communities.},

In this poster, we propose a concept called MemoryRetrospect, which combines Lifelogging with Social Awareness. It considers not only our daily photos and videos, but also the weather, the locations and time. When and how to open the e-records can be set by the senders' willing. Thus the receivers have a chance to feel the true space-time meaning of the e-records. More exactly, every e-record will be packaged in a capsule, which the senders are able to set with kinds of scenes as the activation conditions for recipients. With this, the recipients can experience and understand senders' happiness, beautiful moments and emotions at some certain moment.},

However, we can influence driver behavior to a certain degree by displaying appropriate traffic information. When taking a break at the rest area of an expressway, many drivers are unaware of the future traffic conditions along the highway toward their destination. We propose a method for changing the driver's departure time by predicting the future traffic conditions and informing the driver on how long the driver will expect to wait in a traffic jam based on the time at which the driver chooses to depart from the rest area. We created a prototype system for implementing the proposed method using the driver's smartphone and big data regarding the traffic conditions on an expressway in real-time.

The sensor node makes new binary image from its current image and the transferred messages. The MoRE shows comparable performance to previous works without invasive methods. Unlike the previous works, MoRE does not require extra memory for metadata in sensor nodes and does not need to use relocatable code.},

abstract = {Browsing, a concept usually reserved for the on-line world, consists in a sequence of media consumptions and clicks: reading text, looking at images, watching videos, interlaced with clicks that take us from one content to another. A similar concept does not yet fully exist in the physical world. In this paper we present a system that uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) to obtain information about the objects on a shelf, and Augmented Reality (AR) to let users click on a live image of that shelf shown on a handheld device, accessing the information about the objects located in the vicinity of the clicked spot. A smart shelf with RFID has been set up to which a AR marker has been added to be able to map physical to screen coordinates. Testing and validation of system is done with different number of books at different locations on a shelf. The resulting experience is close to browsing a shelf, clicking on it and obtaining information about the objects it contains.},

Changes exhibited in these areas tend to be subtle and highly dependent on the patient, their injury, and the intensity of rehabilitation efforts. To provide a fine-grained assessment of patient progress, we undertook a study to quantitatively capture movements during inpatient rehabilitation. We utilized wearable inertial sensors to collect data from participants receiving therapy services at an inpatient rehabilitation facility. Participant performance was recorded in an ecological environment on a sequence of ambulatory tasks. A custom software system was developed to process sensor signals and compute metrics describing ambulation. A comparison of metrics one week apart suggests quantifiable changes in movement.},

Our study examines how data collected from mobile devices can be utilized to infer users' behavior and environment. We present the results and the lessons learned from a two-week user study of 40 students. The data collection was performed using Contexto, a framework for collecting data from a rich set of sensors installed on mobile devices, which was developed for this purpose. We studied various new and fine-grained user contexts which are relevant to students' daily activities, such as "in class and interested in the learned materials" and "on my way to campus". These contexts might later be utilized for various purposes such as recommending relevant items to the students' context. We compare various machine learning methods and report their effectiveness for the purposes of inferring the users' context from the collected data. In addition, we present our findings on how to evaluate context inference systems, on the importance of explicit and latent labeling for context inference and on the effect of new users on the results' accuracy.},

We want to prototype a system that influences people's thermal comfort through other stimuli instead of temperature changing. The preliminary Spell research envisions a smart system for heating control that proactively compensates temperature variations using light color variations, accomplishing both the objectives: to satisfy user request for thermal comfort, while optimizing energy consumption. Two preliminary experiments were made: one demonstrates that people's perceived temperature is different from the actual temperature in a space; the second one shows how lights color affects the temperature perceived by people. As a result we derived preliminary guidelines for the prototyping the Spell system.},

Our proposed simple and low-cost fabrication process using conductive elastomers and threads transforms an elastic fabric into a finger-worn interaction tool. Plex preserves an inter-finger natural tactile feedback and proprioception. We also explore the interaction design and implement applications allowing users to interact with existing mobile and wearable devices using Plex.},

Due to the different demands and behavior features of students in the prior system, many students give others help just to make friends but not for money.

Compared to the current 2D design approach of displaying building floor levels side-by-side, the use of stereoscopic 3D offers potential to improve understanding of the space, glanceability of map based UIs, and the ability to navigate between locations on different floor levels.},

abstract = {Lack of awareness of potential fire hazards is a leading factor of fire, especially when the child is alone. This paper presents a simulation training system to help children learn fire hazards knowledge and escape skills. The first part of this system is an application designed for theoretical study, which is featured by gesture interaction using Microsoft Kinect and large screen display environment. It includes three modules, namely animation, quizzes, and a 3D serious game. The second part is a simulated environment of fire escape route, which aims to test learning outcomes. Experimental results show the fire escape skills of 100 children are greatly improved.},

The system consists of two main components: a smartphone application for the users to track their feelings and memories about events, and a sensor recording their physiological responses. The data will then be visualized in several ways and can be shared with trusted individuals or mental health professionals. The goal is to make the user more aware of her mood swings and the precursors to them; to reveal patterns of the swings; to provide a record for healthcare providers; to build a library of personalized interventions for future use; and to create an effective network of social supports.},

We discuss the potential of EOG glasses and other smart eye-wear. Afterwards, we show a first signal level assessment of MEME, and present a classification task using the glasses. We are able to distinguish of 4 activities for 2 users (typing, reading, eating and talking) using the sensor data (EOG and acceleration) from the glasses with an accuracy of 70 % for 6 sec. windows and up to 100 % for a 1 minute majority decision. The classification is done user-independent.The results encourage us to further explore the EOG glasses as platform for more complex, real-life activity recognition systems.},

We apply our system to the piloting of an AR.Drone 2.0 quadricopter with a series of hoops delimiting an exciting circuit. We show that our architecture provides better task performance than traditional BCI paradigms within a shorter time frame.

They typically feature a coordinator who is assigned to walk a designated route, calling at several pick-up points that parents can use to join their children to the "bus". However, parents often feel limited by the rigidity of the scheduled walking bus arrival and departure times making it difficult to coordinate the delivery of children onto the bus with conflicting morning activities. As a result, most parents choose instead to rely on car journeys to the school. In this work we demonstrate a mobile system that allows parents to visualise real-time predictions of walking bus arrival times and thus supports more flexible travel coordination behaviours, providing greater opportunities for parents to utilise walking bus services and reduce car usage.},

abstract = {People respond emotionally to other people, animals, or even objects like furniture. While current furniture is static in appearance, embedded electronics can enable furniture to change its appearance. A couch could show excitement during a party or anger when a pet scratches it. But would emotional furniture delight or annoy people? To explore the potential for emotional furniture, we built EmotoCouch. Through colored light, visual patterns, and haptic feedback, EmotoCouch expresses six emotional states: Excited, Happy, Calm, Depressed/Sad, Afraid, and Angry. This video describes the construction of EmotoCouch, feedback gathered through surveys and user interviews, and shows example EmotoCouch usage situations.},

After alcohol-dependent patients complete alcohol withdrawal treatment and return to their regular lives, they face further challenges in order to maintain sobriety. This study proposes SoberDiary, a phone-based support system that enables alcohol-dependent patients to self-monitor and self-manage their own alcohol use behavior and remain sober in their daily lives. Results from a 4-week user study involving 11 clinical patients show that, using SoberDiary, patients can self-monitor and self-manage their alcohol use behavior, reducing their total alcohol consumption and the number of drinking or heavy drinking days that occur following intervention.},

This is in the interest of the older adults themselves, overburdened caregivers and policy makers who try to control health care budgets in the face of the ever growing older population. However, these technologies are still in their infancy and little is known whether the older adults are ready to adopt and use them. So far, most research efforts are of exploratory nature. While they identify factors which are important for the adoption and use of AAL technologies, only a few attempt to test and quantify the underlying relations between these factors. Furthermore, many studies focus on a pre-adoption stage (a technology has not been used yet) and do not consider post-adoption (users have used and experienced a technology). This dissertation seeks to fill this gap by constructing a model which tests the underlying relations between the various influencing factors across both pre-adoption and post-adoption stages.},

Although the data generated is incredibly useful, state-of-the-art feedback technologies are often limited to either providing an overall status or serving large volume of multi-dimensional sensor data with little processing. My research falls into filling this gap. I work on developing systems that use sensors to understand different dimensions of well being, and subsequently devise interventions through personalized and actionable suggestions. Using simple machine learning techniques, my systems automatically mine user behaviors that influence specific well-being dimensions. Then utilizing decision theory and behavioral psychology theory, my systems create personalized actionable suggestions that are related to existing user's behaviors. In this proposal, I describe how I realize such automated systems for sensing and providing feedback.},

abstract = {Human lives are composed by series of events and activities. Considerable research effort has been made to probe, sense, and understand them. In our research, we are interested in exploring the intrinsic string that connects all these events together, that is, user status and transitions. Such transitions can be reflected from multiple activity dimensions, ranging from our daily mobility trajectories, app usage sequences, to communication patterns and motion state switches. In this paper, we aim to identify whether a personalized model can be learned to capture various user states from different sensing dimensions and whether a unified view can be established to explain the state transitions that drive the changes in user context during day-to-day routines.To this end, we have explored two types of traces -- connected wifi sequences and cell location trajectories. We first model the states among these two individual dimensions. In the end, the identified states from both dimensions are linked together to recognize the spatial-temporal relationship between them. As we evaluate with the DeviceAnalyzer dataset, our method is able to recognize a range of states such as "at home", "working", "commute" and the trasitions between them, all in an unsupervised manner.},

abstract = {Several aspects might influence the way users operate their mobile devices in a mobile context. In this work, we show how the presence or absence of a Wi-Fi connection influences the amount of data traffic generated by mobile devices. Our results show that the probability of users to generate data traffic while connected to Wi-Fi is twice as high as when a cellular connection only is available. Furthermore, we observe that an almost constant amount of data traffic is generated over a day, although it slightly increases in the late afternoon. Last but not least, we observe that fair-use policies do not seem to influence the behavior of mobile users with respect to the amount of traffic they generate over different weeks of a month. We ground our analysis on the Device Analyzers data set, which contains detailed records of mobile phone usage of more than 17,000 users from all over the world. Building upon these preliminary quantitative results, we outline how the availability of data for mobile users can be improved by combining mobility and phone usage prediction with knowledge about the temporal and spatial availability of Wi-Fi connections.},

The multi-level classification system first learns low-level codebook representations for each sensor and uses a random forest classifier to produce minute-level probabilities for each activity class. Then a higher-level HMM layer learns patterns of transitions and durations of activities over time to smooth the minute-level predictions.},

This automated algorithm extracts high-level features from sensor events and inputs these features to a machine learning algorithm which forecasts when a target activity will next occur. We compare this system to a standard linear regression classification using real data from smart homes. The forecasting algorithm is shown to provide lower error rates over the linear regression model.},

Recognition accuracies partly depend on the time synchronicity between the mobile devices used for data recording and labeling. Mobile device synchronization can be done via the Internet or GPS, but both are not available in all areas. This paper presents our novel approach "Event Driven Time Synchronization of Mobile Devices" that works anytime, anywhere. The idea is to trigger sensor events on each device as much as possible at the same time. The time difference of the sensor event occurrences is interpreted as the time difference between the devices, called time offset between the devices. Our prototype utilizes proximity events to enable this. Our evaluation shows that 99% of the time offsets vary not more than 60 ms. Compared to this, only 17% are within this variance when using Network Time Protocol via a mobile High Speed Downlink Packet Access Internet connection.},

Due to the high variance in house configurations and sensor placements, it is important to collect and label sample sensor data that will be used to train a learning algorithm. Ground-truth activity labels must therefore be provided in some manner for this sample data. The abundance of sensor data makes it infeasible to label all of the data, and active learning can be used to intelligently pick the most informative data to be labeled. In this paper, we describe several active learning methods that we designed and implemented for their applicability to the activity recognition task. We evaluate the methods using the CASAS smart home sensor data and present a crowd-sourcing application for annotation.},

In this study, we aim to support users in their recipe selection by discriminating "practical recipes" that are easy to understand, written concisely with sufficient description, and offer detailed tips and pointers. We performed a content analysis of popular recipes found on Cookpad, focusing on ten types of dishes, and decided to use seven content characteristics, such as "description of the heat level" and "description of the cooking time," as features to discriminate practical recipes. We have implemented a discriminator based on an SVM classifier that uses these features. The results of a discrimination experiment show that the mean value of the accuracy of the ten types of dishes is 0.813. This represents a significant difference from a baseline discriminator.},

Firstly, the system extracts the author's reasons for the creation or selection of a recipe from the blog-type recipes. Secondly, the system lets the user input his/her present situation or feelings which must include his/her vague requirement and mine his/her reasons for recipe selection from the input. Finally, the system outputs recipes that meet the user's vague requirements by associating the reasons for recipe selection from the user's input text with the reasons accompanying the blog-type recipes.},

abstract = {Healthy eating habits are important for modern people; however, sustaining these habits is often difficult because it requires a strong will. In this paper, we propose a social media system, Yumlog, that enables people to begin eating meals that are more healthful naturally and without conscious effort. Using the proposed system, users share information on their meals and evaluate the yumminess and healthfulness of each other's meals. The satisfaction of a user with a meal increases with others' positive evaluations. In behavioral science, this effect is called expectation assimilation. In addition, Yumlog modifies others' evaluations, displaying evaluations of healthfulness as those of yumminess to the user consuming the meal. Thus, users tend to eat more foods that are evaluated as healthful foods and thereby, improve their eating habits without noticing it. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed system through user studies.},

In this paper, we propose a method that estimates nutritional information based on segmentation and labeling of food regions of an image by adopting a semantic segmentation method, in which we consider recipes as corresponding sets of food images and ingredient labels. Any food object or ingredient in a test food image can be annotated as long as the ingredient is contained in a training food image, even if the menu containing the food image appears for the first time. Experimental results show that better estimation is achieved through regression analysis using ingredient labels associated with the segmented regions than when using the local feature of pixels as the predictor variable.},

To build the dataset, we instructed the subjects to perform cooking according to instructional texts shown on a display one by one. The instructional texts were generated from flow graphs, which were automatically extracted from recipes sampled from a Web site. The main identity of this dataset is the correspondence between the steps automatically extracted from recipes, and real human activities. Typical uses of our dataset are to construct classifiers for understanding human activities in the kitchen, text generation through observing the activities, and so on.},

However, all the existing research assumed that all the participants have meals, whereas this assumption is not always true in reality. Conversation often takes place where a part of the participants have meals. To better understand co-dining conversation, we should also pay attention to this uneven meal distribution setting. Thus this research investigated face-to-face dyadic conversation on uneven meal distribution setting, focused on the difference between the participant with meal and the one without meal in particular. Conversation scenes that one participant has a meal were videotaped, and questionnaires were asked to fill out. From the analysis, it was found that attentive listening was often likely to emerge in uneven meal distribution setting.},

Rather, the person needs someone to talk to for reflecting himself/herself with the ideas. The other person is not necessarily be talkative, and may desirable to be attentive. In interpersonal communication over a meal, a person who does not have a meal is more likely to become a speaker than the other. The other person who has a meal is more likely to become an attentive listener. Thus in this paper, we developed an anthropomorphic agent that would automatically have dining behavior, and conducted an experiment to study its influence on the idea generations support. As a result, some interesting actions were observed, though effects on the idea generation was not significant.},

Consent is the interactional process by which a user agrees to the terms of engagement with a system, and it represents the principle mechanism by which we protect our privacy online. However, whereas traditional online interactions are explicit, offering a series of moments at which one might inform and engage the user, the growing 'era of ubiquity' has decoupled users from devices, presenting no clear moment for consent to occur. Whilst there have been efforts to raise issues of consent within HCI and cognate disciplines, these remain disparate. The aim of this workshop is to bring together a solution-oriented community with a specific focus on consent issues within interactive environments. It will create a transnational, multidisciplinary platform for discussion and offer opportunities for collaboration, support and the development of a new research agenda.},

abstract = {The stability of trust on the Internet has implications for political diplomacy, innovation, economic stability, social and civil relations, and individual self-determinism. The degree of online trust is a reflection of the gap between individual and collective Netizens' expectations formed by laws and ethics, and their capabilities enabled by technology. Law and ethics, just as with familiar offline society, act as ordering forces that inform the acceptability of our behaviors and relationships with other person and organizations. The migration of these analog activities online has exposed a rather sweeping gap between expectations and capabilities, where legal and ethical ordering forces are challenged to re-examine, -interpret, and --apply the tenets and principles upon which they moor. As this gap widens, so too does ambiguity between asserted rights, interests, and threats to same.This gap is manifest most prominently in the current industrial and geo-political struggle to define rules of engagement for cyber conflict and national security, as well as with online advertising and data brokering. A related context where ordering forces are challenged, lower on the public notoriety index but no less considerable, is information and communication technology (ICT) research. The controversy over the collection, use and disclosure of online data for research exposes gaps and deficiencies in the legal and ethical structures that directly and indirectly inform and reflect our expectations.Notably, "consent" has been a fundamental mechanism for protecting rights and interests in both law and ethics. As such, it serves as an institutionalized signal for persons' reasonable expectations. Yet, the ability to easily collect and combine massive amounts of existing, "publicly-available" information of a sensitive nature (personal or confidential) online exposes deficiencies in consent as an effective signal for expectations.More specifically, researchers increasingly encounter data online such as personal health, financial or behavioral records; usernames and passwords lists; corporate manuals and technical documents; email and voice communications databases; and, device vulnerabilities and machine-to-machine communications. It is located in various online locations ranging from normal websites and social networks to underground criminal forums, Internet relay chat rooms, and publicly-obscured/hidden sites. And, its availability is often a product of malicious, negligent, or ignorant collection or disclosure by a third party.In this context, consent as an expectation signal is strained along substantive and procedural dimensions. For example, some argue that the existence of other signals (i.e., the data was public and/or non-identifiable, the purpose of the research is to study a system or threat and not individual persons) pre-empts the need for consent. In addition, obtaining consent for what amounts to secondary use of online data may be impracticable in light of the distance between researchers and data subjects, or outweighed by countervailing intended benefits or academic freedom interests.With research using data available online, researcher conduct is not fully prescribed or proscribed by formal ethical codes of conduct or law because current expectations signals are ill-fitting. This presentation is intended to advance the collective dialogue toward a path that revisits and harmonizes ethical and legal signals for research using online data among researchers, oversight entities, policymakers and society. It does not dictate answers but aims to point out where current ordering forces breakdown in the context of online research and to suggest how to identify and respond to these grey areas by applying common legal and ethical tenets.},

This framing has implications for consent concepts.

This paper explores the question, "Who owns your data?" from policy, business, legal and philosophical viewpoints, arguing that a new discourse is required for people to understand how much control they actually have over their personal information in order to build a stronger foundation for consent within ubiquitous computing systems.},

We consider the professional ethics of computer engineers that state that developers must protect the privacy of personal data of users of systems. Based on that, we present a set of applied cryptography tools that should be used to protect the user's privacy despite their lack of consent not-understanding.},

abstract = {The dramatic rise in the use of social network sites (SNS) has resulted in a number of users feeling stressed about the extent of their personal use. Previous work has established that daily retrospective estimations of SNS use and access to RescueTime not only improve accuracy of estimations but also reduce perceived stress. The present study aimed to extend this by also exploring the influence of prospective estimations on stress and perceived time management. However, the study was thwarted by incredibly low engagement with RescueTime and consequently, no improvement in estimation accuracy and no reduction in stress. This indicates substantial individual differences in engagement and a requirement for external sources of motivation for using personal informatics, beyond the tasks of the study.},

abstract = {Recent advancement of technology enables installations of small sized accelerometers or gyroscopes on various kinds of wearable/portable information devices. By using such wearable sensors, these devices can estimate its posture or status. However, most of current devices only utilize these sensors for simple orientation and gesture recognition. More deep understandings and recognition of human activity through these sensors will enable the next-generation human-oriented computing. To enable the real-world application by these kinds of wearable sensors, a large scale human activity sensing corpus might play an important role. Additionally, we have now a lot of high-performance mobile devices in real-world such as smart-phones. It is a great challenge to utilize such an enormous number of wearable sensors to collect a large-scale activity corpus. In recent years, there are several ongoing projects which are collecting human activities. Following on a huge success of last year's workshop, we are further planning to share these experiences of current research on human activity corpus and its applications among the researchers and the practitioners and to have a deep discussion for future of activity sensing.},

When using an RFID tag, the card reader is placed at the entrance and recognition only occurs when entering the room in most cases. Thus, the information required to enter is only recognized during entry but not when leaving. In this paper, we propose a method for exit recognition that uses an illuminometer and an accelerometer embedded in a mobile sensor, which assesses the changes in the illuminance and acceleration data for subjects. We analyze the walking data obtained from the feature values of the acceleration data and the exit data derived from the feature values of the illuminance. We found that this method achieves 87.60% of accuracy for exit recognition.},

As a smartphone component, a barometer is expected to be useful for activity recognition because of its low power consumption. In this work, we propose an activity recognition method of classifying a user's state into indoor and outdoor states and using a barometer at each state. In the proposed method, the floor of a building on which a user is located is estimated by determining atmospheric pressure variations sensed in the indoor state, and the user's location is estimated by determining atmospheric pressure variations according to the user movement along a track in the outdoor state. In particular, this paper delineates the method of estimating the current floor on which the user is located. We confirmed that it is possible to closely estimate the current floor of the building in the case of user movement among eighteen floors.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition (AR) has begun to mature as a field, but for AR research to thrive, large, diverse, high quality, AR data sets must be publically available and AR methodology must be clearly documented and standardized. In the process of comparing our AR research to other efforts, however, we found that most AR data sets are sufficiently limited as to impact the reliability of existing research results, and that many AR research papers do not clearly document their experimental methodology and often make unrealistic assumptions. In this paper we outline problems and limitations with AR data sets and describe the methodology problems we noticed, in the hope that this will lead to the creation of improved and better documented data sets and improved AR experimental methodology. Although we cover a broad array of methodological issues, our primary focus is on an often overlooked factor, model type, which determines how AR training and test data are partitioned---and how AR models are evaluated. Our prior research indicates that personal, hybrid, and impersonal/universal models yield dramatically different performance [30], yet many research studies do not highlight or even identify this factor. We make concrete recommendations to address these issues and also describe our own publically available AR data sets.},

abstract = {Bootstrapping activity recognition systems in ubiquitous and mobile computing scenarios often comes with the challenge of obtaining reliable ground truth annotations. A promising approach to overcome these difficulties involves obtaining online activity annotations directly from users. However, such direct engagement has its limitations as users typically show only limited tolerance for unwanted interruptions such as prompts for annotations. In this paper we explore the effectiveness of approaches to online, user-based annotation of activity data. Our central assumption is the existence of a fixed, limited budget of annotations a user is willing to provide. We evaluate different strategies on how to spend such a budget most effectively. Using the Opportunity benchmark we simulate online annotation scenarios for a variety of budget configurations and we show that effective online annotation can still be achieved using reduced annotation effort.},

abstract = {In indoor positioning using Wi-Fi, there is a problem that the accuracy is not stable by the occurrence of large errors. Large errors tend to occur when density of wireless LAN access points is low or the radio wave condition is unstable. Furthermore, as for positioning utilising smartphone, it takes a while to scan Wi-Fi beacons. Thereby, errors tend to occur while user is moving. Because it is difficult to observe exactly Wi-Fi beacons. Accordingly, the authors proposed Cross-Assistive Approach for PDR and Wi-Fi Positioning. First of all, fingerprinting that is often used Wi-Fi positioning is improved by confining fingerprints to location where is estimated by PDR. As a result, this approach improved the accuracy about 2 meters. Furthermore, in order to correct accumulated errors in PDR, the authors proposed a method that corrects PDR with accurate Wi-Fi positioning results. Additionally, the authors proposed a method that estimates the accuracy of Wi-Fi positioning results. The mean error of accurate Wi-Fi results estimated by the accuracy estimating method was 0.98 meters. Thus, the accuracy estimating method detected accurate Wi-Fi positioning results effectively. In the comprehensive evaluation, our approach improved an existing Wi-Fi method about 3.4 meters by assisted PDR with Wi-Fi positioning and assisted Wi-Fi positioning with PDR cooperatively. Moreover, this approach enabled accumulated errors in PDR to be corrected.},

abstract = {Many activity recognition systems using accelerometers have been proposed. Activities that have been recognized are "single" activities which can be expressed with one verb, such as sitting, walking, holding a mobile phone, and throwing a ball. In actual, however, "combined" activities including more than two kinds of state and movement are often taken place. Focusing on hand gestures, they are performed not only while standing, but also while walking and sitting. Though the simplest way to recognize such combined activities is to construct the recognition models for all the possible combinations of the activities, the number of combinations becomes immense. In this paper, we propose a recognition method for combined activities by learning single activities only. Evaluation results confirmed that our proposed method achieved 0.84 of recall and 0.85 of precision, which is comparable to the method that had learned all the combined activities.},

abstract = {This research addresses improvement of the accuracy of pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), which is one effective technique to estimate indoor positions using smartphone sensors. Even though various techniques using step lengths and their number have been previously proposed for PDR, insufficient accuracy is gotten from smartphone sensors. In this research, we define human activity sensing knowledge and propose improvements to PDR accuracy based on it. Human activity sensing knowledge consists of four kinds of information: pedestrian, environmental, activity, and terminal. Previous studies separately used these kinds of information; however, no study has systematically arranged them for use in PDR. We improved PDR accuracy by adjusting the step length in passages and on stairs and revised activity recognition error with human activity sensing knowledge. To investigate the effectiveness of that strategy, we used HASC-IPSC, which is an indoor pedestrian sensing corpus. After our investigation, activity recognition accuracy improved from 71.2% to 91.4%, and the distance estimation error was reduced from approximately 27 m to approximately 7 m using human activity sensing knowledge.},

abstract = {In the existing multimodal systems for activity recognition, there is no single method to process different sensor modalities at different on-body positions. Moreover, sensor types are often selected and optimized so as to accord with the goal of application. The complexity makes those systems infeasible to be deployed for new settings. This paper proposes a unified system which works with any available wearable sensors placed on user's body to spot activities. Each data stream is treated uniformly through our proposed template matching WarpingLCSS to spot activities. With the uniformity in extracting activity-specific patterns from raw sensor signals, our proposed system is compatible with respect to modalities and body-worn positions.We evaluate our system on the Opportunity dataset of four subjects consisting of 17 hard-to-classify classes (e.g., open/close drawers at different heights) with 17 sensors belonging to three modalities (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetic field) attached at different on-body positions. The system achieves good performances (63% to 84% in F1 score). Moreover, the robustness and efficiency to addition and removal of sensors as well as activity classes are also investigated.},

Our evaluation showed that the F1-score increased from 0.61 in the case of sensor data loss to 0.68 with the combination of all methods.

abstract = {Activity recognition systems have demonstrated potential in a broad range of applications. A crucial aspect of creating large scale human activity sensing corpus is to develop algorithms that perform activity recognition in a way that users are not limited to wear sensors on predefined locations on the body. Therefore, effective on-body sensor localization algorithms are needed to detect the location of wearable sensors automatically and in real-time. However, power optimization is a major concern in the design of these systems. Frequent need to charge multiple sensor nodes imposes much burden on the end-users. In this paper, we propose a novel signal processing approach that leverages feature selection algorithms to minimize power consumption of node localization. With the real data collected using wearable motion sensors, we demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves an energy saving that ranges from 88% to 99.59% while obtaining an accuracy performance between 73.15% and 99.85%.},

abstract = {In recent years, a positioning method which utilizes wireless LAN without using GPS has attracted attention. Especially, in the case of a method which combines absolute position with a Wi-Fi radio environment in advance, the cost of operation and management becomes enormous. Therefore, by sampling Wi-Fi radio information observed at points where users stay frequently or in the long-term, a method which automates to collect and update the Wi-Fi radio information has been proposed. In the case of a long-term operating, the positioning accuracy, however, decreases because this method does not perform well in maintaining and managing samples. It cannot adapt samples to environmental changes although Wi-Fi radio signals change in case of long-term operating. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new calculation formula for improving a positioning accuracy. The formula is calculated with the weight of each base station for avoidance of ill-behaving stations. In addition, this paper also proposes the automated management system with two steps. It adapts samples to changes of Wi-Fi radio signals and a user's behavior. As a result, a positioning accuracy of the new system is higher than existing one.},

This is of explicit relevance for assistance systems building on prediction and recommendation.However, the understanding of human activity is limited. Albeit the omnispresence of smart phones and computers, the actual execution of complex activities with those devices in relation to context factors is not completely understood. One possible reason is the limited amount of activity related data to perform actual research.In this paper, we present the Kraken.me framework to address this lack of information. Kraken.me is the first tracking suite to offer integrated tools for mobile, social, and desktop tracking. It is also, to our knowledge, the first tool to emphasize the collection of data from both physical and soft sensors. In this paper, we will introduce the overall architecture, system components, and future research ideas for Kraken.me.},

abstract = {We generally use supervised learning when performing activity recognition using mobile sensor devices such as smartphones. In this application, case data associated with the sensor information and type of action is required. However, there is a possibility that a time shift occurs because this association is done manually on the audio and video that has been acquired along with the sensor information. In this paper, we propose a method of activity recognition that can recognize correct actions even if there is a time gap. In this method, we add labels that shift the original learning data label. We also implement multi-label machine learning. In addition, we propose a method for repeated learning based on the Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm. To evaluate this method, we conducted an experiment that recognized three types of behavior using a Naive Bayes classifier. In the evaluation, we pieced together three types of human action data into one dataset called pseudo sequence data. We slid the action labels of the pseudo sequence data and examined whether the recognition rate was improved by our proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can perform activity recognition with high accuracy, even if the action labels times are shifted.},

From training and testing activity recognition models, to verifying hypotheses in social science, mobile data is indispensable. Unfortunately, mobile data collection requires significant time and budget for infrastructure as well as subject recruiting, screening, training, legal agreements, equipment, and compensation. We estimate up to 70% of the resources in a study may be spent on data collection. Moreover, this massive investment can combine with institutional, legal, and political issues to create a disincentive to sharing with the community. In this paper, we propose and justify a crowdfunded and crowdsourced methodology for longitudinal mobile data collection that cuts researcher costs by orders of magnitude, removes barriers to data sharing, and boosts data value for all stakeholders. We also present CrowdSignals, a first instantiation which will generate the largest labeled mobile dataset available to the community.},

We state that since the smart-home has to self-managed they need to be autonomic. As a contribution we introduce a model that extends the autonomic architecture in order to manage misunderstanding situations and facilitate the sensemaking processes in the Autonomic Smart-Home. We name this extension IHMUNE which stands for Intelligent Home Manager for Understandable Novel Experiences. Then we discuss about the different kinds of collaborations that will arise in the smart-cities, the privacy concerns and the sensemaking.},

Non-Intrusion Load Monitoring (NILM) is applied to identify user operations on each appliance. The operations are integrated with dynamic electric price and environment data to mine users' personal demand and preference on various devices. Finally, the personalized scheduling strategy is generated to meet the different users' demands at the minimal cost. The major contributions of this paper are: 1) NILM is an low-cost and easy-accept solution to profile users' demand, since power meters have been widely deployed and power consumption data are less privacy-related. 2) Five preference indexes are firstly introduced, which can dramatically improve the user's satisfaction on scheduling strategies.},

Evaluating the performance of these systems through simulation or real experiments requires defining suitable scenarios and setting a large number of parameters. As different authors rely on different scenarios and parameter settings, comparing the reported performance results is often infeasible. In this paper, we argue that overcoming this problem is crucial to bring research on smart heating systems a step forward. We outline the main factors influencing the performance of such systems and we show how these factors can be integrated by proposing a simple yet thorough evaluation methodology for smart heating systems. Using parameters synthesised from real-world occupancy and weather data, we describe how this methodology can be used to establish performance bounds of smart heating systems.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing is having an important impact on family life with a wide range of technologies supporting and creating the need for connected and smarter homes. In particular, mobile devices are allowing families to connect activities across spaces, which include the home and the car. This paper presents a new design concept -- the HomeCar Organiser -- which is a connected system that enables families to coordinate schedules, activities and artifacts between the home and activities placed in the car. The design of HomeCar Organiser was informed by an empirical ethnographic study of family car travel practices in the UK over one and a half years. The study motivated us to consider how routine practices of everyday life are negotiated through and in the car while supported by a range of technologies.},

abstract = {The Personal Network (PN) is a logical network of interconnected components used by an individual. It encompasses the home network, the Personal Area Network (PAN), and the Vehicular Area Network (VAN) and includes cloud-based services. Previous security analyses, including ITU-T Recommendation X.1111, have focussed on the individual physical networks rather than the PN itself. By consolidating and structuring previous work, we propose an updated and enhanced security analysis for the PN. In our characteristic-based approach we identify the primary characteristics of the PN and its components and use these to develop an abstract PN asset model. From this, we derive the main attacker objectives and a list of attack vectors through which these could be achieved. We propose a mapping between the attack vectors and the PN component characteristics that can be used to determine the specific attacks to which a particular component is vulnerable. In this paper, we present a summary of this analysis and discuss its usage.},

Also, crowdsourcing platforms and open-data policy of organizations are enabling scalable data collection and access to such data. Moreover, mobile devices can be used as gateways for real-time intervention and feedback. Such powerful capabilities can enable larger-scale and timely social studies in a cost-effective way beyond traditional study methods such as self-reports, interviews, surveys, and observations under laboratory settings, etc. Many exploratory works have proven that mobile phones are a promising computational platform upon which we plan, develop, and conduct various experimental studies related to social science disciplines.},

Smartphone sensing data is emerging as a promising source for studying human mobility. However, most literature focuses on high-precision GPS positioning and high-frequency sampling, which is not always feasible in a longitudinal study or for everyday applications because location sensing has a high battery cost. In this paper we study the feasibility of inferring human mobility from sparse, low accuracy mobile sensing data. We validate our results using participants' location diaries, and analyze the inferred geographical networks, the time spent at different places, and the number of unique places over time. Our results suggest that low resolution data allows accurate inference of human mobility patterns.},

abstract = {The next revolution in mobile user experience is predicted to be a smart device that can adapt to its user's lifestyle and surroundings to become a proactive personal assistant. We introduce the idea of Mobile Sequence Mining (MSM) engine that automatically learns phone usage sequential patterns over the rich context data captured within the device. The learned patterns can then enable variety of applications including proactive assistance for a variety of use cases. Unlike existing cloud-based intelligence services (e.g., GoogleNow) that rely on internet access and may compromise privacy, MSM provides device intelligence by leveraging mined longitudinal patterns while preserving privacy via on-device mining. MSM is generic and can provide sequential patterns and predictions over multiple data streams, also allowing individual mobile applications to stream their own private data to mine sequential patterns. In our preliminary tests by deploying MSM on 3 user devices, it mines frequent sequential patterns within 8 minutes over 7-53 days of longitudinal user context data including location, app usage and call logs spanning 137-312 unique contexts. We conclude the paper by enumerating future research challenges for mobile sequence mining.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a concept of linked participatory sensing, called LiPS, that divide a complex sensing task into small tasks and link each other to optimize social resource allocation. Recently participatory sensing have been spreading, but its sensing tasks are still very simple and easy for participants to deal with (e.g. Please input the number of people standing in a queue. etc.). To adapt to high-level tasks which require specific skills such as those in engineering, the medical profession or authority such as the organizer of the event, we need to optimize social resource allocation because the number of such professionals are limited. To achieve the complex sensing tasks efficiently, LiPS enables to divide a complex sensing task into small tasks and link each other by assigning proper sensors. LiPS can treat physical sensors and human as hybrid multi-level sensors, and task provider can arrange social resource allocation for the goal of each divided sensing task. In this paper, we describe the design and development of the LiPS system. We also implemented an in-lab experiment as the first prototype of hybrid sensing system and discussed the model of further system through users' feedback.},

In the current medical practice, the change is induced through tailored coaching, support and information delivery. However, with the advent of smartphones, innovative ways of delivering interventions are emerging. Indeed, mobile phones, equipped with an array of sensors, and carried by their users at all times, enable therapists to both learn about the user behaviour, and impact the behaviour through the delivery of more relevant and personalised information. In this work we propose harnessing pervasive computing to not only learn from users' past behaviour, but also predict future actions and emotional states, deliver interventions proactively, evaluate their impact at run-time, and over time learn a personal intervention-effect model of a participant.},

Our approach uses mobile phones and accelerometers to detect interpersonal spatial and speech related features, achieving accuracy of around 80% in classifying between formal and informal social interactions, based on the study of 53 social interactions. One of the potential impacts of this work is on studying communication channels to enable more efficient knowledge transfer between knowledge workers. There is an on-going debate in social sciences whether formal or informal social interactions foster productivity more. However, the consensus is that improving communication between workers requires deeper understanding of both formal and informal types of interactions.},

To understand the significance of the problem and core factors that cause such embarrassments, we collected 961 in-situ responses from 14 participants upon the actual message arrival and analyzed them from the perspective of the receiver's situation. The results showed that 29% of message arrivals have the potential to cause embarrassment. We found out that the relationship with a message sender and a nearby person influences the effect of participants' perception about the message exposure.},

abstract = {Previous work on eye tracking and eye-based human-computer interfaces mainly concentrated on making use of the eyes in traditional desktop settings. With the recent growth of interest in smart glass devices and low-cost eye trackers, however, gaze-based techniques for mobile computing is becoming increasingly important. PETMEI 2014 focuses on the pervasive eye tracking paradigm as a trailblazer for mobile eye-based interaction and eye-based context-awareness. We want to stimulate and explore the creativity of these communities with respect to the implications, key research challenges, and new applications for pervasive eye tracking in ubiquitous computing. The long-term goal is to create a strong interdisciplinary research community linking these fields together and to establish the workshop as the premier forum for research on pervasive eye tracking.},

abstract = {In many applications it is necessary to guide humans' visual attention towards certain points in the environment. This can be to highlight certain attractions in a touristic application for smart glasses, to signal important events to the driver of a car or to draw the attention of a user of a desktop system to an important message of the user interface. The question we are addressing here is: How can we guide visual attention if we are not able to do it visually? In the presented approach we use gaze-contingent auditory feedback (sonification) to guide visual attention and show that people are able to make use of this guidance to speed up visual search tasks significantly.},

abstract = {Most commercial eye gaze tracking systems are based on the use of infrared lights. However, such systems may not work outdoor or may have a very limited head box for them to work. This paper proposes a non-infrared based approach to track one's eye gaze with an RGBD camera (in our case, Kinect). The proposed method adopts a personalized 3D face model constructed off-line. To detect the eye gaze, our system tracks the iris center and a set of 2D facial landmarks whose 3D locations are provided by the RGBD camera. A simple onetime calibration procedure is used to obtain the parameters of the personalized eye gaze model. We compare the performance of the proposed method against the 2D approach using only RGB input on the same images, and find that the use of depth information directly from Kinect achieves more accurate tracking. As expected, the results from the proposed method are not as accurate as the ones from infrared-based approaches. However, this method has the potential for practical use with upcoming better and cheaper depth cameras.},

Results show that such cueing influences performance and affects the subjective gaming experience. Accordingly, visual cues make the experience less enjoyable and less immersive. Interestingly, gaze-controlled gaming appears not to require additional cognitive effort. Taking into account previous findings, results suggest that applicability of overt cuing may depend on the game type. Our study shows the potential for optimization of interaction of gaze-controlled arcade games with visual cueing.},

The work that is presented here investigates two of the main purchasing scenarios: the routine purchasing act and the impulse purchasing act. The purpose is to propose a predictive model that best distinguishes the first scenario from the second scenario. To reach this goal, we extract statistically relevant eye-tracking descriptors. We use a supervised learning algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVM), to build the model and reach performances of 82.5% of good identification.},

In this paper we present an in situ study of gaze and mouse coordination as participants went about their normal activities. We analyze the coordination between gaze and mouse, showing that gaze often leads the mouse, but not as much as previously reported, and in ways that depend on the type of target. Characterizing the relationship between the eyes and mouse in realistic multi-task settings highlights some new challenges we face in designing robust gaze-enhanced interaction techniques.},

abstract = {Analysis of eye movements recorded with a mobile eye-tracker is difficult since the eye-tracking data are severely affected by simultaneous head and body movements. Automatic analysis methods developed for remote-, and tower-mounted eye-trackers do not take this into account and are therefore not suitable to use for data where also head- and body movements are present. As a result, data recorded with a mobile eye-tracker are often analyzed manually. In this work, we investigate how simultaneous recordings of eye- and head movements can be employed to isolate the motion of the eye in the eye-tracking data. We recorded eye-in-head movements with a mobile eye-tracker and head movements with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). Preliminary results show that by compensating the eye-tracking data with the estimated head orientation, the standard deviation of the data during vestibular-ocular reflex (VOR) eye movements, was reduced from 8.0° to 0.9° in the vertical direction and from 12.9° to 0.6° in the horizontal direction. This suggests that a head compensation algorithm based on IMU data can be used to isolate the movements of the eye and therefore simplify the analysis of data recorded using a mobile eye-tracker.},

We show that it is possible to predict length of hospital stay based on physiological data collected from the first day of hospitalization. Using 10-fold cross validation we achieve accurate predictions with a root mean square error of 3.3 days for hospital stays that are less than 15 days in duration. We also propose a clustering of patients that organizes them to risk groups according to their estimated severity of condition.},

We test our approach using a longitudinal sensor dataset that we collected from 18 single-resident smart homes for nearly two years and study the relationship between observed changes in the sensor-based everyday functioning parameters and changes in standard clinical health assessment scores. The results suggest that we may be able to develop sensor-based change algorithms that can predict specific components of cognitive and physical health.},

In this paper, we propose a method to predict the advices of doctors from the inquiry, vital data, and the chief complaints of the patients, and to delegate the task to health workers, resulting in eliminating the bottleneck. We also evaluate the accuracy of the prediction of advices from the 931 patients who have taken the doctors' consultancy out of the above experiment. We got the predict accuracy 76.24% with inquiry and vital data, and 82.55% with adding chief complaints data.},

abstract = {Living alone in their own residence, older adults are at-risk for late assessment of physical or cognitive changes due to many factors such as their impression that such changes are simply a normal part of aging or their reluctance to admit to a problem. Sensors networks have emerged in the last decade as a possible solution to older adult health monitoring and early illness recognition. Typical early illness recognition approaches are either concentrated on the detection of a given set of activities such as a fall or walks, or on the detection of anomalies such as too many bathroom visits. In this paper we propose a new illness recognition framework, MFA, based on detecting a missing frequent activity from the daily routine. MFA is implemented using a frequent temporal pattern detection algorithm and demonstrated on a pilot dataset collected in TigerPlace, an aging in place community from Columbia, Missouri.},

Based on a typical smart bed system that uses a force sensor array placed between bed mattress and frame, we evaluate the effect of different signal filtering options to illustrate viable design choices using our accuracy-coverage tradeoff analysis. In a full night recording study with six participants focusing on respiration rate estimation, we show that measurement coverage is an essential metric that should be analysed together with accuracy, when assessing the performance of smart bed systems.},

abstract = {Mobile phones include a variety of sensors that can be used to develop context-aware applications and gather data about the user's behavior, including the places he visits, his level of activity and how frequently and with whom he socializes. The collection and analysis of these data has been the focus of recent attention in ubiquitous computing, giving rise to the field known as mobile sensing. In this work, we present a collaborative extension to InCense, a toolkit to facilitate behavioral data gathering from populations of mobile phone users. InCense aims at providing people with little or no technical background with a tool that assists in the rapid design and implementation of mobile phone sensing campaigns. By extending the architecture of InCense to support distributed sensing campaigns we are able to incorporate several strategies aimed at optimizing battery, storage, and bandwidth. These issues represent significant challenges in sensing campaigns that generate considerable amounts of data (i.e., collecting audio) or quickly drain the battery in the device (i.e., GPS), given the limitations of mobile devices. In this work, collaborative sensing is used to decide which mobile phone should capture audio when two or more devices are potentially recording a similar audio signal.},

In many situations, sensitive objects/regions are maliciously (or accidentally) captured in a video frame by third-party applications. However, current solutions do not allow users to specify and enforce fine grained access control over video feeds.In this paper, we describe MarkIt, a computer vision based privacy marker framework, that allows users to specify and enforce fine grained access control over video feeds. We present two example privacy marker systems -- PrivateEye and WaveOff. We conclude with a discussion of the computer vision, privacy and systems challenges in building a comprehensive system for fine grained access control over video feeds.},

abstract = {Consumer electronic devices like smartphones increasingly feature arrays of sensors that can 'see', 'hear', and 'feel' the environment around them. While these devices began with primitive capabilities, newer generations of electronics offer sophisticated sensing arrays that collect high-fidelity representations of the physical world. For example, wearable cameras are becoming more prevalent with new consumer lifelogging products including the Narrative Clip, Autographer, and Google Glass. These wearable cameras give computing devices a persistent sense of sight, raising important concerns about protecting people's privacy. At the same time, these devices also provide opportunities for enhancing security, by allowing trusted devices to observe and react to the physical environment surrounding the user and the device. We propose Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) to mediate access to sensors and their data using attributes of the context and content of sensor information. Attributes extracted from sensor data could be used to trigger policy actions ranging from sharing or not sharing images, to invoking system changes in reaction to outside visual stimuli such as automatically shutting down network interfaces when in the presence of unknown people. While prior work has addressed some specific actions, like preventing potentially private images from being shared based on their location, in this paper we present and advocate for a more general working definition of ABAC that applies to sensors and sensor data. We also present use cases for how this reactive security approach may help protect the privacy and security of users.},

We then discuss how low-fidelity sensors such as far-infrared imagers can be used to capture these social cues and to control video cameras accordingly in order to respect the privacy of others.

We detect user presence by sensing the proximity of a subset of their possessions, making the process automatic and effortless. As in previous work, a master key unlocks the device and a secret-sharing scheme allows us to reconstruct this master key in the presence of k-out-of-n items. We extend this basic scheme in various directions, e.g. by allowing items to issue a dynamically variable number of shares based on how confident they are that the user is present. The position we argue in this paper is that a multi-dimensional approach to authentication that fuses several contextual inputs, similar to that already adopted by major web sites, can also bring advantages at the local scale.},

Many connected devices are nowadays being accessed through applications running on mobile devices instead of tangible controls. Whilst this ubiquitous access is highly convenient, it is also making connected devices more vulnerable. As such, we reintroduce location-constrained interaction, adapted to connected devices present in a modern home, and explore three design cardinals: (i) spatial granularity, (ii) roles and delegation, and (iii) access control. We report on a qualitative study that explored this design space through a prototype geo-fenced connected lighting system. Our findings suggest that users would like to have geo-fencing for a subset of connected devices, prefer to define geo-fences statically but with different granularities for different devices, and desire access control through location verification and credentials.},

To pass an authentication test using brainwave signals, a user must have both an inherence factor (his or her brain) and a knowledge factor (a chosen passthought). In this study, we investigate the extent to which both factors are truly necessary. In particular, we address the question of whether an attacker may gain advantage from information about a given target's secret thoughts.},

In order to demonstrate this, we present two projects (cases) in which wearable activity recognition is used to support the users' recall capabilities. In the next step, we present a narrative theory of action and mind, which focuses on how humans retrospectively interpret and structure personal experience in their minds, their so called autobiographical memory. Finally, we present some further concepts and distinctions about what it means to memorize and recall personal data.},

The purpose is to investigate how users will behave when a significant capture limitation is imposed in a picture-taking context, and in what kind of pictures this will result.

In a novel approach, we propose recording of events, interaction, and annotations in order to access characteristics that communicate the reasoning behind the decision-making of care providers. Recording is done with free-form and implicit data collection, and communication of spatio-chronological characteristics of events, interactions, and annotations are done with augmented interfaces. This enables care providers, who make decisions, to identify what factors have played the most significant role in the decision-making. In the context of chronic care, this research is aiming at, better understanding how to capture and communicate the medical decision-making process. Our preliminary experiments show success in communicating the reasoning processes of the document analysis sessions in a lab environment. We have started to look at how this improves reliability and practice outcomes of the decision-making in real-life medical environment.},

Mobile augmented reality (MAR) can provide a design approach, where we can utilize our everyday surroundings and attach information to the items without seemingly modifying their outlook. In this paper, we explore selected MAR scenarios from the augmented human memory point of view. We evaluated these scenarios in a online survey with 19 participants.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous technology has prompted the use of location-based reminders (LBRs) to help people remember to do things while being away from their desks. However LBRs are still not an effective tool for mobile users. Our work explores how to make LBRs better by using theories of memory, in particular prospective memory, and treating the system that captures the LBRs as an external memory aid. With the knowledge from these two pre-existing literature (prospective memory and external memory aids), we set out to explore how to influence the design and the use of LBRs. In this paper, we propose a framework that uses knowledge and principles from cognitive psychology and present how we might be able to improve LBRs. Our ultimate goal is to facilitate human memory recall for prospective tasks.},

abstract = {Experimental work in Life Sciences is done with protective garment to contain harmful agents and to avoid contaminations. This limits the amount of documentation that can be done during experimentation, since pen'n'paper and other equipment is hardly allowed in those environments. Relying on her memory, the scientist has to reconstruct the important details of her experiment later on. Wearable computers, like Google Glass or wrist-worn Smartwatches, can enhance the scientist's ability to record key information while conducting his experiment. Especially the possibility of hands-free, and implicit interaction with the wearable system creates new possibilities for augmenting the scientist's memory.},

abstract = {In this position paper we outline a technology concept for making new situations and encounters more familiar and less threatening. Going to new places, interacting with new people and carrying out new tasks is part of everyday life. New situations create a sense of excitement but in many cases also anxiety based on a fear of the unknown. Our concept uses the metaphor of a pin board as peripheral display to automatically provide advance information about potential future experiences. By providing references to and information about future events and situations we aim at creating a "feeling of having already experienced the present situation" (term D\'{e}j\`{a} vu as defined in the Oxford Dictionary) once people are in a new situation. This draws on the positive definition of the concept of d\'{e}j\`{a} vu. In this paper we outline our idea and use scenarios illustrate its potential. We assess different ways the concept can be realized and chart potential technology for content creation and for presentation. We also present a discussion of the impact on human memory and how this changes experiences.},
