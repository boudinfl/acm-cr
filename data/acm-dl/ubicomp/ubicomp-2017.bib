abstract = {Many people enjoy hiking as an outdoor escape from everyday life. However, in our survey of 1002 respondants in the United States, 95% of respondents indicate that they prefer to bring their cell phone when hiking. This potentially creates distractions by reminding hikers of the daily pressures they sought to escape. We believe technology has the ability to enable or enhance outdoor activities, such as hiking, without taking away from the experience. But to begin to realize this vision we must first understand current attitudes towards technology in the outdoors. We present data from a nationwide survey conducted within the United States. We have used this data to identify clusters around attitudes towards hiking and technology use while hiking. We present initial results and analysis of this data as well as direction for future work.},

abstract = {Modern IoT solutions are often an intricate system of interdependent components. Traditional monitoring techniques may not be sufficient to ensure the correct operation of those systems. We present an on-line machine learning approach for anomaly detection that is optimized for interpretability. The aim is to make it as intuitive as possible for human operators to derive insights about the system. To this end we combine characteristics of the system into sets of features that can be rendered graphically. Our solution builds on open source components and applies to any time series of numerical data. This work originated within a larger project on connected mobility that uses Blockchain technology to guarantee data integrity. Hence we demonstrate some results at the example of the public Ethereum blockchain. Further work will extend the solution to more general sensor data from the IoT realm.},

In light of this challenge, we show how blockchain technology can enable privacy by presenting an odometer fraud prevention system. It records mileage and GPS data of cars and secures that on the blockchain, which strongly hinders odometer fraud. Our users own and control their data while at the same time data integrity is ensured. This facilitates the certification of that data. We discuss the advantages of this approach compared to current systems and also highlight limitations of our architecture and the use of blockchain technology.},

abstract = {Multifactor authentication presents a robust security method, but typically requires multiple steps on the part of the user resulting in a high cost to usability and limiting adoption. Furthermore, a truly usable system must be unobtrusive and inconspicuous. Here, we present a system that provides all three factors of authentication (knowledge, possession, and inherence) in a single step in the form of an earpiece which implements brain-based authentication via custom-fit, in-ear electroencephalography (EEG). We demonstrate its potential by collecting EEG data using manufactured custom-fit earpieces with embedded electrodes. Across 7 participants, we are able to achieve perfect performance, mean 0% false acceptance (FAR) and 0% false rejection rates (FRR), using participants' best performing tasks collected in one session by one earpiece with three electrodes. Our results indicate that a single earpiece with embedded electrodes could provide a discreet, convenient, and robust method for secure one-step, three-factor authentication.},

abstract = {Computer activities such as writing documents and playing games are becoming more and more popular in our daily life. These activities (especially if identified in a non-intrusive manner) can be used to facilitate context-aware services. In this paper, we propose to recognize computer activities through keyboard input sensing with a smart-phone. Specifically, we first utilize the microphone embedded in a smartphone to sense the acoustic signal of keystrokes on a computer keyboard. We then identify keystrokes using fingerprint identification techniques. The determined keystrokes are then corrected by using the proposed adjacent similarity matrix algorithm. Finally, by fusing both semantic and acoustic features, a classification model is constructed to recognize four typical computer activities: chatting, coding, writing documents, and playing games. We evaluated the proposed approach from multiple aspects in realistic environments. Experimental results validated the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {As the notion of ubiquitous computing moves from abstract ideal to collective reality, a number of opportunities emerge that have the potential to dramatically change the devices that populate our daily lives and the patterns of interaction that those devices engender. To ensure that ubiquitous technologies enable useful interactions, we need to incorporate a more expressive notion of context, including how it is enacted, how it is identified, and how it is understood and utilized. This paper presents such an approach, highlighting the ways in which context can be defined in practice through the identification of the human dispositions that shape our everyday activities. These dispositions provide a shared vocabulary for technologies and its users to more effectively mediate meaningful interactions.},

We then present a machine learning method for binary classification of each Big Five personality trait using these temporal activity patterns of both computer and smartphones as model features. Our initial findings suggest that Extroversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism can be classified using temporal patterns of digital traces at a similar accuracy to previous research that classified personality traits using different types of digital traces.},

The proposed method was evaluated for recognizing eating moment with the free-environment dataset (9 participants, 604 days), and achieved 98.6% accuracy and 56.9% F-score.

abstract = {This paper proposes a mobile support system to assist DUI (Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol) offenders on probation in avoiding committing DUI again. A customizable portable breathalyzer is used in conjunction with the DUI offender's mobile phone to self-administer alcohol screening tests and send the results to a server. The system also transmits contextual information and momentary feedback to the server. Records pertaining to alcohol use are summarized on a server and a list of triggering events are inferred from the information sent from the phone. This data can then be used to characterize the difficulties faced by these individuals, monitor their compliance with their probation requirements, and gauge their progress.},

abstract = {As cities become increasingly dense, they must turn to novel technologies and frameworks to address the mobility challenges that will arise. 50% of trips in the U.S. are less than 3 miles, and could be replaced by a more sustainable and space-efficient mode of transportation, such as bicycling, if effective policies and incentives were implemented.This abstract presents a financial incentives system to increase the prevalence of urban cycling. The blockchain-based system allows cyclists to receive financial compensation from organizations, such as city governments or local businesses, that would like to sponsor cyclists. Using bicycle-powered sensors, cyclists collect and redeem their activity data through smart contracts stored and executed on an Ethereum blockchain. The use of blockchain technology makes transactions secure, trustworthy, and timely.This project envisions expanding this data platform to include additional bicycle-based sensors that cyclists use to collect and sell data, monetizing their commuting habits, and building a scalable and stable solution for encouraging sustainable transportation in cities.},

abstract = {This paper proposes CrowdTracker, a novel object tracking system based on mobile crowd sensing (MCS). Different from traditional video-based studies, CrowdTracker recruits people to collaboratively take photos of the object to achieve object movement prediction and tracking. The optimization objective of CrowdTracker is to effectively track the moving object in real time and minimize the cost on user incentives. Specifically, the incentive is determined by the number of workers assigned and the total distance that workers move to complete the task. In order to achieve the objective, we propose the MPRE model to predict the object movement and two other algorithms, namely T-centric and P-centric, for task allocation. Initial experimental results over a large-scale real-world dataset indicate that CrowdTracker can effectively track the object with a low incentive cost.},

However, there are many occasions where pet owners have to leave their pets such as working and studying abroad. Thus, we introduce 'Nene', a set of device, including an interactive cat-shaped device that reproduces in real-time features of a pet such thermal and haptic characteristics, and a mobile application for visual and acoustic features. In this study, we explore the psychological effects that Nene has on humans, focusing on loneliness and stress aspects. The evaluation shows a positive result as it provides a calming and relaxing effect to the users and potentially reduces stress and loneliness level. The result aims to open a new perspective for remote HAI for pet owners.},

WAM incorporates UTAUT model and additional variables like wearable characteristics (e.g. wearability, design and physical characteristics), attitude and privacy. WAM was used with an online survey of 129 university faculty, staff and students. Further, partial least square (PLS) path modeling was applied in analysis of 14 hypotheses to validate WAM results. In accordance to WAM, wearability and attitude tend to have a direct effect on intention to use, whereas performance and effort expectancy had only a direct influence on attitude and no direct influence on usage intention. Similarly, privacy concern, social influence had a positive influence on the intention to use both directly and indirectly through attitude. However, design and physical characteristics had no effect on intention to use. This study makes a unique empirical contribution to wearable research by extending knowledge on university users' behavior regarding wearables for well-being.},

In this paper, we propose a novel grip sensing system that enables a smartphone to detect various user-defined hand grips without any additional hardware. Our system emits a carefully-designed (inaudible) sound signal, and records the sound signal modified by an individual grip. The recorded sound signal is transformed into a unique sound signature through feature extraction process, and then SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifies the sound signature so as to identify the signature as one of pre-defined grips. With six representative grips, we demonstrate that our system exhibits 93.0% average accuracy for ten different users. Beyond this feasibility demonstration, our ongoing work is not only to improve the accuracy, but also to adapt our system to various real environments.},

Using such a computation offloading decision model, in this paper, we propose a double computation offloading technique that offloads from wearable devices to smartphones and further offloads to cloud servers. For three experimental scenarios, we measured the energy consumption of each wearable or smart device and analyzed the energy efficiency of our model.},

Physical measurements are not enough to design our living environment and we need to know subjective assessments. To predict subjective assessments from loudness values, we propose to use metadata related to where, who and what is recording. The proposed method is implemented using deep neural networks because these can naturally treat a variety of information types. First, we evaluated its performance in predicting five-point subjective loudness levels based on a combination of several features: location-specific, participant-specific, and sound-specific features. The proposed method achieved a 16.3 point increase compared with the baseline method. Next, we evaluated its performance based on noise map visualization results. The proposed noise maps were generated from the predicted subjective loudness level. Considering the differences between the two visualizations, the proposed method made fewer errors than the baseline method.},

We conduct our experiment on Japanese texts and try to predict, by analyzing the eye gaze, how many questions about the texts the reader will be able to answer to. We show that we obtain 5.27% of error in the number of correct answers estimation by using eye gaze features. As a comparison, we try to predict the number of correct answers by using the reader's self assessment understanding and show that it leads to 9.04% error.},

This will not only help serve patient, but help the caregiver to provide a quicker and more tuned in service. This would also reduce the likelihood of diaper rash as well as the other consequences of having on a soiled diaper over time. This is a less invasive approach to delivering services to people who have urinary incontinence, as many prefer diapers over a catheter.

Assessing the progression of spasticity during clinical interventions and at home is key to rehabilitation efficacy and care management. Here we present electromyography (EMG) and motion data using skin-mounted, flexible and wireless sensors in a cohort of 13 individuals with stroke. We compute a set of 15 features from the EMG data and use machine learning to infer whether spasticity is present during movements of the knee and ankle joints. Using a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classifier, we show that our approach successfully discriminates voluntary contractions from spastic muscle contractions (AUC=0.94). These results show that continuous and non-invasive monitoring of spasticity symptoms could be applied to optimize and personalize rehabilitation regimens.},

In this paper, we name such evolutionary process of POI as POI lifetime and the stages of POI lifetime as POI lifetime status. Specifically, when we find a POI appears/disappears by observing the online maps over time, we may say that a POI is in booming/decaying lifetime status. How to discover the booming/decaying POIs is a challenging but valuable task. To address this problem, we propose a framework leveraging the human mobility data to discover the booming and decaying POIs in urban areas. We conduct the experiments on real-world data sets. The results demonstrate that the ensemble classifier can discover the booming/decaying POIs effectively, and the human mobility factors extracted are indicative for discovering the POI lifetime status.},

abstract = {With advances in thermal sensor technology and falling costs, energy auditors are increasingly using thermography to detect thermal defects and analyze building energy efficiency. However, collecting thermal imagery is laborious and results can be misleading or ineffective if environmental conditions for conducting a proper scan are not met. In this abstract, we present a novel sensor kit for collecting and analyzing temporal thermography data, which reduces manual labor and enables new types of thermographic analyses. To gather initial user reactions and better understand the potential of this temporal data, we conducted a usability pilot study and a small field study deployment. We describe initial results, drawbacks, and enumerate directions forward for this emerging area.},

abstract = {Digital personal assistants such as Apple's Siri or Google Assistant emerge and penetrate our everyday lives, acting as digital helper for searching information or executing simple tasks. However, with their primarily reactive behavior through conversational input current assistants are rather limited in their support. This paper proposes a novel reference model of next-generation digital personal assistants which integrates the user's goals and a proactive behavior of support to achieve these goals. We report the findings of our focus group discussion with 11 researchers to develop and substantiate our model as well as identify common areas of human-centered assistance, namely mental, physical, activity, environment, social, and technology support. We further show and discuss important research challenges of next-generation assistants. Using our proposed reference model, researchers in the community can now design and classify their future personal assistants.},

abstract = {Wearable devices are heavily used in many sports. However, the existing sports wearables are either not tennis-specific, or are limited to information on shots. We therefore added tennis-specific information to a leading commercial device. Firstly, we developed a method for classifying shot types into forehand, backhand and serve. Secondly, we used multi-objective optimization to distinguish active play from the time in-between points. By combining both parts with the general movement information already provided by the device, we get comprehensive metrics for professional players and coaches to objectively measure a player's performance and enable in-depth tactical analysis.},

For two weeks, twenty-six students used a smartphone app that passively collected GPS sensor data. Human raters then characterized their most frequently visited places on a number of psychological characteristics, such as ambience (e.g. how safe, urban, lively a place was perceived) and personality (e.g. a place's perceived extroversion and conscientiousness). We explored the relationship between these place characteristics and participants own personality traits, showing how the personality traits of the average visitor to a location can be similar or different from the place's characteristics. We conclude with a discussion of how this approach can be used in future research on places.},

abstract = {Stroke is a common neurological disorder that can drastically impact mobility - that is, the ability to move in and through one's surroundings. Although rehabilitation programs focus on restoring mobility after stroke, there is no present method for reliably and fully quantifying mobility outside of a clinical setting. Smartphones are ubiquitous wearable sensing systems that can measure community mobility using movement and location tracking. We are currently investigating the ability of smartphone data to characterize post-stroke recovery in a long-term monitoring study (3--6 months). We will evaluate the potential of community mobility features to predict recovery, as determined by traditional clinical assessments. Preliminary results will be available in August 2017. Findings will provide a more objective, complete picture of recovery following stroke as well as the real-world impact of rehabilitation.},

To solve these issues, we implement a garment-type pressure sensor that measures the pressures that are directly added to the human skin. Our sensor successfully detected the body-pressure changes that are overlooked by bed-sheet-type sensors, avoided body-pressure shape vagueness, and measured the pressure increase depending on the body part lift-up by cushion use through an experiment with 20 subjects.},

We propose face2faceVR; an easy to use implementation of AR tracking to assist VR towards recognizing other nearby VR users. The contribution of this work are the following; 1) it is compatible with mobile VR technology that already caters towards a wider adoption, 2) it does not require a networked or shared virtual environment, and 3) it is an inexpensive implementation without any additional peripherals or hardware.},

Our primary purpose is to draw attention to the importance of potential perceived power facilitated by identity claims over an area, and to the temporal nature of the layered meanings of physical places in LBSN so they can be drawn upon as a resource for design.},

Although, smartphones are widely used for self-reporting, there is an opportunity to design dedicated, unobtrusive and distributed self-reporting devices that improve the coverage of sampled experiences. We designed self-reporting devices for two scenarios of reporting-Activities and Stress/Sleepiness. The devices were placed by the users in their surroundings for ease of access. We show that the devices are useful especially in certain situations such as when the user is engaged in focus work. Moreover, we show that the preference of phone or devices to self-report varied between users based on multiple factors such as their engagement with phone and their preferences about being surrounded by multiple devices.},

Existing works on human mobility prediction mainly focus on the prediction of the next location (or a set of locations) that will be visited by the user in a specified time. These methods do not take into account the locations sequence and the departure times. In this research, given the historical data and the user's trajectory in the first part of the current day (e.g trajectory in the morning), we introduce the concept of full trajectory prediction for the rest of the day (e.g. prediction of the trajectory in the afternoon). We emphasize that the full trajectory includes the sequence of the locations, the staying times, and the departure times. The proposed method has been examined on either labeled trajectories and geographical trajectories and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

However, not all the multimedia data have meta-data associated with them, thus making the retrieval cumbersome for the users. We propose a novel technique to bridge the semantic gap between the user's personal ideas (Subjective properties) regarding the images, represented by the meta-data, and the actual representation (Objective properties) of the images, represented by the content of the images. This spanning of semantic gap provides a mechanism for contextual retrieval of the images, based on the context-to-content association. We performed preliminary experiments on the Instagram data collected from public users' profile. The experiments performed on the data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for real-time application.},

We conduct an online experiment (n=151) to compare participants' responses to a narrative fiction passage and a "plain" functional description of the same imagined technology. Qualitatively we find that participants with the fiction passage raised concerns about different types of privacy harms and were more likely to suggest design modifications to protect privacy. Quantitatively, we find that participants with the fiction passage provided higher ratings of negative affect, and lower ratings of comfort and acceptability. This suggests that researchers trying to understand users' privacy concerns with new ubiquitous computing technologies may benefit from presenting the technology in multiple formats to elicit a broader range of values reflections.},

abstract = {Multiple-choice questions are often used to assess the user's understanding. However, the system does not know if the user answered randomly, by chance, with confidence or without confidence. The user's confidence can be used as a feedback for teachers or smart interfaces that could understand that he is not sure of himself and then provide further assistance.We aim to create confidence aware interfaces such as pervasive display. As a first step, we propose an application in the context of multiple-choice question answering. By using an eye tracker, we analyze the reading and answering behavior of the user, extract some features and predict his confidence. We asked 11 participants to solve 80 multiple-choice questions about English understanding, and estimated whether they answered confidently or not. We obtained 90.1% average accuracy for this prediction.},

Olfaction, i.e. the sense of smell, is used by humans as a sensorial information channel as an element for experiencing the environment. Olfactory sensations are closely linked to emotions and memories, but also notify about personal dangers such as fire or foulness. We utilize the properties of smell as a notification channel by amplifying received mobile notifications with artificially emitted scents. We built a wearable olfactory display that can be worn as a pendant around the neck and contains up to eight different scent aromas that can be inserted and quickly exchanged via small scent cartridges. Upon emission, scent aroma is vaporized and blown towards the user. A hardware - and software framework is presented that allows developers to add scents to their mobile applications.},

abstract = {Taking advantage of additive manufacturing and 3D printing, we have designed a 3D printed insole with embedded plantar pressure sensor arrays. 3D printing allowed us to uniquely design a multitude of sensors. With the use of extrusion-based 3D printers, we produced a model that printed both the resistive circuits and a complete insole simultaneously. These distinctive technologies have given us the capability to capture valuable pressure data from the insole of the foot. Analog signals sent from the pressure sensor arrays are received and processed through an attached multiplexer designed specifically for this application. The signal is then digitized and transmitted over the SPI to a microcontroller via Bluetooth Low Energy, to an android device to allow the user to easily record and interpret the pressure data in real-time. The android device houses a pressure mapping view to show the gradient of force throughout the insole.},

The Reader receives direct sensory feedback from these sensors in the form of a vibration band and heat gloves. Projected behind the Reader and Readee is the text being read, with keywords replaced by empty boxes. New words will appear that are selected according to the Readee's emotional state -thanks to an algorithm that interprets her/his biosignals. With the contrast and similarities between the spoken and projected poems, the Audience senses the emotional connection between the Reader and Readee as it shifts through states of resonance and dissonance, calm and stress.},

To this end, we implement atmoSphere, a haptic ball to prototype several haptic/audio designs. AtmoSphere consists of a sphere shaped device which provides haptic feedback. The users can experience the design aimed at instructing them in breathing techniques shown to enhance meditation.The aim of the haptic/audio design is to guide the user into a particular rhythm of breathing. We detect this rhythm using smart eyewear (J!NS MEME) that estimates cardiac and respiratory parameters using embedded motion sensors. Once this rhythm is achieved the feedback stops. If the user drops out of the rhythm, the haptic/audio feedback starts again.},

abstract = {Activity tracking using a wearable device is an emerging research field. Large-scale studies on activity tracking performed with eyewear-type wearable devices remains a challenging area owing to the negative effect such devices have on users' looks. To cope with this challenge, JINS Inc., an eyewear retailer in Japan, has developed a state-of-the-art smart eyewear called JINS MEME. The design of JINS MEME is almost the same as that of Wellington-type eyeglasses so that people can use it in their daily lives. JINS MEME is equipped with sensors to detect a user's eye movement and head motion. In addition to these functions of JINS MEME, JINS developed an application to measure concentration levels of users. In this demonstration, users will experience wearing the JINS MEME glasses and their concentration will be measured while they perform a certain task at our booth.},

The electric field type NFC by electric induction coupling is utilized. The second application demonstrates an Apple Pay on HBC and two scenarios of "contact" communication with a finger to NFC reader and NFC transaction with a touch panel display are introduced.

The proposed method provides mobile devices with a new low cost input interface that offers physical force feedback like a pointing stick. The cost of our method is low as it needs only a simple ring-shaped part on the camera bezel. Moreover, if finger gestures are not being made, the camera has an unobscured view. We prototype the proposed method and evaluate its precision. This paper discusses the unique characteristics and possible applications of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Nonverbal cues are considered the most important part in social communication. Many people desire people; but due to the stigma and unavailability of resources, they are unable to practice their social skills. In this work, we envision a virtual assistant that can give individuals real-time feedback on their smiles, eye-contact, body language and volume modulation that is available anytime, anywhere using a computer browser. To instantiate our idea, we have set up a Wizard-of-Oz study in the context of speed-dating with 47 individuals. We collected videos of the participants having a conversation with a virtual agent before and after of a speed-dating session. This study revealed that the participants who used our system improved their gesture in a face-to-face conversation. Our next goal is to explore different machine learning techniques on the facial and prosodic features to automatically generate feedback on the nonverbal cues. In addition, we want to explore different strategies of conveying real-time feedback that is non-threatening, repeatable, objective and more likely to transfer to a real-world conversation.},

abstract = {In developing countries, room-level air conditioners (air-cons) are a major consumer of electricity across residential and small-scale commercial buildings. In these air-cons, the user specifies their comfort requirements on an inbuilt thermostat through infrared (IR) based remotes. State-of-the-art thermostats emulate the AC remotes and assist occupants in remotely changing the thermostat temperature, through their smartphones. The room-level control together with buildings' poor thermal insulation makes air-cons an attractive target for energy conservation. In this work, we explore grey-box modeling techniques to upgrade the commercial thermostats for - 1. actionable feedback, 2. energy-efficient control, and 3. corrective feedback. We plan to address these three core issues and develop portable and ubiquitous thermostats that leverage easy-to-collect ambient information to optimise the AC operations while ensuring the user comfort. The aim of this work is to achieve comfortable energy-savings for the users with minimal interference from the sensors.},

One factor contributing to these issues is building age. Residential buildings, for example, constitute 95% of all buildings in the US and are on average over 50 years old [23]; most of these buildings were constructed using energy inefficient designs and their materials have degraded over time. Moreover, the US Department of Energy has set a goal of reducing housing energy use by up to 70% [18]. To meet this goal, renovations and retrofits of existing building stock has become a pressing need. One effective practice for motivating these improvements is energy auditing, which has seen a resurgence of interest in recent years [20].},

abstract = {The number of road traffic fatalities has been steadily increasing since 2001 and is currently the eighth leading cause of death globally, with the loss of life of 1.2 million people each year according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [11]. In addition, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that the number of deaths from traffic accidents in the USA increased by 7% from 2014 to 2015, rising to 35,092 fatalities [4]. Amid growing humanitarian concerns of so many injuries and fatalities worldwide, the Department of Transport issued a call to action encouraging the continuous research into different approaches that can improve the situation. As such, there are various research studies which are geared towards how in-vehicle systems can encourage drivers to adapt their driving behaviour and help to reduce the amount of both fatal and non-fatal traffic accidents. Typically, these systems aim to prevent a collision with an upcoming vehicle or pedestrian by providing warnings to drivers, and latest studies demonstrate promising evidence that these systems can indeed have significant positive effects [2, 9, 10]. However, the vast majority of studies have focused on simulation experiments [3, 8] and controlled lab experiments [6, 13]. We have recently contributed to this field by bringing an in-vehicle warning system into a field studying setting, utilising real world location analytics on traffic accident hotspots to generate in-vehicle warnings [7]. Going one step further, the benefit of ubiquitously detecting dangerous locations from data gathered by connected vehicles, and using these locations as a source for in-vehicle warnings, has widely not been addressed in this growing domain and is the focus of our research.},

abstract = {What if we can monitor our health like the way we monitor the weather? The way humans manage the weather is one that is proactive rather than reactive. Weather stations are spread across the world, satellites take periodic images to track large atmospheric patterns, and water samples are made to check the ocean's health. It is an effort that allows us to have knowledge of the current state of the weather and overall health of the world climate. Not only that, it allows us to forecast the weather to plan flight schedules, tsunami warnings, or just when we should go hiking. Without this concerted effort, we would literally be flying blind. In contrast, the current paradigm for general health monitoring is reactive rather than proactive. Generally, patients seek medical attention after something is wrong, leading to higher cost of treatment due to delayed response to conditions [10, 11]. This is largely due to the vast variety of health metrics needed to be monitored to properly screen for all the different facets of human health. This is further aggravated in developing countries where the cost of these screening tools, like blood draws and labs, make it feasible only for national level hospitals to operate [3]. Furthermore, some health conditions require constant monitoring after screening has identified the issue, such as hypertension, diabetes, and different blood conditions [10, 12, 14]. In these cases, the issue becomes further complicated and the need for at home monitoring is needed. Finally, to react to changes in the patient's health, it is essential to predict when the condition may re-occur or worsen. To draw from an analogy with weather tracking, a shift to proactive health monitoring requires tracking that is more ubiquitous, frequent, and predictive.},

The preprocessor retrieves and transfers the GTFS data into a new data format for the visualizer. The visualizer displays an animation of public transport movement according to its schedule specified in the GTFS data on a map. It also displays a graph of the number of public transport vehicles per hour, and allows the user to choose a specific transport route, trip, and stations to visualize. This is the first attempt to build a tool that preprocesses and visualizes GTFS data that is publically available in a format that is not so easy to process with existing standard data visualization tools.},

The services may include but not limited to health, parking, transport, water, environment, power, and so forth. The diverse and heterogeneous environment of IoT and smart urban is challenged by real-time data processing and decision-making. In this research article, we propose IoT based smart urban architecture using Big Data analytics. The proposed architecture is divided into three different tiers: (1) data acquisition and aggregation, (2) data computation and processing, and (3) decision making and application. The proposed architecture is implemented and validated on Hadoop Ecosystem using reliable and authentic datasets. The research shows that the proposed system presents valuable imminent into the community development systems to get better the existing smart urban architecture.},

The ability to automatically estimate passenger occupancy in near real-time throughout cities will be a step change in the way public service usage is currently estimated and provide significant insights to decision makers. The ever-increasing popularity and abundance of mobile devices with always-on Wi-Fi/Bluetooth interfaces makes Wi-Fi/Bluetooth sensing a promising approach for estimating passenger load. In this paper, we present a Wi-Fi/Bluetooth sensing system to detect mobile devices for estimating passenger counts using public transport. We present our findings on an initial set of experiments on a series of bus/tram journeys encapsulating different scenarios over five days in a UK metropolitan area. Our initial experiments show promising results and we present our plans for future large-scale experiments.},

In this work, we use a mobile device as a means to gain information about the rehabilitation progress after a hip replacement. Results from a study conducted with 12 patients of hip replacement indicate that our approach can classify the kind of walking aid used by patients with an accuracy of 93.3% and provide a gait score that correlates to standard gait scores used by physical therapists with an accuracy of 99.1%.},

We identify DQ dimensions directly applicable to sensor data: believability (comparison with the correct operating bounds), completeness (missing values), free-of-error (erroneous values), consistency (over time), timeliness (delay), accuracy (deviation from true value) and precision (granularity of readings) are core aspects of high-quality sensor data. We also emphasize that sensor data must be representative of the originating type of sensor. We propose an altruistic approach to DQ assessment for sensor data that facilitates aggregating and sharing of domain knowledge through a community-contributed library of DQ assessment methods organized by sensor type.},

Specifically, we consider scenarios where multiple smartphones are used to sense physical phenomena, and subsequently the sensor data from multiple distributed devices is aggregated. We observe that the accumulated clock drift for smartphones can be more than 150ms per day in the worst case. We show that solutions using the public Network Time Protocol (NTP) can be noisy with errors up to 1800ms in one request. We describe a rapid clock synchronisation technique that reduces drift to 10ms on average (measured by linear regression) and achieves pair-wise synchronisation between smartphones with an average of 27ms (measured by accelerometer), following a Gaussian-like distribution. Our results provide a lower bound for rapid clock synchronisation as a guide when developing ubiquitous sensing services using multiple smartphones.},

Eight features from three aspects, i.e., daily mobility, user daily schedule, and social ability, are designed within a time window. Further, we analyze the features' correlation and variation over time. With the features, each user can be attached with a few semantic labels to demonstrate his/her characteristics.

abstract = {This paper presents AudioSense, the system to monitor user-item interactions inside a store hence enabling precisely customized promotions. A shopper's smartwatch emits sound every time the shopper picks up or touches an item inside a store. This sound is then localized, in 2D space, by calculating the angles of arrival captured by multiple microphones deployed on the racks. Lastly, the 2D location is mapped to specific items on the rack based on the rack layout information. In our initial experiments conducted with a single rack with 16 compartments, we could localize the shopper's smartwatch with a median estimation error of 15.9 cm in 2-dimensional space.},

We quantify the 'preview effect' bias in visual mood assessment. We demonstrate that automated tools which infer user mood from photographs or video may be affected by the presentation methodology used while performing image capture. Specifically, we demonstrate that showing a "preview" of oneself, i.e., a mirror, increases the accuracy of the visual mood inference algorithms present in Google's Mobile Vision API. Our findings show that studies that incorporate visual mood assessment should include "preview" images to reduce bias and increase the reliability of vision-based happiness inference.},

The study was conducted among members of the Finnish Society for Migraine, and it aimed to determine and recognize the migraine patients with pre-symptoms and whether they would be willing to use wearable sensors in identifying pre-symptoms of migraine. The survey received responses from 565 persons, and more than 90 per cent of the respondents were willing to use the wearable sensors for the measurement of pre-symptoms, as well as to support the treatment. Moreover, the study revealed that 87.8 percent of migraine patients identified migraine early symptoms. The most common symptoms are tiredness, slow thinking, difficulty to find words and visual disturbances. Most of the respondents wanted the device placed on wrist as a watch, wristband or a skin patch.},

abstract = {The migraine is a chronic, incapacitating neurovascular disorder, characterized by attacks of severe headache and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, concerning 15% of people in developed countries. It is one of the most understated and incapacitating diseases in the world and costing yearly 111 Billion Euros in Europe only. In our study, we discarded the mechanisms affecting to the migraine but instead the focus was on early detection of the attacks by using human measured biosignals. By using a single, easy and comfortable wearable sensor device the aim was to develop a model that assists individuals to take their medication on time and hence help to avoid the pain in migraine. In this paper, a preliminary study concept is presented as well as the experiences of the data collection using Empatica E4 device is carried out. The experiences are introduced from the point of view of the researchers themselves but also the volunteers actually using the device answered to a short survey about the usability issues as well as gave opinions of the future migraine detection device itself.},

abstract = {Convenient monitoring of vital signs, particularly blood pressure(BP), is critical to improve the effectiveness of health-care and prevent chronic diseases. This study presents a user-friendly, low-cost, real-time, and non-contact technique for BP measurement based on the detection of photoplethysmography (PPG) using a regular webcam. Leveraging features extracted from photoplethysmograph, an individual's BP can be estimated using a neural network. Experiments were performed on 20 human participants during three different daytime slots given the influence of background illumination. Compared against the systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure readings collected from a commercially available BP monitor, the proposed technique achieves an average error rate of 9.62% (Systolic BP) and 11.63% (Diastolic BP) for the afternoon session, and 8.4% (Systolic BP) and 11.18% (Diastolic BP) for the evening session. The proposed technique can be easily extended to the camera on any mobile device and thus be widely used in a pervasive manner.},

abstract = {Technological advances enable the inclusion of miniature sensors (e.g., accelerometers, gyroscopes) on a variety of wearable/portable information devices. Most current devices utilize these sensors for simple orientation and gesture recognition only. However, in the future the recognition of more complex and subtle human behaviors from these sensors will enable next-generation human-oriented computing in scenarios of high societal value (e.g., dementia care). This will require large-scale human activity corpuses and much improved methods to recognize activities and the context in which they occur. This workshop deals with the challenges of designing reproducible experimental setups, running large-scale dataset collection campaigns, designing activity and context recognition methods that are robust and adaptive, and evaluating systems in the real world. As a special topic this year, we wish to reflect on the challenges and possible approaches to recognize situations, events or activities outside of a statically pre-defined pool, which is the current state of the art, and instead adopt an open-ended view on activity and context awareness. Following the huge success of previous years, we are further planning to share these experiences of current research on human activity corpus and their applications among the researchers and the practitioners and to have a deep discussion on the future of activity sensing, in particular towards open-ended contextual intelligence.},

While the first ideas were more like a-proof-of-concept studies the area has become a fruitful soil to novel methods of machine learning, to adaptive modeling, signal fusion and several different types of application areas. Nevertheless, one of the slowing aspects in methodology development is the burden in collecting and labeling enough versatile data sets. In this article, a MyoGym data set is introduced to be used in activity recognition classifier development, in development of models for unseen activities, in signal fusion, and many other areas not yet known. The data set includes 6D motion signals and 8 channel electromyogram data from 10 persons and from 30 different gym exercises, each of them consisting a set of ten repetitions. The benchmark results provided, in this article, are in purpose made straightforward that their repetitiveness should be easy for any newcomer in the area.},

abstract = {Currently GPS is utilized for localization but is not reliable indoors or underground where its signals cannot reach. Instead, localization using Wi-Fi is investigated in the field of indoor positioning. Wi-Fi localization is performed using a radio model created by observed information collected beforehand; however, the model deteriorates over-time as Radio Base Stations (RBS) appear, disappear, and are relocated. As a result, localization accuracy decreases. Accuracy of positioning is affected by RBS and the number of RBS used for localization, thus, updating the model is required whenever deterioration occurs. There is no way to detect deterioration and necessity to update. This research investigates a method to detect such deterioration only by analyzing logs collected from navigation applications. Appearance and disappearance of RBS can be detected by analyzing observed date with its interval related to its average and standard deviation. Relocation of RBS can be detected by finding change-point of RBS's co-occurrence with other RBS. As results, it is demonstrated that RBS which possibly appears and/or disappears can be specified, if observed over certain days. It is also demonstrated that RBS which possibly be relocated can be specified by finding the best threshold.},

Further sensors can present more detailed information about each potential collapse event. We conduct simulations to identify strategies for dealing with false-positive data under scenarios of varying population density. Potential building collapses can be determined with 95% accuracy given 10 connected devices within a 125m radius, increasing to 99.99% for 50 devices. End-user devices can proactively offer valuable help to emergency responders during earthquakes, potentially saving lives.},

First method is an advanced floor recognition method by using Wi-Fi and barometer in smartphones, when we know the location of Wi-Fi APs and the height between floors of buildings. Second method is to learn and infer if a floor of a building whose location of APs is unknown is connected to outside of the building. We conducted an evaluation of the proposed methods. As a result, the accuracy of the first method was 96%. The evaluation result also shows that the second method can learn and infer the floor which is connected to outside of the building.},

By using the method, we can analyze the behavior of the attendees at some large-scale exhibition, such as the order of the visited booth and the duration of the stay. Using mobile BLE tags has some advantages: to collect a large amount of data easily, to provide location estimation without smart-phones. However, in a real environment, the BLE signal is unstable due to many people and obstacles. Fingerprinting is difficult because arranging booths finishes few hours before exhibition starts. Our previous trilateration method resulted in 10--30 meter accuracy with the data collected at Geospatial EXPO 2015 because of packet loss. We, to decrease packet loss, have developed tandem scanner that is equipped with multiple Bluetooth adapters. This paper presents the result of the improved method with the data collected by tandem scanners at Geospatial EXPO 2016. We also examined what improves accuracy: shorter advertising interval of the BLE tag and a larger number of tandem scanner's available adapters. Average location estimation accuracy was 4.51 meters when using best settings.},

Various schemes have been proposed in PDR, however, sufficient precision has not been achieved because of the error accumulation. In this research, we propose a PDR error compensation scheme based on an assumption that can obtain sparse locations. Sparse locations mean discontinuous locations obtained by using absolute localization method or passage detection devices (ex. BLE, Magnetic Field). We attempt to compensate the trajectory of PDR estimation and improve estimation precision by sparse locations. Then we tune parameters describing errors. In our scheme, we define error models that represent errors in PDR, including moving distance error and orientation changing error. Moreover, we define parameters to describe these errors. As a result, proposed scheme improved position error rate approximately 10% and route distance error rate approximately 7%.},

abstract = {Animal behaviour is a commonly-used and sensitive indicator of animal welfare. Moreover, the behaviour of animals can provide rich information about their environment. For online activity recognition on collar tags of animals, fundamental challenges include: limited energy resources, limited CPU and memory availability, and heterogeneity of animals. In this paper, we propose to tackle these challenges with a framework that employs Multitask Learning for embedded platforms. We train the classifiers with shared training data and a shared feature-representation. We show that Multitask Learning has a significant positive effect on the performance of the classifiers. Furthermore, we compare 7 types of classifiers in terms of resource usage and activity recognition performance on real-world movement data from goats and sheep. A Deep Neural Network could obtain an accuracy of 94% when tested with the data from both species. Our results show that a Deep Neural Network performs the best among the compared classifiers in terms of complexity versus performance. This work supports the development of a robust generic classifier that can run on a small embedded system with good performance, as well as sustain the lifetime of online activity recognition systems.},

abstract = {For many people, the habit of leg shaking is an annoyance to themselves and people around them. By simply becoming aware of the motion, one is able to voluntarily stop shaking. In this work, we present SPINDLES, a low-power, low-latency, non-intrusive and high accuracy mobile application to detect leg shaking and notify the user in a timely manner. SPINDLES is robust to the placement of the phone and implements a signal processing pipeline that eliminates the need for training and calibration phases common in machine learning approaches. We compare SPINDLES with other detection algorithms and existing Google Play Store applications, and find that SPINDLES is a major improvement in terms of accuracy with comparable latency and power consumption. It has a true positive rate of 99.6%, as well as a true negative rate of 97.6%, taken over 500 trials in various situations1.},

abstract = {Problematic eating behaviors are a major cause of obesity. To improve our understanding of these eating behaviors, we need to be able to first reliably detect them. In this paper we use a wrist-worn sensor to test a generalized machine learning models' reliability in detecting eating episodes through data processing. We process data from a 6-axis inertial sensor. Since most eating episodes do not occur while moving, we filter out periods of physical activity, and then use an advanced motif-based time-point fusion technique to detect feeding gestures. We also cluster each of the false alarms into four categories in an effort to identify the main behaviors that confound feeding gesture detection. We tested our system on eight participants performing various activities in the wild while wearing a sensing suite: a neck- and a wrist-worn sensor, along with a wearable video camera continuously recording to capture ground truth. Trained annotators further validated the algorithms by identifying feeding gestures, and categorized the false alarms. All eating episodes were detected; however, many false alarms were also detected, yielding a 61% average F-measure in detecting feeding gestures. This result shows clear challenges in characterizing eating episodes by using a single inertial-based wrist-worn sensor.},

So-called anticipatory systems promise to approach these issues through personal guidance or support within a user's daily and professional life.The Second Workshop on Intelligent Personal Support of Human Behavior (SmartGuidance'17) aims to build on the success of the previous workshop (namely Smarticipation) organized in conjunction with UbiComp 2016, to continue discussing the latest research outcomes of anticipatory mobile systems. We invite the submission of papers within this emerging, interdisciplinary research field of anticipatory mobile computing that focuses on understanding, design, and development of such ubiquitous systems. We also welcome contributions that investigate human behaviors, underlying recognition and prediction models; conduct field studies; as well as propose novel HCI techniques to provide personal support. All workshop contributions will be published in supplemental proceedings of the UbiComp 2017 conference and included in the ACM Digital Library.},

abstract = {A key challenge in the field of behavior intervention technology is to help people address habit-related issues such as depression, diet, exercise, and smoking. For these issues, theories suggest that small behavioral prompts delivered on a daily basis might be one effective way to motivate incremental shifts that accumulate into sustainable change. However, while this approach is appealing, we still know very little about how to design effective behavioral prompts that work in the context of everyday life. To fill this gap, we have developed a mobile intervention that sends people one sustainable lifestyle challenge every day. In a 20-day field trial with 139 participants, we collected logs from our mobile app, surveys, and post-study interviews. Participants completed a total of 1,921 daily challenges. In this paper, we report on participants' feelings and reactions to this daily challenge approach. This feedback suggests new design opportunities for mobile behavior interventions that use daily prompts.},

Learning to recognize a user's negative reactions to such wrong services will enable a CAIE to anticipate a service's appropriateness. We propose a framework for continuous measurement of physiology to infer a user's negative-emotions arising from receiving wrong services, thereby implementing an implicit-feedback loop in the CAIE system. To induce such negative-emotions, in this paper, we present a virtual-reality (VR) based experimental platform while collecting real-time physiological data from ambulatory wearable sensors. Results from the electrodermal activity (EDA) data analysis reveal patterns that correlate with known features of negative-emotions, indicating the possibility to infer service appropriateness from user's reactions to a service, thereby closing an implicit-feedback loop for the CAIE.},

It is difficult to listen to information that is presented in noisy surroundings. If the solution were only to turn up the volume, we would feel uncomfortable because this is very inconvenient. Therefore, by additionally presenting animation, we aim to make it easy for users to listen to speech information. With our method, we use lip-sync animation that matches specific speech information.

abstract = {Evolution has always been the main driving force of change for both the human body and brain. Presently, in the Information era, our cognitive capacities cannot simply rely on natural evolution to keep up with the immense advancements in the field of Ubiquitous technologies, which remain largely uninformed about our cognitive states. As a result, a so-called "cognitive gap" is forming between the human (users) and the machine (systems) preventing us from fully harnessing the benefits of modern technologies. We argue that a "cognitive information layer", placed in-between human and machine, could bridge that gap, informing the machine side about aspects of our cognition in real time (e.g., attention levels). In this position paper, we present our vision for such a software architecture, we describe how it could serve as a framework for designing and developing cognition-aware applications, and we showcase some application scenarios as a roadmap towards human-machine convergence and symbiosis.},

To tackle this issue, we externalised the ability of self reporting loss of focus by developing a feedback loop that helps the user track and maintain their concentration levels in a non-invasive manner. We hypothesise that the change in breathing pattern can indicate a loss of concentration and the act of audibly amplifying a person's breathing sounds during meditation can help them regain and maintain focus on their breathing, leading to a more effective meditation session. We present experimental designs and findings towards this end.},

Whether it is about sensors to expand humans' sensorium, exo-skeletons augmenting physical capabilities, augmented and digital worlds breaking with physical boundaries, or curated digital memories: the value of all these technologies rises and falls with their ability to synchronize with the user's current situation, understand the needs and provide appropriate support. In this position paper we want to outline how semantic technologies can be applied to add more context and meaning to the user's role and task, and use Augmented Reality to present this information to the user. Instead of proposing yet another framework representing world knowledge we describe how to build upon existing standards, descriptions of procedures and routines, and regulations that become machine accessible.

abstract = {Reading in real life occurs in a variety of settings. One may read while commuting to work, waiting in a queue or lying on the sofa relaxing. However, most of current activity recognition work focuses on reading in fully controlled experiments. This paper proposes reading detection algorithms that consider such natural readings. The key idea is to record a large amount of data including natural reading habits in real life (more than 980 hours from 7 participants) with commercial electrooculography (EOG) glasses and to use them for deep learning. Our proposed approaches classified controlled reading vs. not reading with 92.2% accuracy on a user-dependent training. However, the classification accuracy decreases to 73.8% on natural reading vs. not reading. The results indicate that there is a strong gap between controlled reading and natural reading, highlighting the need for more robust reading detection algorithms.},

abstract = {The tracking of cognitive and physical activity using a wearable device is an emerging research field. While several studies have been performed on large-scale activity tracking using a watch-type wearable device, large-scale activity tracking using an eyewear-type wearable device remains a challenging area owing to the negative effect of such devices on a user's appearance. In this paper, we describe the initial result of a large-scale longitudinal study about the concentration level of users using an eyewear-type wearable device. Our approach is to use an eyewear-type wearable device and a predeveloped mobile application to collect data about eye blinks and head posture. The concentration level of users is estimated based on blink rate, blink strength, and head posture. We collected over 40,000 hours of data, and the result shows the change in concentration in a week and with time.},

abstract = {In this position paper we try to extend the discussion about the human augmentation of the mind through reasoning. Memory seems favored but both of them play a major role in the mind, we want to equilibrate it. Those two components of our cognitive system are actually quite intertwined with sometimes similar properties and goals. Both are failing, in many ways, that is why we are interested in it, a slight augmentation to those abilities would have huge impact. Therefore, we made a first attempt to propose an approach of a system capable of augmenting the reasoning of his user. First by sensing his context and detect a kind of cognitive bias for many domains through wearable devices and natural language processing. Then we propose a radical method to debiasing that could be used in different scenarios thanks to augmented reality. Finally, those propositions are a beginning of a much needed bigger work that confronts many challenges discussed at the end.},

The second is sensing technologies for producing experiential supplements in the context of learning. Because a basic activity of learning is reading, we also deal with sensing of reading. Methods for quantifying the reading in terms of the number of read words, the period of reading, type of read documents, identifying read words are shown with experimental results. As for learning, we propose methods for estimating the English ability, confidence in answers to English questions, and estimating unknown words. The above are sensed by various sensors including eye trackers, EOG, EEG, and the first person vision.},

It has been used to remote control users for navigation and instrument playing, but also as a method to convey haptic feedback in VR, for example. As EMS devices become commercially available and application research continues, we explore EMS as a modality to convey information through actuation and as a means to induce and communicate emotions and moods. In this position paper, we present the results from two focus groups on using EMS for interpersonal communication as a way to send and receive emoticons through electrical stimulation. We argue that so-called "EMS Icons" have the potential to become part of multimedia experiences and more broadly of User Interfaces as a haptic variant in analogy to visual and auditory icons.},

However, for that, we need to optimize the transmission method for each person. We propose the augmented-human based approach for the experience transmission, and review some factors that are essential but not well focused in past studies.},

abstract = {Mental health issues affect a significant portion of the world's population and can result in debilitating and life-threatening outcomes. To address this increasingly pressing healthcare challenge, there is a need to research novel approaches for early detection and prevention. In particular, ubiquitous systems can play a central role in revealing and tracking clinically relevant behaviors, contexts, and symptoms. Further, such systems can passively detect relapse onset and enable the opportune delivery of effective intervention strategies. However, despite their clear potential, the uptake of ubiquitous technologies into clinical mental healthcare is rare, and a number of challenges still face the overall efficacy of such technology-based solutions. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers interested in identifying, articulating, and addressing such issues and opportunities. Following the success of last year's inaugural workshop, we aim to continue facilitating the UbiComp community in developing a holistic approach for sensing and intervention in the context of mental health.},

The collected data enhances understanding of how students' social anxiety levels are associated with their mobility and communication patterns. Our analysis based on GPS location, text messages, and call data collected from 54 college students over a two-week period indicates that social anxiety level can be predicted with an accuracy of up to 85%.},

We present an inter-domain study for affect recognition on seven different datasets, recorded with six different sensors, three different sensor placements, 211 subjects and nearly 1000 hours of labelled data. The datasets are processed and translated into a common spectro-temporal space. The data represented in the common spectro-temporal space is used to train a deep neural network (DNN) for arousal recognition that benefits from the large amounts of data even when the data are heterogeneous (i.e., different sensors and different datasets). The DNN approach outperforms the classical machine-learning approaches in six out of seven datasets.},

Rather than focusing on improving overall accuracy of such an approach, we seek to understand when we are and are not capable of predicting an individual's wellbeing. In particular, we consider the ability to predict daily wellbeing from smartphone GPS location data as a case study. We hypothesize that user characteristics, such as behavioral variability, level of depression symptoms, and amount of labeled data, are related to improvements in prediction accuracy. Our preliminary results indicate that there may be a relationship between an algorithm's ability to successfully predict an individual's wellbeing reports and the individual's location behavior variability. While further work is needed to improve model accuracy and confirm this relationship in a larger study, our work is a step in the necessary direction of understanding which individuals can be monitored with smartphone data.},

In this work, we propose SARA, a novel app to engage users with ongoing tracking using timely rewards thereby reinforcing users for data input. SARA is developed for adolescents and emerging adults at risk for substance abuse. The rewards in SARA are designed to be developmentally and culturally appropriate to the target demographic and are theoretically grounded in the behavioral science literature. In this paper, we describe SARA and its rewards to increase data collection. We also briefly discuss future plans to evaluate SARA and develop just in time adaptive interventions for engagement and behavior change.},

We divided the accelerometer data using sliding windows, extracted features from each window, and used the features to train supervised machine learning algorithms to infer an individual's emotion from their walking pattern.

We describe the co-design process conducted with caregivers to define realistic application scenarios for a conversational robot, named Eva, to enact interventions. Most recommendations from the caregivers in the co-design session were implemented in Eva. We conducted two sessions of a music therapy intervention with the new version of Eva with six PwD at a geriatric residence. Preliminary results from the intervention showed that the residents enjoyed the sessions, they talked to Eva to request songs, answered questions made by the robot and sang with it.},

However, recognizing such reactions is difficult since people react to stressful events in various ways. Accordingly, we propose a multimodal stress monitoring framework to examine people's physiological and behavioral reactions to stressors. Our framework consists of (i) multimodal data collection related to mental stress, (ii) stress inducing experiment in a laboratory, and (iii) signal examination software in real-time and after the data collection. Through preliminary experiments, we have examined how people show various reactions to different kinds of stressful tasks. Finally, based on the proposed framework, we will establish a database contributing to the mental health sensing research.},

abstract = {Behavioral activation has shown to be a simple yet effective therapy for depressive patients. The method relies on extensive collection of patient reported activity data on an hourly basis. We are currently in the process of designing a smartphone-based behavioral activation system for depressive disorders. However, it is an open question to what degree patients would use this approach given the high demand for user input. In order to investigate this question, we collected paper-based behavioral activation forms from 5 patients, covering in total 18 weeks, 115 days, and 1,614 hours of self-reported activity data. In this paper we present an analysis of this data and discuss the implications for the design of a smartphone-based system for behavioral activation.},

abstract = {Autism is a neuro-developmental condition that is characterized by a number of unconventional behaviors such as restricted and repetitive activities. It is often largely attributed to deficiency in communication and social interaction. Therefore, it is difficult to make autistic individuals, especially children, to comply with researches that aim at comprehending this condition. However, with the availability of non-invasive eye-tracking technology, this problem has become easier to deal with. The following research probes into the visual face scanning patterns and emotion recognition between 21 autistic and 21 control or TD (typically developing) children when displayed pictures of 6 basic emotions (happy, sad, angry, disgusted, fearful and surprised). Tobii EyeX Controller was used to attain the gaze data and the data was processed and analyzed in MATLAB. The results revealed that children with autism look less at the core features of the face (eyes, nose and mouth) while scanning faces and have more difficulty in perceiving the correct emotion compared to the typically developing children. This atypical face scanning and lack of preference to the core features of the face can be the reason why autistic individuals have trouble understanding others' emotions and an overall incompetency in communication and social interaction. To delve more into this, further eye-tracking, neuroimaging and behavioral studies should be done in integration.},

abstract = {Self-tracking technologies are nowadays commonly used in areas like fitness or personal health. Their use in the work environment is however still under-explored. Employers do have an interest in utilizing technology to quantify different work-related factors, e.g., the use of office space, the interactions among employees, or the collective mood at work. We however advocate for a stronger focus on empowering individuals to self-track their own activities, emotions and performance at work, to reflect on the collected data and possibly use it to drive behavioral changes. In this paper, we focus in particular on empowering two specific categories of workers: teachers and students. We describe a pilot study that we ran at our institution to understand which data and data gathering tools can be used to monitor teachers' and students' emotions and engagement during lectures. We define an empirical metric, called the Emotional Shift, to assess the impact of a lecture on students emotional state. Using the data collected during our pilot study, we show how this metric can be used in practice. Finally, we discuss the limitations of our current approach and provide an outlook on our future work.},

Many students learn the content of different subjects outside the classroom by watching videos on YouTube, Vimeo, Khan Academy, and other sources. Nevertheless, exams are currently the best feedback indication of how effective the student's study session was. Physiological sensors such as electroencephalography (EEG) are accurate enough for measuring attention levels for feedback during self-learning. The traditional representation of brain data is complex for everyday users to comprehend; therefore, such graphs need to be represented in the form of static visualizations for simplicity. In this paper, we describe visualizations formulated by college students in focus groups sessions to visualize attention data for feedback after completing a learning task. These visualizations help us understand user's preference and perception for representing attention, which can be implemented in future quantified-self applications and dashboards.},

In this paper we explore how we can better utilize smart watch data analytics to further improve an individual's awareness of their cardiac health condition and use this data to potentially facilitate preventative behaviors, with the ultimate goal of this leading to the earlier detection of cardiac diseases.},

abstract = {In a world moving towards ubiquitous computing, users are increasingly confronted with a tremendous amount of information proactively provided via notifications. Today, notifications are generated by a large number of applications and services, through multiple devices and screens in the users' environment. Thus, human's attention became a significant bottleneck. Further, the latest computing trends with emerging new devices including versatile IoT devices, and contexts, such as smart cities and vehicles, further amplify the challenges. For future computing systems, "attention management", including attention representation, sensing, prediction, analysis and adaptive behavior becomes crucial. Following last year's successful UbiTtention'16 workshop with more than 40 participants, the UbiTtention 2017 workshop brings together researchers and practitioners from academy and industry to explore the managements of human attention and notifications. The workshop considers versatile devices and smart situations to overcome information overload and overchoice.},

However, what do smartphone users do when they sense a notification, such as hearing the sound or feeling the vibration before they spot it? We present a study investigating smartphone users' behavior starting from the moment when they sense a notification, including speculating the source and deciding whether and when to look at it, until they attend to it. We explore how users' behaviors vary according to the situation, what factors affect the behaviors, and in what situations users need particular help from a notification system to be better aware of and to accurately judge the source of a notification. We expect the findings will provide useful implications for the design of future notification alert system.},

We conducted an in situ field study with 32 information workers in their workplace to test if the use of blocking software can increase focus and productivity by preventing non-work-related distractions. Participants worked for five days in a baseline condition and then worked five days where online distractions were blocked with software. We discovered that with blocking software, participants assessed their productivity significantly higher and could focus significantly longer. People who benefited the most from the software were those who were most distracted by social media. Interviews revealed individual differences in self-control in managing distractions. Resultant changes in work behaviors included switching from online distractions to physical breaks of leaving the office. An unexpected consequence of cutting off distractions for people with less self-control was that they were more focused and worked longer without taking breaks and therefore, experienced higher stress. We present design recommendations to promote focus for the variety of coping behaviors we observed.},

abstract = {The human's visual attention focus usually reflects the activity and environment engaged in or simply his context in the most coherent way. The cornea, which is encasing the iris and pupil, is protected by tear fluid, and thus is a highly reflective surface. Our eyes show a reflection of what we see in our current context. We present an attempt of using corneal imaging to extract contextual information - including objects in the field of view - and the user's attention focus. Our system uses a head-mounted eye-camera, for capturing corneal reflections, connected to a RaspberryPi, to record a humans' current view and estimate his focus of attention. We conducted a 2-day experiment, where we collected data in un-instrumented real-world settings. Based on the analysis of the recordings we illustrate what kind of information can be extracted out of the corneal image reflections and outline the possibilities for in-situ notifications.},

It defines the basic idea of the system and describes the hardware and software in the background. It then shows how the vibration patterns, that are transmitted to the user via a wristband with two vibration motors, are calculated from the data points of the graph. The system is evaluated by a brief study with five participants. Based on this evaluation the paper suggests how the system can be improved, extended and applied in different fields of data representation.},

abstract = {Mobile technologies that drive just-in-time ecological momentary assessments and interventions provide an unprecedented view into user behaviors and opportunities to manage chronic conditions. The success of these methods rely on engaging the user at the appropriate moment, so as to maximize questionnaire and task completion rates. However, mobile operating systems provide little support to precisely specify the contextual conditions in which to notify and engage the user, and study designers often lack the expertise to build context-aware software themselves. To address this problem, we have developed Emu, a framework that eases the development of context-aware study applications by providing a concise and powerful interface for specifying temporal- and contextual-constraints for task notifications. In this paper we present the design of the Emu API and demonstrate its use in capturing a range of scenarios common to smartphone-based study applications.},

abstract = {Smartphones keep their users up to date by notifying them about new messages or phone calls, among others. They offer different notification types such as ringtone, vibration and LED. However, users do not always perceive incoming notifications. Within a lab study with 36 subjects we investigated the perceptibility of these notification types depending on different smartphone positions: on the table, in the trouser pocket or in the backpack. Our results show that vibration and ringtone are perceived best at all positions. There is a statistically significant difference between these types and LED which was only perceived while the phone was on the table - if perceived at all. Users felt that vibration is most pleasant than the ringtone due to habit, lower obtrusiveness, lower disturbance, and lower distraction. Qualitative feedback reveals that the habits of the user, their (social) context, and their current task also influence the suitability of the notification type. We conclude that the best solution would be an automatic notification type selection that uses mostly vibration, though ringtone for important notifications and LED for unimportant notifications or those received while being surrounded by other people.},

abstract = {Awareness about one's own cognitive state is a critical first step towards better physical, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and social health. When users are aware of their mental states - particularly those which might be detrimental to their health (e.g. high stress, low excitement) - they can take the necessary steps to either alter their behavior, or find ways to effectively cope with it. From a technology viewpoint, it is thus important to find ways to detect a user's cognitive state as unobtrusively as possible, and thereafter either inform or assist the users in coping with it. Through this position paper, we wish to discuss the potential of using mobile context data gathered from a user's smartphone to infer the user's cognitive state, and thereafter using mobile notifications to deliver timely intervention messages.},

abstract = {Embedded hardware platforms that carry sensors and actuators play a major role in many Ubicomp applications. With the advent of DIY platforms as Arduino, hardware development for embedded systems is in the reach of everybody today. These projects often build on low-fidelity systems or even prototypes and are often carried out by engineers with no strong background in electrical engineering. On the other end of the spectrum lie specialized or highly integrated platforms with much higher complexity. This paper summarizes some of the pitfalls one may encounter in both kinds of such multi-disciplinary projects and presents some general lessons that can be drawn from past experience. Lastly, we discuss the tradeoffs that come with different levels of fidelity and how user and environment may (and should) affect design decisions.},

However, the design of assistive systems for the industry is a challenging task. Once deployed, people have to work with such systems for full workdays. From experiences made during our past project motionEAP, we report on design challenges for interactive worker assistance at manual assembly workplaces as well as challenges encountered when deploying interactive assistive systems for diverse user populations.},

During the study, it was found that the stroke unit staff were not interested in their stress levels but wanted to identify stressors that they can mitigate.

Nevertheless, such technologies could support people in many mountain scenarios such as activity tracking, navigation, or emergency support. Technologies and applications for mountaineers can learn from ubiquitous computing research in many ways to provide more joyful, motivating and safer outdoor experiences.This workshop is building on the ideas and findings of the successful UbiMount '16 workshop and aims to further explore the newly established research direction of ubiquitous computing in the mountains.

abstract = {Most outdoor activities, such as alpine climbing, cycling, or hiking, require a careful route planning in advance. Today, most routing applications are single-user desktop applications. Furthermore, it is good practice to be able to do paper map based navigation during the trip as a backup. In this work, we propose ARTopos, a concept and implementation of a augmented reality (AR) 3D topographic map visualization, which combines analog paper map planning and digital routing service. It augments paper topographic maps with a digital terrain map suitable for interaction and displaying forecast information. We implemented a first prototype for which we gathered generally positive qualitative feedback as a first initial evaluation. We envision ARTopos as an interactive, collaborative tool can be used during the preliminary trip briefing for most adventurous activities.},

abstract = {Wearable sports technology such as fitness trackers or smart watches has become ubiquitous in our everyday lives, resulting in a vast collection of recorded routes. This technology now enables new forms of tracking and sharing outdoor adventures, that go beyond prosaic descriptions and photographs of the tour. Existing web mapping services and online tour diaries already allow mountaineers an improved preparation of tours but it remains still a time-consuming and cumbersome task. In this paper we introduce the concept of pioneers in outdoor activities. The proposed concept lets people define their pioneers, which are other ambitious athletes who are well known and trusted experts of the area. Using the segments of their tracks and other personal preferences (e.g. length, elevation and difficulty) a personalized route that is based on the pioneers' activities is generated and recommended to the user.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an interactive slackline assistant which features a life-size projection, skeleton tracking and real-time feedback. As in other sports, proper training leads to a faster buildup of skill and lessens the risk for injuries. We chose a set of exercises from slackline literature and implemented an interactive trainer which guides through the several exercises and gives feedback if the exercise was executed correctly. A post analysis gives the user feedback about her perfomance.},

My main research interest is to inquire how to promote socially sustainable creative life and what do we understand by good life. How to develop equal possibilities for participation in social development and carefully chosen networks, when home is in so called periphery or isolated location? How can we apply artistic thinking in society in general and especially in innovative development processes?},

abstract = {Human's vision can only operate in the limited visible band of the electromagnetic spectrum. Using commercially available imaging sensors can be beneficial to extend human's visual perception in different environments. Typically, these environments include challenging conditions, for instance smoky views during a fire or occluded, foggy, cloudy and windy view in mountain environments. Recently, thermal imaging became more commercially available, which makes utilizing it to extend the human's visual perception affordable and deployable. In this paper, we propose the usage of thermal imaging as a vision extension tool. Two initial prototypes are presented depicting the different form factors of thermal cameras attachment to Head Mounted Displays. Finally, we discuss potential use case of extending the human's vision to cover the thermal spectrum during mountains activities.},
