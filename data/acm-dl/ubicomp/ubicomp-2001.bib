abstract = {After twenty years, the "S-curve" of building out the wired internet with hundreds of millions of PCs as its end points is flattening out, with corresponding lowering of the growth rates of the major suppliers of that global infrastructure. At the same time, several new "S-curves" are reaching their steep slope as ubiquitous computing begins to sweep the planet. Leading this will be a vast expansion in heterogeneous end-points to a new wireless internet, moving IP throughout the physical world. Billions of internet connected cell phones, embedded processors, hand held devices, sensors, and actuators will lead to radical new applications in biomedicine,transportation, environmental monitoring, and interpersonal communication and collaboration. The combination of wireless LANs, the third generation of cellular phones, satellites, and the increasing use of the FCC unlicensed wireless band will cover the world with connectivity. The resulting vast increase in data streams, augmented by the advent of ass market broadband to homes and businesses, will drive the backbone of the internet to a pure optical lambda-switched network of tremendous capacity. Finally, peer-to-peer computing and storage will increasingly provide a vast untapped capability to power this emergent planetary computer.},

abstract = {Location-based information systems allow the user to access
information in relation to the user's position in geographical
space. This paper outlines navigational and social aspects of such
systems. It is argued that location-based systems must allow users
to participate as content providers in order to achieve a social
and dynamic information space. Moreover, as these systems allow
commercial and private users to annotate space with information on
a mass-scale, information filtering techniques will become
essential in order to prevent information overload and user
disturbance. We present a number of content-based and social
filtering techniques to support this. We discuss implications for
implementation and we describe a system (GeoNotes), which takes
some of these aspects into account.},

abstract = {The popularity of wireless networks has increased in recent years and is becoming a common addition to LANs. In this paper we investigate a novel use for a wireless network based on the IEEE 802.11 standard: inferring the location of a wireless client from signal quality measures. Similar work has been limited to prototype systems that rely on nearest-neighbor techniques to infer location. In this paper, we describe Nibble, a Wi-Fi location service that uses Bayesian networks to infer the location of a device. We explain the general theory behind the system and how to use the system, along with describing our experiences at a university campus building and at a research lab. We also discuss how probabilistic modeling can be applied to a diverse range of applications that use sensor data.},

abstract = {Advances in hardware are enabling the creation of small, inexpensive devices and sensors. Hundreds or thousands of these devices can be connected using low-power multi-hop wireless networks. These networks foster a new class of ubiquitous computing applications called proactive computing. In proactive applications, computing occurs in the background without requiring human interaction; humans participate to access information or to modify control policies. This paper provides an overview of the application of a large wireless network of sensors to solve everyday problems in the workplace. It describes the implementation of one application that allows people in the workplace to easily find empty conference rooms (e.g., for impromptu meetings). Drawing on this experience, we identify technical challenges and possible directions for building dense networks of sensors that enable proactive computing.},

The chief objective of ICrafter is to let users flexibly interact with the services in their environment using a variety of modalities and input devices. We extend existing service frameworks in three ways. First, to offload services and user input devices, ICrafter provides infrastructure support for UI selection, generation, and adaptation. Second, ICrafter allows UIs to be associated with service patterns for on-the-fly aggregation of services. Finally, ICrafter facilitates the design of service UIs that are portable but still reflect the context of the local environment. In addition, we also focus on the system properties such as incremental deployability and robustness that are critical for ubiquitous computing environments. We describe the goals and architecture of ICrafter, a prototype implementation that validates its design, and the key lessons learnt from our experiences.},

publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {As the proliferation of ubiquitous devices moves computation away from the conventional desktop computer boundaries, distributed systems design is being exposed to new challenges. A distributed system supporting a ubiquitous computing application must deal with a wider spectrum of hardware architectures featuring structural and functional differences, and resources limitations. Due to its architecture independent infrastructure and object-oriented programming model, the Java programming environment can support flexible solutions for addressing the diversity among these devices. Unfortunately, Java solutions are often associated with high costs in terms of resource consumption, which limits the range of devices that can benefit from this approach. In this paper, we present an architecture that deals with the cost and complexity of running Java programs by partitioning the process of Java program execution between system nodes and remote devices. The system nodes prepare a Java application for execution on a remote device by generating device-specific native code and application-specific runtime system on the fly. The resulting infrastructure provides the flexibility of a high-level programming model and the architecture independence specific to Java. At the same time the amount of resources consumed by an application on the targeted device are comparable to that of a native implementation.},

publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {In ubiquitous computing environments, multiple users work with a wide range of different devices. In many cases, users interact and collaborate using multiple heterogeneous devices at the same time. The configuration of the devices should be able to change frequently due to a highly dynamic, flexible and mobile nature of new work practices. This produces new requirements for the architecture of an appropriate software infrastructure. In this paper, an architecture designed to meet these requirements is proposed. To test its applicability, this architecture was used as the basis for the implementation of BEACH, the software infrastructure of i-LAND (the ubiquitous computing environment at GMD-IPSI). It provides the functionality for synchronous cooperation and interaction with roomware components, i.e. room elements with integrated information technology. In conclusion, our experiences with the current implementation are presented.},

However, for successful applications to emerge, it will not be the quantity but the quality and usefulness of connections that will matter. Our concern is how qualitative relations and more selective connections can be established between smart artefacts, and how users can retain control over artefact interconnection. We propose context proximity for selective artefact communication, using the context of artefacts for matchmaking. We further suggest to empower users with simple but effective means to impose the same context on a number of artefacts. To prove our point we have implemented Smart-Its Friends, small embedded devices that become connected when a user holds them together and shakes them.},

However, the majority of the research has focused on technologies to support the capture but not enough on the motivation for accessing the captured record and the impact on everyday work practices based on extended authentic use of a working capture and access system. Our long-term research agenda is to build capture services for distributed workgroups that provide appropriate motivation and further understand how access of captured meetings impacts work practices. To do this, we have developed a testbed for meeting capture as part of a larger distributed work system called TeamSpace. In this paper, we discuss the requirements for meeting capture within TeamSpace, describe the initial prototype developed, and report on initial usage.},

We illustrate the integration of the guidebook into natural conversation by showing that discourse with the electronic guidebook followed the conversational structure of storytelling. We also demonstrate that visitors coordinated object choice and physical positioning to ensure that the electronic guidebooks played a role in their conversations. Because the visitors integrated the electronic guidebooks in their existing conversations with their companions, they achieved social interactions with each other that were more fulfilling than those that occur with other presentation methods such as traditional headphone audio tours.},

Furthermore, the cell phone intrudes into other activities while hands hold it for authoring. In this paper we suggest a future alternative user interface for SMS messages based on a round wristwatch device. Two button-wheels are used to access a round hi-res color display. Text input is done with a round soft keyboard that maps intuitively to the button-wheels using the angular and radial movements of polar coordinates. Furthermore, a wristwatch device has an aesthetics that is less intrusive than a cell phone. Since the device is always deployed, authoring is easily interrupted to use the hands for other tasks. Informal user evaluation of a prototype implementation suggests that this novel round design provides an improved user experience for authoring SMS compared to cell phones.},

abstract = {It is difficult to interact with computer displays that are across the room, which can be important in meetings and when controlling computerized devices. A popular approach is to use laser pointers tracked by a camera, but interaction techniques using laser pointers tend to be imprecise, error-prone, and slow. Therefore, we have developed a new interaction style, where the laser pointer (or other pointing technique such pointing with a finger or even eye tracking) indicates the region of interest, and then the item there is copied ("snarfed") to the user's handheld device, such as a Palm or PocketPC handheld. If the content changes on the PC, the handheld?s copy will be updated as well. Interactions can be performed on the handheld using familiar direct manipulation techniques, and then the modified version is sent back to the PC. The content often must be reformatted to fit the properties of the handheld to facilitate natural interaction.},

title = {The Everywhere Displays Projector: A Device to Create Ubiquitous Graphical Interfaces},
year = {2001},
isbn = {3540426140},
publisher = {Springer-Verlag},
address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {This paper introduces the Everywhere Displays projector, a device that uses a rotating mirror to steer the light from an LCD/DLP projector onto different surfaces of an environment. Issues of brightness, oblique projection distortion, focus, obstruction, and display resolution are examined. Solutions to some of these problems are described, together with a plan to use a video camera to allow device-free interaction with the projected images. The ED-projector is a practical way to create ubiquitous graphical interfaces to access computational power and networked data. In particular, it is envisioned as an alternative to the carrying of laptops and to the installation of displays in furniture, objects, and walls. In addition, the use of ED-projectors to augment reality without the use of goggles is examined and illustrated with examples.},

abstract = {Artifacts and surfaces that can display digital content are proliferating at a steady rate. Many of these displays will be peripheral, i.e., used for content that is not directly related to one's primary activities. However, what kinds of content would people want to see on such peripheral displays? We have begun to investigate the use of peripheral displays in three workplace contexts: within an individual office (Uni-Cast), outside an individual office (OutCast) and in a common area (GroupCast).},

isbn = {3540426140},
publisher = {Springer-Verlag},

abstract = {Although ubiquitous computing hardware technology is widely available today, we believe one key factor in making ubiquitous computing useful is a framework for exploiting multiple heterogeneous displays, whether fixed or on mobile computing devices, to view and browse information. To address this issue, we propose multibrowsing. Multibrowsing is a framework that extends the information browsing metaphor of the Web across multiple displays. It does so by providing the machinery for coordinating control among a collection of Web browsers running on separate displays in a ubiquitous computing environment. The displays may be "public" (e.g. wall-sized fixed screens) or "private" (e.g. the screens of individuals' laptops or handhelds). The resulting system extends browser functionality for existing content by allowing users to move existing pages or linked information among multiple displays, and also enables the creation of new content targeted specifically for multi-display environments. Since it uses Web standards, it accommodates any device or platform already supported by the Web and leverages the vast existing body of Web content and services. We describe the design and implementation of multibrowsing and a variety of scenarios in which we have found it useful in our test bed ubiquitous computing environment.},

abstract = {As large displays become less expensive and more common throughout our working environments, we believe they will become pervasive, much as telephones were the ubiquitous communication devices of the previous generation. When large displays are coupled to an authentication device (e.g., a badge reader) and put on a network, they permit very rapid personal content access. The BlueBoard project explores the design of large displays that can be used as temporary personal access points to personalized content, yet also be used as display surfaces for small groups of people who want to easily share content between themselves. We've developed several design points that make BlueBoards simple for individual and small group use -- (1) p-cons to refer to a person for information access and exchange, (2) assuring users that information displayed on a BlueBoard is truly transient, (3) providing a basic set of tools for immediate walk-up use, and (4) giving the BlueBoard a sense of where it's located for contextually appropriate information display.},

abstract = {We investigate an important interaction that can take place in a ubiquitous computing environment, that of opportunistic browsing, a form of information gathering on the fly. Opportunistic browsing is characterised by being ubiquitous, unintentional and effortless. In this paper, we clarify the concept of opportunistic browsing and place it within a cognitive framework. We further discuss the nature of the interactions that can be triggered by the serendipitous discovery of information through opportunistic browsing and the importance of context-awareness, and we identify important research issues.},
