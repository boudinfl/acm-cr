The track was changed considerably this year with the introduction of tasks with new document collections consisting of (i) library catalog records derived from The European Library, and (ii) and non-European language data, plus a task offering the chance to test retrieval with word sense disambiguated data. The track was thus structured in three distinct streams denominated: TEL@CLEF, Persian@CLEF and Robust WSD. The results obtained for each task are presented and statistical analyses are given.},

abstract = {In this paper we will briefly describe the approaches taken by the Berkeley Cheshire Group for the Adhoc-TEL 2008 tasks (Mono and Bilingual retrieval). Since the Adhoc-TEL task is new for this year, we took the approach of using methods that have performed fairly well in other tasks. In particular, the approach this year used probabilistic text retrieval based on logistic regression and incorporating blind relevance feedback for all of the runs. All translation for bilingual tasks was performed using the LEC Power Translator PC-based MT system. This approach seems to be a fit good for the limited TEL records, since the overall results show Cheshire runs in the top five submitted runs for all languages and tasks except for Monolingual German.},

abstract = {Managing the development and delivery of multilingual electronic library services is one of the major current challenges for making digital content in Europe more accessible, usable and exploitable. Digital libraries and OPACbased traditional libraries are the most important source of reliable information used daily by scholars, researchers, knowledge workers and citizens to carry on their working (and leisure) activities. Facilitating access to multilingual document collections therefore is an important way of supporting the dissemination of knowledge and cultural content. CACAO offers an innovative approach for accessing, understanding and navigating multilingual textual content in digital libraries and OPACs, enabling European users to better exploit the available European electronic content. This paper describes the participation of the CACAO project consortium in the TEL@CLEF 2008 task and proposes a novel approach for exploiting library classification systems as a mean to drive query expansion.},

The results of the experiments show that the performance of our approach is not statistically different from the monolingual baseline in terms of mean average precision. This is an indication that association rules can be effectively used to map concepts between languages. We have also tested a modification to BM25 that aims at increasing the weight of rare terms.

Our main goal was to compare and combine the results from those retrieval engines. The translation of the topics for the cross-lingual experiments was realized with a plug-in to access the Google AJAX language API. The performance of our monolingual experiments was better than the best experiments we submitted during the evaluation campaign. Our crosslingual experiments performed very well for all target collections and achieved between 87% and 100% of the monolingual retrieval effectiveness. The combination of the results from the Lucene and the Lemur retrieval core showed very consistent performance.},

address = {Berlin, Heidelberg},
abstract = {Accessing digital libraries raises the important issue of how to deal with the multilinguality of the documents. Inside a target collection, documents can be written in very different languages and the record associated to a particular document often contains field descriptors in different languages. This paper proposes a principled way to solve this issue, by proposing a multi-language model approach to information retrieval, as well as an extension of the dictionary adaptation mechanism to cover multiple languages (including the source language). In experiments related to the TEL task of the CLEF2008 Ad-hoc track, runs based on the assumption of a purely bilingual approach, translating the query only in the official language of the collection, appeared to result in performance (mean average precision) larger or equal to the ones of the other participants. But, contrarily to our initial intuition, in the case of the TEL task, the experiments showed that exploiting information in languages different from the official language of the collection turns out to offer no advantage.},

Furthermore the effect of stemming has been experimented as a complement to this research. Our findings indicate that part of speech tags may have small influence on effectiveness of the retrieved results. However, when this information is combined with stemming it improves the accuracy of the outcomes considerably.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of the experiments conducted at the University of Bari for the Ad Hoc Robust-WSD track of the Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) 2008. The evaluation was performed using SENSE (SEmantic N-levels Search Engine), a semantic search engine that tries to overcome the limitations of the ranked keyword approach by introducing semantic levels, which integrate (and not simply replace) the lexical level represented by keywords.We show how SENSE is able to manage documents indexed at two separate levels, keyword and word meaning, in an attempt of improving the retrieval performance.Two types of experiments have been performed by exploiting both only one indexing level and all indexing levels at the same time. The experiments performed combining keywords and word meanings, extracted from the WordNet lexical database, show the promise of the idea and point out the value of our institution.In particular the results confirm our hypothesis: The combination of two indexing levels outperforms a single level. Indeed, an improvement of 35% in precision has been obtained by adopting the N-levels model with respect to the results obtained by exploiting the indexing level based only on keywords.},

Last year we used Entry Vocabulary Indexes and Thesaurus expansion approaches for DS, but found in later testing that some simple text retrieval approaches had better results than these more complex query expansion approaches. This year we decided to revisit our basic text retrieval approaches and see how they would stack up against the various expansion approaches used by other groups. The results are now in and the answer is clear, they perform pretty badly compared to other groups' approaches.All of the runs submitted were performed using the Cheshire II system. This year the Berkeley/Cheshire group submitted a total of twenty-four runs, including two for each subtask of the DS track. These include six Monolingual runs for English, German, and Russian, twelve Bilingual runs (four X2EN, four X2DE, and four X2RU), and six Multilingual runs (two EN, two DE, and two RU). The overall results include Cheshire runs in the top five participants for each task, but usually as the lowest of the five (and often fewer) groups.},

While Wikipedia has already been used in IR, the application of Wiktionary in this task is new. We evaluate two retrieval models, i.e. SR-Text and SR-Word, based on semantic relatedness by comparing their performance to a statistical model as implemented by Lucene. We refer to Wikipedia article titles and Wiktionary word entries as concepts and map query and document terms to concept vectors which are then used to compute the document relevance. In the bilingual task, we translate the English topics into the document language, i.e. German, by using machine translation. For SR-Text, we alternatively perform the translation process by using cross-language links in Wikipedia, whereby the terms are directly mapped to concept vectors in the target language. The evaluation shows that the latter approach especially improves the retrieval performance in cases where the machine translation system incorrectly translates query terms.},

Our analysis shows that when users have active competence in the target language, their success rate is 18% higher than if they do not know the language at all. If the user has passive competence of the language (i.e. can partially understand texts but cannot make queries), the success rate equals those with active competence, but at the expense of executing more interactions with the system.Finally, the usage of specific cross-language facilities (such as refining translations offered by the system) is low, but significantly higher than standard relevance feedback facilities, and is perceived as useful by searchers.},

abstract = {The QA campaign at CLEF 2008 [1], was mainly the same as that proposed last year. The results and the analyses reported by last year's participants suggested that the changes introduced in the previous campaign had led to a drop in systems' performance. So for this year's competition it has been decided to practically replicate last year's exercise. Following last year's experience some QA pairs were grouped in clusters. Every cluster was characterized by a topic (not given to participants). The questions from a cluster contained coreferences between one of them and the others. Moreover, as last year, the systems were given the possibility to search for answers in Wikipedia as document corpus beside the usual newswire collection. In addition to the main task, three additional exercises were offered, namely the Answer Validation Exercise (AVE), the Question Answering on Speech Transcriptions (QAST), which continued last year's successful pilots, together with the new Word Sense Disambiguation for Question Answering (QA-WSD). As general remark, it must be said that the main task still proved to be very challenging for participating systems. As a kind of shallow comparison with last year's results the best overall accuracy dropped significantly from 42% to 19% in the multi-lingual subtasks, but increased a little in the monolingual sub-tasks, going from 54% to 63%.},

We focus on expanding queries for questions regarding actions and events, where verbs have a central role. Two different thesaurus are used: the OpenOffice thesaurus and an automatically generated verb thesaurus. The performance of thesaurus-based methods is compared against what is obtained by (i) executing no expansion and (ii) applying a simple query generalization method. Results show that thesaurus-based approaches help improving recall at retrieval, while keeping satisfactory precision. However, we confirm that positive impact for the final QA performance is mostly achieved due to increase in recall, which can also be obtained by using simpler methods. Nevertheless, because of its better relative precision thesaurus-based expansion is effective in selectively reducing the number of irrelevant text passages retrieved, thus reducing computational load in the answer extraction stage.},

Where it regards the use of external tools, Esfinge uses a syntactic analyzer, a morphological analyzer and a named entity recognizer. This year an alternative approach to retrieve answers was tested: whereas in previous years, search patterns were used to retrieve relevant documents, this year a new type of search patterns was also used to extract the answers themselves. We also evaluated the second and third best answers returned by Esfinge. This evaluation showed that when Esfinge answers correctly a question, it does so usually with its first answer. Furthermore, the experiments revealed that the answer retrieval patterns created for this participation improve the results, but only for definition questions.},

abstract = {LogAnswer is a logic-oriented question answering system developed by the AI research group at the University of Koblenz-Landau and by the IICS at the University of Hagen. The system addresses two notorious problems of the logic-based approach: Achieving robustness and acceptable response times. Its main innovation is the use of logic for simultaneously extracting answer bindings and validating the corresponding answers. In this way the inefficiency of the classical answer extraction/answer validation pipeline is avoided. The prototype of the system, which can be tested on the web, demonstrates response times suitable for real-time querying. Robustness to gaps in the background knowledge and errors of linguistic analysis is achieved by combining the optimized deductive subsystem with shallow techniques by machine learning.},

For the Spanish subtask, we used an almost completely rebuilt version of our system, designed with the aim of flexibly combining information sources and linguistic annotators for different languages. To allow easy development for new languages, most of the modules do not make any language dependent assumptions. The language dependent knowledge is encapsulated in a rule language developed within the MIRACLE team. By the time of submitting the runs, work on the new version was still ongoing, so we consider the results as a partial test of the possibilities of the new architecture. Subsystems for other languages were not yet available, so we tried a very simple approach for the French to Spanish subtask: questions were translated to Spanish with Babylon, and the output of this translation was fed into our system. The results had an accuracy of 16% for the monolingual Spanish task and 5% for the cross-language task.},

abstract = {The German question answering (QA) system IRSAW (formerly: InSicht) participated in QA@CLEF for the fifth time. IRSAW was introduced in 2007 by integrating the deep answer producer InSicht, several shallow answer producers, and a logical validator. InSicht builds on a deep QA approach: it transforms documents to semantic representations using a parser, draws inferences on semantic representations with rules, and matches semantic representations derived from questions and documents. InSicht was improved for QA@CLEF 2008 mainly in the following two areas. The coreference resolver was trained on question series instead of newspaper texts in order to be better applicable for follow-up questions. Questions are decomposed by several methods on the level of semantic representations. On the shallow processing side, the number of answer producers was increased from two to four by adding FACT, a fact index, and SHASE, a shallow semantic network matcher. The answer validator introduced in 2007 was replaced by the faster RAVE validator designed for logic-based answer validation under time constraints. Using RAVE for merging the results of the answer producers, monolingual German runs and bilingual runs with source language English and Spanish were produced by applying the machine translation web service Promt. An error analysis shows the main problems for the precision-oriented deep answer producer InSicht and the potential offered by the recalloriented shallow answer producers.},

Throughout the paper, we describe a basic system configuration and how it is enriched by the addition of semantic constraints. Moreover, we want to apply special emphasis to the language-independent capabilities of some system components. As a result, we were able to apply our techniques over both Spanish and English corpora achieving the first and second position in the AVE ranking.},

abstract = {RAVE (Real-time Answer Validation Engine) is a logic-based answer validator/selector designed for real-time question answering. Instead of proving a hypothesis for each answer, RAVE uses logic only for checking if a considered passage supports a correct answer at all. In this way parsing of the answers is avoided, yielding low validation/selection times. Machine learning is used for assigning local validation scores based on logical and shallow features. The subsequent aggregation of these local scores strives to be robust to duplicated information in the support passages. To achieve this, the effect of aggregation is controlled by the lexical diversity of the support passages for a given answer.},

All texts were in English and the topics were supplied in German, French, and English. 30 topics were made available, ten of each of the categories visual, mixed, semantic.Most groups concentrated on fully automatic retrieval. Only three groups submitted a total of six manual or interactive runs not showing an increase of performance over automatic approaches. In previous years, multi-modal combinations were the most frequent submissions but in 2008 text only runs were clearly higher. Only very few fully visual runs were submitted and non of the fully visual runs had an extremely good performance. Part of these tendencies might be due to semantic topics and the extremely well annotated database. Best results regarding MAP were similar for textual and multi-modal approaches whereas early precision was better for some multi-modal approaches.},

We submitted eight retrieval runs taking two main approaches. The first approach combined Text-Based Image Retrieval (TBIR) and Context-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). The second approach applied query expansion using conceptual fuzzy sets (CFS). A CFS is a method that uses the expression of meaning depending on the context, which an ordinary fuzzy set does not recognize. A conceptual dictionary is necessary to perform query expansion using CFS, and this is constructed by clustering. We propose here the use of query expansion with CFS and other techniques, for image retrieval that integrates different media, and we verify the utility of the system by explaining our experimental results. This time, TBIR+CFS in the system which we proposed is selected No.1 with "Text Only" runs, and we demonstrated that question expansion with CFS produced higher search results.},

abstract = {This paper describes the participation of MIRACLE-GSI research consortium at the ImageCLEFphoto task of ImageCLEF 2008. For this campaign, the main purpose of our experiments was to evaluate different strategies for topic expansion in a pure textual retrieval context. Two approaches were used: methods based on linguistic information such as thesauri, and statistical methods that use term frequency. First a common baseline algorithm was used in all experiments to process the document collection. Then different expansion techniques are applied. For the semantic expansion, we used WordNet to expand topic terms with related terms. The statistical method consisted of expanding the topics using Agrawal's apriori algorithm. Relevance-feedback techniques were also used. Last, the result list is reranked using an implementation of k-Medoids clustering algorithm with the target number of clusters set to 20. 14 fully-automatic runs were finally submitted. MAP values achieved are on the average, comparing to other groups. However, results show a significant improvement in cluster precision (6% at CR10, 12% at CR20, for runs in English) when clustering is applied, thus proving to be valuable.},

First, in the Visual Concept Detection Task (VCDT), we look at the mutual exclusion and implication relations between VCDT concepts in order to improve the automatic image annotation by Forest of Fuzzy Decision Trees (FFDTs). Second, in the ImageCLEFphoto task, we use the FFDTs learnt in VCDT task and WordNet to improve image retrieval. Third, we apply a fast visual diversity method based on space clustering to improve the cluster recall score. This study shows that there is a clear improvement, in terms of precision or cluster recall at 20, when using the visual concepts explicitly appearing in the query and that space clustering can be effciently used to improve cluster recall.},

abstract = {This paper considers the strategies of query expansion, relevance feedback and result fusion to increase both precision and diversity in photo retrieval. In the text-based retrieval only experiments, the run with query expansion has better MAP and P20 than that without query expansion, and only has 0.85% decrease in CR20. Although relevance feedback run increases both MAP and P20, its CR20 decreases 10.18% compared with the non-feedback run. It shows that relevance feedback brings in relevant but similar images, thus diversity may be decreased. The run with both query expansion and relevance feedback is the best in the four text-based runs. Its F1-measure is 0.2791, which has 20.8% increase to the baseline model. In the content-based retrieval only experiments, the run without feedback outperforms the run with feedback. The latter has 10.84%, 9.13%, 20.46%, and 16.7% performance decrease in MAP, P20, CR20, and F1-measure. In the fusion experiment, integrating text-based and content-based retrieval not only reports more relevant images, but also more diverse ones. Its F1-measure is 0.3189.},

abstract = {DCU participated in the ImageCLEF 2008 photo retrieval task, which aimed to evaluate diversity in Image Retrieval, submitting runs for both the English and Random language annotation conditions. Our approaches used text-based and image-based retrieval to give baseline runs, with the the highest-ranked images from these baseline runs clustered using K-Means clustering of the text annotations, with representative images from each cluster ranked for the final submission. For random language annotations, we compared results from translated runs with untranslated runs. Our results show that combining image and text outperforms text alone and image alone, both for general retrieval performance and for diversity. Our baseline image and text runs give our best overall balance between retrieval and diversity; indeed, our baseline text and image run was the 2nd best automatic run for ImageCLEF 2008 Photographic Retrieval task. We found that clustering consistently gives a large improvement in diversity performance over the baseline, unclustered results, while degrading retrieval performance. Pseudo relevance feedback consistently improved retrieval, but always at the cost of diversity. We also found that the diversity of untranslated random runs was quite close to that of translated random runs, indicating that for this dataset at least, if diversity is our main concern it may not be necessary to translate the image annotations.},

Using 45 dimensions Profile Entropy visual Features, we show for the 39 topics of the imageCLEF08 web image retrieval clustering campaign on 20K IAPR images, that the Cluster-Recall (CR) after AP is 13% better than the baseline without clustering, while the Precision stays almost the same. Moreover, CR and Precision without clustering are altered by Kmeans. We finally discuss that some high-level topics require text information for good CR, and that more discriminant visual features would also allow Precision enhancement after AP.},

The experimental results showed that one type of visual concept representation dominated the other except under one condition. Also, it was found that hierarchical clustering can enhance instance recall while preserving the precision when the threshold parameters are appropriately set. In contrast, partitioning clustering degraded the results. We also categorized the queries into geographical and non-geographical, and found that the geographical queries are relatively easy in terms of the precision of retrieval results and post-retrieval clustering also works better for them.},

The former formulation consists of expanding manual annotations with labels generated by automatic annotation methods. Experimental results show that the performance of text-based methods can be improved with this strategy, specially, for visual topics; motivating further research in several directions. The second approach consists of combining the outputs of diverse image retrieval models based on different information. Experimental results show that competitive performance, in both retrieval and results diversification, can be obtained with this simple strategy. It is interesting that, contrary to previous work, the best results of the fusion were obtained by assigning a high weight to visual methods. Furthermore, a probabilistic modeling approach to result-diversification is proposed; experimental results reveal that some modifications are needed to achieve satisfactory results with this method.},

We tackled the problem on two fronts: (1) we introduced a further integration strategy using SVM as an opinion maker; (2) we enriched the poorly populated classes adding virtual examples. We submitted several runs considering different combinations of the proposed techniques. The run jointly using the feature concatenation, the confidence-based opinion fusion and the virtual examples ranked first among all submissions.},

abstract = {This paper describes the work of the LIG for ImageCLEF 2008. For ImageCLEFPhoto, two non diversified runs (text only and text + image), and two diversified runs were officially submitted. We add in this paper results on image only runs. The text retrieval part is based on a language model of Information Retrieval, and the image part uses RGB histograms. Text+image results are obtained by late fusion, by merging text and image results. We tested three strategies for promoting diversity using date/location or visual features. Diversification on image only runs does not perform well. Diversification on image and text+image outperforms non diversified runs. In a second part, this paper describes the runs and results obtained by the LIG at ImageCLEFmed 2008. This contribution incorporates knowledge in the language modeling approach to information retrieval (IR) through the graph modeling approach proposed in [4]. Our model makes use of the textual part of the corpus and of the medical knowledge found in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) knowledge sources. And the model is extended to combine different graph detection methods on queries and documents. The results show that detection combination improves the performances.},

abstract = {This article describes the participation of the MedGIFT research group at the 2008 ImageCLEFmed image retrieval benchmark. We concentrated on the two tasks concerning medical imaging. The visual information analysis is mainly based on the GNU Image Finding Tool (GIFT). Other information such as textual information and aspect ratio were integrated to improve our results. The main techniques are similar to past years, with tuning a few parameters to improve results.For the visual tasks it becomes clear that the baseline GIFT runs do not have the same performance as some more sophisticated and more modern techniques. GIFT can be seen as a baseline for the visual retrieval as it has been used for the past five years in ImageCLEF. Due to time constraints not all optimizations could be performed and no relevance feedback was used, one of the strong points of GIFT. Still, a clear difference in performance can be observed depending on the various optimizations applied, and the difference with the best groups is smaller than in past years.},

The main goal of our participation this year is to evaluate different text-based topic expansion approaches: methods based on linguistic information such as thesauri or knowledge bases, and statistical techniques based mainly on term frequency. First a common baseline algorithm is used to process the document collection: text extraction, medical-vocabulary recognition, tokenization, conversion to lowercase, filtering, stemming and indexing and retrieval. Then different expansion techniques are applied. For the semantic expansion, the MeSH concept hierarchy using UMLS entities as basic root elements was used. The statistical method expanded the topics using the apriori algorithm. Relevance-feedback techniques were also used.},

In image validation, the modifications to the main function are verified so as to ensure that the new function is better than the preceding one. Finally, the image retrieval process is performed according to the ImageCLEFmed rules, fully described in [2, 5].

We compared document expansion using both. From a baseline of 0.136 for Mean Average Precision (MAP), we reached a MAP of respectively 0.176 (+29%) with the first method, and 0.154 (+13%) with the second. In-depth analyses show how both strategies were beneficial, as they covered different aspects of the image. Finally, we combined them in order to produce a significantly better run (0.254 MAP, +86%). Combining the MeSH terms using both methods gives hence a better representation of the images, in order to perform document expansion.},

In addition to the textual index of annotations, supervised machine learning techniques using visual features were used to classify the images based on image acquisition modality. Our system provides the user with a number of search options including the ability to limit their search by modality, UMLS-based query expansion, and Natural Language Processing-based techniques. Purely textual runs as well as mixed runs using the purported modality were submitted. We also submitted interactive runs using user specified search options. Although the use of the UMLS metathesaurus increased our recall, our system is geared towards early precision. Consequently, many of our multimodal automatic runs using the custom parser as well as interactive runs had high early precision including the highest P10 and P30 among the official runs. Our runs also performed well using the bpref metric, a measure that is more robust in the case of incomplete judgments.},

In addition, a distance measure based on texture features is used. In 2008, the baseline classifier yields error scores of 170.34 and 182.77 for k = 1 and k = 5 when the full code is reported, which corresponds to error rates of 51.3% and 52.8% for 1-NN and 5-NN, respectively. Judging the relative increases of the number of classes and the error rates over the years, MAAT 2008 is estimated to be the most difficult in the four years.},

The first one consists of using image names explicitly: we computed a similarity score between the query and the name of images using the vector space model. The second one consists of combining results obtained using the textual content of documents and results obtained using the first method. Finally, in our last approach, image names are used less explicitly: we proposed to use all the textual content of image annotations, but we increased the weight of terms in the image name. Results show that the image name can be an interesting factor to improve image retrieval results.},

To tackle this issue, we propose a reformulation method that reduces the influence of noisy image annotations. We extract a ranked list of related concepts for terms in the query from WordNet and Wikipedia, and use them to expand the initial query. Then some visual concepts are used to re-rank the results for queries containing, explicitly or implicitly, visual cues. First evaluations on a diversified corpus of 150000 images were convincing since the proposed system was ranked 4th and 2nd at the WikipediaMM task of the ImageCLEF 2008 campaign [1].},

The main purpose was twofold: 1) to compare these approaches to determine their impact on performance retrieval and 2) to compare results from these experiments with the results generated in the first set of experiments to determine whether query expansion and the presence or absence of diacritic marks have an impact on performance retrieval. The stopword list provided by Terrier was used to index all the collections. We removed diacritic marks from the topics and collections for German and Portuguese before indexing and retrieval. Topics were processed automatically and the query tags specified were the title and the description. Query expansion was included using the 20 top ranked documents and 40 terms. These parameters were selected arbitrarily. Results show that the DFR InL2 model outperformed language modeling for all the languages. Results of the new experiments with query expansion show an improvement in performance retrieval for all the languages. They also suggest that removing diacritic marks may also have an impact in the case of German and Portuguese.},

The experiments results show that: 1) our online geographic coordinates extraction and clustering algorithm is useful for the type of locations that do not have clear corresponding coordinates; 2) the expansion based on the geo-locations generated by GCEC is effective in improving geographic retrieval; 3) Wikipedia can help in finding the coordinates for many geo-locations, but its usage for query expansion still needs further study; 4) query expansion based on title only obtained better results than that on the title and narrative parts, even though the latter contains more related geographic information. Further study is needed for this part.},

abstract = {This paper describes the participation of GIRSA at Geo-CLEF 2008, the geographic information retrieval task at CLEF. GIRSA combines information retrieval (IR) on geographically annotated data and question answering (QA) employing query decomposition.For the monolingual German experiments, several parameter settings were varied: using a single index or separate indexes for content and geographic annotation, using complex term weighting, adding location names from the topic narrative, and merging results from IR and QA, which yields the highest mean average precision (0.2608 MAP).For bilingual experiments, English and Portuguese topics were translated via the web services Applied Language Solutions, Google Translate, and Promt Online Translator. For both source languages, Google Translate seems to return the best translations. For English (Portuguese) topics, 60.2% (80.0%) of the maximum MAP for monolingual German experiments, or 0.1571 MAP (0.2085 MAP), is achieved.As a post-official experiment, translations of English topics were analysed with a parser. The results were employed to select the best translation for topic titles and descriptions. The corresponding retrieval experiment achieved 69.7% of the MAP of the best monolingual experiment.},

The proposed result fusion method takes as input the document lists returned by the different systems and returns a document list where the documents are ranked according to the fuzzy Borda voting scheme. The obtained results show that the fusion method allows to improve the results of the component systems, although the fusion is not optimal, because it is effective only if the components return a similar set of relevant documents.},

abstract = {The VideoCLEF track, introduced in 2008, aims to develop and evaluate tasks related to analysis of and access to multilingual multimedia content. In its first year, VideoCLEF piloted the Vid2RSS task, whose main subtask was the classification of dual language video (Dutch-language television content featuring English-speaking experts and studio guests). The task offered two additional discretionary subtasks: feed translation and automatic keyframe extraction. Task participants were supplied with Dutch archival metadata, Dutch speech transcripts, English speech transcripts and ten thematic category labels, which they were required to assign to the test set videos. The videos were grouped by class label into topic-based RSS-feeds, displaying title, description and keyframe for each video.Five groups participated in the 2008 VideoCLEF track. Participants were required to collect their own training data; both Wikipedia and general web content were used. Groups deployed various classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes and k-NN) or treated the problem as an information retrieval task. Both the Dutch speech transcripts and the archival metadata performed well as sources of indexing features, but no group succeeded in exploiting combinations of feature sources to significantly enhance performance. A small scale fluency/adequacy evaluation of the translation task output revealed the translation to be of sufficient quality to make it valuable to a non-Dutch speaking English speaker. For keyframe extraction, the strategy chosen was to select the keyframe from the shot with the most representative speech transcript content. The automatically selected shots were shown, with a small user study, to be competitive with manually selected shots. Future years of VideoCLEF will aim to expand the corpus and the class label list, as well as to extend the track to additional tasks.},

Our system for the first task is composed of two main blocks: the core system knowledge base and the set of operational elements that are needed to classify the speech transcripts of the topic episodes and generate the output in RSS format. For the second task, our approach is based on the assumption that the most representative fragment (shot) of each episode is the one with the lowest distance to the whole episode, considering a vector space model. In the classification task, our runs ranked 3rd (out of 6 participants) in terms of precision.},

The goal of the challenge was to evaluate unsupervised algorithms that provide morpheme analyses for words in different languages. For morphologically complex languages, such as Finnish, Turkish and Arabic, morpheme analysis is particularly important for lexical modeling of words in speech recognition, information retrieval and machine translation. The evaluation in Morpho Challenge competitions consisted of both a linguistic and an application oriented performance analysis. In addition to the Finnish, Turkish, German and English evaluations performed in Morpho Challenge 2007, the competition this year had an additional evaluation for Arabic. The results in linguistic evaluation in 2008 show that although the level of precision and recall varies substantially between the tasks in different languages, the best methods seem to deal quite well with all languages involved. The results in information retrieval evaluation indicate that the morpheme analysis has a significant effect in all the tested languages (Finnish, English and German). The best unsupervised and language-independent morpheme analysis methods can also rival the best language-dependent word normalization methods.

New treatment of prefixes is the main innovation in comparison to [1]. After filtering out spurious hypotheses, the list of morphemes is applied to segment input words.
