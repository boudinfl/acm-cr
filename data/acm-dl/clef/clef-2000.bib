Twentytwo participating systems used topics (test questions) in one language to retrieve documents written in English, French, German, and Italian. A large-scale multilingual test collection has been built and a new technique for building such a collection in a distributed manner was devised.},

abstract = {Language resources such as machine dictionaries and lexical databases, aligned parallel corpora or even complete machine translation systems are essential in Cross-Language Text Retrieval (CLTR), although not standard tools for the Information Retrieval task in general.

Our discussion is based on a survey conducted on the CLEF participants, as well as the descriptions of their systems that can be found in the present volume. We also discuss how the usefulness of the CLEF evaluation campaign could be enhanced by including additional tasks which would make it possible to distinguish between the effect on the results of the resources used by the participating systems, on the one hand, and the retrieval strategies employed, on the other.},

abstract = {The problem of finding documents that are written in a language that the searcher cannot read is perhaps the most challenging application of Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) technology. The first Cross-Language Evaluation Forum (CLEF) provided an excellent venue for assessing the performance of automated CLIR techniques, but little is known about how searchers and systems might interact to achieve better cross-language search results than automated systems alone can provide. This paper explores the question of how interactive approaches to CLIR might be evaluated, suggesting an initial focus on evaluation of interactive document selection. Important evaluation issues are identified, the structure of an interactive CLEF evaluation is proposed, and the key research communities that could be brought together by such an evaluation are introduced.},

However, CLIR is now sufficiently mature to broaden the investigation to consider some new challenges. Two interesting further areas of investigation are the user experience of accessingin formation from retrieved documents in CLIR, and the extension of existing research to cross-language methods for multimedia retrieval.},

In this paper, the CLIR component - Mpro-IR - which is presented has been developed as the core module of a multilingual information system in a legal domain. This component uses not only the lexical base form for indexing but also derivational information and, for German, information about the decomposition of compounds. This information is provided by a sophisticated morpho-syntactic analyser and is exploited not only for query translation but also for query expansion as well as the search and the document ranking. The objective of the CLEF evaluation was to assess this linguistic based retrieval approach in an unrestricted domain. The focus of the investigation was on how derivation and decomposition can contribute to improve the recall.},

Results indicate that competitive performance can be achieved using four-stage backoff translation in conjunction with freely available bilingual dictionaries, but that the the usefulness of the statistical stemming algorithms that were tried varies considerably across the three languages to which they were applied.},

These models are combined in query translation. Our goal in this series of experiments is to test if the parallel web pages can be used effectively to translate queries in multilingual IR. In particular, we compare models trained on Web documents with models that also combine other resources such as dictionaries. Our results show that the models trained on the parallel web pages can achieve reasonable CLIR performance.

This method seeks to automatically extract topical information from request sentences written in one of the source languages and to create a target language query, based on translations given by a translation dictionary. We paid particular attention to morphology, compound words and query structure. we tested this approach in the bilingual track of CLEF. All the source languages are compound languages, i.e., languages rich in compound words. A compound word refers to a multi-word expression where the component words are written together. Because source language request words may appear in various inflected forms not included in a translation dictionary, morphological normalization was used to aid dictionary translation. The query resulting from this process may be structured according to the translation alternatives of each source language word or remain as an unstructured word list.},

Direct dictionary translation of a query introduces considerable ambiguity that damages retrieval, an average precision 79% below monolingual in this research. Transitive translation introduces more ambiguity, giving results worse than 88% below direct translation. We have shown that lexical triangulation between two transitive translations can eliminate much of the additional ambiguity introduced by transitive translation.},
