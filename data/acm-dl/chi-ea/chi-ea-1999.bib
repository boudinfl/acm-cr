abstract = {Electronic products are being introduced at an increasingly rapid rate into our schools, workplaces, and daily living environments. Rather than taking the form of standard desktop systems, however, many of these new technologies are small mobile systems which are intended to be used in a wide variety environments. This is calling for the development of new more flexible interface strategies which can be used at various times in eyes free, hands free, silent and noisy situations and environments. In addition, the ability for people with disabilities to be able to access and use these products is an increasingly important issue which also calls for the development of flexible user selectable input and display approaches. Proposed is a package of interface techniques called "EZ Access™." Together, these techniques provide users with the ability to operate in a wide range of environments and situations. They similarly are able to accommodate individuals with a wide range of abilities or constraints. The strategies have been designed so that they are flexible enough to be applied to a wide range of products from cellular phones to ATMs to pocket computers, to microwave ovens.},

Fluid links provide additional information at a link source, termed a gloss, to support readers in choosing among links and understanding the structure of a hypertext. Fluid links present glosses in a convenient location that does not obscure the content or layout of source material. The technique uses perceptually-based animation to provide a natural and lightweight feeling to readers. Fluid links provide a novel hypertext navigation paradigm that blurs the boundary between source and destination: computed glosses supply a "bring from" approach to hypertext, while multi-way links and nested glosses allow readers to skip through intermediate nodes while still attending to their original source context.},

abstract = {Advanced Multimedia Oriented Retrieval Engine (AMORE) [2] is a World-Wide Web image retrieval engine integrating several techniques to facilitate effective retrieval of images from the Web. With the explosive growth of information that is available through the WWW, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the users to find the information of interest. Therefore, search engines are becoming very popular and useful. However, most of the popular search engines today are textual. Although most Web pages have images, the current image search engines on the WWW are primitive.For traditional text retrieval the only way to search for relevant documents is by specifying keywords. However, for multimedia retrieval it is essential that the user is provided with various options for retrieving the target image. AMORE allows the user to retrieve images of interest using various techniques.The effectiveness of an information retrieval engine is also dependent on the user interface to show the retrieved images. In AMORE, the retrieved images are shown using thumbnails. Like traditional WWW search engines the user can browse through pages of results. We also allow the user to click on an interesting thumbnail and retrieve similar images. This visual navigation strategy is helpful in quickly retrieving the target images. To help the user if many images are retrieved we have also developed a Query Result Visualization Environment. This interface allows the search results to be organized in various ways. We believe that the integration of information retrieval with visualization is helpful for the user's retrieval tasks.},

Physical office tools such as pens, erasers, books, and paper were seamlessly integrated (or at least almost seamlessly!) with computational augmentation and virtual tools, using projection and image processing. His work, and now our most recent efforts (reported in this paper and [1, 3, 5]), are directed at more seamlessly bridging the gulf between physical and virtual worlds; an area which we believe represents a key future path for the design of user interfaces. A goal of this work is to seamlessly blend the affordances and strengths of physically manipulatable objects with virtual environments or artifacts, thereby leveraging the particular strengths of each.The goal of this video is to visually present scenarios of a number of working physical prototypes we have designed and built which computationally augment everyday objects to support casual interaction using natural manipulations. Unlike previous work [2, 4, 8, 9], we have tried to build invisible interfaces that have little reliance on specialized single-user environments and/or display projection, or custom-designed objects. To this end, we start with everyday objects and embed computation in them in the ubiquitous computing tradition founded at PARC [6, 7]. We have combined four technologies (RFID identifier tags and readers, RF networking, infrared beacons, and portable computing) in a seamless and tightly integrated way. This combination has not been discussed in the literature and is only now being experimented with in research labs working on user interface design.},

A goal of these efforts is to seamlessly blend the affordances and strengths of physically manipulatable objects with virtual environments or artifacts, thereby leveraging the particular strengths of each. This approach allows us to break free of indirectly manipulating tiny representations trapped within a computer display by leveraging form factor, physical motor skills, and naturalistic associations.Our work is distinguished from previous work in that we are not exploring separate input devices, but rather we employ sensor technologies to make the physical artifact become the input device. In other words we are investigating situations in which the physical manipulations are directly integrated with the device or artifact that is being controlled. We consider these user interfaces to be physically embodied. Our approach has been to experiment with various form factors of several handheld devices, implement some commonly used functions, such as navigation, and iterate on the resulting prototypes.This video shows three implementations of manipulative user interfaces on PDAs to support three simple real world tasks - navigation through long sequential lists, navigation within a book or document by pages, and document annotation. In addition to the three tasks, this document describes a fourth implementation not shown in the video - navigation within a book by "chunks" or by relative location.},

Are normal good design methods enough to ensure that a product will work for this population? If not, is it worth the extra effort?},

abstract = {A few years ago Hollywood and the music industry discovered the Internet and realized, much to their horror, that the technology now exists to make arbitrary numbers of perfect copies of a digitized object. As a result, we have seen an explosion of legislative and treaty proposals. Legislation was recently passed that attempts to protect intellectual property on the Net by outlawing some devices and technologies that can be used to "circumvent" measures restricting access. This legislation has several bad features, among them the unintended side effect of making some legitimate computer security research illegal. It could even criminalize some techniques that are required to correct Y2K problems. Both the legislation that is passed and the manner in which technology is implemented will have a major impact on the rights and responsibilities of creators and users of intellectual property. How will copyright he impacted? What will happen to user rights of fair use and first sale? Are we moving from copyright protection of books and magazines on the net to contract law, and if so, what are the potential repercussions? Will free libraries become a thing of the past, to be replaced by pay-per-view?The manner in which these questions are resolved will have a significant impact on our society.},

State Transition Diagrams (STDs) provide a notation for the expression of required behaviour at the initial design stage. STDs can also be used to inform the design of classes within a three (application, presentation and translation) layer architecture; can also be used to validate the behaviour of the completed artefact and used to derive usability metrics.},

abstract = {Field data gathering techniques such as Contextual Inquiry enable a design team to gather the detailed data they need. These techniques produce enormous amounts of information on how the customers of a system work. This creates a new problem--how to represent all this detail in a coherent, comprehensible form, which can be a suitable basis for design. An affinity diagram effectively shows the scope of the customer problem, but is less effective at capturing and coherently representing the details of how people work. Design teams need a way to organize this detail so they can use it in their own development process.In this tutorial we present our latest methods for representing detailed information about work practice and using these representations to drive system design. These methods have been adopted over the last few years by major product development and information systems organizations. We show how to represent the work of individual users in models, how to generalize these to describe a whole market or department, and how to use these to drive innovative design. We present the process by which we build and use the models and practice key steps. We show how these methods fit into the overall design process, and summarize Contextual Design, which gathers field data and uses it to drive design through a well-defined series of steps.The tutorial is appropriate for those who have used field techniques, especially Contextual Inquiry, and would like to put more structure on the process of using field data.We use shopping as our example of work practice throughout this tutorial, since shopping is simple and understood by everyone. We encourage participants to go grocery shopping shortly before the tutorial, and bring any shopping list they may have used, their store receipt, and a drawing of the store layout and their movement through it.},

Donis DondisThough Donis Dondis (A Primer of Visual Literacy) wrote this statement in 1973, it has never been more true than today. Our world is one of non-stop messages and images. As we rapidly create and use tools that allow us to deliver more messages and images faster, we have not taken enough time to understand the implications. We make countless decisions every day based on our perception and interpretation of these things, yet we are unaware of what, why and how we respond to visual imagery. This kind of understanding, however, can give us the potential to deliver efficient, effective messages consistent with the intended meaning.The problem is that no one has given us a greater ability to use and understand all this new information. In our rush to use enticing new tools, we have forgotten our goal: that this is all about quality communication.We need to step back and evaluate this visual chaos; learn to see, not just look; learn and understand what the basic principles are to create quality communication as well as the implications of our choices.

Groups will rotate through the three workshops, so that each participant has experience with each of the three methods. The participants will then compare and contrast their experiences in a plenary discussion, moderated by the instructors. In our closing section, we will compare these practices with other, related practices (e.g., [1,2]), locate these practices in a larger space of participatory methods (per a recent survey chapter by two of the instructors in the new Handbook of HCI [6]), and discuss how participants can adapt the methods to meet their own needs.},

Which movie should I go to? Which restaurant would I like? The experience of friends and colleagues is a valuable resource for making such decisions, especially friends who are familiar with the subject area and have similar tastes.The field of recommender systems (or collaborative filtering) attempts to automate this process, e.g., by supporting people in making recommendations, finding a set of people who are likely to provide good recommendations for a given person, or deriving recommendations from implicit behavior such as browsing activity, buying patterns, and time on task.},

abstract = {Usability testing methods have not changed significantly since the origins of the practice. Usability studies typically address human performance at a readily observable task-level, including measures like time to complete a task, percentage of participants succeeding, type and number of errors, and subjective ratings of ease of use [3]. Certain types of questions are difficult to answer efficiently with these techniques. Imagine, for example, that we observe users spending longer than expected looking at a particular dialog of a software application or web page without making the appropriate selection to complete the task. Participants often have difficulty reporting their behavior and the experimenter is clueless about what went wrong. Is it because the user is overlooking the control? Is the user distracted by another element in the interface -- perhaps an animated graphic? Is the user seeing the control, but failing to comprehend its meaning? Different answers to these questions would clearly lead to different recommendations. If overlooking the control is a problem, increasing its salience is appropriate. If confusion of the control's function is a problem, changing the graphic or text label may be appropriate. If distraction is a problem, decreasing the salience of other stimuli may help. Without answers to these questions, design recommendations have to be implemented by trial and error. Recording the fixation pattern of the participant's eyes can offer additional information to help answer these questions. While this concept is not new, it has been confined primarily to military aircraft cockpit issues [2,4]. Only recently has eye tracking technology advanced to make it practical in the broader usability community. Usability studies of human-computer systems that have included eye tracking, e.g., [1] are beginning to show benefits of these techniques. However, important challenges remain.},

Yet a strange convergence is taking place between the roles of programmers and end-users. Professional programmers are now end users of complex IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) similar to tools for non-programmers. On the other end of the scale, end users of major applications are gradually eased into real programming by extensive customization, macro recorders, "wizards", and GUI builders. In between are the informally-trained software professionals we call "blended-user programmers" who configure computers and networks, control industrial machines, and build active Web pages and business applications. Like conventional programmers, they are paid to program full-time, and develop skills in a variety of tools. Like end-users, their knowledge is applied and experimental rather than theoretical. Many started as end users, but moved into these software careers instead of becoming "gurus" or "gardeners" [1] who help other users.},

abstract = {Software agents which communicate and collaborate with users to perform complex tasks constitute a new paradigm for human-computer interaction complementing existing graphical interfaces. We have recently completed a prototype agent of this kind for helping people with their email, based on our studies of people working with human assistants and Wizard-of-Oz studies. The prototype was constructed using application-independent software for modeling collaborative discourse (Collagen, see [4]) jointly developed by Lotus and Mitsubishi Electric and speech understanding technology from IBM Research. Users perform typical email tasks via a flexible combination of spoken language conversation with the agent and graphical interface actions (which are observed by the agent). The agent maintains a model of the user's goals and activities, and can act on its own initiative to assist the user. Having a high-level model of actions and goals allows speech to be used in a more natural, conversational, and effective manner than otherwise possible.},

The SIT Book uses electric field sensors located in the book binding to sense the reader's casual book handling and fingering of the page; these sensors control the ambient audio.

The interface is based on : (1) a mapping of the graphical HTML document into a 3D virtual sound space environment, where non-speech auditory cues differentiate HTML elements; (2) the transcription into sound not only of text, but also of images; (3) the use of a touch-sensitive screen to facilitate user interaction. Moreover, in order to validate the sonification model of the images, we have created an audio "memory game", that can be used as a pedagogical tool to help blind pupils learn spatial exploration cues.},

abstract = {A human-computer interaction (HCI) agent was designed and built to support users in their ability to recover from negative emotional states, particularly frustration. The agent uses social-affective feedback strategies delivered to the user with text-only interaction. The agent's effectiveness was evaluated against two control conditions: (1) user's emotions were ignored, and (2) users were able to report problems and "vent" their feelings and thoughts to the computer. Behavioral results showed that the agent was significantly more effective than the control conditions in helping relieve frustration levels.},

In the proposed method, each agent has a specific viewpoint and interactively points at the contents that the user will be interested in.

The prototype uses piezoelectric sensors hidden in a visor extension to a pair of glasses, providing for compactness, user control, and anonymity. On users who received no training or feedback, the glasses initially performed at 94% accuracy in detecting an expression, and at 74% accuracy in recognizing whether the expression was confusion or interest. Significant improvement beyond these numbers appears to be possible with extended use, and with-a small amount of feedback (letting the user see the output of the system).},

abstract = {Two cognitive modeling efforts (EPIC &amp; ACT-R) have proposed computational models of a simple menu selection task involving searching for a single digit in an unordered, pull down menu. This paper presents an empirical study which extends the menu selection task in two dimensions (distance between menu items and whether the items are digits or words). Each of these manipulations should make a difference in selection time according to one of the models but not the other. An analysis of response times reveals that both factors produce significant differences in the direction predicted by the cognitive models. The magnitude of these differences, however, are smaller than predicted (7% for distance and only 3% for word vs. digit). Implications for future modeling of visual attention is briefly addressed.},

The goal of this study was to assess the benefits of secondary navigation controls in terms of user success with and user preference for the controls in the context of a software wizard. Thirty participants across three IBM sites tested prototypes of wizards with secondary navigation controls. We found that study participants were more successful with and preferred the table of contents secondary navigation control, participants continued to rely on the Back and Next buttons for navigation in the wizard, and participants preferred a secondary navigation control to having no secondary navigation control in a wizard.},

abstract = {We describe a low-cost distributed method for associating web pages with physical objects, thus making the objects act as physical bookmarks to the World Wide Web. By doing this, we can inherit the physical properties of the objects, such as persistency and availability. The system utilizes stickers with pre-printed barcodes -- WebStickers -- to associate URLs with physical objects. Users can return to a desired web page by scanning the barcode attached to an object. The associations are stored in a networked server, making it easy to move and share physical bookmarks between users. Preliminary evaluations show that the system is easy to use, even for novice users.},

abstract = {SIGCHI.NL, the local chapter of SIGCHI in the Netherlands, decided at its first conference in January 1998 that most, if not all, communication to and between members should take place electronically. This also meant that the website should play a vital role in supporting the local HCI community in Holland. The newly appointed website committee was given the tough job of building the 'perfect' website for an opiniated audience of 500 usability experts.The website committee soon learned that in this case 'designing by committee' didn't prove effective enough. A 'surgical team' of two members was formed, joined by a member of the board to generate enough momentum to build the site in just a few months time.Despite the fact that the site had to be designed and built in the scarce free hours of its members, the surgical team managed to introduce the new website at the second SIGCHI.NL conference on September 7th, 1998.The website (http://sigchi.nl) was well received by the members and is visited by approximately 40 people per day with only mouth-to-mouth (or better: mail-to-mail) promotion.Here is what we feel worked good when we designed and built the website• Rapid (online) prototyping to quickly get feedback from all of the committees of SIGCHI.NL• The surgical team did the 'cutting' while other members gave comments and support• Community support = adding 'real' interactivity to a website• Frequent updates: at this moment 4-6 updates a monthSoon to be introduced are password-protected area's for internal reports and documentation and a password-protected update system, where committees can change pages when necessary, meanwhile enforcing the necessary layout and navigational guidelines.},

The perspective of the user has not been given as much attention. It is often assumed that users will appreciate the fact that all their messages are handled by a single institution, and are presented in a uniform way. We do not believe that this is necessarily the case, and we want to explore this issue based on several scenarios.},

abstract = {The number of Internet users and goods sold over the Internet is increasing rapidly. To keep this momentum user interfaces for electronic shops have to adapt to and anticipate the changing needs of buyers and merchants on the Internet. A CHI98 workshop on future interfaces for e-commerce [1] confirmed that electronic product catalogs are a a rapidly evolving area where advanced HCI techniques can play an important role in the creation of successful product catalogs.Only recently these catalogs have started to evolve from a static set of inter-linked web-pages into dynamic interfaces that better exploit the possibilities of the computational and networked medium. There are a number of driving forces for this development:• Increased competition between catalog operators makes it important to design catalogs in such a way that they attract customers, keep customers exploring, and make customers return.• Marketing new types of products requires new types of interfaces. For example selling complex products electronically will require additional support for buyers to make them confident in their choice.• The increased number of products, product options, product reviews, and supplier evaluations create the challenge of organizing this information in a way that is useful for the needs of individual buyers.• With the increased number of Internet users, new classes of buyers with very different needs and expectations become apparent. For example, a catalog that wants to attract shoppers that mainly come for entertainment will be different from a catalog that wants to attract bargain hunters. Some of these buyers might also be interested in new ways of buying like auctions and request-for-proposals, that were traditionally only available for professionals.A number of HCI techniques have been applied to electronic product catalogs. Among them direct manipulation, information visualization, personalization, user modeling, and anthropomorphic interface agents.The goal of this SIG is to deepen the understanding of the challenges that have to be approached by electronic product catalogs, collect information about prototypical systems, and to share experiences gained with applying HCI techniques to improve electronic product catalogs.},

Today's on-line/distance education usability professional is in a desert of information hiding. This is caused by the facts that these professionals primarily work in other domains and the recent advent of this area has not provided a great deal of practical knowledge that the professional can draw upon.It must therefore follow that there are not a large number of resources that the usability professional has access to, either on the Internet (such as a research report from a University or research consortium) or through other, more traditional means, of information distribution (books or journals). The method of information "passing" is akin to oral histories: passed along by word of mouth.

abstract = {With the growing interest in human-computer interfaces that use natural language in some way, researchers and practitioners who work on these interfaces are finding that two general fields of research, CHI and natural language processing (NLP), are complementary and converging. In the CHI research community, there have been investigations on a number of related issues such as usability of text and graphics in on-line documentation, hypertext, spoken-dialogue interfaces, and language/audio resources. In the NLP research community, there is increasing interest in use of natural language, both spoken and written, in intelligent multimodal and multimedia interfaces, e.g., International Symposium on Spoken Dialogue (ISSD-96), COOP 98 Workshop on The Use of Herbert H. Clark's Models of Language Use for the Design of Cooperative Systems, 1998 AAAI Workshop on Representations for Multi-Modal Human-Computer Interaction, and Coling-ACL'98 Workshop on Content Visualizations and Intermedia Representations (CVIR'98).Some technical issues of possible interest to both communities are:1. For what and under what conditions is NL effective in the human-computer interface? For what types of tasks or communication? How does modality influence its effectiveness? How does its effectiveness in computer media differ from that in traditional forms of communication such as face-to-face conversation and print media? How do performance limitations of NLP technologies (e.g., .speech recognition errors) influence effectiveness?2. What are the critical technical requirements for NLP to be effective in the human-computer interface, e.g., coordination of generated text and graphics, incremental and robust interpretation, and modeling turn-taking and initiative in dialogue? What technical requirements arise in transferring technology developed for one language to systems for users of another language (e.g., languages using different writing systems)? How should effectiveness of NLP technologies be evaluated?},

Use cases are related to scenarios, which have a long history of application to computer-human interaction [2], but may offer distinct advantages. A use case comprises a single case of use of a system that is complete, well-defined, and meaningful from the perspective of an external user [5,8]. Concrete instances of multiple use cases can be combined into plausible sequences to form the narrative vignettes usually associated with scenario-based design, but because use cases are a finer-grained formal construct at a higher level of abstraction, they lend themselves to more rigorous definition and more systematic and structured expression. The structured narratives of use cases can be interrelated through formally defined constructs [6,8] to form a comprehensive model of the tasks to be supported by a system under design.},

However, differences in cultures, languages, and traditions, make real international collaboration a very challenging endeavor.Some differences among international research communities were originally identified in CHI '97 (Boy and Novick, 1997): language, style for writing and reviewing papers, economic disparities, lack of awareness, among others. We believe that, one way to foster international cooperation is to create "cultural clusters," that is, groups that share similar culture, problems and other characteristics.},

abstract = {Web design is still primarily an artistic endeavor. However, we are beginning to see empirical research results that tell us what pitfalls to avoid in order to create successful websites.In this SIG, we will discuss the latest research results available. Individuals designing websites can share successful strategies, and discuss questions still unanswered.This SIG also will be a forum for researchers to discuss methods and share objectives. Researchers will have an opportunity to interact with website designers to understand the research still required to identify the keys to successful design.Following the session, we intend to consolidate the discussion into a 4-to-5 page summary and send it to all participants.},

abstract = {The purpose of this Special Interest Group (SIG) session is to share lessons learned about using automated logging techniques to collect data for evaluating collaborative (multi-user) systems. Automated logging techniques are frequently used in evaluating the human-computer interaction of single-user systems. There has been much less experience in using logging techniques for evaluating collaborative systems. We will discuss logging to collect data that are useful for evaluating collaborative systems.},
