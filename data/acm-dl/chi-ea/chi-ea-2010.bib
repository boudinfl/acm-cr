Designing such interfaces raises challenges and often requires multiple iterations. While we are generally prompt to discard more hard-to-use interfaces and smooth out usability issues, we want to raise here the issue of their potential benefits. We de-scribe two cases in which we observed potential bene-fits from introducing barriers for collaborating and communicating with others. We attempt to shed a new light on interfaces with usability "problems" and how these problems may benefit system efficiency and user experience. We end with a discussion of the pros and cons of making systems harder for people to use, and how to integrate this perspective in the design process.},

An alternate model of 'interdisciplinarity' offers one way forward, but calls for clarity on the question of what interaction design aspires to be. We offer the notion of 'disciplined transdisciplinarity' as an exciting and perhaps necessary way of solving the complex problems that ID researchers face, and illustrate this with examples drawn from the area of emotional design and assessment. Our bridge between 3rd paradigm, knowledge production and what we are calling 'disciplined transdisciplinary' yields insights into the path toward institutionalizing and legitimating research on ID and academic careers in this field in the university.},

Working with Adaptive Mouse, all users have to do is to hold it with preferred hand gestures, then through the use of their fore and middle fingers the correct button functions will intuitively be triggered. Users can also freely move the mouse and always get accurate cursor feedbacks. This "intuitive holds then clicks" action creates sense of "magic", and the mouse shape with minimum visual clues not only lowers mental loads but also achieves the goal of simplicity design.},

Yet, we know little about attribution practices in online creative collaboration and the technologies that shape them. This paper describes a study of online collaborative animation projects, focused on the practices surrounding integration and attribution. We found that both tasks are closely related and often completed by a single person, a process we call "cr-editing." We also identify frustrations with existing practices and systems and propose design considerations for alleviating them. Our findings offer insights into the growing space of online remixing, mashups, and creativity.},

We discuss implications for designing interfaces that encourage personal conservation, and identify environmental policy making as an area ripe for new CHI activity. Finally, we suggest that sustainability has the potential to move from the periphery of CHI research and become a galvanizing force for the community at large.},

After identifying preferences and value orientations in different cultures from a series of user studies, this research tries to form a theoretical base for understanding local cultures and designing different user experiences for people from different cultures. The goal of this research is to explore cost-effective strategies for developing multiple versions of user interfaces and services for different cultures, perhaps through cultural templates or through special versioning tools.},

abstract = {Electronic documents such as PDFs are becoming increasingly popular as we move further towards the notion of the paperless office. The harsh truth however is that e-documents differ greatly from their physical paper counterparts, with many users opting to print them before reading. This paper describes several novel implementations that utilize a technique known as 'lightweight interaction'; a term that describes activities that can be performed without excessive cognitive attention. Incorporating tools into digital document readers to aid users in day-to-day tasks will enhance their performance and hopefully increase user uptake of digital reading. My research on this topic centers on several areas of document navigation, focusing specifically on current physical (paper) practices, in order to enhance their digital equivalents.},

abstract = {Computing supports a number of activities across the lifespan, from interactive games for children to smart homes for seniors. However, one part of the lifespan which is often overlooked by application designers is the end of life - a period marked by issues of mortality, dying, and death. My thesis takes up this area as its object of study, and does so specifically by examining the bereaved as a target population. I argue that most modern technologies are not designed with proper acknowledgement of the eventual death of their users, and that this oversight results in a series of circumstances which complicate affairs for bereaved family members. Based on evidence from a survey and interview study, I identify opportunities for technology designers to support bereavement activities through a process called "thanatosensitive design." My thesis seeks to contribute methodological insights for designing for the end of the lifespan, a novel system which connects bereaved individuals together, and account of how this system mediates social support.},

This interdisciplinary design study works at the intersection of social media and cultural heritage in the crisis context using a variant method called "social media probes."

abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) tags containing privacy-sensitive information are increasingly embedded into personal documents (e.g., passports and driver's licenses). The problem is that people are often unaware of the security and privacy risks associated with RFID, likely because the technology remains largely invisible and uncontrollable for the individual. To mitigate this problem, we developed a collection of novel yet simple and inexpensive alternative tag designs to make RFID visible and controllable. This video and demonstration illustrates these designs. For awareness, our tags provide visual, audible, or tactile feedback when in the range of an RFID reader. For control, people can allow or disallow access to the information on the tag by how they touch, orient, move, press, or illuminate the tag (for example, Figure 1 shows a tilt-sensitive RFID tag).},

The system is based on the idea of relating spatial representations to sound. The shapes are predefined and the user has no access to any visual information. The user interacts with the system using a universal pointer device, as a mouse or a pen tablet, or the touch screen of a mobile device. While exploring the space using the pointer device, sound is generated, which pitch and intensity vary according to a strategy. Sounds are related to spatial representation, so the user has a sound perception of shapes and gestures. They can be easily followed with the pointer device, using the sound as only reference.},

The model human cochlea (MHC) is the sensory substitution system that drives the Emoti-Chair. Music can be experienced as a tactile modality, revealing vibrations that originate from different instruments and sounds spanning the audio frequency spectrum along multiple points of the body. The system uses eight separate audio-tactile channels to deliver sound to the body, and provides an opportunity to experience a broad range of musical elements as physical vibrations.},

The question that this technology can help us to explore is how our interaction with mobile phones in everyday life could change, once devices were able to actively change the way we hold them in our hands.Various levels of interaction are proposed: Balancing based on angular tilt and counter-balancing of button-clicks, and, for a future implementation, balancing, supported through grasp recognition. We report a user study that assessed in how much such a system may help users to balance the a device equipped with the proposed system. It concludes that actuated balancing may be helpful in mobile interactions, but that it needs to be designed carefully.},

abstract = {Working with communities around social change presents a challenge to common HCI methods, as politics often comes to the fore. In some cases, the politics of a community are explicit, for example, when working with activists or advocacy groups. In other cases, political aspects are less explicit but surface in considering the allocation of resources or in groups wherein issues of race, gender or class are of major importance. To address these dynamics, HCI researchers have to go beyond traditional HCI tools and metrics, which too often bracket out the political in an effort to focus on the instrumental issues and uses of technology. This panel juxtaposes several community-based HCI research projects in which politics have been a significant factor and asks "How do we address the},

abstract = {Design practitioners know that part of their job is to create products and services with usability in mind. Making products and services learnable, efficient and pleasant to use are certainly goals, but every designer dreams of creating something more - something so great that people crave it, long for it, must have it. Marketers call it "a must have", "compelling", or "insanely great". But most of the rest of us just call it Cool.Over the past several decades, Cool has evolved into a marketing imperative. And so Cool has become like an overarching requirement for many designs, especially in the consumer product space. But Cool is hard to pin down - there's no accepted way to define it, measure it, or design for it. Like glamour, it is an ineffable yet powerful quality that depends on a host of subtle factors. This SIG creates a forum to go beyond "you know Cool when you see it", collecting and collating a number of concrete examples of Cool and identifying patterns and design principles underlying Cool.},

abstract = {Cars have become complex interactive systems. Mechanical controls and electrical systems are transformed to the digital realm. It is common that drivers operate a vehicle and, at the same time, interact with a variety of devices and applications. Texting while driving, looking up an address for the navigation system, and taking a phone call are just some common examples that add value for the driver, but also increase the risk of driving. Novel interaction technologies create many opportunities for designing useful and attractive in-car user interfaces. With technologies that assist the user in driving, such as assistive cruise control and lane keeping, the user interface is essential to the way people perceive the driving experience. New means for user interface development and interaction design are required as the number of factors influencing the design space for automotive user interfaces is increasing. In comparison to other domains, a trial and error approach while the product is already in the market is not acceptable as the cost of failure may be fatal. User interface design in the automotive domain is relevant across many areas ranging from primary driving control, to assisted functions, to navigation, information services, entertainment and games.},

abstract = {We present a new affective interaction technique, called CheekTouch, by combining tactile feedback, delivered through the cheek, and multi-finger input, while speaking on the mobile phone. We designed a prototype by using a multi-touch mobile device and a 4x3 vibrotactile display device. We identified six affective touch behaviors (pinching, stroking, patting, slapping, kissing and tickling) that can be exchanged through one another's cheeks while speaking on the phone. We mapped the affective touch behaviors on tactile feedback expressions of the vibrotactile display. Results of a preliminary user study suggest that our technique is positively evaluated by the participants and applicable to intimate and emotional communication.},

abstract = {Telecare is a term that covers a range of products and services that use new technology to enable people to live with greater independence and safety in their own homes. This paper considers the need for design development of a mainstream telecare product called a personal trigger, which provides a means of summoning assistance when help is needed. It is provided as part of a community alarm service and should be worn at all times for continuous protection. The discussion is based on key findings from a survey of 1,324 service users in North East Scotland with a 60% response rate. Telecare technology is often unattractive because the emphasis is on producing a functional, rather than a desirable product. We argue that the telecare industry needs to consider the social and emotional aspects of design as well as function, even though many of today's service users find the current design acceptable. The survey findings can be incorporated into future product designs.},

In this paper, we present a novel tagging framework based on the theory of emergent semantics to assist the user in the tag selection process. Our idea is to enrich the current "looking at" experience of tagging with the "looking for" experience of searching.

Here, we report on two studies aimed at determining how best to render the important concept of an unavailable menu item. In Study 1, 23 undergraduates navigated a Microsoft Word-like auditory menu with a mix of available and unavailable items. For unavailable items, using whisper was favored over attenuated voice or saying "unavailable". In Study 2, 26 undergraduates navigated a novel auditory menu. With practice, whispering unavailable items was more effective than skipping unavailable items. Results are discussed in terms of acoustic theory and cognitive menu selection theory.},

With our research we investigate new interaction techniques that aim to make it easier to interact with these systems while driving. In contrast to the standard approach of combining all functions into hierarchical menus controlled by a multifunctional controller or a touch screen we suggest to utilize the space on the steering wheel as additional interaction surface. In this paper we show the design challenges that arise for multi-touch interaction on a steering wheel. In particular we investigate how to deal with input and output while driving and hence rotating the wheel. We describe the details of a functional prototype of a multi-touch steering wheel that is based on FTIR and a projector, which was built to explore experimentally the user experience created. In an initial study with 12 participants we show that the approach has a general utility and that people can use gestures for controlling applications intuitively but have difficulties to imagine gestures to select applications.},

In addition to the requirements set by the screen size, also data entry method, interaction style and mobile context related issues need to be taken into account when designing questionnaires for mobile devices.},

abstract = {Trouble-spotting is a newly-invented video method for capturing everyday HCI experiences. The method borrows qualities from scenarios and photo elicitation, allowing images and narration to be captured, appropriated, and post-processed into a narrated sequence of photographs, called a photoshow. In a pilot project which focused on four participants' problematic experiences with business processes, participants created four trouble-spotting photoshows, varying in length from 33 seconds to 13:16 minutes, containing useful and actionable firsthand accounts. In this paper, Trouble-spotting is introduced along with insights gained from the pilot project and directions for future work.},

We suggest that sustainable HCI research could become more relevant by developing evaluations that link to understandings of sustainability beyond HCI, and more 'scientific' by developing more systematic evaluations, while acknowledging that many ways of knowing play important roles in both sustainability and HCI.

abstract = {UI designers use a variety of prototyping tools, from paper and pencil sketching, to drag-and-drop mock-up tools (e.g., Balsamiq Mockups), to sophisticated suites of modeling tools and toolkits (e.g., iRise or dijit, the dojo GUI toolkit ). Many projects would benefit from quickly analyzing prototypes at an early stage without the effort of bringing in users for empirical tests. Most analysis tools, however (e.g., AutoCWW [1], Bloodhound [2], and CogTool [4]), require prototypes to be in their own format, which forces the designer to re-do the prototypes in order to analyze them. Our work is a step toward allowing the CogTool analysis tools to import from many different prototyping tools, so designers will have a path to quick usability analysis without changing the way they currently express their preliminary designs.},

We propose a novel concept that is based on an inner Core for the basic technical and software platform of a product and an outer Shell that builds a flexible and ex-changeable tangible user interface from passive components. Using vision-based tracking, we can realize a clear separation between the components. No wiring is necessary.

Capturing this information normally requires eye tracking equipment, which until now has limited the use of gaze-based feedback to the laboratory. While previous research has reported a correlation between mouse movement and gaze position, we are not aware of previous work on automatically inferring searcher's gaze position from mouse movement or similar interface interactions. In this paper, we report the first results on automatically inferring whether the searcher's gaze position is coordinated with the mouse position - a crucial step towards predicting the searcher gaze position from the computer mouse movements.},

We have compared the task process and outcome of participants interacting over an environment analogous to common commodity solutions, those using face-to-face communication, and groups communicating over GColl. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to design a group-to-group collaboration environment with modest technical requirements and low overall cost that still shows measurable advantages over the common environment in its ability to support trust in social dilemma games.},

abstract = {In television shows, we are familiar with the sound of artificial laughter, the so called "canned laughter" or "laugh track". It generally has an enhancing effect on the viewer's desire to laugh. However, if the sound is played when the user dislikes the content, it works negatively. To cope with this problem, we propose a system that produces the laugh track synchronized with the user's desire to laugh. We use a use a myoelectric signal from the diaphragmatic muscle to detect an initial laugh, and dolls around the user to produce the laugh sound. We speculated that although the initial laugh trigger from the user is necessary, the system can still effectively enhance the laugh activity, and even affect the subjective quality of the contents.},

abstract = {Authentication through passwords in public spaces (such as in ATMs) is susceptible to simple observation attacks, such as shoulder surfing, which can result in the password being compromised and ultimately the exposure of users to fraud and theft. Haptic technology, which can present information non-visually to users, offers a potential solution to this problem through the creation of tactile passwords. Situated in this space, this paper presents the design and initial evaluation of a novel haptic device, the haptic wheel, which displays tactons, or structured tactile messages, to enable password entry. It describes this device and the tactile passwords it supports in detail before presenting two short user studies. The results of these reveal that the chosen tactons are easily identifiable and that password entry times are significantly improved compared to previous systems based on haptic authentication.},

In this paper we report on a large survey (300 school children, 85 teachers) that was carried out in Panama to assess the status quo of technology use, as well as the initial ideas of the potential of using mobile phones in the context of school education. Results show that there is a high proliferation of mobile phones among school children, and that teachers and pupils were all able to envision using mobile phones for learning purposes. The results indicate that mobile devices have the potential to integrate into existing learning contexts, as well as enable new learning contexts.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compare users' interaction with the humanoid robot ASIMO and the dog-shaped robot AIBO. We conducted a user study in which the participants had to teach object names and simple commands and give feedback to either AIBO or ASIMO. We did not find significant differences in the users' evaluation of both robots and in the way commands were given to the two different robots. However, the way of giving positive and negative feedback differed significantly: We found that for the pet-robot AIBO users tend to give reward in a similar way as giving reward to a real dog by touching it and commenting on its performance by uttering feedback like "well done" or "that was right". For the humanoid ASIMO, users did not use touch as a reward and rather used personal expressions like "thank you" to give positive feedback to the robot.},

Users draw UI sketches on paper (similar to a paper prototype) as the initial step in an evolutionary UI development process to speed up the development of the application and to minimize the text input effort.},

This paper presents a methodology for real-time eye gaze tracking using a standard webcam without the need for hardware modification or special placement. An artificial neural network was employed to estimate the location of the user's gaze based on an image of the user's eye, mimicking the way that humans determine where another person is looking. Accuracy measurements and usability experiments were performed using a laptop computer with a webcam built into the screen. The results show this approach to be promising for the development of usable eye tracking systems using standard webcams, particularly those built into many laptop computers.},

Results show that this lockout period can reduce sequence errors by up to 64%.

We primarily aimed at exploring ways to promote interactants' self-disclosure while securing their visual anonymity, timely nonverbal feedback of virtual humans, when interactants anticipate future interaction. The research examined interactants' self-disclosure through measuring their verbal behaviors. The preliminary findings indicated that interactants revealed greater intimate information about themselves in interactions with virtual humans than with real humans. However, interactants' AFI did not affect their self-disclosure, which does not correspond to the results of previous studies using text based interfaces.},

We present an experimental car-simulator study with 28 users, in which the in-car HMI was systematically manipulated with regard to representation of the outside world. The results show that perceived safety is significantly higher with 1:1 realistic views than with conventional schematic styles, despite higher visual complexity. Furthermore, we found that the more demanding the safety recommendation on the HMI, the more realistic visualization are perceived as a valuable support.},

This research utilizes data from 34,514 survey respondents from users of the social media site, myYearbook. Results show that those more engaged with multiple social media platforms are more willing to share opinions, seek opinions, and act on these opinions. However, there were statistically significant differences among users of myYearbook, MySpace, Facebook, and Twitter. Findings show that the reported demographic differences and social network service chosen have an effect on behaviors. These results have implications for businesses and others interested in advertising on these platforms, and researchers interested in investigating these populations.},

We also report on a design project case study to show how the method can be used and how the method impacts user feedback on a design project case study. The results show that the method helped develop diverse viewpoints and make a positive impact on getting more valuable user feedback.

We investigate aggregate usage of the search engine, such as number of users, queries, and terms. We also investigate the structure of queries and terms submitted by these users. The results are compared to Web searching on traditional search engines. Results show that 60% of the traffic comes from the engine's application program interface, indicating that real time search is heavily leveraged by other applications. Of the queries, 30% were unique (used only once in the entire dataset). The most frequent query accounted for 0.003% of the query set. Less than 8% of the terms were unique. The most frequently used terms accounted for only 0.03% of the total terms. Concerning search topics, the most used terms dealt with technology, entertainment, and politics, reflecting both the temporal nature of the queries and, perhaps, an early adopter user-based. Sexual queries were quite low, relative to traditional Web search. Searchers of real time content often repeat queries overtime, perhaps indicating long term interest in a topic. We discuss the implications for search engines and information providers as real time content increasingly enters the main stream.},

abstract = {Human performance models based on information foraging theory have proved capable of predicting navigation behavior on the Web. They can therefore provide a useful tool for Web site design. They may also be effective for modeling auditory navigation within a single Web page. Designers often struggle to accommodate this sort of access, different as it is from their own experience. As a step toward realistic simulations based on models of auditory Web access, we describe information seeking strategies observed in people with visual impairment using screen reading software for Web navigation tasks. We outline one example strategy for approaching a new Web page that, guided by information foraging theory, may expose access barriers that current design tools miss.},

The most important functionalities of the music player are derived from a user study. Design sketches for the augmentation shown on the phone's display are collected from 10 participants.

abstract = {As the first phase of a two-phase project, the International Usability Partners (IUP; http://www.international-usability-partners.com/) conducted a study in nine different countries to identify cultural similarities and differences in the use of gestures on small, handheld, touchscreen user interfaces. A total of 340 participants in the study were asked to define their own gestures for 28 common actions like "zoom" and "copy" on a custom-constructed gesture recorder that simulated a handheld touchscreen device. Actions were described pictorially by showing participants a "before" screen and an "after" screen to clarify the exact context for each action.Initial analysis suggests four primary findings. The first is that there is generally a high level of agreement across cultures. One exception, however, is the use of symbolic gestures; Chinese participants created significantly (p &lt; .01) more symbolic gestures (e.g. letters, question mark, check mark) than participants from other countries. The second finding is that experience with gesture-enabled devices influenced the gestures that participants created for the following actions: back, forward, scroll up, and scroll down. The third finding is that when a gesture to elicit an action was not immediately identifiable, participants generally tapped on the screen to bring up a menu. The final finding is that there is higher agreement on actions that can be performed through direct manipulation and lower agreement scores on actions that are more symbolic in nature.Phase two of this research effort will be to present the most common three to five user-defined gestures for each action to a large number of participants and ask them to select the gesture that they believe to be the most intuitive gesture for that action.},

Several methods such as diaries, experience sampling and questionnaires have been used for collecting data on user experience with a product. Although these methods provide valuable data, they may lack obtaining rich descriptions of UX in users' everyday lives. We have approached the question of UX evaluation by experience reports which are open-ended experience stories written by the users after using their products in real contexts of use. In this paper, we describe a field study in which 21 participants wrote 116 experience reports about UX with their personal products such as smart phones and MP3 players. The reports were analyzed with predefined context and experience categorizations to identify core experiences. We discuss our initial findings on the applicability of the method to evaluate UX.},

abstract = {Strategies for meeting people online are often based on appearance or demographics, criteria that do not guarantee quality connections or long-lasting relationships. Drawing from prior work in ambiguity and affective interaction, pixSmix is a conceptual design to facilitate human connection through visual expression and interpretation. Participants create mosaics formed from a dozen public images, co-creating meaning with those who view and interact with the social artifact. To explore the validity and dynamics of this process, we gathered feedback using a paper prototype and a task-oriented focus group. The early outcomes support the notion of ambiguous design as an engaging creative activity and, through sharing of new social artifacts, as rewarding reflective experience.},

abstract = {New media interfaces offer a wide variety of modalities for interacting with systems. While typing and clicking remain the staple of most interfaces, several other modalities have emerged in recent years, enabling users to perform a range of other actions, such as dragging, sliding, zooming-in/out, mousing-over and flipping through a revolving carousel of images (as in cover flow). While each modality offers a unique way of interacting with information, it is not clear whether it brings unique psychological advantages. Does a drag engender greater user engagement? Is the mouse-over likely to enhance user's perceptual bandwidth? A scientific assessment of such effects is impossible with existing interfaces given the confounded nature of modality combinations and information provided by them. Therefore, we designed six Web interface prototypes with identical content, differing only in modality, for experimentally isolating the effects of each, using a between-subjects design. Ongoing data collection involves both physiological and psychological measures of perceptual bandwidth and engagement.},

It is capable of defining layout behavior for non-graph-like visual languages like Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams or GUI forms as well as graph-like visual languages such as class diagrams, mindmaps, or business process models. In this paper, we demonstrate that the combination of graph drawing algorithms and other layout algorithms is meaningful by presenting three visual language editors that have been created by students.},

We seek to create a new application for computer music interfaces by augmenting, rather than replacing, acoustic instruments. Starting with an acoustic grand piano, an optical keyboard scanner measures the continuous position of every key while electromagnetic actuators directly induce the strings to vibration. Unlike the traditional piano, the performer is given the ability to continuously modulate the sound of each note, resulting in a new creative vocabulary. Ongoing work explores the creation of intelligent mappings from sensed user input to acoustic control parameters which build on the existing musical intuition of trained pianists, creating a hybrid acoustic-electronic instrument that offers new expressive dimensions for human performers.},

For this regard, a set of haptic morphs are introduced that can be used as building blocks to create new sensations on the skin. A novel haptic sensation, haptic blur, is also introduced that gives an illusion of continuous motion across the skin using discrete vibrating points.

We use electromagnetic trackers and a 3-sided CAVE to present virtual space-themed stimuli to the user, who must use physical movements to avoid collisions and gain points. We can use Astrojumper not only to motivate exercise, but to evaluate the different ways people with and without autism interact with an exercise tool.

Based on the interaction analysis, we have found that the human guide selects the appropriate answerer by distributing his/her gaze towards visitors and observing visitors' gaze responses during the pre-question phase. Then, we performed the experiments that a robot distributed its gaze towards visitors to select an answerer and analyzed visitors' responses. From the experiments, we have found that the visitors who are asked questions by the robot feel embarrassed when they have no prior knowledge about the questions and the visitor's gaze before and during the question play an important role to avoid being asked questions. Based on these findings we have developed a function for a guide robot to select the answerer by observing visitors' gaze responses.},

abstract = {Sketch recognition is the automated recognition of hand drawn diagrams. Military course-of-action (COA) diagrams are used to depict battle scenarios. The domain of military course of action diagrams is particularly interesting because it includes tens of thousands of different geometric shapes, complete with many additional textual and designator modifiers. Existing sketch recognition systems recognize on the order of at most 20 different shapes. Our sketch recognition interface recognizes 485 different freely drawn military course-of-action diagram symbols in real time, with each shape containing its own elaborate set of text labels and other variations. We are able to do this by combining multiple recognition techniques in a single system. When the variations (not allowable by other systems) are factored in, our system is several orders of magnitude larger than the next biggest system. On 5,900 hand-drawn symbols drawn by 8 researchers, the system achieves an accuracy of 90% when considering the top 3 interpretations and requiring every aspect of the shape (variations, text, symbol, location, orientation) to be correct.},

abstract = {We have recently witnessed a tremendous increase in popularity and growth of online social networks. Social support and family involvement can play an important supportive role in health management. An increasing number of family members are establishing online social networking relationships with their families. This trend poses new research questions on effectively accommodating family members in online social networks. Family members themselves often have very different requirements based on their gender and family role. There is little research on the design of family-oriented social networking applications. In order to fill this research gap and investigate the impact of social and family relationships in online social networks, we are developing a healthy living online social application to support families in adopting healthy lifestyles. This paper reports the findings of a user study aimed at understanding gender- and role-based characteristics and differences in family-based healthy living social networks. The study shows that female users play a major role in leading the usage of the social technology; parents remain conscious of and concerned about their family's health as they interact with the social technology; and the social technology should support fun, especially for children.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a two-handed 3D interaction approach for immersive virtual reality applications on a large vertical display. The proposed interaction scheme is based on hybrid motion sensing technology that tracks the 3D position and orientation of multiple handheld devices. More specifically, the devices have embedded ultrasonic and inertial sensors to accurately identify their position and attitude in the air. The interaction architecture is designed for pointing and object manipulation tasks. Since the sensor system guarantees 3D spatial information only, we develop an algorithm to exactly track the position of interest produced by the pointing task. For the object manipulation, we have carefully assigned one-handed and two-handed interaction schemes for each task. One-handed interaction includes selection and translation while rotation and scaling are assigned for the two-handed interaction. By combining one-handed and two-handed interactions, we believe that the presented system provide users with more intuitive and natural interaction for 3D object manipulation. The feasibility and validity of the proposed method are validated through user tests.},

In the first study, we found that participants are willing to disclose more to the robot when the robot moved its neck in an expressive manner.

To seamlessly integrate the added control input with existing practices for ordinary computer keyboards, the redefined notion of virtual modifier keys is introduced. A number of application examples are given, especially to point out a potential for simplifying existing interactions by replacing modifier key combinations with single key presses. Also, a new class of interaction scenarios employing the technique is proposed, based on an interaction model named "What You Touch Is What You Get (WYTIWYG)". Here, the proposed tactile input method is used to navigate interaction options, get full previews of potential outcomes, and then either commit to one or abort altogether -- all in the space of one key depress / release cycle. The results of user testing indicate some remaining implementation issues, as well as that the technique can be learned within about a quarter of an hour of hands-on operating practice time.},

The method measures human physiology in a contact-free manner and therefore, is suitable for continuous monitoring. We conducted two experiments to analyze the validity of our method. Experiment-1 focused on driver's cognitive distraction by allowing cell phone talking while driving. Experiment-2 focused on driver's visual distraction by allowing texting while driving. The experimental results from 11 participants illustrate that the facial physiology alters in a measurable amount in both kinds of distraction. The proposed method quantifies this physiological change and detects periods of distractions. Ultimately, this information can be utilized to alert the drivers in real time. Participants' performance analysis confirms validity of the proposed method.},

A first user study revealed that CGP's unique use of eye tracking required special techniques to improve gaze precision.

For walking, a methodology has been developed that translates accelerometer values from peripheral body locations to equivalent readings on the waist and from there to metabolic units. For running, the limitation of iPhone to perform accurate metabolic measurements is documented.

abstract = {We propose the concept of shape memory alloy motion display (SMD), a new type of physical display, and introduce a plant-shaped robot "Himawari" based on this technology. SMD is a display apparatus taking advantage of existence of an actual object, and gives visual expressions by movement and change in shape of actuators, which are components of this device. Visual expressions resembling tentacles of sea anemone and foliage of grasses and trees are possible by designing the actuators, making way for new expressions by physical display. We built the plant-shaped robot Himawari as a piece of art applying SMD technology. We discuss the possibilities of SMD through fabrication of the completed piece of art, Himawari.},

We report the results of a study of the mobile-social practices of students who use such devices, and the ways in which hierarchical relationships between students and professors were affected by the use of smart-mobile devices. The common premise is that because such devices enable continuous interaction, students are constantly using social networking and communication applications on the go, across different types of relationships. Our study shows that in hierarchy-based interaction mobile-social communication is more limited than could be expected. Social norms and usability issues both played a part in shaping students' mobile-social practices, resulting in "selective participation" - as students carefully crafted their mobile interaction to maintain hierarchical distance.},

To test this theory, we designed and piloted an experience sampling study in which participants used a simulated reactive access control system for a week. Preliminary results suggest a neutral to positive response to using this kind of system and indicate that reactive policy creation may help meet users' need for dynamic, contextual policy decisions.},

Social connectedness is considered to be the momentary experience of belongingness and relatedness with others. Particular user groups may benefit from support in social connectedness, such as elderly or divorced parents and their children. Several research projects have made efforts to support social connectedness. However, there have been few formal studies into the factors affecting connectedness. Also, the way in which social connectedness has been measured in studies to date is diverse and often not grounded in psychological theory. This shows a need for more elaborate investigation in how social connectedness can be measured, what types of content could be shared between users, and which interactions should be provided by a system, when aiming for social connectedness. This should lead to guidelines and an ontology of elements to help and inspire designers of social connectedness systems.},

As our technology pervades our cultures, we find that the digital is increasingly intersecting with these practices.

It is increasingly important to design "thanatosensitive" technologies which support death-centric practices such as collaborative acts of remembrance, bequeathing of digital data, or group reflection on the digital residua of a life. This workshop will bring together participants interested in such technologies and their implications. Potential topics include, but are not limited to: devices for reflection and meaning-making across multiple lifespans; interdisciplinary practices surrounding mortality, dying, and death; technology heirlooms; digital rights management; and methodological approaches to researching end-of-life technology issues.},

This context determines the utility of an application, but good user experience (UX) with business applications is only achieved if the software supports the fulfillment of users' goals and needs. This article presents the efforts realized in a call-center of a German telephone company aimed at enhancing UX and hence creating a positive influence on the emotional state of the users/employees. It describes a method applied for the elicitation of user needs as well as ideas for improving UX. Beyond that, the results indicate that software properties can influence the emotional state of the user if they support the fulfillment of human needs and thus positively affect the achievement of business goals.},

abstract = {This case study describes how Cisco followed a "Rapid Experimentation" methodology in conducting iterative, high velocity pilot studies to inform a large global customer service experience design project. The research findings described in this case study informed the design of a better mechanism for customers to select their expected outcomes, so Cisco can provide a personalized service experience. This improved accuracy moves us closer to our goal of eliminating at least 5% of all re-routing of service requests. In addition, customer satisfaction improves as we approach our target of reducing average Time-To-Resolution by at least 5%, which also saves on the Cost-Per-Call for Cisco.The case study explains how these studies improved the direction of the design concept and narrowed the research focus to answer more specific design questions. It summarizes how this approach was successfully applied in the customer service experience design situation to achieve the same experience design goal in 8 weeks, 4 weeks ahead of the 12 week schedule. We also describe lessons learned in applying the "Rapid Experimentation" methodology.},

Those that have, such as the graphical user interface (GUI), can provide valuable lessons. When we were challenged to develop a new natural user interface design for Microsoft Surface, we drew from these lessons and from modern user research techniques. A prominent starting point resulting from this was using metaphors to develop the new user interface. We used metaphors for two reasons: To create a user interface world that was understandable and predictable for our users, and to guide the design team in creating the detailed user interface design. We continued this practice in the user research: We focused on which metaphors worked best in the studies, and learned if users understood the metaphors we were using and which metaphor they preferred. This case study describes the process we followed, and the lessons we learned from this.},

The high domain knowledge barrier makes it difficult for a person who is outside this field to imagine the user experience, and the globally distributed core drilling community imposes more design constraints in space and time. In addition to activities proposed in prior literatures, we used the "immersive empathic design" approach of having a computer scientist trained as a junior core technician. Through in-situ observation and interview evaluations from on-going expeditions, we present the system and the lesson learned in the process. It makes the best use of precious co-located opportunities. It allows the developer to build up domain knowledge efficiently. It establishes a trust relationship between the developer and scientists. The system designed through this approach formed a sustainable foundation that was adapted in the following design iterations. This process allows the software developer to experience authentic user activities. The designed system is innovative and helps scientists solving real-world problems. This approach can be a useful example to HCI practitioners who work with potential users or communities that share similar properties.},

abstract = {Our research explored factors that impacted the use of wikis as a tool to support the dissemination of knowledge within an enterprise. Although we primarily talked to a population of wiki contributors and readers, we discovered two major factors which contributed to staff's unwillingness to share information on a wiki under certain circumstances. First, we uncovered a reluctance to share specific information due to a perceived extra cost, the nature of the information, the desire to share only "finished" content, and sensitivities to the openness of the sharing environment. Second, we discovered a heavy reliance on other, non-wiki tools based on a variety of factors including work practice, lack of guidelines, and cultural sensitivities. Our findings have several implications for how an enterprise may more fully reap the benefits of wiki technology. These include implementation of incentive structures, support for dynamic access control, documenting clear guidelines and policies, and making wikis more usable.},

abstract = {In large enterprises different teams work on different parts of a big software application. Therefore, retaining user interaction paradigms and concepts becomes important. However, during the development of a large software product, these principles and paradigms get progressively diluted, due to trade-offs, differences in interpretation, communication errors and many other reasons. In order to remain true to design rationale and communicating them to a wider audience/consumers, often User Interface (UI) Style Guide are created. The style guide attempts to sensitize and educate its consumers about design principles and document some of these design rationales for references.However, the usability, usage and adoption of these UI guidelines within an organization are topics frequently discussed and debated in several forums for years.Post the 'design and definition phase' of software development lifecycle, UI designers are often required to do 'quality checks' as the UIs get developed. Despite painstakingly defining every interaction to its finest level of granularity, in practice the guidelines are often not followed or interpreted incorrectly.The method of manually inspecting the 'implemented' user interface for compliance to UI guidelines has the following pitfalls: Highly effort and time consuming; Outcome is often inaccurate, unreliable and sub-optimal in quality; Findings are too late in the process to be fixed.; Not an efficient process for tracking issues to resolutionThis case study talks about the challenges we faced with our UI Style guide and how we tackled them. Based on internal user research and design thinking we defined an approach of better integrating UI style guide into the software design and development process. We leveraged the benefits of pattern based UI approach and a model based development environment to achieve compliance to our UI guidelines by: Providing tools to automate verification of UI guidelines in the model based development environment; Redefining the development process to support UI verification early-on during the design and development process},

abstract = {In this paper we describe an imaging based virtual color consultation system that automatically recommends cosmetics appropriate for users' skin tone based on user's photograph. This system is intended for commercial use to address the problem of color selection of cosmetic foundation. Based on surveys and semi-structured interviews we have verified that visual selection of color foundation cosmetics by consumers is error prone, and the results of our study indicate that both mobile and kiosk touch points are essential to cover the entire target population (women of all ages) since we identified technical vs. social comfort, accuracy vs. convenience and social vs. individual parameters that play a huge role in the usage and adoption of such personal services for women.},

abstract = {To solve the challenge of exploring large information spaces on interactive surfaces such as tabletops, we developed an optically tracked, lightweight, passive display (magic lens) that provides elegant three-dimensional exploration of rich datasets. This can either be volumetric, layered, zoomable, or temporal information spaces, which are mapped onto the physical volume above a tabletop. By moving the magic lens through the volume, corresponding data is displayed, thus serving as a window into virtuality. Hereby, various interaction techniques are introduced, which especially utilize the lens' height above a tabletop in a novel way, e.g. for zooming or displaying information layers.},

The design is centered on a virtual body model that represents the users in the context of the workspace, relative to one another as well as to the display(s). This concept of body-centric interaction serves both as a design philosophy and an implementation approach and is both general and powerful. Our approach is general because if the model is detailed enough, a broad range of interaction techniques can be implemented. It is powerful because it opens up an entire class of new interaction techniques: those that depend on properties of a users' body, such as arm or hand pointing direction, head direction, or body location or orientation. The video highlights some of the body-centric interaction techniques that we believe are of value based on how people use their bodies in the everyday world.},
