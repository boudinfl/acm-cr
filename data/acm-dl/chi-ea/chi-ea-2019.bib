abstract = {There are many opinions on how to write an influential CHI paper, ranging from writing in an active voice to including colons in the title. However, little is known about how we actually write, and how writing influences impact. We conducted quantitative analyses of the full text of all 6578 CHI papers published since 1982 to investigate. We looked at readability, titles, novelty, and name-dropping and related these measures to the papers' citation count; overall and for different subcommittees. We found that CHI papers are more readable than papers from other fields. Furthermore, readability, title length, and novelty markers all influence citation counts.},

abstract = {In August 2018, a student protest initiated in Bangladesh sought justice when two school students were run over by public bus. Student protesters were demonstrating on the street for days until they were physically attacked. Concurrent with the physical attacks, the country experienced a disconnect. Internet, restrictions on social media usage, and several high-profile arrests of people speaking about the incidents. These suppressive encounters created what we call a "digital silence." In response, we collected stories from people, which depict their effort to seek out information about the events unfolding and share their perspective of what happened. Through these in-the-moment stories, we see a glimpse of how the information suppression impacted people with varying proximity to the events, including protesters, bystanders, and family members. We also reflect on the benefit of the subtle defiance of storytelling for storytellers in the midst of this social justice effort.},

Our suggestions on how to patch these gender bugs appear trivial while at the same time revealing seemingly insurmountable barriers. We illustrate the casual violence technologies present to non-binary people, as well as the on-going marginalisations we experience as HCI researchers.

This reduces the ability of users to control how and when they are being sensed. To address this imbalance, this project identifies the need to be able to deceive 'smart' objects, and proposes a number of practical interventions to increase user awareness of sensors, and encourage agency over digital sensing through acts of dishonesty to objects.},

People constantly engage in re-designing the past by re-elaborating, reckoning, and plainly forgetting. The rewriting of the past, such as in historical revisionism, is often seen as an attempt to wipe-out, and hence re-inscribe and perpetuate, injustice, oppression, and even genocide. With this paper we call for more courage to take ownership of the past as something malleable, to take responsibility for it, and in so doing to open up design opportunities to a plurality of voices.},

abstract = {Withing the fields of HCI and game design, conventional design practices have been criticised for perpetuating the status quo and marginalising users beyond the norm [11], [1], e.g. through genderized assumptions about user interaction [13]. To solve this problem of conservatism in HCI, one recommended strategy has been queering; the use of mischiveous, spaceful, and oblique design principles [13]. This contribution focuses on the conventional computer mouse within videogames as an example for a conventional input device optimised for a limited set of interactions. The article first reviews HCI discourses on the mouse within technology studies, game culture, and queer game studies. In these three domains, the mouse has been consistently reduced to its functionality as high-precision point-and-click device, constructing it as conservative seemingly hard-wired to cater to male-centred pleasures. We then discuss three experimental game design strategies to queer the mouse controller in The Undie Game, a cooperative wearable mouse-based installation game by the Copenhagen Game Collective. The Undie Game speculates about ways to confront and disrupt conventional expectations about gaming by fa''silly''tating interaction for two players who wear a mouse controller in their panties and collectively steer a 3D high definition tongue on screen to achieve a mutual highscore. By creating a social, silly, and potentially daunting play experience, The Undie Game reinterprets the affordances of the computer mouse to bring subjects like consent, failure, and ambiguity into the picture.},

Some of these works cover spiritual/transcendent experiences associated with these contexts, but strikingly few of them describe in any way the experiences they studied or aimed to support, let alone give definitions of the terms they use for those experiences. Even fewer papers cite any literature on the relevant experiences. We have to ask: How do the authors understand the experiences their work is aiming to observe, invite, or support? How do they know when and whether they have observed, invited, or supported the kinds of experiences they target? How do they know what they are studying? This paper discusses the presence and absence of definitions of terms for spiritual/transcendent experiences in HCI research, and of citations of relevant literature. It speculates about possible reasons for the oversight, proposes some definitions aimed at filling the gap, and suggests an approach to operationalizing some of the proposed definitions.},

abstract = {Today's mainstream Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research primarily addresses functional concerns - the needs of users, practical applications, and usability evaluation. Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms are driven by vision and carried out with an artistic approach. While today's technologies will become obsolete in one year, and today's applications will be replaced in 10 years, true visions - we believe - can last longer than 100 years. Tangible Bits (3, 4) seeks to realize seamless interfaces between humans, digital information, and the physical environment by giving physical form to digital information and computation, making bits directly manipulatable and perceptible both in the foreground and background of our consciousness (peripheral awareness). Our goal is to invent new design media for artistic expression as well as for scientific analysis, taking advantage of the richness of human senses and skills we develop throughout our lifetime interacting with the physical world, as well as the computational reflection enabled by real-time sensing and digital feedback. Radical Atoms (5) leaps beyond Tangible Bits by assuming a hypothetical generation of materials that can change form and properties dynamically, becoming as reconfigurable as pixels on a screen. Radical Atoms is the future material that can transform its shape, conform to constraints, and inform the users of their affordances. Radical Atoms is a vision for the future of Human-Material Interaction, in which all digital information has a physical manifestation, thus enabling us to interact directly with it.},

Products with high usability lab ratings have been rejected in the crucible of real-life usage because they don't add sufficient value for either the consumer or company that delivers them to market. The failure of these so called "great designs" reduces them at best to museum or portfolio pieces. True impact is only achieved when the designed artifact reaches a critical level of market adoption. The service benchmarks today are Facebook with over two billion active users and Google with 1.2 trillion searches a year. Achieving significant market adoption is difficult. It requires not only delightfully fulfilling users' needs but also a UX strategy and design optimization to fit corporate business models and marketing channels, both characterized by substantial financial risk. If there is no ROI for the product, then by association there is no ROI for design or the UX team itself. UX earns a "seat at the table" by simultaneously delivering value for both the business and the user. Owning the Business of UX role contains strategy and management challenges. Mastering them can bring UX to corporate parity with the more established engineering and marketing professions.},

abstract = {Science and design should be relevant and accessible to everyone. HCI has a long history of service, engagement, and connection with people with higher risk for educational, physical, and social challenges. Previous winners of this award are on the forefront of those efforts towards support for these diverse and often vulnerable populations. On this 15th anniversary of this award, we have a moment to reflect on these advances. Increasingly, the CHI community is connected to our worlds outside of research and scholarship. However, we see that connection is not enough. We must seek instead for true engagement. What does it mean to be a true partner, to take small steps to increase engagement in projects, in designs, and in scholarly work? Building on an existing ethos of service, three years ago, the CHI community undertook an effort to positively impact the cities we visit: Day of Service. This step is just one in a long line of efforts on the part of a responsible, committed group of scholars to leaving this world better than we found it. However, these efforts also represent some of the challenges of our own privilege. How can we go beyond service to true collaboration? How can we bring to bear our vast resources while listening to the community and valuing their expertise and lived experiences? Finally, the CHI community has always been a place of greater diversity than some similar and surrounding academic communities. Recent efforts have focused on expanding that diversity further still: diversity of thought, diversity of experience and physical bodies, and diversity of racial, ethnic, and gender boundaries. What happens once we have recruited this diverse community? How do we ensure long-term inclusion in all activities and in the highest levels of leadership? The CHI Social Impact Award is an incredible honor and the talk an excellent platform. In this talk, I will reflect alongside the community. I will describe research focused on empowering people who are not typically represented in the design process as well as the requisite inclusive and democratic approaches to design. In particular, I will focus on the ways in which thought and action are deeply intertwined [2] and the generation of knowledge through participatory cycles of action and reflection [1]. I will also go beyond these specific research projects and practices to discuss the progress of the CHI community as a whole and our work to create an environment that is engaged, collaborative, and inclusive.},

abstract = {A 'data-driven life' has become an established feature of present and future technological visions. This dissertation interrogates the human experience of a data-driven life, by conceptualising, investigating, and speculating about personal informatics tools as new technologies of memory. I argue that the prevalence of quantified data and metrics is creating fundamentally new and distinct records of everyday life: a 'quantified past'. To address this, I conducted qualitative and idiographic fieldwork -- with long-term self-trackers, and subsequently with users of 'smart journals' -- to investigate how this data-driven record mediates the experience of remembering. Further, I undertook a speculative and design-led inquiry to explore the context of a 'quantified wedding'. Adopting a context where remembering is centrally valued, this Research through Design project demonstrated opportunities for the design of data-driven tools for remembering. Crucially, while speculative, this project maintained a central focus on individual experience, and introduced an innovative methodological approach 'Speculative Enactments' for engaging participants meaningfully in speculative inquiry.},

abstract = {Text input methods are an integral part of our daily interaction with digital devices. However, their design poses a complex problem: for any method, we must decide which input action (a button press, a hand gesture, etc.) produces which symbol (e.g., a character or word). With only 26 symbols and input actions, there are already more than 1026 distinct solutions, making it impossible to find the best one through manual design. Prior work has shown that we can use optimization methods to search such large design spaces efficiently and automatically find a good user interface with respect to the given objectives [6]. However, work in the text entry domain has been limited mostly to the performance optimization of (soft-)keyboards (see [2] for an overview). The Ph.D. thesis [2] advances the field of text-entry optimization by enlarging the space of optimizable text-input methods and proposing new criteria for assessing their optimality. Firstly, the design problem is formulated as an assignment problem for integer programming. This enables the use of standard mathematical solvers and algorithms for efficiently finding good solutions. Then, objective functions are developed, for assessing their optimality with respect to motor performance, ergonomics, and learnability. The corresponding models extend beyond interaction with soft keyboards, to consider multi-finger input, novel sensors, and alternative form factors. In addition, the thesis illustrates how to formulate models from prior work in terms of an assignment problem, providing a coherent theoretical basis for text entry optimization. The proposed objectives are applied in the optimization of three assignment problems: text input with multi-finger gestures in mid-air [8], text input on a long piano keyboard [4], and - for a contribution to the official French keyboard standard - input of special characters via a physical keyboard [3]. Combining the proposed models offers a multi-objective optimization approach able to capture the complex cognitive and motor processes during typing. . .},

abstract = {Computers are now ubiquitous. However, computers and digital content have remained largely separate from the physical world - users explicitly interact with computers through small screens and input devices, and the "virtual world" of digital content has had very little overlap with the practical, physical world. My thesis work is concerned with helping computing escape the confines of screens and devices, spilling digital content out onto the physical world around us. In this way, I aim to help bridge the gap between the information-rich digital world and the familiar environment of the physical world and allow users to interact with digital content as they would ordinary physical content. I approach this problem from many angles: from the low-level work of providing high-fidelity touch interaction on everyday surfaces, easily transforming these surfaces into enormous touchscreens; to high-level questions surrounding the interaction design between physical and virtual realms. To achieve this end, building on my prior work, I developed two physical embodiments of this new mixed-reality design: a tiny, miniaturized projector and camera system providing the hardware basis for a projected on-world interface, and a head-mounted augmented-reality head-mounted display modified to support touch interaction on arbitrary surfaces.},

abstract = {The way people participate in decision making has radically changed over the last few decades. Technology has facilitated the sharing of knowledge, ideas and opinions across social structures and, has allowed grass-root initiatives to flourish. Participatory civic technology has helped local communities to embrace civic action on matters of shared concern. In this case study, we describe SENSEI, a year-long participatory sensing movement. Local community organisations, decision makers, families, individuals and researchers worked together to co-create civic technologies to help them address environmental issues of shared interest, such as invasive plant species, abandoned items in the forests and nice places. Over 240 local participants have taken part to the different stages of this year long process which included ten community events and workshops. As a result, over hundred concrete ideas about issues of common interest were generated, nearly thirty civic tech prototypes were designed and developed, along hundreds of environmental observations. In this paper, we describe the process or orchestration of this initiative and present key reflections from it.},

In this paper, we present additional cases in more detail which demonstrate the applicability of our concept of Critical Experience on cases in which PEACE was used.

The ubiquitous use of social media also enables researchers to study human behavior as the data can be collected in an inexpensive and unobtrusive way. Not only does social media provide a passive means to collect historical data at scale, it also functions as a "verbal" sensor, providing rich signals about an individual's social ecological context. This case study introduces an infrastructural framework to illustrate the feasibility of passively collecting social media data at scale in the context of an ongoing multimodal sensing study of workplace performance (N=757). We study our dataset in its relationship with demographic, personality, and wellbeing attributes of individuals. Importantly, as a means to study selection bias, we examine what characterizes individuals who choose to consent to social media data sharing vs. those who do not. Our work provides practical experiences and implications for research in the HCI field who seek to conduct similar longitudinal studies that harness the potential of social media data.},

abstract = {We present a system-initiative multimodal speech-based dialogue system for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The MMSE is a questionnaire-based cognitive test, which is traditionally administered by a trained expert using pen and paper and afterwards scored manually to measure cognitive impairment. By using a digital pen and speech dialogue, we implement a multimodal system for the automatic execution and evaluation of the MMSE. User input is evaluated and scored in real-time. We present a user experience study with 15 participants and compare the usability of the proposed system with the traditional approach. Our experiment suggests that both modes perform equally well in terms of usability, but the proposed system has higher novelty ratings. We compare assessment scorings produced by our system with manual scorings made by domain experts.},

Conceptually drawing on previous work in VR exposure training, this prototype consists of guided, first-person 3D-360° video episodes that depict psychologically stressful situations that women commonly face when returning home. Critical story and production elements, including screenplay, acting, and narration, were created with incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women. The institutional, technological, and cultural restrictions of prison, combined with the tensions of making media with often exploited groups, forced adaptations of participatory design methods. The inclusion of incarcerated female voices resulted in an immersive narrative that reflects this group's specific challenges. The next phase is to evaluate its efficacy against non-immersive comparative trainings for reentry-related anxieties.},

We conducted a user-study (N = 15) to understand what factors facilitate or amplify forms of behaviour in cases of online conversation that are less likely to be tolerated in face-to-face.

Our findings suggest that (1) emphasizing curricular coherence as a design goal and (2) providing youth with multiple avenues for engaging in 3D modeling can help to: spark youth interest in 3D printing/modeling, maintain youth engagement in learning activities over the course of several weeks, and provide youth with opportunities to develop their spatial thinking skills.},

abstract = {With the rise of automated vehicles, a new road user had to be designed, an autonomous system that needs to integrate into an ecosystem of human-human interaction. Traditionally automotive UX is focused on the interaction between the driver and the vehicle. This new design challenge however comprised a change of perspective from driver/inside to road user/outside and from a system that is steered by a human being to an intelligent system that proactively makes decisions in a public space. A new approach was necessary to handle this change of perspective in the design process and to instill it into the heads of the stakeholders. We modified a user centered process to satisfy the challenge of designing the automated vehicle as a social actor. For example, we designed for acceptance by defining a character based on hopes and concerns of the public. The flow of communication was analyzed and intent based visual and acoustic signals were designed and evaluated in a purpose-built simulator. The lessons we learned from this process might also be applicable to the design of other autonomous, public facing systems.},

abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) assistants have been a hot topic for a few years. Popular solutions - such as Google Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, Apple's Siri, and Amazon Alexa - are becoming resourceful AI-assistants for general users. Apart from some mishaps, those assistants have a successful history in supporting people's everyday tasks. The same cannot be said in industry-specific scenarios, in which AI-assistants are still a bet. Companies combining AI with human expertise and experience can be stand out in their industry. This is particularly important for industries that rely their strategic decision-making processes on knowledge workers actions. More than another system, AI-assistants are new players in the human-computer interaction. But how and when should an AI-assistant interfere in a knowledge worker task? In this paper, we present findings from a case study using the Wizard of Oz approach in an oil and gas company. Our findings begin to answer that question for what kind of interference knowledge workers in that domain would accept from an AI-assistant.},

Unusually, we used an internal Google+ social media site to post a continual stream of raw, unsynthesized "atomic evidence" from research activities. The G+ unexpectedly went viral, creating extremely high engagement, impact, and stakeholder sentiment. Here we discuss the pros, cons, and impact of our approach, and also how success came from creating space for others to create, engage with, and act on raw evidence from the field.},

Within PASSME H2020 European project, 3D design visualizations for novel concepts for an airport interior were developed and tested early on with users to identify the best interior design principles among the alternatives considered to reduce passenger stress, waiting times and improve overall Passenger Experience (PAX). Using the potential of VR, concepts were tested with users and we identified passenger emotional and design-driven responses to boarding gates and lounge visualizations to inform the iterative development of in-situ passenger-centric interventions. We elicited both emotional, practical and operational needs and requirements for improving PAX within airports and found out that users can use VR to imagine interaction scenarios within the proposed design products.},

Within a 3-week assignment for an illustration class, we ran three 3-hour sessions. Our design was informed by the experiences of previous data-comics workshops. Results show the creative potential of data comics. Challenges to learn from the workshop include the stages to introduce data visualizations and journalistic narratives, the structuring of stories and the method of developing iterations of comic drafts.

The "TechShops" approach emerged because we found it difficult to engage YAID in traditional contextual interviews. Hence, we offered a series of "TechShops", which we found useful in: enabling engagement with participants, their families and support staff; fostering relationships; and gaining research access. We explain the context of "TechShops", and reflect upon the opportunities and challenges that the approach offers for both researchers and YAID in exploratory design research.},

We must focus our attention primarily on current developments. Why look in the rear-view mirror? Some topics that are being actively explored now will soon be of less interest, so career planning benefits from thoughtfully identifying trajectories. To make use of relevant information in other fields you must understand how their terminologies, priorities, and methods evolved. We will cover the history of several HCI fields and discuss opportunities and challenges that lie ahead. Software evolved from passively reacting to human input to today's dynamic partnership. In some areas HCI advanced steadily, elsewhere it reached dead ends or seemed to go in circles. Understanding these patterns will prepare you to respond to unexpected developments in years to come. The forces that shaped HCI in computer science, human factors, information systems, information science, and design are covered, with examples and implications for our new era.},

In order to support this proposed approach, an entirely new program for performing interactive statistics, called ILLMO, was developed. This course will use examples of frequent statistical tasks such as hypothesis testing, linear regression and clustering to introduce the key concepts underlying intuitive and interactive statistics.},

These techniques use a combination of new paper-based AR/VR design templates and smartphone-based capture and replay tools, adapting Wizard of Oz for AR/VR design. The fourth and final session will allow participants to test and critique each other's prototypes while checking against emerging design principles and guidelines. The instructor has previously taught the techniques to broad student audiences with a wide variety of non-technical backgrounds, including design, architecture, business, medicine, education, and psychology, who shared a common interest in user experience and interaction design.

Currently, there is no systematic integration of wellbeing science into tech development, and the many technology-induced harms to mental health, reported in the media daily, attest to this deficit. But the status quo is changing. A demand for more "Humane Technologies" [12] is forcing companies to rethink digital business as usual. Fortunately, recent research has uncovered new ways to make psychologically respectful technologies possible. Just as we can design ergonomically to support physical wellness, we can design psycho-ergonomically to support psychological health. By integrating well-evidenced theory and methods from multiple disciplines, we can design and develop new technologies to "do no harm" and even increase psychological wellbeing [1]. In this course we will introduce frameworks for designing technologies that respect human values and wellbeing [6,7,8,9,10] together with an established ethical framework within which to situate this design for flourishing [11]. We also provide practical tools for ideation, design, and the evaluation of the psychological impact of products.},

abstract = {The epoch of the platform economy has arrived. Companies face the question of how to build up disruptive digital services with disruptive business models and establish a digital ecosystem. Traditional UCD methods concentrate on the conception of particular services. Nevertheless, most of these are isolated solutions of single companies. Building services for the digital transformation era requires additional methods to come up with end-to-end consumer experiences and sustainable business models across boundaries of single companies for benefiting consumers. In this course participants learn the "Tangible Ecosystem Design? Method (TED), that supports the conception of Digital Ecosystems by using tangible elements.},

abstract = {The teaching of harmonic foundations in music is a common learning objective in many education systems. However, music theory is often considered as a non-interactive subject matter that requires huge efforts to understand. With this work, we contribute a novel tangible device, called ScaleDial, that makes use of the relations between geometry and music theory to provide interactive, graspable and playful learning experiences. Therefore, we introduce an innovative tangible cylinder and demonstrate how harmonic relationships can be explored through a physical set of digital manipulatives, that can be arranged and stacked on top of an interactive chromatic circle. Based on the tangible interaction and further rich visual and auditory output capabilities, ScaleDial enables a better understanding of scales, pitch constellations, triads, as well as intervals. Further, we describe the technical realization of our advanced prototype and show how we fabricate the magnetic, capacitive and mechanical sensing.},

abstract = {Reflection-in-action (RiA) refers to teachers' reflections on their teaching performance during busy classroom routines. RiA is a demanding competence for teachers, but little has been known about how HCI systems could support teachers' RiA during their busy and intensive teaching. To bridge this gap, we design and evaluate an ambient information system named ClassBeacons. ClassBeacons aims to help teachers intuitively reflect-in-action on how to divide time and attention over pupils throughout a lesson. ClassBeacons subtly depicts teachers' division of time and attention over pupils through multiple light-objects distributed over students' desks. Each light-object indicates how long the teacher has been cumulatively around it (helping an adjacent student) by shifting color. A field evaluation with eleven teachers proved that ClassBeacons enhanced teachers' RiA by supporting their sensemaking of ongoing performance and modification of upcoming actions. Furthermore, ClassBeacons was experienced to unobtrusively fit into teachers' routines without overburdening teaching in progress.},

This capability has been exploited to create displays since being able to position mid-air physical voxels enables for rich data representations. However, most of the times interesting features of acoustic levitation are not exploited. Acoustic Levitation is harmless and sound diffracts around objects, thus we can insert our hand inside the levitator and touch the levitated particles without harmful effect on us. In this demo, we showcase more tangible interactions with acoustically levitated particles by passing acoustically-transparent structures through the particles, manipulating particles in mid-air with wearable levitators or by moving multiple particles with direct manipulation. We hope that this demo provides a more tangible experience of acoustic levitation. Since all the presented devices are Do-It-Yourself, we encourage visitors to experiment further with acoustic levitation.},

abstract = {In this demo, we present Slackliner 2.0, an interactive slackline training assistant which features head and skeleton tracking, and real-time feedback through life-size projection. Like in other sports, proper training leads to a faster increase of skill and lessens the risk of injuries. We chose a set of exercises from slackline literature and implemented an interactive trainer which guides the user through the exercises giving feedback if the exercises were executed correctly. Based on lessons learned from our study and prior demonstrations we present a revised version of Slackliner that uses head tracking to better guide the user's attention and movements. Additionally a new visual indicator informs the trainee about her arm posture during the performance. This has been also included in an updated post-analysis view that provides the trainee with more detailed feedback about her performance. The present demo showcases an interactive sports training system that provides in-situ feedback while following a well-guided learning procedure.},

abstract = {Ola De La Vida is a three-player cooperative game installation which is designed to harness the qualities of social play environment such as an arcade or play party (an event which mixes games, music, dance and socializing). Ola De La Vida uses physical and digital design techniques that consider the unique qualities of a social play space being sensitive to the complex personal, social and interpersonal aspects each player may experience. The game installation uses its scale to heighten the visibility of the game in a crowded play space, custom control methods to lower barriers to entry and costume to promote teamwork, collaboration and to lower social anxieties. These techniques, in partnership with the digital-physical nature of the game play aims to entice players and spectators in a social environment to participate. Through this installation we hope to encourage discussion around designing for participation and the challenges of social play.},

The key idea is to cut and perforate a 2D sheet using a cutting plotter to make it foldable into a 3D honeycomb structure; before folding, users place the electronic components and circuitry onto the sheet. The fabrication process only takes a few minutes allowing to rapidly prototype functional interactive devices. The resulting objects are lightweight and rigid, thus allowing for weight-sensitive and force-sensitive applications. Due to the nature of honeycombs, the created objects can be folded flat along one axis and thus can be efficiently transported in this compact form factor.},

abstract = {We present an interactive editing system for laser cutting called kyub. Kyub allows users to create models efficiently in 3D, which it then unfolds into the 2D plates laser cutters expect. Unlike earlier systems, such as FlatFitFab, kyub affords construction based on closed box structures, which allows users to turn very thin material, such as 4mm plywood, into objects capable of withstanding large forces, such as chairs users can actually sit on. To afford such sturdy construction, every kyub project begins with a simple finger-joint "boxel"-a structure we found to be capable of withstanding over 500kg of load. Users then extend their model by attaching additional boxels. Boxels merge automatically, resulting in larger, yet equally strong structures. While the concept of stacking boxels allows kyub to offer the strong affordance and ease of use of a voxel-based editor, boxels are not confined to a grid and readily combine with kuyb's various geometry deformation tools. In our technical evaluation, objects built with kyub withstood hundreds of kilograms of loads. We demonstrate the kyub software to the CHI audience and allow them to experience the resulting models first hand.},

This allows CATS to produce paintings that would be difficult to create with traditional art supplies or existing software. We evaluated the effectiveness of CATS by asking artists to integrate the tool into their creative practice for two weeks; their paintings and feedback demonstrate that CATS is an expressive tool which can be used to create richly textured paintings.},

Instead of command sequences, learners assemble processing nodes into a graph through which signals and data flow. Flowboard consists of a visual flow-based editor on an iPad, a hardware frame integrating the iPad, an Arduino board and two breadboards next to the iPad, letting learners connect their visual graphs seamlessly to the input and output electronics. Graph edits take effect immediately, making Flowboard a live coding environment.},

Despite live programming's practical values, such as providing an easier overview of code and better understanding of its structure, it is not yet widely used. In this work, we extend live programming to general purpose code editors, which allows for live programming to be used by programmers, and provides new interfaces for understanding and changing the functionality of code. To achieve this we extended a fully-featured IDE with the ability to show input/output examples of code execution, as the programmer is writing code. Furthermore, we integrate programming by example (PBE) synthesis into our tool by allowing the user to change the shown output, and have the code update automatically. Our goal is to use live programming to give novice programmers a new way to interact and understand programming, as well as being a useful development tool for more advanced programmers.},

This technique enables us to estimate hand shapes (bend of a finger and contact between fingers) and differentiates a grabbing tag. To estimate how far each finger bends, the electrical resistance of the conductive fiber is measured; this resistance decreases as the finger bends because the surface of the glove short circuits. To detect contact between fingers, we apply alternating currents with different frequencies to each finger and measure the signal propagation between the fingers. This principle is also used to differentiate a grabbing tag (each tag has an alternating current with a unique frequency). We developed a prototype data glove based on this technique.},

abstract = {Come Hither to Me is an interactive robotic performance, which examines the emotive social interaction between an audience and a robot. Our interactive robot attempts to communicate and flirt with audience members in the gallery. The robot uses feedback from sensors, auditory data, and computer vision techniques to learn about the participants and inform its conversation. The female robot approaches the audience, picks her favorites, and starts charming them with seductive comments, funny remarks, backhanded compliments, and personal questions. We are interested in evoking emotions in the participating audience through their interactions with the robot. Come Hither to Me strives to invert gender roles and stereotypical expectations in flirtatious interactions. This performative piece explores the dynamics of social communication, objectification of women, and the gamification of seduction. The robot reduces flirtation to an algorithm, codifying pick-up lines and sexting paradigms.},

abstract = {"Eyes" is an interactive biometric data art that transforms human's Iris data into musical sound and 3D animated image. The idea is to allow the audience to explore their own identities through unique visual and sound generated by their iris patterns based on iris recognition and image processing techniques. Selected iris images are printed in 3D sculptures, and it replays the sound and animated images on the sculptures. This research-based artwork has an experimental system generating distinct sounds for each different iris data using visual features such as colors, patterns, brightness and size of the iris. It has potentials to lead the new way of interpreting complicated dataset with the audiovisual output. Moreover, aesthetically beautiful, mesmerizing and uncanny valley-effected artwork can create personalized art experience and multimodal interaction. Multisensory interpretations of this data art can lead a new opportunity to reveal users' narratives and create their own "sonic signature."},

These weapons are spawned in an enclosed area during the performance and can be used by whoever is collects them first. There is a multitude of such power-ups, all of which have different properties, such as speed boost, additional damage, ground traps and so on. All of these weapons affect the sound and sonic textures that each of the avatars produce. Additionally, the players can use elements of the environment such as platforms, obstructions and elevation in order to gain competitive advantage, or position themselves strategically to access first the spawned power-ups.},

In this study, we investigated how the developed device can modify the wearer's body representation and experiences based on a field study conducted at a nursing school and museums, and through lab studies. Using this device, designers and teachers can understand the perspectives of a smaller-person including a child in an existing environment.},

We designed a two-handed control map for the drone that engages multiple parts of the body, a light foam casing to give the impression that the drone is floating and an onboard light which gives feedback to the speed of the movement. The user will experience both leading and following the drone to explore the interplay between mapping, form, feedback and instruction.

Movie+ allows the selective sharing of this information through different visualization options, as well as rendering others' emotional fingerprints over the same clip.

abstract = {Family connections are maintained through sharing reminiscences, often supported by family photographs which easily prompt memories. This is increasingly important as we age, as picture-based reminiscence has been shown to reduce older adults' social isolation. However, there is a gap between sharing memories from physical pictures and the limited support for oral social reminiscence afforded by digital tools. PhotoFlow supports older adults' picture-mediated social storytelling of family memories using an intuitive metaphor mirroring sharing physical family pictures on a table top. The app uses the speech of oral storytelling to automatically organize pictures based only on what has been said. This simplifies the overall process of family picture interactions by leveraging one enjoyable aspect to ease a more effortful one. In particular, the familiar table top interaction metaphor has the potential to bridge the gap between physical picture reminiscence and managing digital picture collections.},

Training with a speech therapist may be inaccessible due to health disparities; thus, a technological solution, as I propose in my research, is necessary.

As specific contributions, it is planned that (i) and (ii) emerge into a design space, while (iii) leads to a set of heuristics. So far, I was able to extensively work on the first objective as well as to touch on the other two.},

This research questions how integrating these may better engage and include minimally-verbal children on the spectrum in the co-design of digital technologies.},

abstract = {Despite pervasive messaging about the dangers of "screen time," children and families remain avid consumers of digital media and other technologies. Given competing narratives heralding the promise or the peril of children's technology, how can designers best serve this audience? In this panel, we bring together world experts from: children's media and communications, pediatrics and human development, HCI and design, and industry product development to debate the validity of pundits' concerns and discuss designers' opportunities and obligations with respect to creating products for this user group. Panelists bring diverse--and sometimes conflicting--perspectives on the conceptual frameworks that are most appropriate for understanding family technology use, the ethical considerations designers should bring to this space, and the most pressing needs for future research. Grounding the conversation in guidance from the audience, panelists will share their visions for a research agenda that separates moral panics from credible concerns and promotes the design of positive digital experiences for children and families.},

Now digital transformation, a pervasive shift in the role of information technology, will offer both practitioners and researchers far more influential roles in organizations. This shift, which is taking place in industry, education and government is part of a larger shift to a global, digitally connected society.This panel builds on the theme of CHI'19 - Weaving the Threads - through its focus on how HCI/UX, research and practice will be integrated as organizations transform into digitally-driven entities.The panel brings together thought leaders with backgrounds in both academia and industry. With extensive audience participation, we will explore the implications of digital transformation on the roles of HCI/UX, the challenges, and the new skills needed to support a culture change and collaborate with a wider range of stakeholders.It is our hope that this panel can become a jumping off point for future work, built on our belief that HCI/UX are vital drivers of new technologies, and of beneficial societal transformations. Through national agencies and, perhaps in time, becoming part of the UN's Sustainable Development Agenda, would position HCI/UX to fulfill its role as a key driver of both business and social transformation.},

It will be led by members of the ACM SIGCHI Research Ethics Committee. We will pose open questions and invite audience discussion of practices centered on recent "hot topic" issues. For this year's town hall, the primary focus will be on paths to balancing the often-competing regulatory frameworks under which we operate (some of which having recently undergone significant revisions) with our community's efforts to reveal ethical challenges posed by new interactive technologies and new contexts of use. We will engage the audience in discussions on whether there is a non-colonial role for ethics education within the broad HCI community, how that may capture the cultural and disciplinary differences that are woven into CHI's fabric, and how research ethical issues should be handled in SIGCHI paper submission and review process.},

These experiences can change what individuals know and value, their perspective on the world and life, evolving them as a grown person. For these characteristics, transformative experiences are gaining increasing attention in psychology, neuroscience, and philosophy. One potentially interesting question related to transformative experiences concerns how they can be invited by means of interactive technologies. This question lies at the center of a new research program, transformative experience design, which has two aims: (1) to investigate phenomenological and neurocognitive aspects of transformative experiences, as well as their implications for individual growth and psychological well-being; and (2) to translate such knowledge into tentative design principles for developing experiences that aim to support meaning in life and personal growth. Our goal for this SIG is to discuss challenges and opportunities for transformative experiences in the context of interactive technologies.},

First, we aim to critically discuss the definition of Spatial Interfaces and outline the common components that build such interfaces in today's world. Second, we would like the community to reflect on the path ahead and focus on the potential of what kind of experiences can Spatial Interfaces achieve today},

Together, these organizations not only tackle issues their members identify in the world of work, but also provide network-driven collections of shared things (e.g., books, tools) and resources (e.g., woodworking spaces, fab labs) that benefit local communities, potentially changing, not just use of resources at community level, but socio-economic structures on the ground (e.g., [15]). In contrast to for-profit services often associated with the sharing economy (e.g., Uber, Airbnb), platform co-ops attempt to advocate ecological, economic and social sustainability, with the goal to promoting a fairer distribution of goods and labor, ultimately creating a stronger sense of community. While some HCI sub-communities (e.g., CSCW) have started to explore this emergent phenomenon, especially leveraging ethnographic research methods, researchers have called for more diverse HCI approaches to address the growing scope of challenges within platform co-ops, member-driven exchange systems, and cooperativism more broadly. This SIG aims to bring together researchers from different HCI sub-communities to identify future research directions in HCI around cooperativism and platforms.},

A workshop at CHI 2018 with researchers and practitioners working on accessible and assistive technologies for children in educational settings raised two on-going challenges in this area: (1) Very few assistive technologies proposed in research are evaluated in context, notably because of the many practical constraints on evaluation when working with these small communities of diverse individuals; (2) The scholars turning their attention to context raise new design preoccupations, such as interdependence, for which we do not yet have a community consensus regarding the suitable approaches to evaluation. Although this workshop was conducted with researchers working with children with visual impairments, these challenges apply more widely to the field of technologies for children with disabilities in educational settings. The purpose of this SIG is to bring together researchers and practitioners to encourage the homogenization of evaluation approaches for accessible and assistive technologies in schools.},

abstract = {Sketching is universal. It enables us to work through problems, communicate complexity, work with people who have diverse needs, and document work processes we employ within Human-Computer Interaction. Increased interest in sketching as a methodology within HCI has led to increased attendance of interactive courses, meet-ups, and discussion groups, from those who are complete beginners, to seasoned researchers with the skills and knowledge to support others. By bringing together these individuals, we are able to advance the understanding of how sketching underpins research, and how we might work with sketching as technology advances. SketCHI 2.0 aims to support ongoing discussions and collaborations around sketching in HCI, and further build the Sketching HCI community. As well as drawing on location, feedback, and discussion, we will form collaborative working groups to further our collective interest in this area and conduct high-level discussions about the practical applications and outputs of sketching in HCI.},

abstract = {Gender disparity in high tech is a long-standing challenge. The number of women in tech is lower than 30 years ago; women leave the field 50% more often than men; attrition costs companies money and talent. This SIG addresses the issue of gender and retention by changing key work practices. As a maker community critique, giving and receiving feedback on one's work, is a necessary and everyday experience. Yet especially women lose self esteem when criticized. Since HCI professionals are key participants in critique it is a good place to start improving interactions within diverse teams. In this SIG we engage the community in a critical examination and reinvention of the critique process. Using a Mini Living Lab format, participants share experiences of their critique practices, brainstorm improvements, and try them out with a practice problem. The organizers share insights from their Living Lab company-research partnerships addressing gender and retention.},

Interest in refugee and humanitarian contexts has also been expressed within the HCI community through the organization of workshops at conferences. While previous engagements within the HCI community have focused on our experiences of working within refugee contexts as well as developing a common research agenda, we have yet to explore how HCI research fits within wider humanitarian research and in relation to digital humanitarianism.

The learning gap is even larger in schools catering to lower income groups due to the absence of digital infrastructure and digital knowledge. As a result, a large section of Indian students is cut off from a major source of knowledge, the internet, causing the gap to increase between students in the society. With co ed, we attempt to bridge these gaps by providing a platform to foster mutual learning as well as combining digital mediums and the long-established pen and paper in a seamless manner.},

abstract = {Visual impairment can profoundly impact well-being and social advancement. Current solutions for accessing graphical information fail to provide an affordable, user-friendly collaborative platform for visually impaired and sighted people to work together. Therefore, sighted users tend to have low expectations from visually impaired people while working in a team. Hence, visually impaired people feel discouraged to participate in a mixed population collaborative environment. Consequently, their generative capabilities remain devalued. In this paper, we propose an audio-haptic enabled tool (Drawxi) for free-form sketching and sharing simple diagrams (processes, workflows, ideas, perspectives, etc.). It provides a common platform for visually-impaired and sighted people to work together by communicating each other's ideas visually. Thus, enabling the discovery of generative capabilities in a hands-on way. We relied upon participatory research methods (Contextual inquiry, Co-Design) involving visually impaired participants throughout the design process. We evaluated our proposed design through usability testing which revealed that collaboration between visually impaired and sighted people benefits from the use of common tools and platforms. Thereby, enhancing the degree of their participation in a collaborative environment and quality of co-creation activities.},

People who are hard of hearing (HH) often experience social isolation caused by the lack of understanding from the hearing community. Our research revealed that there is a communication gap between the hearing and HH communities. The current state of art tends to focus on assisting HH people to participate in conversations, which places more responsibility on the HH community. There is a lack of responsibility of people in the hearing community. However, communication works in two directions; it requires both parties to take responsibility. In this paper, we present HearU - an integrated, multichannel system that includes public interaction. Through the creation of an immersive experience that increases people's awareness of hearing loss, we aim to use HearU as a medium to weave these two communities together as a whole.},

To address these issues, we introduce 'PALS' - an accessible crowdsourcing and connection quilt, first hung like a tapestry in the ALS clinic, then later used as an interactive public display. The quilt offers the opportunity to access crowdsourced information concerning individual experiences of ALS. Our work offers three primary contributions: 1) adding to limited HCI research concerning the ALS community by establishing the needs, 2) applying the 'PALS' quilt design solution to these needs, and 3) combining three modalities: crowdsourcing, tangible tapestry displays, and interactive waiting education in a unique way.},

This paper aims at exploring the effectiveness of representing HRV measures with alternative modalities, other than visual displays, such as audio or haptics. Therefore, we undertook a preliminary study in which we applied a parameter mapping sonification approach to transform the HRV signal into an audible form. In this work, we sought to evaluate the human perception of the developed auditory interface. Hence, a dataset that involves interbeat interval measurements of individuals experiencing changes in mental state in the form of meditation was selected as the basis of the study. The HRV parameters of the dataset were mapped to acoustic features using a linear mapping technique. The feasibility of the system was assessed by measuring the learnability, performance, latency, and confidence aspects. The results suggest a great potential of incorporating auditory displays in the analysis of HRV. Participants were able to distinguish the different meditation states and types with minimal training time. However, further studies should be conducted on a larger population to provide verification of the findings of this preliminary study.},

This paper presents Muse, an in-action chatbot interface that prompts students to reflect metacognitively on their self-direction process in the midst of working on their independent research projects. Students participate in the Design, Technology, and Research (DTR) program, which provides several undergrads the opportunity to self-direct an independent research project by using the socio-technological model Agile Research Studios (ARS). Results from a case study suggest that Muse helps students identify time consuming habits and set aside less important tasks by giving participants the opportunity to act on their reflections and adjust aspects of their process that they deem less effective.},

This PhD research in Digital Media explores how digital technologies can facilitate natural history museums in creating immersive museum experiences for teenagers (15-18 years old), especially through digital storytelling and gamification frameworks. This contribution would be a set of guidelines that will aid in designing interactive experiences inside these museums. So far, we have involved a total of 155 teens through co-design sessions, 130 in focus groups, and 98 in usability studies, as well as 3 museums, 12 curators, and 17 master students. Through qualitative analysis, our preliminary findings suggest that teenagers value gamification and storytelling elements when thinking about enjoyable museum tours, while curators value story-based narratives as the most prominent method to provide enjoyable museum experience for teens. Based on the findings identified, and in collaboration with the Madeira-ITI, two interactive mobile experiences targeted at teenagers were developed for the Natural History Museum of Funchal, Portugal.},

abstract = {Mobile app designers aim to develop the best mobile software interfaces in the least amount of time, and rely on testing ideas with prototypes in lieu of building costly, fully functioning applications. Yet, designers cannot effectively prototype some complex app experiences, including augmented reality applications like Pok\'{e}mon GO, because existing tools lack the needed features, or because prototyping in them is too time intensive to be feasible. To solve this problem, we introduce Lake, a mobile application prototyping tool that enables the creation of complex mobile applications with the same ease as paper prototyping. By leveraging the Wizard of Oz technique used in paper prototyping in our digital medium, we enable designers to prototype at the same low cost as paper, but at a much higher fidelity. Through a pilot study (N=6), we find that designers are able to gather organic in-context feedback from complex prototypes made with Lake.},

abstract = {Nowadays, speech is becoming a more common, if not standard, interface to technology. This can be seen in the trend of technology changes over the years. Increasingly, voice is used to control programs, appliances and personal devices within homes, cars, workplaces, and public spaces through smartphones and home assistant devices using Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Apple's Siri, and other proliferating technologies. However, most speech interfaces are not accessible for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing (DHH) people. In this paper, performances of current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with voices of DHH speakers are evaluated. ASR has improved over the years, and is able to reach Word Error Rates (WER) as low as 5-6% [1][2][3], with the help of cloud-computing and machine learning algorithms that take in custom vocabulary models. In this paper, a custom vocabulary model is used, and the significance of the improvement is evaluated when using DHH speech.},

abstract = {Power wheelchairs (PW) are an example of an assistive technology in that they are used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional capabilities of persons with disabilities [6]. As seen in [5] [3], the commercially available products do not provide any assistance beyond enhanced mobility. Furthermore, existing PW research fails at comprehensively noting an individual's challenges, such as navigating through narrow passages or fixing their broken wheelchairs. Instead, they focus mostly on novel interaction methods such as BCI, head and gaze control [9] [15]. In this paper, we explore these individual needs and show that PWs have the novel potential to become a smart wheelchair at an affordable price. Our research follows the double diamond (DD) process [2] and relies on the participatory design (PD) methodology [7], which addresses all stakeholders involved. Namely, we consider individuals with wheelchairs, the assistive technology research community, and the PW industry. For further insight we also contacted medical doctors, healthcare professionals, and non- profit organizations. We spent time getting to know these communities through interviews, surveys, demonstrations, and continuous user inputs, aligning our work to the PD tools. We found that individuals using wheelchairs overall desire safety, accessibility, and a durable design. Guided by these results, we designed a proof of concept (POC) system called the Affordable Smart Wheelchair (ASW) for indoor use. This kit implements full-autonomy in the form of indoor navigation from one room to another and to predetermined docking locations through voice control. It also has semi-autonomous functions in the form of manual joystick control augmented with real-time collision avoidance and staircase detection.},

Recent studies and anecdotal evidence has highlighted the potential of these technologies to serve as tools of bad eating behavior due to its focus on self-monitoring and calorie counting. The current research investigates on the potential of using social-orienting features of technology, specifically bandwagon and identity cues, to incentivize food-based nutrition (FBN) rather than a calorie-only approach. For this purpose, a 2 x 2 mixed factorial online experiment was conducted with bandwagon cue as a within-subject factor and identity cue as a between-subject factor. Results reveal that 67.6% of participants selected high bandwagon cue meals, regardless of its nutritional value. Bandwagon perception was the only significant predictor of meal selection, indicating that an increase in one unit improved the odds of an individual choosing a high bandwagon meal by 69%.},

There are numerous design studies on exploring multiple simultaneous designs, but few present interface solutions and system features for such exploration. To the best of my knowledge, no study probes exploring a large design space with multiple simultaneous states. The premise of my research is that, if designers can work directly with large numbers of designs with new representations and tools as part of the design workflow, we should expect new patterns and strategies to emerge and change the design process. Such task environments may present novel actions, task sequences, methods and techniques. What are new actions and techniques that would enable working seamlessly with multiple designs? My research aims to answer this (and similar) questions; and, more specifically, to uncover how designers' augment their work through spatial structuring of the task environment to reduce the cognitive cost of working with multiple simultaneous designs on a large work-surface. I conducted a lab experiment with nine designers. The results suggest design features for new front-end gallery interfaces for managing a large set of design variations while enabling simultaneous editing.},

However, older adults' maladaptation to exergames may occur due to the complexity of game tasks and interfaces. In this work, we show that familiarity can improve older adults' adaptation to exergames. The results of our first study indicate that older adults with higher level of familiarity to exergames exhibit higher level of motivation and ability. To maximize the effectiveness of exergames, it is helpful to provide older adults exergames which they are more familiar with. To evaluate the familiarity level of exergames, we propose a novel familiarity model with five factors, namely prior experience, positive emotion, repeated time, level of processing, and retention rate. Results from our second study show that the identified five factors have significant positive correlations with familiarity and there is a high positive correlation between familiarity levels and participants' satisfaction to the exergames.},

Users can also switch from this mode to normal typing mode. We also present an application of this input technique based on web browsers. A user study with nine participants who are familiar with keyboard input showed the input efficiency of GPK. We compared the typing efficiency of GPK with other special symbol typing methods. We could deploy this method to office environments where users have desktop computers with a keyboard only. It could also inspire future work of integrating this method into word processors, document preparation systems and web environments.},

abstract = {It is increasingly hard for adults and children alike to be attentive given the increasing amounts of information and distractions surrounding us. We have developed AttentivU: a device, in a socially acceptable form factor of a pair of glasses, that a person can put on in moments when he/she wants/needs to be attentive. The AttentivU glasses use electroencephalography (EEG) as well as Electrooculography (EOG) sensors to measure attention of a person in real-time and provide either audio or haptic feedback to the user when their attention is low, thereby nudging them to become engaged again. We have tested this device in workplace and classroom settings with over 80 subjects. We have performed experiments with people studying or working by themselves, viewing online lectures as well as listening to classroom lectures. The obtained results show that our device makes a person more attentive and produces improved learning and work performance outcomes.},

abstract = {TrussFormer is an integrated end-to-end system that allows users to 3D print large-scale kinetic structures, i.e., structures that involve motion and deal with inertial forces. TrussFormer builds on TrussFab, from which it inherits the ability to create static large-scale truss structures from 3D printed connectors and PET bottles. TrussFormer adds movement to these structures by placing linear actuators into them: either manually, wrapped in reusable components called assets, or by demonstrating the intended movement. TrussFormer verifies that the resulting structure is mechanically sound and will withstand the dynamic forces resulting from the motion. To fabricate the design, TrussFormer generates the underlying hinge system that can be printed on standard desktop 3D printers. We demonstrate TrussFormer with several example objects, including a 6 legged walking robot and a 4m tall animatronics dinosaur with 5 degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {Childhood obesity is one of the greatest public health challenges of the 21st century, although it could easily be prevented by regular physical activity. Exergames have been applauded for their potential to counteract this tendency in a playful and motivating manner. However, current solutions often lack a user-centered, interdisciplinary design approach covering the physical and virtual design levels. Consequently, motivational factors, attractiveness and effectiveness of these fitness games remain limited. To contribute to this topic, we - a team of sports scientist and game designers - developed the adaptive exergame Plunder Planet (Fig. 1) with and for children and young adolescents [1]. It can be played as single or cooperative multiplayer [2] with two different motion-based controllers that require either haptic or gesture-based input movements (Fig. 2) and trigger different (social) gameplay experiences. Based on the player's heart rate and in-game performance the game difficulty and complexity are continuously adjusted to provide a maximum attractive and effective experience.},

Issues such as these cannot be studied and understood by evaluating computer systems in isolation, but rather by taking a 'big picture' approach and examining their synergy with the broader social context. Traditional low-fidelity prototyping methods, such as interface mockups, are however poorly equipped to convey such broader settings. Video-based scenarios on the other hand are uniquely qualified to portray rich socio-technical ecosystems. By creating a set of provocative video scenarios that contextualize and provide a backdrop for prospective technologies, we thus seek to draw attention to the potentially important role that worldbuilding strategies might play in the future of low fidelity prototyping.},

To make fireworks more inclusive for Blind and Low-Vision (BLV) persons, we have developed a large-scale interactive tactile display that produces tactile fireworks. Fast dynamic tactile effects are created at high spatial resolution, using directable nozzles that spray water jets onto the rear of a flexible screen. The screen furthermore has back-projected visual content and touch interaction.A BLV focus group provided input during the development process, and a user study with BLV users showed that Feeling Fireworks is an enjoyable and meaningful experience. Quotes from blind users include "First time to get the feeling of what's happening in the sky. Fountain - awesome, first time had a feeling of that is what is a fountain.", "My mom always told me about fireworks but now I understand it." and "Now I know why people like fireworks."Beyond the Feeling Firework application, this is a novel approach for scalable tactile displays with potential for broader use.},

abstract = {The nature has myriad plant organisms, many of them carrying unique sensing and expression abilities. Plants can sense the environment, other living entities and regenerate, actuate or grow in response. Our interaction mechanisms and communication channels with such organisms in nature are subtle, unlike our interaction with digital devices. We propose a new convergent view of interaction design in nature by merging and powering our electronic functionalities with existing biological functions of plants.Cyborg Botany is a design exploration of deep technological integration within plants. Each desired synthetic function is grown, injected or carefully placed in conjunction with a plant's natural functions. With a nanowire grown inside the xylem of a plant [1, 2, 3, 4], we demonstrate its use as a touch sensor, motion sensor, antenna and more. We also demonstrate a software through which a user clicks on a plant's leaves to individual control their movement [6], and explore the use of plants as a display [5]. Our goal is to make use of a plant's own sensing and expressive abilities of nature for our interaction devices. Merging synthetic circuitry with plant's own physiology could pave a way to make these lifeforms responsive to our interactions and their ubiquitous sustainable deployment.},

This allows CATS to produce paintings that would be difficult to create with traditional art supplies or existing software. We evaluated the effectiveness of CATS by asking artists to integrate the tool into their creative practice for two weeks; their paintings and feedback demonstrate that CATS is an expressive tool which can be used to create richly textured paintings.},

To that end, we are organizing a CHI 2019 symposium dedicated exclusively to HCI education: EduCHI 2019: Global Perspectives on HCI Education. The symposium will focus on the canons of HCI education in 2019 and beyond. It will offer a venue for HCI educators across disciplinary and geographical borders to discuss, dissect, and debate HCI teaching and learning. Through keynote addresses, paper presentations, and a panel discussion, we aim to discuss current and future HCI education trends, curricula, pedagogies, teaching practices, and diverse and inclusive HCI education.

Job hunting, interviewing, navigating new contexts such as a junior academic position, applying for funding as a first time project investigator, learning to adapt to the culture of an industry-based workplace, supervising graduate students or full-time employees - these are just a few of the scenarios recent PhD graduates find themselves in. Within HCI, one may encounter more discipline-specific challenges, such as keeping up with the CHI publication cycles while taking on new administrative duties. The CHI community, however, strives to be collectively supportive and inclusive of researchers at all stages of their career - this is even more important as many of our design approaches are rooted in empathy for and empowerment of participants. By more actively supporting each other as researchers in our career paths, we can better grow as a community, and reflect it back into our collective body of practice. The Early Career Development Symposium has been proposed (and held yearly since 2016) to provide a more formal mentoring venue that reflects our aims as a community to more meaningfully support each other.},

The promise of mental health care delivered through technology (eMentalHealth) to provide personalized care offers a promising solution that has galvanized interest worldwide. However, in order to ensure that eMentalHealth is scalable and sustainable, service delivery and health and social care policies need to be integrated into the design of technology interventions. This will require new forms of interdisciplinary collaborations that we hope to foster in this symposium. Thus, in this fourth in our series of Symposia on Computing and Mental Health, the focus will beon the intersection of the communities innovating in this space: patients, designers, data scientists, clinicians, researchers, computer scientists, developers, and entrepreneurs guided by core medical ethical principles including respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Our aim is thus to enable the vision of better mental health through ethical innovation powered by the right collaborations},

abstract = {Commercial drones have recently been developed to encompass use cases beyond aerial photography and videography. Researchers have explored wider applications of drones including using drones as social companions, as key components in virtual environments, as assistive tools for people with disabilities, and even as sport companions. However the uptake of research in Human-Drone Interaction (HDI) also brought forth a plethora of challenges that are unique to this platform. While drones were initially considered as flying robots, recent works have shown that traditional Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) methodologies cannot simply be applied to HDI. For example, how do we deal with privacy and safety concerns associated with drones in public space? What is the appropriate methodology to evaluate HDI applications? How do the size, altitude, and speed of drones influence their perception? The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry to identify: 1) novel HDI applications, and 2) key challenges in this area to drive research in the coming decade. The long-term goal is to create a strong interdisciplinary research community that includes researchers and practitioners from HCI, HRI, Ubiquitous Computing, Interaction Techniques, User Privacy, and Design.},

abstract = {ArabHCI initiative was inaugurated in a CHI17 SIG Meeting that brought together 45+ HCI Arab/non-Arab researchers/practitioners who are conducting/interested in HCI within Arab communities. The meeting started an ongoing dialogue that recognizes the fact that HCI is still in its infancy in the Arab world and explores challenges and opportunities for shaping the future of HCI in the region. The meeting was further followed by three successful meetings in SIGCHI sponsored events that included general discussions about the state of HCI research in Arab countries, and a thematic discussion on exploring participatory design practices with Arab communities. In this workshop, we build on the momentum generated by our previous meetings, and attempt to draw a roadmap for HCI research and practice in Arab world. Our goal is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss case studies from their own work, share experiences and lessons learned, and envision the future of the field in this area. We plan to share the results of our discussions and research agenda with the wider CHI community through various social and scholarly channels.},

abstract = {Many healthcare systems around the world are noted as fragmented, complex and low-quality, leaving patients and caregivers with no choice but to engage in "infrastructuring work" to make it function for them. However, the work patients do to construct their functioning health service systems often remain invisible, with very little resources and technologies available to assist them. This workshop aims to bring together researchers, health practitioners, and patients to examine, discuss, and brainstorm ways to re-envision our healthcare service systems from the perspective of patients and caregivers. We aim to unpack the types of work that patients and caregivers do to reconfigure, reconstruct and adapt the healthcare infrastructure, and to brainstorm design solutions that can provide better infrastructuring assistance to them.},

Digital resources can provide a wealth of information, present opportunities for socialising, and even assist in tracking a baby's development. However, women are often juggling the role of motherhood with other commitments, such as work. The aim of this workshop is to understand the digital support needs and practices during parenthood from the perspective of employed mothers. We are interested in exploring the ways that women utilise the technologies which have been designed to support mothers, and specifically, the importance of work-life balance and the various roles that mothers play. There is a need to better understand and identify which technologies are being used to support working women through their motherhood journey, and ensure a healthy transition to support women's changing identities.},

Beyond the passengers of the vehicle, it also impacts others, for example by lowering the barriers to visit distant relatives. In line with the CHI2019 conference theme, our aim is to weave the threads of vehicle automation by gathering people from different disciplines, cultures, sectors, communities, and backgrounds (designers, researchers, and practitioners) in one community to look into concrete future scenarios of driving automation and its impact on HCI research and practice. Using design fiction, we will look into the future and use this fiction to guide discussions on how automated driving can be made a technology that works for people and society.},

Attention has also been called to the social challenges these systems bring, particularly in how they might fail or even actively disadvantage marginalised social groups, or how their opacity might make them difficult to oversee and challenge. In the context of these and other challenges, the roles of humans working in tandem with these systems will be important, yet the HCI community has been only a quiet voice in these debates to date. This workshop aims to catalyse and crystallise an agenda around HCI's engagement with AI systems. Topics of interest include explainable and explorable AI; documentation and review; integrating artificial and human intelligence; collaborative decision making; AI/ML in HCI Design; diverse human roles and relationships in AI systems; and critical views of AI.},

This workshop intends to bring these communities together to increase awareness on recent advances in blind navigation assistive technologies, benefit from diverse perspectives and expertises, discuss open research challenges, and explore avenues for multi-disciplinary collaborations. Interactions are fostered through a panel on Open Challenges and Avenues for Interdisciplinary Collaboration, Minute-Madness presentations, and a Hands-On Session where workshop participants can hack (design or prototype) new solutions to tackle open research challenges. An expected outcome is the emergence of new collaborations and research directions that can result in novel assistive technologies to support independent blind navigation.},

The rapid adoption of this technology puts it at the forefront of systems that impact the lives of many, yet the consequences of this adoption are not fully understood. Therefore, work at the intersection of people's needs and ML systems is more relevant than ever. This area of work, dubbed Human-Centered Machine Learning (HCML), re-thinks ML research and systems in terms of human goals. HCML gathers an interdisciplinary group of HCI and ML practitioners, each bringing their unique, yet related perspectives. This one-day workshop is a successor of Gillies et al. 2016 CHI Workshop and focuses on recent advancements and emerging areas in HCML. We aim to discuss different perspectives on these areas and articulate a coordinated research agenda for the XXI century.},

More recently, many technology companies have begun to introduce digital wellbeing features, such as for managing time spent and for encouraging breaks in use. These are in the context of, and likely in response to, renewed concerns in the media about technology dependency and even addiction. The promotion of technology abstinence is also increasingly widespread, e.g., via digital detoxes. Given that digital technologies are an important and valuable feature of many people's lives, digital wellbeing features are arguably preferable to abstinence. However, how these are defined and designed is something that needs to be explored further. In this one-day workshop we welcome both industry and academic participants to discuss what digital wellbeing means, who is responsible for it, and whether and how we should design for it going forward.},

abstract = {The use of speech as an interaction modality has grown considerably through the integration of Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPAs- e.g. Siri, Google Assistant) into smartphones and voice based devices (e.g. Amazon Echo). However, there remain significant gaps in using theoretical frameworks to understand user behaviours and choices and how they may applied to specific speech interface interactions. This part-day multidisciplinary workshop aims to critically map out and evaluate theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches across a number of disciplines and establish directions for new paradigms in understanding speech interface user behaviour. In doing so, we will bring together participants from HCI and other speech related domains to establish a cohesive, diverse and collaborative community of researchers from academia and industry with interest in exploring theoretical and methodological issues in the field.},

New immersive technologies present many opportunities for enhancing humans' experiences with data interaction, but also present many challenges, a subset of which are specific to the analytics domain. This workshop is centered around a set of group prototyping sessions, aimed at identifying new approaches to existing design challenges. In addition to giving perspective on opportunities and difficulties faced by future designers, these exercises will also explore new prototyping methods and tools for the design of interactive data-centric interfaces.

The workshop will address: 1) convergence of the two approaches at the intersection of HCI, 2) updates to theoretical and methodological foundations, 3) bringing disparate modeling communities to CHI, and 4) sharing datasets, code, and best practices. This workshop seeks to establish Computational Modeling as a theoretical foundation for work in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to model the human accurately across domains and support design, optimization, and evaluation of user interfaces to solve a variety of human-centered problems.},

SIIDs are a great concern when considering the ubiquitousness of technology in a wide range of contexts. Considering our daily reliance on technology, and mobile technology in particular, it is increasingly important that we fully understand and model how SIIDs occur. Similarly, we must identify appropriate methods for sensing and adapting technology to reduce the effects of SIIDs. In this workshop, we will bring together researchers working on understanding, sensing, modelling, and adapting technologies to ameliorate the effects of SIIDs. This workshop will provide a venue to identify existing research gaps, new directions for future research, and opportunities for future collaboration.},

For instance, advances in computer vision and face, gaze, facial expression, body and hand-gesture recognition have enabled new ways of distal interactivity with digital content. Such possibilities are only just being adopted by advertisers and retailers, yet, they face important challenges e.g. the lack of a commonly accepted gesture, facial expressions or call-to-action set. Another common issue here is the absence of active tactile stimuli. Mid-air haptic interfaces can help alleviate these problems and aid in defining a gesture set, informing users about their interaction via haptic feedback loops, and enhancing the overall user experience. This workshop aims to examine the possibilities opened up by these technologies and discuss opportunities in designing the next generation of interactive digital signage kiosks.},

For example, HCI is exploring agency delegation and automation to support the user in managing the deluge of IoT data, make decisions, or even take actions on behalf of the user, while economic models are being proposed to drive sharing economy services. This creates new problems including how to design appropriate solutions for uncertain and dynamic human behaviour, how to ensure resources are distributed fairly, and how to ensure that the user can understand system actions and ultimately remains in control. These issues are becoming more pertinent as the IoT diversifies into safety-critical domains such as manufacturing and healthcare. This one-day workshop intends to bring together the CHI community to explore the interactional, socio-cultural, ethical, and practical challenges and approaches that these new domains raise for the IoT. With this, we want to consider how such approaches could be integrated to achieve more sustainable, inclusive, or effective interactions.},

abstract = {Social connections and cultural aspects play important roles in shaping an individual's preferences. For instance, people tend to select friends with similar music preferences. Furthermore, preferences and friending are influenced by cultural aspects. Recommender systems may benefit from these phenomena by using knowledge about the nature of social ties to better tailor recommendations to an individual. Focusing on the specifities of music preferences, we study user connections on Last.fm---an online social network for music. We identify those countries whose users are mainly connected within the same country, and those countries that are characterized by cross-country user connections.

abstract = {This paper presents Character Alive, a tangible system designed to improve early Chinese literacy acquisition for Mandarin-speaking children at-risk for dyslexia by enabling high-level interaction. Character Alive uses the multisensory training method to teach children the reading and writing of Chinese characters and words. The core design features of our system are augmented dynamic color cues, 2D radical cards and handwriting cards with tactile cues, and multimedia content such as character animations. Character Alive was built on our previous work on designing tangible and augmented reality reading and writing systems for children at-risk for dyslexia in English. Our previous work has demonstrated that dynamic color cues can draw children's attention to key characteristics of letter-sound-correspondences and two-hand actions with tangible letters help children to better solve spelling tasks. We present the design rationale, the design and implementation of the Character Alive system, and the future plan on evaluating the system.},

Self-awareness is healthy for a diverse and dynamic community, allowing it to anticipate and respond to emerging themes. Instead of using a traditional topic modelling approach to analyze the text of the papers, we adopt a social network analysis approach by analyzing the citation network of papers. After constructing such a citation network, community detection is applied in order to cluster papers into different groups. The keywords of these groups are found to represent different research themes in human-computer interaction, while the growth or decline of these groups is visualized by their paper shares over time. Lastly, we contribute a visualization tool for exploring emerging trends within our community, which can be used to predict likely topics at future CHI conferences.},

The system implementation includes a 2D magnetic peristaltic pump, a spectral sensor, and a heat transfer plate. MFB is an affordable, safe, and sterile system for hands-on experimentation with live microorganisms. Our system supports temperature control, liquid circulation, measurement of optical density, and a web interface for remote control and monitoring. Our first experiment demonstrates the three phases of bacterial growth: initial lag phase, the rapid-growth log phase, and the stationary phase.},

The programmability of video and audio assets enables new creative possibilities that do not exist in traditional timeline-based video editing software nor in existing programming platforms. Drawing from Seymour Papert's assertion that all learning is an act of bricolage - i.e., a process of constructing knowledge while dialoguing back and forth with creative materials - we describe the design of an initial prototype of Bricoleur, which emphasizes tinkerability as a primary design goal.},

Results indicate that the type of user task influences participant preferences and perceptions. For the auditory task, as the following angle increased, participants were more satisfied with the robot's following behavior. For the visual task, as the following angle increased, participants were less satisfied with the robot's following behavior. In addition, participants were more perceptive of the robot's following behavior for the auditory task compared to the visual task. Additional research is required to better understand whether human preferences and perceptions depend on task modality or task complexity.},

In this respect, we propose and evaluate a video-based system for helping referees in powerlifting to make better decisions. Results reveal promising accuracy rates of the proposed system.

Despite the intended objectivity of the methodology, we find elements of bias in the data-driven personas. The bias is highest when doing an exact match comparison, and the bias decreases when comparing at age or gender level. The bias also decreases when increasing the number of generated personas. For example, the smaller number of personas resulted in underrepresentation of female personas. This suggests that a higher number of personas gives a more balanced representation of the user population and a smaller number increases biases. Researchers and practitioners developing data-driven personas should consider the possibility of algorithmic bias, even unintentional, in their personas by comparing the personas against the underlying raw data.},

While preliminary, the results/feedback has been consistently to confirm the potential usefulness and acceptability of HasAnswers. Next steps include applying the results of the latest user testing followed by pilot testing.

There are more than 3.7 million Syrian refugees in Turkey. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have a critical role in refugees' lives, their access to services, and integration into communities. In this study, we investigated the barriers NGOs encounter in their work with refugees and the types of information communication technologies they use in the process. Semi-structured interviews with participants from eight Turkish NGOs revealed that digital technologies have a fundamental role in their activities. They use them in three main ways including as tools to help them become knowledge brokers between Turkish communities and refugee communities. Our findings provide insights on NGOs' digital technology use and pave a path for future studies.},

In this article, we present a co-design study aimed at informing the design of interactive communication means between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Conducted in two stages with the local community --which is accustomed to the AV's ecosystem and has interacted with it on a daily basis-- the study highlights the interactive experiences of road users, and furnishes contextualized design guidelines to bridge the communication with the pedestrians.},

The framework proposes to see designing for relevance as developing ways of integrating meaning-making, play and acceptable visitor effort across all these stages. It is intended to provide sensitizing concepts for use in further research on designing for relevance, as well as in design-related activities such as crafting requirements for new museum experiences, analyzing existing museum experiences and developing new museum experiences.},

We propose an alternative interface to explore EPCs, called immersive process models, which aims to transform the exploration of EPCs into a multisensory virtual reality journey. To make EPC exploration more enjoyable, interactive and memorable, we propose a concept that spatializes EPCs by mapping traditional 2D graphs to 3D virtual environments. EPC graph nodes are represented by room-scale floating platforms and explored by users through natural walking. Our concept additionally enables users to experience important node types and the information flow through passive haptic interactions. Complementarily, gamification aspects aim to support the communication of logical dependencies within explored processes. This paper presents the concept of immersive process models and discusses future research directions.},

In this work we investigate how people engage with the posts by authoritative accounts that fall into five social roles-politicians, government agencies, media, weather experts, and humanitarian organizations. More specifically, we explore whether in their disaster-time sensemaking activities social media users engage with the content from different types of authoritative sources differently, and why. We find that tweets by politicians garner most replies and shares, but not due to prevalence in them of tweet features that facilitate visibility and engagement-hashtags, URLs, and images. We find that while higher popularity of political accounts plays a role in higher engagement, it does not fully explain the differences. Preliminary qualitative analysis suggests that politicized event-related posts by politicians and politicized public response to their even innocuous tweets may affect engagement.},

In addition, we propose a research agenda for evaluating the model.},

Three design instances are presented. From and within those are three conceptual directions drawn and exemplified. Conditional availability involves tuning the availability of an interaction to certain geographic locations, environmental conditions and time-of-day in strive for particular aesthetics. Erratic and dubious presence is about making interactions unpredictable and/or feeding a doubt whether the user is engaged in an interaction or not, in strive for confusion and startle. Sensorial evidence of interaction is a way of thinking about narratives within an interaction through elements of planning, exploration and suddenness in strive for experiential qualities like anticipation, surprise, and fascination of discovery. My felt experiences of a two-day camping trip were used as a design resource. Reflections of these experiences were used in the design and concept development through visualizations, textual narratives, technical implementation detailing, and thematic analysis.

To our knowledge, there is no design tool that focuses on facilitating the exploration of a variety of manipulation and aiding generation of ideas for manipulation. To address this gap, we designed Idea Bits, a tangible design tool consisting of interactive physical artifacts that enable users to experience a set of manipulations. These artifacts are coupled with digital examples of tangible systems and technical implementation guidance to help users understand how to implement the manipulations. Our work contributes knowledge about the generation of ideas for manipulation and will be useful to tangible interaction design students, instructors, practitioners, and researchers.},

The results of the workshop emphasized the need for reflecting critically on how we perceive menstruation when designing and how viewing menstruation as a problem might perpetuate taboos and distance women's experiences from their bodies. We aim to contribute to the ongoing discussion on designing for women's health in HCI by suggesting implications for researchers and practitioners.},

abstract = {Voice Conversational Agents (VCAs) are increasingly becoming part of our daily life. Calling them by their names can solve more than just a problem of efficiency in interaction between users and VCAs, but also can cast them as actors capable of playing a role in a relationship. However, due to the immature state of the technology and its related services, such relationships between users and VCAs can be limited in practice. To broaden the scope in designing different relationships, this study explores VCAs depicted in sci-fi movies. Sci-fi is not purely based on fantasy, but also is a social reflection on technology, which in turn can inspire design researchers to understand and speculate the complexity of VCAs. Through community sourcing with sci-fi enthusiasts, 43 Sci-fi VCAs were deduced. A movie event was also organized to discuss the role of VCAs. Finally, this paper presents several possible design insights for designing the role of VCAs.},

While physical activity trackers could leverage visual quotes, empirical studies of activity tracking in HCI research have paid little attention to this phenomenon and their potential effects on motivation. In this work, we conducted an online experiment (129 participants) to evaluate the impact of aesthetic appeal in motivational text messages as it relates to extrinsic identified behavior regulation. This is the type of motivation linked to the initial adoption of exercise behavior. The results of our study demonstrate that a perceived motivating text message presented with different levels of aesthetic appeal - ugly, neutral, beautiful - has the same impact on the motivation linked to short-term exercise (extrinsic identified behavior regulation). In other words, the perceived aesthetic appeal did not influence the motivating capability of textual messages for encouraging physical activity.},

We conducted an explorative study to understand how personal experience of confabulation can contribute to the constitution of the body of possible worlds and to explore the potential of using mixed everyday soundscapes as a medium to trigger possible-world-experience. The result shows that these "counterfactual soundscapes" can create self-convinced experiences of counterpart self, which indicates a reflexive but fictional self across possible worlds. Based on these findings, we proposed the model of counterpart self that accounts for reflexive speculation in possible worlds and made a research artifact, the Confabulation Radio, as our attempt to inquire into this phenomenon.},

However, according to a Herbalife research in 2018 [4], around 25% of all Taiwanese lack the habit of eating breakfast every day. Our research starts to explore the role breakfast plays in people's morning routine, as well as the morning expectations and experiences of different lifestyles. The end goal is to create designs that give people a different perspective to engage with a good experience of the beginning of their day, to wonder about how their morning could be, not just about breakfast but about morning experience as well.},

Since the CUI is a voice-mediated interface, users naturally form an image of the CA's persona through the voice. Because that image affects users' interaction with CAs while using a CUI, we tried to understand users' perception via drawing method. We asked 31 users to draw an image of the CA that communicates with the user. Through a qualitative analysis of the collected drawings and interviews, we could see the various types of CA personas perceived by users and found design factors that influenced users' perception. Our findings help us understand persona perception, and that will provide designers with design implications for creating an appropriate persona.},

Looking for a tool that could support non-designers' divergent thinking to creatively offset familiar solutions while providing starter suggestions, we hypothesized that LEGO pieces could replace sketching. In a comparative lab experiment, 36 participants did two conceptual ideations of Web interfaces, one using paper/pen, the other LEGO, in random sequence. The 72 resulting interfaces were assessed on their fluency, flexibility, elaboration and originality according to Guilford [6] and Torrance's [9] divergent thinking framework. Our main finding is that LEGO could substitute sketching for non-designers; the 3D figurative, constructive pieces provide a stimulating visual representation that supports divergent thinking by offering alternate meanings, generating a greater number of elements to react to, thus enhancing the use of analogies.},

Moreover, user feedback becomes readily available thanks to modern software engineering tools, such as app stores and open source platforms. Using Firefox Reality as a case study, we explored the major types of VR usability issues raised in these platforms. We found that 77% of usability feedbacks can be mapped to Nielsen's heuristics while few were mappable to VR-specific heuristics. This result indicates that Nielsen's heuristics could potentially help developers address the usability of this VR application in its early development stage.

abstract = {Augmenting arbitrary physical objects with digital content leads to the missing interface problem, because those objects were never designed to incorporate such digital content and so they lack a user interface. A review of related work reveals that current approaches fail due to limited detection fidelity and spatial resolution. Our proposal, based on Google Soli's radar sensing technology, is designed to detect micro-gestures on objects with sub-millimeter precision. Preliminary results with a custom gesture set show that Soli's core features and traditional machine learning models (Random Forest and Support Vector Machine) do not lead to robust recognition accuracy, and so more advanced techniques should be used instead, possibly incorporating additional sensor features.},

abstract = {Internet of Things systems are complex to develop. They are required to exhibit various features and run across several environments. Software developers have to deal with this heterogeneity both when configuring the development and execution environments and when writing the code. Meanwhile, computational notebooks have been gaining prominence due to their capability to consolidate text, executable code, and visualizations in a single document. Although they are mainly used in the field of data science, the characteristics of such notebooks could make them suitable to support the development of IoT systems as well. This work proposes an IoT-tailored literate computing approach in the form of a computational notebook. We present a use case of a typical IoT system involving several interconnected components and describe the implementation of a computational notebook as a tool to support its development. Finally, we point out the opportunities and limitations of this approach.},

abstract = {The use of Augmented Reality (AR) systems has been shown to be beneficial in guiding users through structured tasks when compared to traditional 2D instructions. In this work, we begin to examine the potential of such systems for home improvement tasks, which present some specific challenges (e.g., operating at both large and small scales, and coping with the diversity in home environments). Specifically, we investigate user performance of a common low-level task in this domain. We conducted a user study where participants mark points on a planar surface (as if to place a nail, or measure from) guided only by virtual cues. We observed that participants position themselves so as to minimize parallax by kneeling, leaning, or side-stepping, and when doing so, they are able to mark points with a high degree of accuracy. In cases where the targets fall above one's line of vision, participants are less able to compensate and make larger errors. We discuss initial insights from these observations and participant feedback, and present the first set of challenges that we believe designers and developers will face in this domain.},

abstract = {Despite almost all software development involving application programming interfaces (APIs), there is surprisingly little work on how people use APIs and how to evaluate and improve the usability of an API. One possible way of investigating the usability of APIs is through the user's mental model of the API. Through discussions with the developers and UX practitioners at Google along with our own evaluations, a distributed data processing API called Apache Beam has been identified as difficult to use and learn. In our on-going study, we investigate methods for understanding users' mental models of distributed data processing and how this understanding can lead to design insights for Beam and its documentation. We present our novel approach, which combines a background interview with two natural programming elicitation segments: the first designed for participants to express a high level mental model of a data processing API while the second asks questions contextualized to a data processing task to see how participants apply their conceptual understanding to a more specific situation. Our method shows promise as pilot participants expressed a "dataflow" mental model that matched one way that Beam has been described, resulting in a potential design modification.},

For a given voice message, the tool selects the most representative emoji from 64 most commonly used emojis. We conducted a pilot study with 34 participants. In our study, 159 utterances were labeled with emojis by our tool. The emotion restoration effect was evaluated. The results indicate that the proposed tool effectively compensates for the emotion loss.},

Similarly to other sports, the simplest way to learn bouldering skill is to mimic professional's motion. However, ordinary beginner boulders cannot learn to coaches, so that they learn by themselves or tutorial videos. Even if they managed, bouldering has a communication difficulty between a trainee and a trainer, that is, climbers cannot mimic the trainer's movement in parallel. Accordingly, we considered a video feedback system would be useful for beginners and suggested InterPoser: a novel visualization system for intermediate motion between a beginner climber and a more experienced. InterPoser receives two videos of different subjects climbing the sample problem and generates an intermediate movement. In addition, this motion is transferred into realistic images of the climber. The proposed system is expected to support beginner to acquire more detailed observation and understanding of the motion.},

This work evaluates mental models that experts and non-expert users have of autonomous driving to provide an explanation of the vehicle's past driving behavior. We identified a target mental model that enhances the user's mental model by adding key components from the mental model experts have. To construct this target mental model and to evaluate a prototype of an explanation visualization we conducted interviews (N=8) and a user study (N=16). The explanation consists of abstract visualizations of different elements, representing the autonomous system's components. We explore the relevance of the explanation's individual elements and their influence on the user's situation awareness. The results show that displaying the detected objects and their predicted motion was most important to understand a situation. After seeing the explanation, the user's level of situation awareness increased significantly.},

While natural speech can capture a rich variety of commands, verbal input is poorly suited to finer grained and real-time control of continuous actions such as short and precise motion commands. For these types of operations, continuous non-verbal speech is more suitable, but it lacks the naturalness and vocabulary breadth of verbal speech. In this work, we propose to combine the two types of vocal input by extending the last vowel of a verbal command to support real-time and smooth control of robot actions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel hybrid speech input method in a beverage-pouring task, where users instruct a robot arm to pour specific quantities of liquid into a cup. A user evaluation reveals that hybrid speech improves on simple verbal-only commands.},

Their main focus is on mission management via the UAV's payload, yet, they continuously interact with the command and control (C2) map to obtain SA and make decisions. C2 maps, shared among forces in the environment, are cluttered and overloaded with information. We aim to develop a map display machine-learning based spatial-temporal algorithm that will identify the most relevant information items to the UAV operator and deliver the right visualized information on the C2 map at the right timing. Towards the algorithm development, experiments for collecting user-based importance data were conducted and analysed. For this, a designated UAV C2 Experimental System (UCES) has been developed. Results show high feasibility for the prediction model, allowing to move forward with the following steps of the algorithm development.},

We created Pirate Plunder, a novel educational block-based programming game, that aims to teach children to reduce smells by reusing code in Scratch. This work describes an experimental study designed to measure the efficacy of Pirate Plunder with children aged 10 and 11. The findings were that children who played the game were then able to use custom blocks (procedures) to reuse code in Scratch, compared to non-programming and programming control groups.},

abstract = {We analyze hate speech toward the MENA players as a form of toxic behavior in League of Legends in-game and forum chats. We find that this kind of toxicity: (1) is initiated by one or two players; (2) sparks from criticizing the skills of team members; (3) can be elevated by frustration with game elements and hardware; and (4) can turn into personal clashes. There is also non-toxic use of abusive language, which stresses the importance of context-aware analysis (i.e., interpreting what is actually toxic). Finally, we find evidence that the type of toxicity varies by server location, advising gaming companies to consider the location of players when setting up policies to mitigate hate speech.},

For constructionist-like kits that use gaming, many are focused on designing and programming games that are single player, and few explore using physical and craft-like approaches that move beyond the screen and single player experiences. Moving beyond the screen to incorporate physical sensors into the creation of gaming experiences provides new opportunities for learning about concepts in a variety of areas in computer science and making. In this early work, we elucidate our design goals and prototype for a mini-arcade system that builds upon principles in constructionist gaming - making games to learn programming - as well as physical computing.},

abstract = {Usertesting is commonly employed in games user research (GUR) to understand the experience of players interacting with digital games. However, recruitment and testing with human users can be laborious and resource-intensive, particularly for independent developers. To help mitigate these obstacles, we are developing a framework for simulated testing sessions with agents driven by artificial intelligence (AI). Specifically, we aim to imitate the navigation of human players in a virtual world. By mimicking the tendency of users to wander, explore, become lost, and so on, these agents may be used to identify basic issues with a game's world and level design, enabling informed iteration earlier in the development process. Here, we detail our progress in developing a framework for configurable agent navigation and simple visualization of simulated data. Ultimately, we hope to provide a basis for the development of a tool for simulation-driven usability testing in games.},

Current applications for young children focus on media playing, answering questions, and highly-structured activities.

In this paper, we describe our first step in pursuing this opportunity with 24 design sessions guided by a partnership with eight 3 to 4 year old children. In a social play setting, we learned that children wanted to physically interact with the voice agents and VUIs could redirect behaviors and promote social interactions.},

Common solutions include white canes and guide dogs. White canes are useful in object detection, but require physically touching objects with the cane, which may be undesired. Guide dogs allow navigation without touching objects in the vicinity, but cannot help in object detection. By addressing this gap, employing a user-centric research approach, we aim to find a solution to improve the independence of VI people. Here, we began by initially gathering requirements through online questionnaires. Working from this, we build a prototype of a glove that alerts its users when an obstacle is detected at the pointed position; we call this EyeR. Lastly, we evaluated EyeR with VI users and found out that in use our prototype provides real time feedback and is helpful in navigation. We also provide future recommendations for VI prototypes from our participants, who would additionally like the device to recognise objects.},

Specifically, many video streaming technologies require input devices and content browsers that are inaccessible to individuals with sensory and physical impairments and do not work with their current assistive technologies. Our team of engineers, designers, and clinicians took an inclusive approach to assessing and redesigning these streaming service products, with the aim of creating more universally accessible experiences. We recruited 9 participants with diverse abilities to evaluate the accessibility of a large telecommunication company's commercially available video streaming products. This evaluation revealed significant accessibility barriers and informed the design of a participatory design activity to create accessible remote-controls, an onboarding assistance prototype, and a content browsing prototype that is screen reader accessible and supports audio descriptions. We evaluated these accessible prototypes with 11 additional participants and found they were more accessible, flexible, and enjoyable to use compared to the off-the shelf products. In this paper we summarize these findings and discuss how future streaming technology must support customization and follow established accessibility guidelines and standards.},

abstract = {How can people learn advanced motor skills such as front flips and tennis swings without starting from a young age? The answer, following the work of Masters et. al., we believe, is implicitly. Implicit learning is associated with higher retention and knowledge transfer, but that is unable to be explicitly articulated as a set of rules. To achieve implicit learning is difficult, but may be taught using obscured feedback - that is feedback that provides little enough information such that a user does not overfit a mental model of their target action. We have designed an auditory feedback system - AUFLIP - that describes high level properties of an advanced movement using a simplified and validated physics model of the flip. We further detail the implementation of a wearable system, optimized placement procedure, and takeoff capture strategy to realize this model. With an audio cue pattern that conveys this high-level, obscured objective, the system is integrated into a gymnastics-training environment with professional coaches teaching novice adults how to perform front flips. We perform a pilot user study training front flips, evaluating using a matched-pair comparison.},

It can be challenging, however to involve end-users when designing healthcare technology, due to the limited availability of patients because of their condition or treatment. This is especially difficult when co-designing healthcare technology, which often requires several end-users to collaborate in group activities such as ideation exercises and brainstorms. In an exploration of co-design methods that do not require participants to be co-located, this paper describes initial results from a small-scale ideation workshop in the context of fertility treatment. Preliminary data analysis suggests that user-generated card-based ideation could be used to inspire ideation while transferring knowledge and ideas between participants who are not co-located. This approach could benefit researchers in several healthcare technology settings that use co-design, and other domains where availability of participants is limited.},

There is an increasing global research effort into strategies for early clinic-based diagnosis at the stage where patients present with mild memory problems.

This paper presents the ongoing development of an augmented reality system using HoloLens that is designed to test an early onset of Alzheimer's disease. The most important aspects in the early AD diagnostics are the symptoms that appear to be connected with early memory loss, in particular spatial memory. The ability to store and retrieve the memory of a particular event involving an association between items such as the place and the object properties is incorporated in a game environment.},

abstract = {Prolonged sedentary behavior contributes to many chronic diseases. An appropriate reminder could help screen-based workers to reduce their prolonged sedentary behavior. The fixed-duration point-of-choice prompt has been frequently used in related work. However, this prompting system has several drawbacks. In this paper, we propose the SedentaryBar, a context-aware reminding system using an always-on progress bar to show the duration of a working session, as an alternative to the prompt. The new reminding system uses both users' keyboard/mouse events on the computer and the state-of-the-art computer vision algorithm with the webcam to detect users' presence, which makes the system more accurate and intelligent. Our evaluation study compared the SedentaryBar and the prompt using subjective and objective measurements. After using each method for a week respectively, more participants preferred the SedentaryBar. The participants' perceived interruption and usefulness also suggested the SedentaryBar was more popular during the study. However, the logged data of the participants' working durations indicated the prompt was more effective in reducing their sedentary behavior.},

While technology-based weight loss interventions have the potential to be very engaging, short-term approaches showed limited success.

In this paper we lay the basis for our approach towards a multimodal health intervention for young adults: we present formative work based on interviews and a design workshop with 26 young adults. We discuss our intervention at the intersection of user feedback, empirical evidence from previous work, and behavior change theory.},

abstract = {Family member involvement has been shown to be key to the well-being and recovery of patients in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU), but they often find themselves overwhelmed and in an emotionally heightened state. ICU care teams, especially nurses, are typically considered to be in the best position to help and provide support to family members of patients. However, the heavy workload, lack of time, and personal interaction styles can make it difficult for them to be receptive to family member needs. To understand how current aids in the ICU are used and the challenges associated with them, we conducted 22 interviews with both family members and the care team. We also created prototypes of family-centered aids through a co-design session to reveal the opportunities that emerge for technology to facilitate family member support in the ICU without adding additional burdens on the care team.},

MoveMIDI's virtual interface contributes to solving problems difficult to solve with hardware MIDI controller interfaces such as customized positioning and instantiation of interface elements, and accurate, simultaneous control of independent parameters. MoveMIDI's positional interaction mirrors interaction with some physical acoustic instruments and provides visualization for an audience.

Today much of this technology is enjoyed by gadget enthusiasts and early adaptors, but in the foreseeable future many people will become dependent on smart devices and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, desired or not. To support people with various levels of computer skills in mastering smart appliances as found, e.g., in smart homes, we propose the 'magic paradigm' for programming networked devices. Our work can be regarded as a playful 'experiment' towards democratizing IoT technology. It explores how we can program interactive behavior by simple pointing gestures using a tangible 'magic wand'. While the 'magic paradigm' removes barriers in programming by waiving conventional coding, it simultaneously raises questions about complexity: what kind of tasks can be addressed by this kind of 'tangible programming', and can people handle it as tasks become complex? We report the design rationale of a prototypical instantiation of the 'magic paradigm' including preliminary findings of a first user trial.},

Recipients, too, feel a pressure to respond even during inopportune moments. A messaging assistant which could respond with relevant contextual information on behalf of individuals while they are unavailable might reduce the pressure to respond immediately and help put the sender at ease. By modelling attentiveness to messaging, we aim to (1) predict instances when a user is not able to attend to an incoming message within reasonable time and (2) identify what contextual factors can explain the user's attentiveness---or lack thereof---to messaging. In this work, we investigate two approaches to modelling attentiveness: a general approach in which data from a group of users is combined to form a single model for all users; and a personalized approach, in which an individual model is created for each user. Evaluating both models, we observed that on average, with just seven days of training data, the personalized model can outperform the generalized model in terms of both accuracy and F-measure for predicting inattentiveness. Further, we observed that in majority of cases, the messaging patterns identified by the attentiveness models varied widely across users. For example, the top feature in the generalized model appeared in the top five features for only 41% of the individual personalized models.},

Rather than addressing regular day to day activities, we focus on a more complex type of full-body movement - dance. For this purpose, a new dataset was created which contains short excerpts of the performances of professional dancers who interpreted four emotional states: anger, happiness, sadness, and insecurity. Fourteen minutes of motion capture data are used to explore different CNN architectures and data representations. The results of the four-class classification task are up to 0.79 (F1 score) on test data of other performances by the same dancers. Hence, through deep learning, this paper proposes a novel and effective method of emotion classification, which can be exploited in affective interfaces.},

The state of the art methods such as using physical keyboards with tracked hand avatars require a complex setup which might not be accessible to the majority of VR users. In this paper, we propose two novel ways to enter text in VR: 1) Word-gesture typing using six degrees of freedom (6DOF) VR controllers; and 2) word-gesture typing using pressure-sensitive touchscreen devices. Our early stage pilot experiment shows that users were able to type at 16.4 WPM and 9.6 WPM on the two techniques respectively without any training, while an expert's typing speeds reached up to 34.2 WPM and 22.4 WPM. Users subjectively preferred the VR controller method over the touchscreen one in terms of usability and task load. We conclude that both techniques are practical and deserve further study.},

abstract = {In the last few years, the interest in virtual reality has been increasing partially due to the emergence of cheaper and more accessible hardware, and the increase in content available. One of the possible applications for virtual reality is to lead people into seeing situations from a different perspective, which can help change beliefs. The work reported in this paper uses virtual reality to help people better understand paralympic sports by allowing them to experience the sports' world from the athletes' perspective. For the creation of the virtual environment, both computer-generated elements and 360 video are used. This work focused on wheelchair basketball, and a simulator of this sport was created resorting to the use of a game engine (Unity 3D). For the development of this simulator, computer-generated elements were built, and the interaction with them implemented. User studies were conducted to evaluate the sense of presence, motion sickness and usability of the system developed. The results were positive although there are still some aspects that should be improved.},

abstract = {Programming has the potential to bring to life that which is most minute in man's imagination. Imagination, however, it will all remain, if no appropriate intervention is made to facilitate the learning of programming. Research studies show that the traditional, face-to-face method of teaching does not provide an enabling environment for learning programming. Hence, outside-classroom intervention is called for. Certain previous studies have tried to build new tools to support the outside-classroom intervention. However, there a need to study the use of existing, familiar and relaxing environments, such as social media, for this intervention. In this paper, we investigate the capability of a social media platform to support the learning of programming among learners in the developing world. We chose the WhatsApp platform as the starting point to uncover these design needs. We also reflected on the lessons learnt using this intervention.},

abstract = {Our traditional interaction possibilities have centered around our electronic devices. In recent years, the progress in electronics and material science has enabled us go beyond chip layer and work at the substrate level. This has helped us rethink form, sources of power, hosts and in turn new interaction possibilities. However, the design of such devices has mostly been ground up and fully synthetic. In this paper, we discuss the analogy between artificial functions and natural capabilities in plants. Through two case studies, we demonstrate bridging unique natural operations of plants with the digital world. Each desired synthetic function is grown, injected carefully or placed in conjunction with a plant's natural functions. Our goal is to make use of sensing and expressive abilities of nature for our interaction devices. Merging synthetic circuitry with plant's own physiology could pave a way to make these lifeforms responsive to our interactions and their ubiquitous sustainable deployment.},

However, designing interfaces for spherical displays remains difficult because we do not yet fully understand how users naturally interact with and collaborate around spherical displays. This paper reports current progress on a project to understand how children (ages 8 to 13) and adults interact with spherical displays in a real-world setting. Our initial data gathering includes an exploratory study in which children and adults interacted with a prototype application on a spherical display in small groups in a public setting. We observed that child groups tended to interact more independently around the spherical display, whereas adult groups interacted with the sphere in a driver-navigator mode and did not tend to walk around the sphere. This work will lay the groundwork for future research into designing interactive applications for spherical displays tailored towards users of all age groups.},

To improve beverage experience, electrical stimulation has been indicated as a method for changing a beverage's taste. However, the taste of a beverage changes temporally-a beverage's taste during drinking is different from its taste after swallowing. There are methods of evaluating the taste of a beverage based on time-series, such as the Time-Intensity (TI) method and the Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) method. Therefore, it is important to focus on the temporal change in a beverage's taste for improving the beverage experience. Thus, we focused on the taste before and after swallowing as a first step. Based on this review, we propose the concept of controlling the temporal change of a beverage's taste using electrical stimulation.},

One aspect of qualitative coding includes resolving disagreements, where coders discuss differences in coding to reach a consensus. We conduct a case study to evaluate four strategies of disagreement resolution and understand their impact on the coding process. We find that an open discussion and the n-ary tree metric lead coders to focus more on the disagreement of a particular data instance, whereas kappa values and Code Wizard direct coders to compare code definitions. We discuss opportunities for using different strategies at different stages of the coding process for more effective disagreement resolution.},

In an initial field study, 71% of the participants reported that they were able to use the device naturally and indicate their feeling of safety satisfactorily. The feeling-of-safety slider can consequently be used to evaluate and benchmark interactions between pedestrians and vehicles, and compare communication interfaces for automated vehicles.},

Using a prototype of a nutrition recommender, we conducted a lab study (N=30) between three groups (no explanation, placebic explanation, and real explanation). Our results indicate that placebic explanations for algorithmic decision-making may indeed invoke perceived levels of trust similar to real explanations.

We report on a study in which we compare viewing 1) unaltered photos, 2) photos with blurred people, and 3) a subset of the photos after deleting private ones, on memory recall. Findings show that obfuscated content helps users recall a lot of content, but it also results in recalling less accurate details, which can sometimes mislead the user.

We evaluate if robotic movements are automatically interpreted as social cues, even if the robot has no social role. 24 participants performed the Implicit Associations Test, classifying robotic gestures into direction categories ("to-front" or "to-back") and words into social categories (willingness or unwillingness for interaction). Our findings show that social interpretation of the robot's gestures is an automatic process. The implicit social interpretation influenced both classification tasks, and could not be avoided even when it decreased participant's performance. This effect is of importance for the HCI community as designers should consider, that even if a robot is not intended for social interaction (e.g. factory robot), people will not be able to avoid interpreting its movement as social cues. Interaction designers should leverage this phenomenon and consider the social interpretation that will be automatically associated with their robots' movement.},

However, professional sportspeople find this information irrelevant due to their high-performance training. They want these devices to provide real-time assistive feedback on their performance, despite the formidable limitations suggested by previous research on giving such feedback. On the other hand, sport coaches already give performance feedback to their sportspeople during their performance.We speculated that some of their approaches might give clues for designing activity trackers with useful real-time performance feedback. Consequently, we interviewed six elite tennis coaches to explore their approaches of communicating performance information to their players, during tennis games. In this paper, we discussed the findings by comparing them with related work and formed two design insights for giving real-time performance feedback that might lead to novel approaches for activity trackers.},

In this work, we aimed to understand the characteristics of Alarmy (task-based alarm app) users who (dis) likes wake-up task in terms of alarm set usage. We grouped 8,500 US users into three according to the proportion of the task selection and investigated group-wise usage differences. We found significant usage differences among the groups in terms of (1) set frequency, (2) set time, and (3) set consistency, possibly caused by consistent needs and task difficulty. The results suggest promising directions for inconvenient interaction and behavior change research.},

As voice interfaces gain mainstream popularity, we ask: is our relationship with technology that speaks with us fundamentally different from technology we use to read and type? In particular, will we disclose more about ourselves to computers that speak to us and listen to our answer? We examine this question through a controlled experiment where a conversational agent asked participants closeness-generating questions common in social psychology through either text-based or voice-based interfaces. We found that people skipped more invasive questions when reading-typing compared to speaking-listening. Surprisingly, typing in their answers seemed to increased the propensity for self-disclosure. This research has implications for the future design of voice-based conversational agents and deepens concerns of user privacy.},

To investigate this, we first chart a problem space, comprising different problem characteristics (complexity, time, available means, and consequences). Secondly, we map them to LEGO assembly tasks. We apply these in a lab study (N=22) equipped with several tracking technologies (i.e., smartwatch sensors and an OptiTrack setup) to assess which problem characteristics lead to measurable consequences in user behaviour. Participants rated occurred problems after each task. With this work, we suggest first steps towards a) understanding user behaviour in problem situations and b) building upon this knowledge to inform the design of adaptive support systems. As a result, we provide the GOLD dataset (Goal-Oriented Lego Dataset) for further analysis.},

abstract = {The replication crisis---a failure to replicate foundational studies---has sparked a conversation in psychology, HCI, and beyond about scientific reliability. To address the crisis, researchers increasingly adopt preregistration: the practice of documenting research plans before conducting a study. Done properly, preregistration should reduce bias from taking exploratory findings as confirmatory. It is crucial to treat preregistration, often an online form/template, as a user-centered design problem to ensure preregistration achieves its intended goal. To understand preregistration in practice, we conducted 14 semi-structured interviews with preregistration users (researchers) who ranged in seniority and experience. We identified two main purposes researchers have for using preregistration, in addition to different user roles and adoption barriers. With the ultimate goal of improving the reliability of scientific findings, we suggest opportunities to explicitly support the different aspects of preregistration use based on our findings.},

In order to explore the influence of other people on travelling behaviour, nineteen participants from the city of Ghent, Belgium, took part in a diary study and a subsequent interview. Our results show that the social context of certain travelling behaviours can influence the three main components that make up a displacement (i.e. the route, the departure time and the mode of transportation). Additionally, other aspects of the displacement, such as activities during the displacement, can also be influenced by a social travelling context. We propose that travel planning and travel assistance software could benefit from efforts to incorporate the social aspects of travelling into their systems and offer some suggestions.},

To bridge this gap, we investigate how User-Centered Design (UCD) methods can be used to improve the privacy of systems' designs. We present the process of developing A/P(rivacy) Testing, a platform that allows designers to compare several privacy designs alternatives, eliciting end-users' privacy perceptions of a tested system or a feature (Figure 1). We describe three online experiments, with 959 participants, in which we created and validated the reliability of a scale for Users' Perceived Systems' Privacy (UPSP), and used it to compare between privacy designs alternatives by using scenarios and different variants. We show that A/B testing is applicable for privacy purposes and that our scale is differentiating between designs that perceived as legitimate and designs that may violate users' expectations.},

abstract = {Malicious Android applications can obtain user's private data and silently send it to a server. Android permissions are currently not sufficient enough to ensure the security of users' sensitive information. For a sufficient permission model it is important to account the target of the outgoing data flow. On the other hand, permission dialogues often contain relevant information, but most of the users generally do not understand the implications or the visualization fails to guide the user attention to it. It is important to empower users by providing applications that show them who can access their private data and who might send this data to the outside. In order to raise user awareness considering Android permissions, we developed HappyPermi, an application that visualizes which user information is accessible by the granted permissions. Our evaluation (n=20) shows that most users are not aware of the sensitive data that their installed applications have access to. Our results suggest how different users feel about accessing their sensitive data when they are aware of its outgoing destinations.},

Toward this goal, we conducted semi-structured interviews with nine participants who are heavy users of smart speakers connected with home IoT devices. We collected 107 rules (usage instances) and asked benefits and limitations of using those rules. Our thematic analysis has found that, while the smart speakers perform the role of voice controller in the single device context, their role extended to automation hub, reporter, and companion in the MDCC. Based on the findings, we provide design implications for smart speakers in the MDCC.},

abstract = {The integration of User-Centered Design with Agile practices studies the interactions between designers and developers and the alignment of the design and development processes. However, beyond the interactions with the development team, designers are often required to operate within a wider business context, driven by goals set on high-level metrics, like Monthly Active Users, and to show how design-led initiatives and improvements address those metrics. In this paper we generalize learnings from prior work on applying usability improvements to Jira, a project tracking software tool created by Atlassian, and we describe a structured approach to bridging the gap between feature work and business metrics.},

abstract = {In recent years, museums have embraced the use of digital technologies to add interactivity to exhibits. New tools such as wireless beacons, QR codes and markerless trackers paired with powerful smartphones are used to implement applications ranging from guides that provide supplementary material as web pages or audio to spatially precise augmented reality (AR). In this work we explore the use of head-mounted (rather than the more common hand-held) AR in a museum space. Our goal is to explore visitor behaviour when using such technology, to inform the design of a future longitudinal study. We found that visitors enjoyed their experience with head-mounted AR and learned fairly quickly how to navigate and interact with virtual content.},

abstract = {Recently, many mobile apps start to incorporate social functions into their design, even for the task-oriented ones, i.e., those designed mainly to help users complete certain tasks. For instance, Taobao, a shopping app, includes online-sharing and instant-messaging functions. However, there is still lack of research on how the users accept and use these social functions. This paper aims to unveil the user requirements on the social functions in task-oriented apps, and accordingly provide design suggestions for app developers. To this end, we conduct semi-structured interviews with 16 participants on how they use instant-messaging functions in three widely-used task-oriented apps, the shopping app Taobao, an online payment app Alipay, and an entertainment app NetEase Cloud Music. Our findings demonstrate that the instant-messaging functions in these apps are not widely accepted, although they benefit user experience and facilitate users' online social activities. We show that both the design and the users' stereotype towards the apps are important reasons. Finally, we suggest several design guidelines.},

Designed in cooperation with more than 30 specialists at local care centers and primary schools, Magika integrates digital worlds projected on the wall and the floor with a gamut of "smart" physical objects (toys, ambient lights, materials, and various connected appliances) to enable tactile, auditory, visual, and olfactory stimuli. The room is connected with an interface for educators that enables them to: control the level of stimuli and their progression; define and share a countless number of game-based learning activities; customize such activities to the evolving needs of each child.

abstract = {Automating usability diagnosis and repair can be a powerful assistance to usability experts and even less knowledgeable developers. To accomplish this goal, evaluating user interaction automatically is crucial, and it has been broadly explored. However, most works focus in long interaction sessions, which makes it difficult to tell how individual interface components influence usability. In contrast, this work aims to compare how different widgets perform for a same task, in the context of evaluating alternative designs for small components, implemented as refactorings. For this purpose, we propose a unified score to compare the widgets involved in each refactoring by the level of effort required by users to interact with them. This score is based on micro-measures automatically captured from interaction logs, so it can be automatically predicted. We show the results of predicting such score using decision trees.},

abstract = {Since its idealization more than 20 years ago, much research has been carried out on the User eXperience (UX) field, with several evaluation methods being proposed. However, studies have been pointing out conflicting results when evaluating the UX. Users frequently evaluate their UX as positive, even when experiencing many negative emotions when interacting with a product. Moreover, variables such as the peak-end effect and the memory-experience gap may also have been influencing the results, leading to misinterpretations about the product's quality. In this context, this paper presents our work-in-progress research on the following research question: "What are we doing wrong when evaluating the UX?". We discuss about different variables that may have been influencing users' perceptions about their experiences in previous studies and highlight research opportunities. With this work, we expect to shed light on and bring reflection to current practices on UX evaluations in order to progress the research in the UX field.},

Also, the existing literature about usability differences between these two distinct groups is limited.

The findings show that compared with their counterparts, the native English speakers had better and more positive user experiences in interacting with the device. It also shows that users' English language proficiency plays an important role in interacting with VUIs. The findings from this study can create insights for VUI designers and developers for implementing multiple language options and better voice recognition algorithms in VUIs for different user groups across the world.},

In this paper, we describe a user study involving 50 participants, with ages between 19 - 77 years old, who completed a mid-air haptic learning experiment involving eight different mid-air haptic shapes. Preliminary results showed no learning effect throughout the task. Age was found to be strongly related to a decline in performance, and interestingly, significant differences in accuracy rates were found for different types of mid-air haptic shapes.},

Yet the application of gaming elements can be problematic because it can have a negative effect on cognitive load (CL) and on working memory (WM). This is a particular issue for children with learning disabilities who suffer from deficits in working memory. While studies have explored the relationship between gamification and cognitive load, there is little research to address the management of cognitive load in gamified learning applications for children with learning disabilities. This study is suggesting a framework based on existing guidelines derived from HCI concepts and cognitive load theories to design user-centered gamified applications for children with learning disabilities to exploit their limited WM capacity and manage cognitive load.},

While topics like performance, motion sickness and presence are well investigated, basic topics as VR User Interfaces (UIs) for menu control are lagging far behind. A major issue is the absence of haptic feedback and naturalness, especially when considering mid-air finger-based interaction in VR, when "grabbable" controllers are not available. In this work, we present and compare the following two visual approaches to mid-air finger-based menu control in VR environments: a planar UI similar to common 2D desktop UIs, and a pseudo-haptic UI based on physical metaphors. The results show that the pseudo-haptic UI performs better in terms of all tested aspects including workload, user experience, motion sickness and immersion.},

The recognition of objects like traffic signs or traffic lights is still challenging, especially under bad weather conditions or when traffic signs are partially occluded. A common approach to deal with system boundaries of AVs is to shift to manual driving, accepting human factor issues like post-automation effects. We present CooperationCaptcha, a system that asks drivers to label unrecognized objects on the fly, and consequently maintain automated driving mode. We implemented two different interaction variants to work with object recognition algorithms of varying sophistication. Our findings suggest that this concept of driver-vehicle cooperation is feasible, provides good usability, and causes little cognitive load. We present insights and considerations for future research and implementations.},

abstract = {Learner-driven subgoal labeling helps learners form a hierarchical structure of solutions with subgoals, which are conceptual units of procedural problem solving. While learning with such hierarchical structure of a solution in mind is effective in learning problem solving strategies, the development of an interactive feedback system to support subgoal labeling tasks at scale requires significant expert efforts, making learner-driven subgoal labeling difficult to be applied in online learning environments. We propose SolveDeep, a system that provides feedback on learner solutions with peer-generated subgoals. SolveDeep utilizes a learnersourcing workflow to generate the hierarchical representation of possible solutions, and uses a graph-alignment algorithm to generate a solution graph by merging the populated solution structures, which are then used to generate feedback on future learners' solutions. We conducted a user study with 7 participants to evaluate the efficacy of our system. Participants did subgoal learning with two math problems and rated the usefulness of system feedback. The average rating was 4.86 out of 7 (1: Not useful, 7: Useful), and the system could successfully construct a hierarchical structure of solutions with learnersourced subgoal labels.},

abstract = {In the contemporary practice of participatory neighborhood planning, planners leverage digital support tools with realistic, interactive 3D visualization to support perception processing and to increase engagement among diverse public stakeholders. However, capturing the aspirations of a community lacking design and planning expertise requires a more thorough evaluation and considered design of support tools. We present Land.Info, a proof-of-concept software that allows users to design open spaces with 3D visualization and see the subsequent costs and environmental consequences. To assess how the public engages in design discussion with 3D visualization, we organized three community design workshops for developing a vacant lot. We found that 3D visualization 1) promotes public ideation of user stories around objects, and 2) prohibits ideas beyond spatial design elements. Future research will investigate whether it is possible to aggregate more diverse public aspirations, whether or not visual realism sets expectations for designs, and the potential impacts of expanding the software user base for neighborhood planning cases.},

A centerpiece such as a bowl of food, a decorative flower arrangement, or a container of writing tools, is commonly placed on a table around which people have conversations. We explore the design space for an augmented table and centerpiece to influence how people may interact with one another. We present an initial functional prototype to explore different choices in materiality of feedback, interaction styles, and animation and motion patterns. These aspects are discussed with respect to how it may impact people's awareness of their turn taking dynamics as well as provide an additional channel for expression. Potential enhancements for future iterations in its design are then outlined based on these findings.},

abstract = {Online learning platforms such as MOOCs have been prevalent sources of self-paced learning to people nowadays. However, the lack of peer accompaniment and social interaction may increase learners' sense of isolation. Prior studies have shown the positive effects on visualizing peer students' appearances in VR learning environments. In this work, we propose to build virtual classmates, which were constructed by synthesizing previous learners' time-anchored messages. Configurations of virtual classmates and their behavioral features can be adjusted. To build the characteristics of virtual classmates, we developed a technique called comment mapping to aggregate prior online learners' comments to shape virtual classmates' behaviors. We evaluated the effects of the virtual classmates built with and without the comment mapping and the amount of virtual classmates rendered in VR.},

abstract = {Note-taking activities in physical classrooms are ubiquitous and have been emerging in online learning. To investigate how to better support online learners to take notes while learning with videos, we compared free-form note-taking with a prototype system, NoteStruct, which prompts learners to perform a series of note-taking activities. NoteStruct enables learners to insert annotations on transcripts of video lectures and then engages learners in reinterpreting and synthesizing their notes after watching a video. In a study with a sample of Mechanical Turk workers (N=80), learners took longer and more extensive notes with NoteStruct, although using NoteStruct versus free-form note-taking did not impact short-term learning outcome. These longer notes were also less likely to include verbatim copied video transcripts, but more likely to include elaboration and interpretation. We demonstrate how NoteStruct influences note-taking during online video learning.},

Brain Painting has shown to improve the Quality of Life (QOL) of patients with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), by giving patients a way to express themselves and affect society through their art [1]. Although there is currently no known cure for ALS, through such outlets we can help mitigate the physical and psychological impairments of those living with ALS. This paper discusses the development and testing of an immersive Brain Painting application using a Google brush-like tool in a 3D Environment, for able-bodied users. It also discusses how it can help provide a more immersive medium for users to express themselves creatively. In addition, we also discuss feedback received from a preliminary study on how the brush and application can be improved to better allow users to paint in VR using their brain.},

We gave workshops on personal informatics to 13 adolescents at two secondary schools in London, UK. We asked them to use a commercial personal informatics app to track something they chose that they thought might impact their learning. Our participants proved competent and versatile users of personal informatics tools. They tracked their feelings, tech activity, physical activity, and sleep with many using the process as a system for understanding and validating aspects of their own lives, rather than changing them.},

However, students use guessing strategies to improve the chances of choosing the right answer in a test. Therefore, scores do not reflect actual levels of the student's knowledge and skills. In this paper, we propose a brain-computer interface (BCI) to estimate whether a student guesses on a test question or masters it when s/he chooses the right answer in logic reasoning. To build this BCI, we first define the "Guessing'' and employ Raven's Progressive Matrices as logic tests in the experiment to collect EEG signals, then we propose a sliding time-window with quorum-based voting (STQV) approach to recognize the state of "Guessing'' or "Understanding'', together with FBCSP and end-to-end ConvNet classification algorithms. Results show that this BCI yields an accuracy of 83.71% and achieves a good performance in distinguishing "Guessing'' from "Understanding''.},

While streamers benefit from Twitch's own features for forming a wide community of engaged viewers, many streamers look to external social media platforms to increase their reach and build their following. We collect a corpus of Twitch streamer popularity measures and their behavior data on Twitch and third party platforms. We test the community-proposed relationship between behavior on social media accounts and popularity through examining the timing of creation and use of social media accounts. We conduct these experiments by studying the correlations between streamer behaviors and two popularity measures used by Twitch: followers and average concurrent viewers. We find that we cannot yet define which behaviors have statistically significant correlations with popularity, and propose future directions for this research.},

We found that finsta users deliberately partition their audience and mostly maintain a small audience of close friends to avoid context collapse. Additionally, we discovered that finsta is a space where distinct norms shape performance: humor, authenticity, and "unfiltered'' self-expression. Given that finsta users are mostly teenagers and young adults, we ask how an expectation for authentic performance by peers might itself increase pressure on users.},

abstract = {As the K-pop industry has been rapidly expanded, the strength of the K-pop fandoms is under the spotlight. In particular, the collaborations among fandoms for mutually supporting their artists have contributed to the success of the K-pop artists. This paper investigates the current practice of the fandom collaborations in K-pop. To this end, we first introduce the notion of the 'fandom collaboration network' that represents the collaborations among K-pop fandoms. By collecting and analyzing a large-scale fandom activity data from DCinside, we investigate (i) to what extent fandom collaboration is prevalent in K-pop, (ii) how fandoms collaborate with other fandoms, and (iii) what fandoms play more roles in fandom collaboration than others. We find that K-pop fandoms actively collaborate with other fandoms for mutually supporting their artists. By analyzing the structural properties of the fandom collaboration network, we show the fandom collaboration is basically based on the reciprocity. However, we also show that the amount of collaborations between the two fandoms is often unfair. Among all the active fandoms in our data, we find that there a small number of fandoms who play significant roles in fandom collaborations in K-pop. We believe our work can provide important insight for K-pop stakeholders such as fans, agencies, artists, marketers, and broadcasting companies.},

The project is testing the possibility of anticipatory governance of emerging blockchain and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) by involving stakeholders in the design process over templates. The goal is to question the promises of blockchain governance happening over automation and smart contracts and to offer an alternative to the misuses of emerging technologies in the so-called predictive and anticipatory design. The prototype consists of a functional Node-RED dashboard used as an interface for the Hyperledger smart contracts and a design fiction movie about the lives of the Lithopians.},

However, existing information channels for public policies deliver only few stakeholders' voices, thus failing to provide a diverse knowledge base for personal deliberation. This paper presents an initial design of PolicyScape, an online system that supports personal deliberation on public policies by helping citizens explore diverse stakeholders and their perspectives on the policy's effect. Building on literature on crowdsourced policymaking and policy stakeholders, we present several design choices for crowdsourcing stakeholder perspectives. We introduce perspective-taking as an approach for personal deliberation by helping users consider stakeholder perspectives on policy issues. Our initial results suggest that PolicyScape could collect diverse sets of perspectives from the stakeholders of public policies, and help participants discover unexpected viewpoints of various stakeholder groups.},

Particularly, body-worn "always-on" cameras raise social acceptability concerns as their form factors hinder bystanders to infer whether they are "in the frame". Screen-based status indicators have been suggested as remedy, but not evaluated in-the-wild. Simultaneously, best practices for evaluating social acceptability in field studies are rare. This work contributes to closing both gaps. First, we contribute results of an in-the-wild evaluation of a screen-based status indicator testing the suitability of the "displayed camera image" design strategy. Second, we discuss methodical implications for evaluating social acceptability in the field, and cover lessons learned from collecting hypersubjective self-reports. We provide a self-critical, in-depth discussion of our field experiment, including study-related behavior patterns, and prototype fidelity. Our work may serve as a reference for field studies evaluating social acceptability.},

abstract = {An autonomous car, also known as a robot car, self-driving car, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving with little or no human control. In most cases today, a driver can switch "driving mode" of his/her car between manual and autonomous. However, while the mode can be smartly changed, it is not able to show the current driving mode to nearby pedestrians. This might become a source of anxieties for many ordinary people living in the era of autonomous car. To overcome this issue, we propose to create a car with new expressive functions, and make it communicable and interactive. Unlike conventional approaches which use displays and LEDs, our approach is to develop 3D shape-transforming, morphable body of a car by using multi-material 3D-printing. Our first trial with printed soft membranes was successful in representing three different modes of a car seamlessly. In this paper, we introduce our concept, core technologies and implementations, and discuss further possibilities and future works.},

abstract = {In this paper, I speculate on a future where our need to socialize physically is solely to exchange bacteria. With our biological data being in the hands of private companies and governments and our environments' microbiomes becoming less diverse, our social systems, social identities and social interactions are redefined and reinvented to adapt to this new reality. In this world, everyone wears a "social microbial prosthesis" that analyzes their microbial composition from their breath and reveals sensitive information on their chest. The microbial prosthesis would be able to give off information not only on the microbial composition but also on the mental and physical health of a person. This second skin plays a role in controlling communication and interaction between people, where one is able to, by inspecting surrounding people's prosthesis, take careful considerations of who to interact with and who to avoid. Social Microbial Prosthesis is a critique of the race of private companies and governments to collect our biological data, the role of commercializing such data in shaping and changing our social identities and a response to the loss of microbial diversity in our environments due to our modern lifestyles and surroundings.},

However, approaches for monitoring HR, either depend on complex visualizations on small screens (i.e., smartwatches) or intrusive modalities (i.e. haptic, auditory) that might force the attention to the information. We developed an early prototype, Howel, a novel wrist-worn soft wearable to display HR zone information during CT. Our concept utilizes mapping information onto dynamic patterns (color changing stripes) as an easy-to-understand ambient display. To preserve non-intrusiveness, it uses non-emissive modality by heating thermochromic paints on its textile surfaces. Early feedback from three participants suggests that soft wearables with non- emissive dynamic patterns have potential (1) to embed information organically on the body, (2) to give easy-to-understand in-situ intensity information and (3) to keep the attention on the exercise instead of performance measures.},

Inspired by notions from embodied interaction and somaesthetic design, we present in this paper a research through design (RtD) project that substitutes directional metaphors with push against the body. The result, Flow, is a wearable designed to cue six movements of the wrist/forearm to support the training of elementary sensory-motor skills of physical activities, such as foil fencing.

Weiser's vision of the omni-present, ubiquitous computer of the 21st century [21] has been realized, but at a cost.

To address this problem, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for designing and communicating agent personalities. We conducted two design workshops with 12 designers, discovering three dimensions of an agent personality and three channels to express it. The study results revealed that an agent personality can be crafted by designing common traits shared within a service domain, distinctive traits added for a unique identity, and neutral traits left intentionally undecided or user-driven. Also, such a personality can be expressed through how an agent performs services, what contents it provides, and how it speaks and appears to be. Our results suggest a renewed view of the dimensions of conversational agent personalities.},

abstract = {Lucid dreaming, knowing one is dreaming while dreaming, is an important tool for exploring consciousness and bringing awareness to different aspects of life. We present a proof-of-concept system called Lucid Loop: a virtual reality experience where one can practice lucid awareness via biofeedback. Visuals are creatively generated before your eyes using a deep learning Artificial Intelligence algorithm to emulate the unstable and ambiguous nature of dreams. The virtual environment becomes more lucid or "clear" when the participant's physiological signals, including brain waves, respiration, and heart rate, indicate focused attention. Lucid Loop enables the virtual embodied experience of practicing lucid dreaming where written descriptions fail. It offers a valuable and novel technique for simulating lucid dreaming without having to be asleep.

abstract = {Prototyping involves the evolution of an idea into various stages of design until it reaches a certain level of maturity. These design stages include low, medium and high fidelity prototypes. Workload analysis of prototyping using NASA-TLX showed an increase in workload specifically in frustration, temporal demand, effort, and decline in performance as the participants progressed from low to high fidelity. Upon reviewing numerous commercial and academic tools that directly or indirectly support software prototyping in one aspect or another, we identified a need for a comprehensive solution to support the entire software prototyping process. In this paper, we introduce Eve, a prototyping workbench that enables the users to sketch their concept as low fidelity prototype. It generates the consequent medium and high fidelity prototypes by means of UI element detection and code generation. We evaluated Eve using SUS with 15 UI/UX designers; the results depict good usability and high learnability (Usability score: 78.5). In future, we aim to study the impact of Eve on subjective workload experienced by users during software prototyping.},

abstract = {This research aims to utilize an output method for zero energy pop-up fabrication using chemical inflation as a technique for instant, hardware-free shape change. By applying state-changing techniques as a medium for material activation, we provide a framework for a two-part assembly process starting from the manufacturing side whereby a rigid structural body is given its form, through to the user side, where the form potential of a soft structure is activated and the structure becomes complete. To demonstrate this technique, we created two use cases: firstly, a compression material for emergency response, and secondly a self-inflating packaging system. This paper provides details on the auto-inflation process as well as the corresponding digital tool for the design of pneumatic materials. The results show the efficiency of using zero energy auto-inflatable structures for both medical applications and packaging. This rapidly deployable inflatable kit starts from the assumption that every product can provide its own contribution by responding in the best way to a specific application.},

abstract = {Designing for digital or robotic fabrication typically involves a virtual model in order to determine and coordinate the required operations of its construction. As a result, its creative design space becomes constrained to material expressions that can be predicted through digital modeling. This paper describes our preliminary thinking and first empirical results when this digital modeling phase is skipped, and the designing occurs interactively 'with' the fabrication operations themselves. By analyzing the material responses of corrugated cardboard to simple linear cutting operations that are executed by a robotic arm, we demonstrate how emergent material effects can be discovered improvisationally. Such material effects cannot be virtually modeled, however, they can be recreated and controlled by the robotic manipulations. We believe this form of 'material sketching' broadens the advances in 'human-fabrication interaction' towards a novel and unforeseeable expressions of physical form that require a much more direct, yet still digital, relationship with materiality.},

We organized an ideation workshop with 15 participants preceded by a sensitizing phase to identify possible applications for mid-air haptics within the home. From the extensive set of ideas that resulted from this, five themes emerged: guidance, confirmation, information, warning and changing status. As general 'application categories', we propose that they can provide a useful basis for the future design and development of mid-air haptic applications in the home, and possibly also beyond.},

In addition to providing access to collections of books and other physical media, public libraries today are embracing a new role of becoming urban hubs, in which a wide range of activities take place. In these activities, local knowledge is developed, exchanged, and disseminated. However, there are still very few digital services that support this new role. Here, we explore how to develop digital services for supporting and leveraging user-generated video content in library activities. Based on interviews and design scenarios as probes, we describe the potentials and challenges for designing such services, as seen from the perspective of library staff. Our insights will inform the design of a new digital service for publics to participate in collaborative production of videos to document, exchange, and disseminate local knowledge generated in library activities.},

We outline a number of advantages of this novel combination compared to current atmosphere generation techniques. The features of recent IS engines can be extended to automatically adapt the atmosphere produced by a group of virtual humans in response to user intervention while staying coherent with the unfolding story of the training scenario. This work is currently being developed in the context of a VR training for teachers, in which they learn to manage a difficult classroom under the guidance of an instructor.},

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) is a useful tool for modern game designers but often requires a technical background to understand. This gap of knowledge can intimidate less technical game designers from employing ML techniques to evaluate designs or incorporate ML into game mechanics. Our research aims to bridge this gap by exploring interactive visualizations as a way to introduce ML principles to game designers. We have developed QUBE, an interactive level designer that shifts ML education into the context of game design. We present QUBE's interactive visualization techniques and evaluation through two expert panels (n=4, n=6) with game design, ML, and user experience experts.},

abstract = {Today's small group interactions often occur in multi-device, multi-artifact ecosystems. CHI researchers studying these group interactions may adopt a socio-behavioral or sensing/data mining approach or both. A mixed-methodological approach for studying group interactions in collocated settings require collecting data from a range of sources, like audio, video, multiple sensor streams, and multiple software logs. Analyzing these disparate data sources systematically - with opportunities to rapidly form and correct research insights can help researchers who study group interactions. But engineering solutions assimilating multiple data sources to support different methodologies, ranging from grounded theory methodology to log analysis are rarely found. To address this frequent and tedious problem of data collection and processing in mixed-methodology studies of group interactions, we introduce a workbench tool: Interaction Proxemics in Multi-Device Ecologies (IPME). The IPME workbench synchronizes multiple data sources, provides data visualization, and opportunities for data correction and annotation.},

The cursor metrics were derived computationally from the mouse trajectories when rating the consumption of each appliance and analyzed using Multidimensional Scaling, Jenks Natural Breaks, and the Jaccard Similarity Index techniques. The results show that despite the fact that the metrics measure different aspects of the mouse trajectories, there is an agreement with respect to the appliances that generated higher levels of hesitation. The paper concludes with an outline of future work that should be carried out in order to further understand how cursor trajectories can be used to measure respondent hesitation.},

Transformational games offer a promising avenue for cybersecurity behavior change.

As a first step to filling this gap, we present the design of Hacked Time, a desktop game that aims to encourage cybersecurity behavior change by translating self-efficacy theory into the game's design. As cybersecurity games are a relatively novel area, our design aims to serve as a prototype for mapping specific behavior change principles relevant to this area onto game design practice.},

However, the tracking space is still limited, and viable alternatives or extensions are required to reach further virtual destinations. Our current work focuses on traveling over (very) large distances--an area where approaches such as teleportation are too exhausting and WIM teleportations potentially reduce presence. Our idea is to equip players with the ability to switch from first-person to a third-person god-mode perspective on demand. From above, players can command their avatar similar to a real-time strategy game and initiate travels over large distance. In our first exploratory evaluation, we learned that the proposed dynamic switching is intuitive, increases spatial orientation, and allows players to maintain a high degree of presence throughout the game. Based on the outcomes of a participatory design workshop, we also propose a set of extensions to our technique that should be considered in the future.},

abstract = {This paper analyses the impact that introducing game elements can have in players' artistic valuation of video-games. We put forth a hypothesis that aesthetic experiences are incompatible with game elements (challenges and rewards/penalties). We tested it, by allowing (n=76) subjects to experience two different variants of the same artistic video game, one with game elements, another without. Using a mixed methods approach, we study results from self-reports and open-ended questionnaires. These indicate that in the game version's case, subjects reported being less focused in understanding the experience's meaning and found it less meaningful to a statistically significant degree. Therefore, we conclude that game designers seeking to mediate artistic experiences should be cautious in the introduction of game elements, as they can negatively impact the experience's value.},

As a consequence, prosocial behaviour like offering someone a seat is displayed less often. We discuss the design and design process of MirrorMe, a simple communal game to induce positive mood of commuters. MirrorMe aims to increase prosocial behaviour through mimicry. Commuters are challenged to "make a face" and thereby connect to other commuters. MirrorMe will be installed in a public display close to a train station enabling access to all commuters and passers-by. This work addresses the need for games and play in public setting to stimulate prosocial behaviour. It exemplifies how multidisciplinary HCI approaches in a gamejam setting can contribute to real life challenges. We conclude with open questions for impact evaluation in future work.},

We selected two games that provides emotional challenge and conducted a 24-subject experiment to compare the impact of a VR and monitor-display version of each game on multiple player experiences. Preliminary results show that many positive emotional experiences have been enhanced significantly with VR while negative emotional experiences such as horror and fear have less been influenced; participants' perceived immersion and presence were higher when using VR than using monitor-display. Our finding of VR's expressive capability in emotional experiences may encourage more design and research with regard to emotional challenge in VR games.},

abstract = {Hybrid bio-digital games integrate real, biological materials into computer systems. They offer a rich, playful space in which interactions between humans, computers, and non-human organisms can be explored. However, the concept of video game 'glitching' in hybrid bio-digital games, specifically those that result from interactions between the biological and the computer hardware and/or software, have not been explored in great detail. We report two incidences of glitches observed during Mold Rush - a hybrid bio-digital game based on growth patterns of living mold: The creation of an additional game character (Moldy Ghosts), and the gameplay freeze (a Yeasty Invasion). As we interpret our observations, we question the potential for glitches to become valuable tools in framing HCI investigations into designing a productive and meaningful biological-digital interactions. The goal of this paper is to propose three testable routes in which glitches could be implemented. 1) Glitch as a tool for learning 2) Glitch as a precursor for an experience-enhancing game component, and 3) Glitch as an instigator for discourse on ethical implications of bio-digital games.},

abstract = {Gamification can change how and why people interact with software. A common approach is to use quantitative feedback to give users a feeling of progress or achievement. There are, however, other ways to provide users with motivation or meaning during normal computer interactions, such as using emotional reinforcement. This could provide a powerful new tool to allow the positive effects of gamification to reach wider contexts. This paper investigates the design and evaluation of a mobile to-do list application, 'Tamu To-Do', which utilises gamified emotional reinforcement, as seen in Figure 1. A week-long field study (N=9) recorded user activity and impressions with the application. The results supported emotional reinforcement's potential as a gamification strategy to improve user motivation and engagement.},

However, there are players that require special configuration so they could enjoy playing equally. One of these types of players is left-handed players. In order to determine whether to create a special configuration designed for the needs of left-handed audience, we carried out a study where left-handed players were targeted and offered to play with two types of control: a standard right-handed and a customized left-handed configuration. A significant main effect on player experience on the left-handed control configuration was demonstrated. The study reveals the importance of a catered control configuration to create a fair, non-stressful and user-friendly environment for players.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) games continue to grow in popularity with the advancement of commercial VR capabilities such as the inclusion of full body tracking. This means game developers can design for novel interactions involving a player's full body rather than solely relying on controller input. However, existing research on evaluating player interaction in VR games primarily focuses on game content and inputs from game controllers or player hands. Current approaches for evaluating player full body interactions are limited to simple qualitative observation which makes evaluation difficult and time-consuming. We present a Full Room Virtual Reality Investigation Tool (FRVRIT) which combines data recording and visualization to provide a quantitative solution for evaluating player movement and interaction in VR games. The tool facilitates objective data observation through multiple visualization methods that can be manipulated, allowing developers to better observe and record player movements in the VR space to improve and iterate on the desired interactions in their games.},

Our findings suggest that research into chatbots for cognitive behavioural therapy would be more effective when directly addressing these drawbacks.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is also characterized by its motor fluctuations throughout the day. This makes clinical assessment to be hard to accomplish in an appointment as the patient status at the time may be largely different from his condition two hours before. Clinicians can only evaluate patients from time to time, making symptom fluctuations difficult to discern. The emergence of wearable sensors enabled the continuous monitoring of patients out of the clinic, in a free-living environment. Although, these sensors exist and they are being explored in a research setting, there have been limited efforts in understanding which information and how it should be presented to non-technical people, clinicians (and patients). To fill this gap, we started by performing a focus group with clinicians to capture the information they would like to see devised from free-living sensors, and the different levels of detail they envision. Building on the insights collected, we developed a data-driven platform, DataPark, that presents usable visualizations of data collected from a wearable tri-axial accelerometer. It enables report parameterization and includes a battery of state-of-the-art algorithms to quantify physical activity, sleep, and clinical evaluations. A two-month preliminary deployment in a rehabilitation clinic showed that patients feel rewarded and included by receiving a report, and that the change in paradigm is not burdensome and adds information for clinicians to support their decisions.},

Walking with crutches is a learning skill that requires continuous repetition and constant attention to detail to make sure they are being used correctly, avoiding negative consequences, such as falls or injuries. We conducted expert consultation sessions, and we identified the main issues that patients face when walking with crutches. This informed the design of Augmented Crutches. We performed a qualitative evaluation and conclude with design implications: the importance of timing, self-assurance and awareness.},

Their human-like physical appearance and nonverbal behavior set them apart from chatbot-type embodied conversational agents, and has recently received significant interest as a potential tool for health-related interventions. As healthcare providers deliberate whether to adopt this new technology, it is crucial to examine the empirical evidence about their effectiveness. We systematically evaluated evidence from controlled studies of interventions using virtual humans on their effectiveness in health-related outcomes. Nineteen studies were included from a total of 3354 unique records. Although study objectives varied greatly, most targeted psychological conditions, such as mood, anxiety, and autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Virtual humans demonstrated effectiveness in improving health-related outcomes, more strongly when targeting clinical conditions, such as ASD or pain management, than general wellness, such as weight loss. We discuss the emerging differences when designing for clinical interventions versus wellness.},

abstract = {Shared decision making (SDM) is increasingly considered as the best way to reach a treatment decision in a clinical environment. However, the use of SDM in practice can be obstructed by a number of factors, such as time constraints or lack of applicability due to patient characteristics. Our project, PrepDoc, explores how a Virtual Training Doctor (VTD) can help patients overcome some of these obstacles to experiencing effective SDM during doctor's visits. In this paper, we report on user studies conducted with 19 participants in Scotland aged 65+. The goal of these studies was to identify the reactions of this audience to the PrepDoc system, evaluate its suitability within Scotland, and elicit suggestions to improve it. Our findings revealed that the idea of empowering people to participate in SDM using a virtual agent was positively received by all participants. However, the reactions to how this idea was implemented in the PrepDoc system varied greatly across participants. Based on this, our paper outlines recommendations for enhancing the user experience with VTDs, accommodating individual differences of older adults, and accounting for the national context.},

We present a framework encompassing three phases and two related checklists for performing N-of-1 evaluations. We also present our analysis of using this framework in the development and deployment of an app that encourages people to walk more. Our key findings are that there are challenges in designing engaging apps that automate N-of-1 procedures, and that there are challenges in collecting sufficient data of good quality. Further research should address these challenges.},

Our subjects yielded results comparable to traditional participants, exhibiting well-known phenomena such as underestimating the energy contained in foods perceived to be healthy. Several techniques from the online education literature, such as prompts for reflection, were also investigated for their efficacy at increasing estimation accuracy. Although calories were more accurately judged after applying these methods on aggregate, the effects of individual techniques on our participants were inconclusive. A more thorough investigation is thus needed into effective educational methods for correcting calorie estimations on the Web.},

abstract = {Helping patients to reach optimal health entails a holistic approach of complex interventions including clinical decision support systems, patient decision aids, and self-management tools. In real-world settings, understanding the human factors in technological interventions is the core of HCI research; however, it requires a considerable amount of time to run experimental procedures, especially for patients with mental disorders. We conducted a roleplay simulation over a period of two weeks that comprised observations, and semi-structured interviews with eight health care professionals participated in the simulated use of a health optimization system. The study revealed the SWING model of enabling interventions towards optimal health as i) Sharing feelings, ii) Weaving of information, iii) Improving awareness, iv) Nurturing trust v) Giving support. This model establishes a common path from research to practice for researchers and practitioners in eHealth and HCI.},

This paper describes a user-centered design approach involving nurses, to develop a prototype expert system for modelling CPGs for Pressure Ulcer management. The system was developed using Visirule, a software tool that uses a graphical approach to modeling knowledge. The system was evaluated by 5 staff nurses and compared nurses' time and accuracy to assess a wound using CPGs accessed via the Intranet of an NHS Trust and the expert system. A post task qualitative evaluation revealed that nurses found the system useable with a systematic design, that it increased access to CPGs by reducing time and effort required by other usual methods of access, that it provided opportunities for learning due to its interactive nature, and that its recommendations were more actionable that those provided by usual static CPG documents.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of wellbeing-as-interaction. Instead of designing and evaluating technologies that locate wellbeing in the individual, this paper presents early-stage work on designing technologies for people to collaboratively express, interpret, discuss and enact wellbeing. To explore this concept, we examined the wellbeing of six pairs of university students through a 7-day deployment of a technology probe 'MoodCloud'. MoodCloud consisted of a mobile app and an ambient display to share wellbeing updates through colour. We observed three patterns of wellbeing interactions: updates, follow-ups, and message chains. Wellbeing interactions benefitted from the ambiguity of colour and a clearly defined target audience, but students also communicated through other channels to make sense of updates and to enact support. The concept of wellbeing-as-interaction seeks to offer an analytic lens for the CHI community as well as inspiration for novel wellbeing technologies that emphasise meaningful interactions with friends.},

The step-by-step nature of this framework draws from multiple disciplinary and stakeholder perspectives, integrates knowledge about efficacious psychological interventions, considers individual differences and specific challenges faced by patients, and realizes contextual needs. It also includes incremental and iterative refinements based on multidisciplinary sources to foster more evidence-based interface designs. Once reached its maturity, this framework can potentially be applied for designing efficacious technologies for a range of mental health conditions.

Existing VA research has focused on microscale interaction patterns such as usability and artificial intelligence. However, the macroscale patterns of users' information practices and their relationship with the design and adoption of VAs have been largely understudied, especially when it comes to older adults (OAs), who stand to benefit greatly from VAs. We conducted a preliminary investigation to understand the role design elements, such as anthropomorphic aspects of VAs, play in OAs' perception of VAs and in OAs' preferences for VAs' participation within their health information practices. Some unexpected findings indicate that the fidelity of anthropomorphic features influences perception in ways that are dependent on the context of the information tasks. This suggests that research on improving the design and increasing the adoption of VAs should factor the interplay between fidelity of VA representation and information context.},

We look at the influence of driving-related stress to find the right time to provide personalized and contextually-aware interventions. We address this challenge with a data driven approach that takes into consideration driving-induced stress, driver (cognitive) availability, and indicators of risky driving behavior such as lane departures and high steering reversal rates. We ran a study with sixteen commuters during morning and evening traffic while applying an in-situ experience sampling. During 45 minutes of driving through various scenarios including city, highway, and neighborhood roads we captured physiological measurements, video of participants and surroundings, and CAN bus driving data. Initial review of the data shows that stress levels changed greatly between 2 and 9 (out of a 0-min to 10-max scale). We conclude with a discussion on how to prepare the data to train supervised algorithms to find the right time to intervene stress while driving.},

Eight subjects performed a Fitts' law experiment with or without additional jitter on the cursor. Results show that while error rate significantly increased above ±0.5° jitter and subjects' effective throughput started to decrease significantly above ±1° jitter, there was no significant effect on users' movement time. Further, the Fitts's law movement time model was affected when ±2° jitter was applied to the tracker. According to these results, ±0.5° jitter on the controller does not significantly affect user performance for the tasks explored here. The results of our study can guide the design of 3D controller and tracking systems for 3D user interfaces.},

In touchless input, users may alternate between hands or use bimanual gestures. But touchless performance in nondominant hands is little explored---even though cognitive science and neuroscience studies show cerebral hemispheric specialization causes performance differences between dominant and nondominant hands in lateralized individuals. Drawing on theories that account for between-hand differences in rapid-aimed movements, we characterize motor asymmetry in touchless input. Results from a controlled study (n = 20, right-handed) show freehand touchless input produces significantly smaller between-hand performance differences than a mouse in pointing and dragging. We briefly discuss the HCI implications of motor asymmetry in an input type.},

abstract = {We present JeL-a bio-responsive immersive installation for interpersonal synchronization through breathing. In JeL, two users are immersed in a virtual underwater environment, where their individual breathing controls the movement of a jellyfish. As users synchronize their breathing, a virtual glass sponge-like structure starts to grow, representing the users' physiological synchrony. JeL explores a novel form of interpersonal interaction in virtual reality that aims to connect users to their physiological state through biofeedback, to each other through physiological synchronization, and to nature through connecting with a jellyfish and collaboratively growing a glass sponge-inspired sculpture. This form of immersive, bio-responsive interaction could ultimately be used to encourage self-awareness, a feeling of connectedness, and consequently pro-social and pro-environmental attitudes. Here, we describe the motivation, inspiration, design elements, and future work involved in bringing this system to fruition.},

abstract = {Olfactory notifications have been proven to have a positive impact on drivers. This has motivated the use of scents to convey driving-relevant information. Research has proposed the use of such scents as lemon, peppermint, lavender and rose for in-car notifications. However, there is no framework to identify which scent is the most suitable for every application scenario. In this paper, we propose an approach for validating a matching between scents and driving-relevant notifications. We suggest a study in which the olfactory modality is compared with a puff of clean air, visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli while performing the same driving task. For the data analysis, we suggest recording the lane deviation, speed, time required to recover from the error, as well as the perceived liking and comfort ratings. Our approach aims to help automotive UI designers make better decisions about choosing the most suitable scent, as well as possible alternative modalities.},

abstract = {Augmented visual-audio feedback supports rhythmic motor performance in both sports training and sensorimotor synchronization practise. In home-based rehabilitation for minor stroke patients, training on a fine motor skill using rhythms not only helps to recover sophisticated motion ability but also increases their confidence and mental health recovery. Auditory information has been shown to have advantages for improving rhythmic motion performance, but it can be masked by environmental noise and may be intrusive to non-stakeholders. Under these circumstances, patients may be reluctant to practice actively due to difficulties hearing the auditory stimuli or through a concern for disturbing others. To address this issue, we explored an inconspicuous way of providing vibrotactile feedback through wristband. In order to investigate the general feasibility of a sensorimotor synchronization task, we conducted a preliminary user study with 16 healthy participants, and compared the visual-tactile feedback with visual-audio, visual-audio-tactile and visual-only feedback. Results showed that rhythmic motion accuracy with visual-tactile feedback has the equivalent facilitatory effect with visual-audio feedback. In addition, visual-tactile feedback supports smoother movements than the visual-audio feedback. In the future, after refinement with stroke patients, the system could support customization for different levels of sensorimotor synchronization training.},

abstract = {A long lasting problem in the design of auditory displays is how to design audio feedback that is aesthetically appealing and comfortable to listen to. Many systems focus solely on function and do not consider these other factors. This can lead to annoyance for users, or more extremely, abandonment of the system entirely. Instead of communicating information through sound which is built in to the system, an alternative method is to modulate acoustic parameters of a user's own music to encode information. This method - music modulation - has successfully been used in systems for conveying navigational data while walking and listening to music. This paper discusses the potential of applying this method to other contexts and types of data. We present a number of acoustic parameters of music that could be used to encode information and discuss a number of factors affecting the design of sonification systems employing them, with the goal of inciting discussion and further research into this potentially effective method of conveying information through sound.},

Through VUI, children can move the turtle, the voice agent of the game, to the target location and learn the basic programming concepts of "sequencing" and "iteration." We conducted a preliminary user study where eight children played the game and took part in a posthoc interview. The results showed that voice interaction with TurtleTalk led children to be more immersed in the game and understand the elements of programming with ease and confidence.},

We investigate the use of multimodal (auditory and/or visual) head-mounted AR displays to warn about entering hazard zones while performing an independent navigation task. As a first step in this research, we report a design-research study (including a user study), conducted to obtain a visual and an auditory AR display subjectively judged to approach equivalence.

This represents a new, more intuitive way of for example virtually exploring unknown spaces in advance. Our prototype consists of off-the-shelf VR components (i.e., treadmill, headphones, glasses, and controller) providing a simplified white cane simulation and was tested by six visually impaired subjects. Our results indicate that this interaction is yet difficult, but promising and an important step to make VR more and better usable for PVIs. As an impact on the CHI community, we would like to make this research field known to a wider audience by sharing our intermediate results and suggestions for improvements, on some of which we are already working on.},

We focus on changing the internal structures of each object made through a 3D printing process to assign a unique resonant property to it even if multiple objects have the same appearance. To identify the objects, the method identifies resonant property differences by using vibration that can pass through 3D-printed objects. The method can be applied even to low-filled 3D-printed objects as long as an acoustic wave can travel through the objects from one sensor to another. To validate the method's feasibility, we conducted a preliminary experiment to confirm whether it can be applied to low-filled 3D-printed objects and found that its average classification accuracy reached 92.2%.},

As a finger identification method for a smartwatch, we propose FingMag, a machine-learning-based method that identifies the finger on the screen with the help of a ring. For this identification, the finger's touch position and the magnetic field from a magnet embedded in the ring are used. In an offline evaluation using data collected from 12 participants, we show that FingMag can identify the finger with an accuracy of 96.21% in stationary geomagnetic conditions.},

We examined the effects of these two factors on the performance of 4T in VR in user experiments. Their results show that hover feedback had a significant main effect on the 4T performance, but grip stability did not.

To increase the effectiveness in learning Chinese character, we combine pronunciation and character writing with the integrated use of computer, projector and camera in this design. This system eases the learners to understand the meaning, cultural background and formation structure of character by using the morphological and phonetic animation projection and handwriting instruction. In comparison with screen-writing systems, this system provides a more authentic learning experience for learners through simulating the learning process of writing on real paper. We anticipate our system to be a starting point to explore the instruction in Chinese character in the field of its formation structure, pronunciation and handwriting, and to be used in the classroom or at home in the future.},

At last, we conducted observations and interviews with participants to explore factors linked with social interaction, users' perceptions of music, and the reflections on the use of audio form for self-expression or communication. We found that Audiolize Emotion prototype triggers communication and self-expression in two ways: building curiosity and supporting communication by extending expression form.

abstract = {Despite a growing body of research about the design and use of Smart Personal Assistants, existing work has mainly focused on their use as task support for individual users in rather simple problem scenarios. Less is known about their ability to improve collaboration among multiple users in more complex problem settings. In our study, we directly compare 21 groups who either use a Smart Personal Assistant tutor or a human tutor when solving a problem task. The results indicate that groups interacting with Smart Personal Assistant tutors show significantly higher task outcomes and higher degrees of collaboration quality compared to groups interacting with human tutors. The results are used to suggest areas for future research in the field of computer-supported collaboration.},

abstract = {Semi-autonomous vehicles are gradually appearing on our roads, and have already been involved in several high-profile accidents. These accidents usually occurred because the driver did not intervene in time when the automated system failed. An important issue for the design of future semi-autonomous vehicles is identifying effective methods for alerting drivers to critical events that require their intervention. To investigate this, we report the results of a lab-based simulator study in which participants had to respond to driving events while also playing an immersive mobile game on a phone. Results show that a more assertive voice alerting the driver to driving events resulted in faster reaction times and was perceived as more urgent than a less assertive voice, regardless of how immersed the driver was in the mobile game. These results suggest that the designers of future semi-autonomous vehicles should use assertive voice commends to alert drivers to critical events that require their intervention.},

Bubble offers a novel approach to grasping, where slim, ultra-lightweight silicone actuators are attached to the fingers. When the user wishes to grasp an object, the silicone units inflate pneumatically to fill the available space around the object. The inflatable units are interchangeable, can be independently inflated, and can be positioned anywhere on the fingers in any orientation, thereby enabling a wide variety of grasping gestures including the palmar grasp, pinch, etc. In this paper, we describe the implementation of our current prototype, the fabrication process of the soft inflatable units, as well as our preliminary study to evaluate our system's grasping capability.},

The electrostatic attraction force is adjusted according to the exploring speeds of user's finger. User studies of adjective and similarity ratings on roughness and stickiness of virtual materials are designed, and the results demonstrate that the sense of touching the rendered materials is similar to that of the real materials, which proves that the proposed texture rendering method can be applied to display tactile information in an electrostatic tactile display.},

We carried out an exploratory study (n=12) to examine whether and how people understand and use floor visualisations to make their navigational choices. Results suggest that floor visualisations have influenced participants' navigation decisions. Our findings showed that implicit visualisations were difficult to interpret compared to explicit visualisations. Thematic analysis of participants' interpretations revealed a contextual interpretation of explicit visualisations and non-contextual interpretation of implicit visualisations. Additionally, thematic analysis revealed that spatial behaviour is influenced by several factors including self-centredness, environmental features and the presence of others. These design insights will inform the design of history-enriched floor interfaces that direct people in the built environment.},

For creators of serious content, such as news organizations, advertisers, or educational institutions, engagement has a deeper meaning beyond likes, shares, etc. that is aimed at the audience actually processing the underlying content associated with a social media post. In this research, we report findings from a group study that aimed to understand the process and challenges of creating engaging content across three social media platforms in a major news organization. The findings from the study indicate that creating engaging content is effort- and time-consuming, and they highlight the need to support the process of creating engaging content across multiple social media platforms. Our longer-term goal is to develop a system design to support social media editors' creation of engaging content with which they can select engaging passages from news articles and select platforms on which to publish the content.},

FlexPass relies on a single, user-selected secret that can be reflected in both textual and graphical authentication secrets. Such an approach facilitates adaptability in nowadays ubiquitous user interaction contexts within the Internet of Things (IoT), in which end-users authenticate multiple times per day through a variety of interaction device types. We present an initial evaluation of the new authentication method based on an in-lab experiment with 32 participants. Analysis of results reveal that the FlexPass paradigm is memorable and that users like the adaptable perspective of the new approach. Findings are expected to scaffold the design of more user-centric knowledge-based authentication mechanisms within nowadays ubiquitous computation realms.},

While understanding the uncertainty that online workers experience as they assimilate into their career is critical to understanding online workers' needs, such an understanding is currently severely limited. thus, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 29 online freelancers to investigate critical events that contribute to uncertainty early in their online careers. We situate these critical events within the context of organizational assimilation, and how participants employ diverse information-seeking tactics.},

The remaining problem for achieving implicit user calibration is to estimate the difference between the optical axis and visual axis of the eye (angle kappa). In this paper, we propose an implicit user calibration method using face detection around the optical axis of the eye. We assume that the peak of the average of face region images indicates the visual axis of the eye in the eye coordinate system. The angle kappa is estimated as the difference between the optical axis of the eye and the peak of the average of face region images. We developed a prototype system with two cameras and two IR-LEDs. The experimental results showed that the proposed method can estimate the angle kappa more accurately than the method that uses Itti's saliency map instead of face detection.},

In other words, we have to acquire the target in spatial and temporal domains simultaneously. We call this type of task spatiotemporal moving target selection, which we find is common yet less studied in HCI. This paper presents a tentative model for predicting the error rates in spatiotemporal moving target selection. Our model integrates two latest models, the Ternary-Gaussian model and the Temporal Pointing model, to explain the influence of spatial and temporal constraints on pointing errors. In a 12-subject pointing experiment with a computer mouse, our model shows high fitting results with 0.904 R2. We discuss future research directions on this topic and how it could potentially help the design in dynamical user interfaces.},

Most of the research in target selection fields focused on the analysis of interaction results. Moreover, trajectories play a much more important role in crossing-based target selection comparing to the other interactive techniques. And an ideal model for trajectories may help computer designers make predictions about interaction results during the process of target selection rather than at the end of the whole process. We proposed a trajectory prediction model for crossing-based target selection tasks referring to dynamic model theory. Simulation results show that our model performed well in the prediction of the trajectories, endpoints and the hitting time for target-selection motion, and the average error of trajectories, endpoints and hitting time values as 17.28%, 18.17 pixel and 11.50%.},

Further, while collective responses were often combined with "avoidance" or "protective" responses, when using a personal safety app, collective responses were less often combined with other reaction types.

abstract = {Developing affectively aware technologies is a growing industry. To build them effectively, it is important to understand the features involved in discriminating between emotions. While many technologies focus on facial expressions, studies have highlighted the influence of body expressions over other modalities for perceiving some emotions. Eye tracking studies have evaluated the combination of face and body to investigate the influence of each modality, however, few to none have investigated the perception of emotion from body expressions alone. This exploratory study aimed to evaluate the discriminative importance of dynamic body features for decoding emotion. Eye tracking was used to monitor participants' eye gaze behavior while viewing clips of non-acted body movements to which they associated an emotion. Preliminary results indicate that the two primary regions attended to most often and longest were the torso and the arms. Further analysis is ongoing, however initial results independently confirm prior studies without eye tracking.},

abstract = {Public speaking is recognized as an important skill for success in learning and education. However, the mere thought of public speaking elicits anxiety in many people. This anxiety may manifest in a student's nonverbal behaviors and physiological responses which can negatively affect both performance and evaluation. While public speaking training systems have employed a variety of speaker cues to automatically evaluate and score public speaking performance, many are built on data collected in a lab setting. However, it is difficult to achieve the same level of anxiety in these environments. We posit that students would benefit from a system that provides the ability to reflect on and practice public speaking presentation skills. This preliminary study explores public speaking anxiety from physiological responses and nonverbal behaviors of English language learners in-situ as a first step toward the design and development of a public speaking practice and reflection system.},

abstract = {Both overtrust in technology and drowsy driving are safety-critical issues. Monitoring a system is a tedious task and overtrust in technology might also influence drivers' vigilance, what in turn could multiply the negative impact of both issues. The aim of this study was to investigate if trust in automation affects drowsiness. 30 participants in two age groups conducted a 45-minute ride in a level-2 vehicle on a real test track. Trust was assessed before and after the ride with a subjective trust scale. Drowsiness was captured during the experiment using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Results depict, that even a short initial system exposure significantly increases trust in automated driving. Drivers who trust the automated vehicles more show larger signs of drowsiness what may negatively impact the monitoring behavior. Drowsiness detection is important for automated vehicles, and the behavior of drowsy drivers might help to infer trust in an unobtrusively way.},

In this study, involving 3 verbal abuse types (Insult, Threat, Swearing) and 3 response styles (Avoidance, Empathy, Counterattacking), we examine whether a conversational agent's response style under varying abuse types influences those emotions found to mitigate people's aggressive behaviors. Sixty-four participants, assigned to one of the abuse type conditions, interacted with the three conversational agents in turn and reported their feelings about guiltiness, anger, and shame after each session. Our study results show that, regardless of the abuse type, the agent's response style has a significant effect on user emotions. Participants were less angry and more guilty with the empathetic agent than the other two agents. Our study findings have direct implications for the design of conversational agents.},

abstract = {Software developers use Stack Overflow on a daily basis to search for solutions to problems they encounter during bug fixing and feature enhancement. In prior work, studies have been done on mining Stack Overflow data such as for predicting unanswered questions or how and why people post. However, no work exists on how developers actually use, or more importantly, read the information presented to them on Stack Overflow. To better understand this behavior, we conduct an eye tracking study on how developers seek for information on Stack Overflow while tasked with creating human-readable summaries of methods and classes in large Java projects. Eye gaze data is collected on both the source code elements and Stack Overflow document elements at a fine token-level granularity using iTrace, our eye tracking infrastructure. We found that developers look at the text more often than the title in posts. Code snippets were the second most looked at element. Tags and votes are rarely looked at. When switching between Stack Overflow and the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE), developers often looked at method signatures and then switched to code and text elements on Stack Overflow. Such heuristics provide insight to automated code summarization tools as they decide what to give more weight to while generating summaries.},

In this paper, we present two significant findings from our analysis that highlight issues faced by data workers: (a)code hoarding and (b) excessivetask switching andcode cloning. To mitigate these issues, we provide design recommendations based on existing work, and propose to augment IDEs with an interactive visual plugin. This plugin parses source code to identify and visualize high-level task details. Data workers can use the resulting visualization to better understand and navigate the source code. As a realization of this idea, we presentAddIn, an add-in for RStudio that identifies and visualizes the hypotheses that a data worker is testing for statistical significance through her source code.},

More importantly, location of the cloud servers also affected outcomes, in that users tended to prefer some locations (e.g., US, Europe, Oceania, China) over others (e.g., Russia) for storing their cloud data.

We then assessed our new design method by searching for users who might benefit from two different technical innovations: ViBand and PaperID. We found that matchmaking with the list of occupation groups helped surface users we would likely have not considered. In addition, the customer discovery interviews helped to generate better applications and additional target users for the innovations.

The purpose of this paper is to incorporate the psychological process into feature extraction, and use these features to effectively predict the task switching behavior on smartphones. Features are extracted from the sequence of screenshots, gauging visual stimulation, cognitive load, velocity and accumulation, sentiment, and time-related factors. Labels of task switching behavior were manually tagged for 87,182 screenshots from 60 subjects. Using random forest, we demonstrate that we can correctly infer a user's task switching behavior from unstructured data in screenshots with up to 77% accuracy, demonstrating it is a viable option to use features of the screenshots to predict task switching behavior.},

For example, it can be %concerns people have when seeking help can be the concerns of burdening others, the obligation of reciprocation, etc. To understand what could reduce social costs, we conducted a study in the context of Question-Answering (QA) and investigated the following three factors inspired by literature: anonymity (posting a question anonymously), recommendation (having the system handle the question routing), and ephemerality (allowing questions to be visible only for a short period). We built a QA platform to support these three features and conducted a randomized within-subject experiment to test their effects on social costs of posting questions. Results suggest the presence of anonymity, recommendation, and ephemerality reduces the social costs which provides design implications for future community building.},

Focusing particularly on brain data, Neurocinematics has emerged as a research field using Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) sensors. Where previous work found inter subject correlations (ISC) between brain measurements of people watching movies in constrained conditions using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we seek to examine similar responses in more naturalistic settings using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS has been shown to be highly suitable for HCI studies, being more portable than fMRI and more tolerant of many natural movements than Electroencephalography (EEG). Early results found significant ISC, which gives a lot of hope and potential for using fNIRS in Neurocinematics.},

In the experiment, we provided different security recommendations about two-factor-authentication (2FA) to participants in different conditions and recorded their decisions about enabling it. Results show that participants in the condition "Disadvantage" were willing to adopt 2FA the most. The findings indicate that showing disadvantages can be useful to persuade users into better security decisions.},

Conversely, in a University network, provision of terms and conditions encourages disclosure of unethical behavior, but the presence of VPN cue inhibits it.

abstract = {Reverse engineering is a complex task essential to several software security jobs like vulnerability discovery and malware analysis. While traditional program comprehension tasks (e.g., program maintenance or debugging) have been thoroughly studied, reverse engineering diverges from these tasks as reverse engineers do not have access to developers, source code, comments, or internal documentation. Further, reverse engineers often have to overcome countermeasures employed by the developer to make the task harder (e.g., symbol stripping, packing, obfuscation). Significant research effort has gone into providing program analysis tools to support reverse engineers. However, little work has been done to understand the way they think and analyze programs, potentially leading to the lack of adoption of these tools among practitioners. This paper reports on a first step toward better understanding the reverse engineer's process and mental models and provides directions for improving program analysis tools to better fit their users. We present the initial results of a semi-structured, observational interview study of reverse engineers (n=15). Each interview investigated the questions they asked while probing the program, how they answered these questions, and the decisions made throughout. Our initial observations suggest that reverse engineers rely on a variety of reference points in both the program text and structure as well as its dynamic behavior to build hypotheses about the program's function and identify points of interest for future exploration. In most cases, our reverse engineers used a mix of static and dynamic analysis---mostly manually---to verify these hypotheses. Throughout, they rely on intuition built up over past experience. From these observations, we provide recommendations for user interface and program analysis improvements to support the reverse engineer.},

Although users can accomplish tasks as if they were asking a person, users still have problems in utilizing conversational agents effectively. To address this problem, some proposals explain how to input agent requests by using visual information such as instruction manuals and displays. However, such instructions create problems such as occupying the hands and eyes. The purpose of this study is to effectively enhance request entry by issuing instructions for use in an easy-to-understand manner without using visual information. Our proposal uses a pair of conversational agents, one is called the main agent, and the other is called the sub-agent, that have different voice types. Experiments show that agent pairing yields easier to understand instructions than using just the main agent. Furthermore, experiments also show that use instructions are easier to understand if the sub-agent reads aloud specific examples of use.},

Groups with internal diversity are typically considered to be advantageous to group performance due to the presence of different perspectives and the potential to stimulate new ideas. However, intergroup conflicts can also occur in diverse groups, especially for groups with imbalanced composition. Previous studies have pointed out that minority members often suffer from unequal participation and performance pressure, which may further decrease group outcome. Since CMC tools facilitate online collaboration, it is necessary to understand how group composition interacts with the affordances of CMC tools on group collaboration. In this study, we tested three gender compositions (female-majority, equal-gender-composition, male-majority) with two communication contexts (video-text, text-only) and found that both gender composition and communication medium influenced group collaboration. Design implications for online collaboration are provided based on our findings.},

However, literature has little to say about how users would receive and use these stories. Given the quality of stories generated by modern AI algorithms, users will nearly inevitably have to edit these stories before putting them to real use. In this paper, we present the first analysis of how human users edit machine-generated stories. We obtained 962 short stories generated by one of the state-of-the-art visual storytelling models. For each story, we recruited five crowd workers from Amazon Mechanical Turk to edit it. Our analysis of these edits shows that, on average, users (i) slightly shortened machine-generated stories, (ii) increased lexical diversity in these stories, and (iii) often replaced nouns and their determiners/articles with pronouns. Our study provides a better understanding on how users receive and edit machine-generated stories, informing future researchers to create more usable and helpful story generation systems.},

abstract = {Creating personas from actual online user information is an advantage of the data-driven persona approach. However, modern online systems often provide big data from millions of users that display vastly different behaviors, resulting in possibly thousands of personas representing the entire user population. We present a technique for reducing the number of personas to a smaller number that efficiently represents the complete user population, while being more manageable for end users of personas. We first isolate the key user behaviors and demographical attributes, creating thin personas, and we then apply an algorithmic cost function to collapse the set to the minimum needed to represent the whole population. We evaluate our approach on 26 million user records of a major international airline, isolating 1593 personas. Applying our approach, we collapse this number to 493, a 69% decrease in the number of personas. Our research findings have implications for organizations that have a large user population and desire to employ personas.},

abstract = {One of the critiques of personas is that the underlying data that they are based on may stale, requiring further rounds of data collection. However, we could find no empirical evidence for this criticism. In this research, we collect monthly demographic data over a two-year period for a large online content publisher and generate fifteen personas each month following an identical algorithmic approach. We then compare the sets of personas month-over-month, year-over-year, and over the whole two-year period. Findings show that there is an average 18.7% change in personas monthly, a 23.3% change yearly, and a 47% change over the entire period. Findings support the critique that personas do change over time and also highlight that changes in the underlying data can occur within a relatively short period. The implication is that organizations using personas should employ ongoing data collection to detect possible persona changes.},

In the field of HCI, however, the use of conversational fillers (e.g., "um," "uh," etc.) by Conversational Agents have not been fully explored in an experimental setting. We observed the effects on user perceptions of Intelligence, Human-likeness and Likability of Conversational Agents by a 2 x 2 experimental design. From the results of 26 total participants, we concluded that 1) the use of fillers by Conversational Agents are perceived as less intelligent and less likable in task-oriented conversations, 2) and the fillers did not have any statistically significant change in perception of human-likeness. However, further examination showed that users reported filler-speaking agents as more entertaining for social-oriented conversations. With these findings, we discuss design implications for voice-based Conversational Agents.},

We report the results of a controlled, quantitative study with 20 participants which focused on testing the effectiveness of three different nudges in an e-commerce environment and whether their use has an impact on participants' trust. We found that products nudged via an anchoring effect were more frequently "bought" by participants, and that while participants deemed a store version implementing nudges and one which did not to be equally trustworthy, they perceived the former as technically inferior. Overall we found the effects of nudging to be less dominant than reported in previous studies.},

We designed a research prototype called "Anchor," where a smart speaker news assistant provides users with news about specific keywords and responds to users' questions. We recruited 21 participants and conducted a user study where they consumed the news with Anchor, followed by post hoc interviews. The results of the qualitative analysis revealed the following. (1) People preferred interactive news to news briefings. (2) People found it useful to get answers on their questions by talking with the assistant. (3) Although users were allowed to ask questions anytime, they often hesitated, as they did not want to miss the whole flow of the news. (4) However, they had difficulty recalling the questions they had not asked. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for news design in a voice-only user interface.},

Open card sorting is a widely-used method to create information architectures based on users' groupings of the content. However, little is known about the method's cross-study reliability: Does it produce consistent content groupings for similar profile participants involved in different card sort studies? This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the method's cross-study reliability. Six card sorts involving 140 participants were conducted: three open sorts for a travel website, and three for an eshop. Results showed that participants provided highly similar card sorting data for the same content. A rather high agreement of the produced navigation schemes was also found. These findings provide support for the cross-study reliability of the open card sorting method.},

abstract = {The analysis of tasks and workflows is a longstanding tradition in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). In many cases, it provides a crucial basis for the usable design of interactive systems. However, established tools almost exclusively focus on task content and structure, thereby ignoring the more "experiential" aspects of task performance. To fill this gap, we combined Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA) with the analysis of subjective accounts of meaning. Our explorative study (N=4) suggests that objective descriptions resulting from HTA and subjective experience of one and the same activity differ. People tend to subsume experientially unimportant sequences or even ignore these within their subjective experience. Furthermore, people are able to name experientially important sequences and to relate these to feelings and thoughts (i.e., meaning). In the future, more refined versions of our approach may support practitioners with the design of meaningful interaction and activities.},

Results revealed that the number of usability issues is significantly affected by the Openness trait. Emotional Stability significantly affects the type of reported usability issues. Problem severity is not affected by any trait. Valence ratings are significantly affected by Conscientiousness, whereas Agreeableness, Emotional Stability and Openness significantly affect arousal ratings. Finally, Openness has a significant effect on the number of detected peaks in user's skin conductance.},

abstract = {The use of complex machine learning models can make systems opaque to users. Machine learning research proposes the use of post-hoc explanations. However, it is unclear if they give users insights into otherwise uninterpretable models. One minimalistic way of explaining image classifications by a deep neural network is to show only the areas that were decisive for the assignment of a label. In a pilot study, 20 participants looked at 14 of such explanations generated either by a human or the LIME algorithm. For explanations of correct decisions, they identified the explained object with significantly higher accuracy (75.64 % vs. 18.52 %). We argue that this shows that explanations can be very minimalistic while retaining the essence of a decision, but the decision-making contexts that can be conveyed in this manner is limited. Finally, we found that explanations are unique to the explainer and human-generated explanations were assigned 79 % higher trust ratings. As a starting point for further studies, this work shares our first insights into quality criteria of post-hoc explanations.},
