abstract = {Pretend play is a symbolic activity in one's childhood which develops critical competences such as mental representation, linguistic expression and social knowledge. However, children with autism spectrum condition (ASC) are often found lacking in pretend play. Inspired by the analogy between pretend play and Augmented Reality (AR), both of which require dual representations of reality and its symbolic counterpart, we designed an AR system that aims to assist young children with ASC to be engaged in open-ended pretend play by overlaying suggested imaginary "mental images" over the physical environment. A usability study with normally developed children aged 4 to 5 was conducted to inform a future empirical study with autistic children.},

abstract = {Real-time captioning provides deaf and hard of hearing users with access to live spoken language. The most common source of real-time captions are professional stenographers, but they are expensive (up to $200/hr). Recent work shows that groups of non-experts can collectively caption speech in real-time by directing workers to different portions of the speech and automatically merging the pieces together. This work uses 'one size fits all' segment durations regardless of an individual worker's ability or preferences. In this paper, we explore the effect of adaptively scaling the amount of content presented to each worker based on their past and recent performance. For instance, giving fast typists longer segments and giving workers shorter segments as they fatigue. Studies with 24 remote crowd workers, using ground truth in segment calculations, show that this approach improves average coverage by over 54%, and F1 score (harmonic mean) by over 44%.},

The guidelines include: the ability for users to control the level of corrections, the timeliness and intuitiveness of the information, and the compatibility with screen readers. We then developed a prototype with which we are conducting a case study evaluation, mainly, to come up with more guidelines. Emerging guidelines include: differentiating voices associated with content and formatting information, the ability to record user preference, and a preview of the surrounding context of the formatted items.},

Thus, we propose to develop a domain specific taxonomy for the design of user interaction in AAL systems. We adopted a systematic taxonomy development approach that combines an empirical and a pseudo-conceptual strategy. Six co-researchers from different disciplines conduct the iterative research process. Next to AAL systems existing taxonomies in the field of human-computer interaction are analyzed following the Delphi method. In this paper we present our research process and preliminary results from the first iteration. The final taxonomy allows classification and should support the analysis of user interaction utilized in AAL systems. Furthermore, it can deal as a practical design guideline.},

We have chosen a dwell time based eye typing application, since eye typing can be easily modeled as a sequence of eye movements from one key to the next. By modeling how dwell time selection is performed, we show how the GE and OC can be used to generate visual feedback that facilitates the eye movement to the next key. A pilot experiment was conducted in which participants had to type short phrases on a virtual keyboard using 2 different visual feedback methods, one traditional feedback based on animation and a new feedback scheme using the GE and OC. Results show that using a feedback that exploits these phenomena facilitates eye movements and can improve eye typing user experience and performance.},

In this work-in-progress report, we propose a preliminary, theoretical model of factors that influence trust in automation. Our model utilizes three layers of analysis (dispositional trust, situational trust, and learned trust) to explain the variability of trust in a wide range of circumstances. We are in the process of verifying certain aspects of the model empirically, but our current framework provides a useful perspective for future investigations into the intricacies of trust in automated systems.},

Our results indicate that allowing for eye contact fosters the perception of gestures.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing platforms aim to leverage the collective intelligence of a largely distributed Internet workforce to solve a wide range of tasks. Crowd workers (unlike in a typical organization), exhibit varying work patterns, expertise, and performance - with little or no control that can be imposed on them. Requesters (e.g. enterprises) also exhibit diverse requirements in terms of the size, complexity and timings of the tasks, as well as SLAs (performance expectations). Clearly, the heterogeneity makes the choice of a platform suited for a given task difficult for the user. This paper highlights this problem and proposes CrowdUtility - a first-of-a-kind statistical machine learning approach, which models the dynamic behavioral characteristics of crowdsourcing platforms and uses them to recommend the best platform for the enterprise task(s). Initial results from real-world experiments suggest that the proposed system provides an attractive solution to this erstwhile unsolved problem},

In this paper, we present the first results of evaluating the acceptance of Social Devices in a laboratory setting. We tested two versions of a game running on Social Devices by exposing the participants to four different scenarios varying in proactivity. The majority of the participants (74%, N=27) preferred to have control over starting the game. However, 48% ranked an application proactively sharing personal information to friends as the best of the four presented scenarios.},

The main dependent variable was whether users' socially desirable responses were affected by the type of interviewer and that amount of self-disclosure provided by the interviewer.

Audio Gift uses hand-only gestures along with haptic feedback to capture and share audio notes from a discussion. The aim is to enhance, in a subtle way, the capture of key points during a research discussion. In addition to describing the prototype, we present observations and findings of an exploratory field study with archaeologists. These findings highlight the value and challenges of Audio Gift.},

abstract = {Direct-touch interactive surfaces become pervasive in our daily lives due to personal mobile devices such as smartphones. However, inaccurate target pointing on direct touch-based mobile devices, which occurs due to the ambiguity of the user-aimed point estimation from the finger contact region, often causes trouble for users. To understand this problem of direct-touch interactions, we conducted an experimental study where we explored the touch bias of one thumb posture on direct touch-based mobile devices. Moreover, we proposed a novel method of splitting a touch surface into several regions; this method enables an analysis of the touch bias according to angular and longitudinal criteria.},

abstract = {When we go to the museum, we see many interesting objects that have fascinating stories related to them. However, visitors do not often share these experiences with people that have not visited the exhibition. Sharing is beneficial both because it can create interest and attract people to the museum, and because it can help people who cannot attend the visit (for example, is physically unable to do so) to still enjoy it. We were interested to understand the extent and motivation behind sharing (or not sharing) and test how to encourage visitors to do so. We conducted and are conducting various surveys and trials, for which we report the preliminary results in this paper. Initial findings show that i) people today rarely share their visits for lack of content to complement their storytelling, and ii) by providing visitors with a simple and easy-to-create virtual photobook with their dearest memories from the visit we can significantly enhance this sharing.},

The correct colored zone was indicated by a word for a color displayed in congruent or incongruent colored LED lights (e.g., "yellow" displayed in yellow or red, respectively). Participants took more time to place the object in a zone and made more errors when the word was lit with an incongruent than congruent color.

The simulation augments the data by biomechanical quantities from which we derive an index of fatigue. We are working on an interactive analysis tool that allows practitioners to identify and compare movements with desirable performance and fatigue properties.

The qualitative results from a field experimental were gathered to reframe our future direction. Several design implications are also addressed to identify the opportunities for the future work. We argue that a reminiscence aid should (1) evoke curiosity and empathy for shifting responsibility, (2) provide embodied metaphor to communicate personal significance and system's expression, and (3) interweave reminiscence activities into daily practice.},

abstract = {In the study, we explored potential design decision biases by understanding the relationship of the information being used and overconfidence of design outcomes that arise from the anchoring process in design. A total of twenty-eight industrial designers carried out a two-way between-subjects study administered by the four types of design exercise. Designers showed a strong anchoring effect when they employed "consistent knowledge-evidence" information rather than "inconsistent knowledge-evidence" information given. The empirical findings shed light on a double-edged anchoring effect in the design process, further suggesting the implications of the use of design information for educating HCI practitioners},

abstract = {Several theories of how novices explore a new interface have arisen in HCI and have led to methods and tools for UI practitioners to predict users' behavior on proposed interfaces and improve their design ideas before implementation. These tools depend on obtaining quantitative estimates of information scent, which usually requires a large corpus of documents representing the background knowledge of target users and an algorithm that uses this corpus to calculate the information scent between a user's goal and the labels in the GUI. Prior work has often used proprietary algorithms and propriety, now outdated corpora. This note presents an open source approach to information scent that is as good a foundation for research and practice as a previously published proprietary system, exemplifies its use in CogTool-Explorer, and opens the door for researchers to explore many important questions about novice exploration of interfaces.},

Further, children of immigrants and refugees accounted for the largest segment growth rate, between 1990 and 2008, in the USA for children who are younger than eight years of age. While diversity brings incredible richness, it also brings responsibility for helping immigrants participate fully in American life and culture versus isolating themselves within ethnic communities. We propose an experimental multi-disciplinary framework that uses design thinking combined with perspectives from computer science, information science, and information behavior. Our approach seeks to deeply understand how ethnic minority youth serve as information and technology mediaries within their social networks, and blends these perspectives into a community-based, multi-day workshop format called "teen design days."},

In most research, the authoritative designer view remains the touchstone against which all user interpretation is evaluated. However, the proliferation of technology use in daily life puts this view under increasing pressure. As technology is more often being used beyond the workplace, more diverse target user groups and contexts of use make interaction broader and more personal. Acknowledging this increased variation in user interpretation, we are developing an evaluation method to identify and analyze variation and shifts in end user interpretation, helping designers to balance and support different meanings, instead of imposing only one authoritative interpretation.},

In this study, we used a participatory design approach to community informatics to explore why some do not engage with the support offered and the potential for service design to increase engagement. This is a community where on-line service delivery is a method used to deliver information and support and so taking a community informatics lens helps to inform both on and off-line service design. This paper explores the use of four participatory design principles selected to improve the extent and quality of participation: ceding control, segmentation, situation and envisioning control. In this first phase of the study we discovered how the principle of feedback between segmented participant groups helps to develop an understanding of the service design needs for the whole community and is a potential technique for community informatics and service design in general to improve the quality of input to community service design.},

We began with a workshop that scoped out all of the potential virtual hospice services, which were condensed into a core set of five services. We then conducted interviews with selected Hospice staff. The final step involved presenting our recommendations to the Hospice, including a storyboard of how the virtual hospice might operate in practice. We took the Hospice's feedback and incorporated it into a final report. Overall, we feel that the knowledge exchange process generated a more accurate and realistic implementation plan.},

The roller is composed of two parts. One part is set hot and the other is set cold by embedded Peltier devices. When the device is rolled on the user's skin, the skin is exposed to hot and cold stimuli alternatively. We also evaluated the elicited sensation and confirmed that it could partly deliver pain sensation.},

abstract = {Nonverbal communication between patients and clinicians affects the delivery of empathic patient-centered care and patient outcomes. To be effective communicators, clinicians must appropriately encode, decode, and regulate nonverbal cues, such as speech rate, pitch, facial expression, and body language. Yet, few efforts to develop tools for enhancing clinician communication have focused on nonverbal aspects of the clinical encounter. To address this gap, we describe a novel solution that both uses social signal processing technology (SSP) to capture nonverbal cues in real time and displays instant visual feedback. In this paper, we examine the theoretical underpinnings of nonverbal cues and their critical role in clinical encounters. We then describe opportunities for capturing nonverbal cues with SSP and explore visual designs for feeding back those social signals to enhance clinicians' nonverbal communication.},

We conducted video observations to evaluate user experience of four low-functioning children with an autism spectrum disorder while they were playing a prototype of a game. Our preliminary results suggest that despite its limitations, video observation can be a useful technique for evaluating episodic user experience of children with special needs.},

"Serious games", especially therapeutic games on a hybrid medium, have been proven to serve as a useful tool for behavioral therapy. In this work, we present such a hybrid therapy game: "Invasion of the Wrong Planet". Based on the game, we demonstrate essential design principles for the development of therapeutic games. We focus on specific aspects of behavioral therapy, depending on which desired behavior is encouraged and not enforced. The project provides a basis for discussion on how collaboration using therapeutic games in general can be improved.},

It provides high-accuracy sensing of whether a user's fingers are hovering above the mouse. This kind of hovering is known to cause pains in the forearm. The integration of trans-parent sensing in existing products enables medical researchers to gain new insights on unhealthy habits. The Habit-Aware Mouse is a diagnostic sensing tool to get detailed knowledge about the user's unhealthy computer habits. Sensing is the first step to enable feedback, preventing injuries from finger hovering.},

In order to evaluate our concept we created a software replica of an airport split-flap display, deployed as an interactive public art installation. Visitors tweet, or through an adjacent laptop, contribute to the overall storytelling process by providing a story fragment that appears on the split-flap display for other visitors to read and build on. We argue that in the right conditions ambiguity can trigger curiosity and invite interaction, but special care is needed to avoid confusing and alienating users.

abstract = {This paper reports on experience design work currently in progress. "Wet Pixels" is intended to stimulate discussion around the notion of reproducing original digital images in a physical medium. The prototype's design is informed by mechanical reproduction devices (e.g. relief press, large format camera) and retrospective print processes (halftone, dot matrix). The original conceptual design (Figure 1) constitutes a miniature camera encased in a wooden viewing frame that would enable viewers to select and capture photographs. This image could subsequently be printed onto Japanese paper using an Arduino-controlled matrix of stepper motors topped with paint-tipped sponges. When presented in a gallery, Wet Pixels provides users with greater sensory feedback (physical, visual, auditory) than entirely digital processes through tangible creative mark-making on to paper.},

A remote robot-view, used to control an assistive robot, allows people to take on the perspective of the robot and thereby explore its action-possibilities in context. This view is extended with a dynamic graphical layer (filters and shape-changing mask). This layer is expressively mapped to the robot's 'feelings' constituted by its internal conditions and direct interaction with its surrounding (environment and person). The Emotional-Perspective design will be evaluated to address the expressive mapping and the emergence of meaning in interaction.},

abstract = {Recently the number of users who purchase fashion-related items using mobile devices has increased rapidly. However, most users find it hard to find their choice of apparel items due to the mobile's limited screen space. Because the lists of items are displayed images optimized for viewing with a mobile device, it is hard for users to visualize the item size and how it will coordinate with other items. In this paper, we propose the "KiTeMiROOM" interface to quickly browse coordinating tops, bottoms, and shoes by adjusting the scale of the clothing images while simultaneously displaying them using carousel panels. To implement this function, we created clothing-only image data by mechanically extracting the images and features of various clothing from a huge collection of apparel on e-commerce websites. Finally, we compared our proposed method with an ordinal list-view method used in these websites and confirmed that the KiTeMiROOM interface enhances the experience of searching for coordinated clothing.},

We compare the impact of alarming with a plain screen based task guidance interface, a task guidance interface with additional ambient light or with tactile feedback. The results show the greatest impact of alarming for tactile feedback. Regarding the attraction of attention, we were only able to observe a tendency, because this specific task switching seems to be too difficult.

We compare two gameplay situations: playing a digital game before watching a game-play video and playing a digital game after watching a gameplay video. Using a between-participants design, to measure learning effectiveness we recorded Mu rhythms, which are indirectly linked to mirror neuron activation during imitation learning. We also analyze hemispheric frontal alpha asymmetry.

abstract = {This paper describes the macro-ergonomics approach currently being delivered in collaboration with a West Australian school community to ensure healthy computing for students in middle school (ages 11- 17 Years). Background: Introduction of notebook computers in many schools has become integral to learning. While this is rewarding from an educational perspective, increased screen-based exposure has been associated with potential risks to physical and visual health. Unhealthy computing behaviours include frequent and long durations of exposure; awkward postures due to inappropriate furniture and workstation layout, and ignoring computer-related discomfort. Methods: This research uses a community-based participatory research approach. Students in Year 7 in 2011 at a co-educational middle school, their parents, and teachers have been recruited. Baseline data was collected on students' knowledge of computer ergonomics, current notebook exposure, and attitudes towards healthy computing behaviours; and teachers' and self-perceived competence to promote healthy notebook use among students, and what education they wanted. The intervention phase is a health promotion program that is being developed by an inter-professional team in collaboration with students, teachers and parents to embed concepts of ergonomics education in relevant school activities and school culture. End of year changes in reported and observed student computing behaviours will be used to determine the effectiveness of the program. Significance: Building a body of evidence regarding physical health benefits to students from this school-based ergonomics program can guide policy development on the healthy use of computers within children's educational environments. Additionally, an approach that attends to epidemiological risk factors, whole community attitudes, environmental factors and the organizational environment and culture of the community is essential.},

This work addresses the challenge of collecting and presenting subgoal labels to a large number of video tutorials. We introduce a mixed-initiative approach to collect subgoal labels in a scalable and efficient manner. The key component of this method is learnersourcing, which channels learners' activities using the video interface into useful input to the system. The presented method will contribute to the broader availability of subgoal labels in how-to videos.},

abstract = {Learning English through playing is expected to help with the effort of seeking new possibilities, from understanding that play is fundamental to the development of a child's capacity to learn. This extended abstract describes the function and system of a second-language learning toy while referring to some educational points to be considered in second-language education. We present iSpy, an interactive language-learning toy for preschool children. Along with the features and values that could be offered by iSpy, concerns and their reflection on the design of iSpy are introduced. Design of iSpy also includes building a collaborating system, consisting of the: toy itself, database, and application to a smart device. iSpy utilizes the living environment as a language learning resource. It is achieved by providing rich audio contents related to the surrounding objects based on the RFID tag mapping information. Tag reading histories are stored and processed to provide constant updates and feedback for parents. The system as a whole is expected to provide a new scenario for the learning toy in terms of creating a sustainable structure.},

We believe that one of the best ways to combat this problem is to use these incidents as "teaching moments", encouraging teens to reflect on their behavior and choices. Sites that offer community discussions around the ethical aspects of social situations can help teens feel less alone in their plight, and provide useful advice and emotional support. But the success of these "crowdsourced ethics" sites depends critically on the user feeling like discussions are relevant to their own personal experience.We have augmented the crowdsourced ethics site "Over The Line", offered by MTV Networks, with a personalized story matcher that classifies stories according to dynamically discovered high-level themes like "sending nude pictures online" or "feeling pressure in relationships". The matcher uses a mixed-initiative LDA machine learning technique [2], and a commonsense knowledge base specialized to the bullying problem. The site is currently public, and attracts an audience of thousands of users daily.},

Using multiple devices introduces a configuration overhead as users have to manually reconfigure all devices according to ongoing activities. Especially in an environment such as an office, where the use of multiple devices is more common, the process of configuring them in context of ongoing activities is cumbersome. In this paper, we present the initial explorations of the ActivityDesk system, an interactive desk that supports multi-device configuration work and workspace aggregation into a personal ad hoc smart space for knowledge workers. The main goal of ActivityDesk is to reduce the configuration work required to use multiple devices at the same time by using an interactive desk as a configuration space.},

With the proposed method, 2D images can have its own tactility. The main advantage of this method over previous information-handling methods is that the resultant format remains compatible with an ordinary 2D image. For example, if the original image is a PNG file, the resulting image can remain as a PNG file. We conclude with explorations of geometry-based interactive applications and discussions on compatibility and transparency issues.},

This paper presents an approach suitable for the design of auditory displays based on the working practices of soundtrack composers. We describe our initial investigation into the feasibility of the idea. This has involved a literature review and the distributing of an on going survey to ascertain the working practices of soundtrack composers. We justify our ideas for the initial method and toolkit for its execution from the initial results of both the review and the survey. We then conclude by discussing further plans for development and evaluation, which involve identifying key points within an HCI scenario for sound design.},

abstract = {Menus are one of the effective user interfaces which is used for navigation in many systems like desktop applications, voice system, etc. Placement of each menu item in the menu tree is known as menu configuration. Deciding optimal configuration in a menu based system is a challenging task. This task to decide the optimal configuration dynamically can be done through adaptive interfaces. Adaptive interfaces play significant role when optimality varies with time. However, the negative impacts of adaptive interfaces on the users familiar with the system discourage its use. There is a need to have separate design for handling users familiar and unfamiliar with the system. In this work, we study the adverse effect of adaptive voice menu on the experienced users. We also propose strategies to reduce the adverse effect of adaptivity. We design and deploy a menu based voice system to conduct a control experiment to evaluate proposed strategies. The proposed strategies try to differentiate between familiar and unfamiliar users and takes remedial steps to suppress the adverse effect of adaptive interfaces for familiar users.},

Yet, only the increasing adoption of smartphones today unveils real world implications, since a large number of users currently use location-based services and GPS-enabled devices for a multitude of purposes. Recently, research suggested that location privacy is not a relevant problem for today's users. However, a study we conducted indicates that it might be too early to call off investigations of location privacy: In a survey of 414 users on online media sharing behavior, we found that location was rated as the type of photo metadata that poses the highest risk to privacy. Therefore, we revisit the discussion on location privacy in this paper and propose factors that can explain the conflicting views.},

abstract = {Even though users have become increasingly concerned about their privacy online, they continue to disclose deeply personal information in a number of online venues, including e-commerce portals and social networking sites. Scholars have tried to explain this inconsistency between attitudes and behavior by suggesting that online users consciously weigh the trade-off between the costs and benefits of online information disclosure. We argue that online user behaviors are not always rational, but may occur due to expedient decision-making in the heat of the moment. Such decisions are based on cognitive heuristics (i.e., rules of thumb) rather than on a careful analysis of each transaction. Based on this premise, we seek to identify the specific triggers for disclosure of private information online. In the experiment reported here, we explore the operation of two specific heuristics-benefit and fuzzy boundary-in influencing privacy-related attitudes and behaviors. Theoretical and design implications are discussed.},

However, bank policies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia seem to run contrary to their clients' requirements when they prevent them from sharing their authentications with their family. We investigated Saudi participants behaviour towards authentication and found that credentials are shared between couples as a sign of mutual trust. This, may extend to siblings and parents too. The consequence of such behaviour is that these account holders are liable for any loss, and this also increases the opportunities for so-called spouse attacks. Saudi bank policies need, at one and the same time, to match their clients' behaviour and simultaneously to provide complete and effective security for them.},

We introduce a crowdsourcing annotation tool for Photoshop how-to videos with a three-stage method that consists of: (1) gathering timestamps of important events, (2) labeling each event, and (3) capturing how each event affects the task of the tutorial. Our ultimate goal is to generalize our method to be applied to other domains of how-to videos. We evaluate our annotation tool with Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to investigate the accuracy, costs, and feasibility of our three-stage method for annotating large numbers of video tutorials. Improvements can be made for stages 1 and 3, but stage 2 produces accurate labels over 90% of the time using majority voting. We have observed that changes in the instructions and interfaces of each task can improve the accuracy of the results significantly.},

This work is motivated by the fact that there is a lack of possibilities to reflect the receiver's wishes when the sender is capturing or sharing information. This informational asymmetry may result in unnecessary or annoying information for the passive receiver. We suggest that 'demand-driven sharing' is a good alternative to existing sharing practices and tested the concept in a case study. We will discuss how the users have adopted our prototype in their social practices. In particular, we have observed a highly altruistic culture in users' interaction using Onegai, which is barely seen in today's social media landscape.},

abstract = {This study explored whether artificial cues of others on social networking sites (SNS) have an effect on a user's tweeting behavior in frustrating situations. By manipulating artificial cues of others, we measured the statements posted by participants on a hypothetical SNS under two different experimental situations: one was the agent condition, in which task instructions were given by an assistant agent throughout the task, and the other was the control condition in which task instructions were given through a text box. In each condition, participants were first asked to read fictional stories including frustrating interpersonal and intrapersonal events and to adopt these situations as their own. Participants were then asked to tweet about their feelings on the hypothetical SNS. The negativity and aggressiveness of each statement in both conditions were assessed by other participants. Results demonstrate that the statements for the frustrating interpersonal event posted by participants under the agent condition were more often evaluated as non-negative and less often evaluated as negative-and-blaming-of-others than those posted under the control condition. Conversely, there was no difference between conditions in the statements for the frustrating intrapersonal event. These findings suggest that the implication of the presence of others, such as an assistant agent, in the tweeting environment inhibits disparaging tweeting behavior on SNS.},

In a nuclear power plant simulation scenario users were assisted by an anthropomorphic agent completing several tasks. Afterwards the agent was assessed using questionnaires that were presented in three different modalities. One group completed a pen and paper questionnaire, another one used a web-based version of the questionnaire, and the third group was asked the questions directly by the agent. We expected the group assessed directly by the agent to behave more politely and to overall give the best ratings. While we did not attain the expected results our study revealed first evidence that the "Computers as Social Actors" paradigm might have to be reconsidered. We argue that the prevalence of computers nowadays might have caused computers not to be treated as "standalone social entities" anymore but to be rather perceived as a "window to the Internet" rendering social behavior towards computers obsolete under certain conditions.},

With the emerging trend of the Web 2.0, however, different kinds of people are likely having less chance to share information with each other. How to design for supporting better information flow among different social, taste, or opinion groups of people becomes a challenging question for digital designers. In this work-in-progress paper we present our on-going research of exploring a crowd-based system for facilitating natural information flow among different types of people. We conducted a Wizard-of-OZ study to simulate push-based human powered recommendation, and learn how participants react when receiving unexpected information. Based on the findings, we designed and implemented a web application for encouraging different kinds of people to exchange information in a peer-to-peer way. Next steps include designing pairing strategy and conducting user study.},

In this paper we present work in progress to develop intelligent interfaces to social media that use commonsense knowledge bases and automated narrative analyses of text communications between users to trigger selective interventions and prevent negative outcomes. While other approaches seek merely to classify the overall topic of the text, we try to match stories to finer-grained ''scripts' that represent stereotypical events and actions. For example, many bullying stories can be matched to a ''revenge' script that describes trying to harm someone who has harmed you. These tools have been implemented in an initial prototype system and tested on a database of real stories of cyberbullying collected on MTV's ''A Thin Line' Web site.},

In this paper, we present Power of Friends, a novel approach to friendsourcing games, which involves identifying the unanimous opinion of all the friends about a question related to an individual. We tested our proposed approach with seven different groups and were able to generate 47 facts about members of the selected groups.

abstract = {In online peer production, users assess potential collaborators' expertise and warmth to inform interactions. However, people often make inaccurate first impressions. These false impressions hurt collaboration and lead to conflict based on incorrect behavioral attributions. Online peer production interface design can reduce or enhance impression accuracy. In this paper, we suggest ways to reduce bias in online impression formation. Based on our own previous research and social psychology literature on impression formation, we propose ways of presenting individuals' work history and interaction traces to reduce bias in impression formation. The design recommendations we present should improve efficiency and satisfaction with interactions in large-scale online peer production settings.},

More specifically, we present a mobile augmented reality application to support various parts of boulder training. The proposed approach also incorporates sharing and other social features. Thus our solution supports collaborative training by providing an intuitive way to create, share and define goals and challenges together with friends. Furthermore we propose a novel method of trackable generation for augmented reality. Synthetically generated images of climbing walls are used as trackables for real, existing walls.},

As a user points a smart phone or tablet at a physical object, an augmented reality (AR) application recognizes the object and offers an intuitive graphical interface to program the object's behavior and interactions with other objects. Once reprogrammed, the Smarter Object can then be operated with a simple tangible interface (such as knobs, buttons, etc). As such Smarter Objects combine the adaptability of digital objects with the simple tangible interface of a physical object. We have implemented several Smarter Objects and usage scenarios demonstrating the potential of this approach.},

For this purpose we built the prototype of an assistive system projecting instructions directly into the workspace (in situ). While it can be applied in every production environment, the system was first implemented and tested where it is needed the most: in a sheltered work organization employing persons with impairments.It could be shown that the assembly times could be slightly reduced by the augmented system. However it had a "catalytic" effect on the test subjects' work quality: While some seem to be overwhelmed by the new information density and perform worse, others perform much better than the control group and significantly reduce error rates. The qualitative results show that although impaired persons retain a critical perspective on systems directly changing the way they have been working for years, all users would like to retry working with the system. When looking at additional aids like the projection of a real-sized model in the workspace, the users invariantly accept its benefits for their assembly work.},

Thus in this paper, the influence on user's communication behavior is investigated. The analysis of the recorded video of the study revealed that the system affected user's communication behavior such as turn taking, speech time, speech overlapping, and gaze. The result suggests that considering the local site front view as a background of the remote person is one practical way to create the same-room illusion, which facilitates communication.},

We report preliminary observations of OneSpace's use, noting that it encourages cross-site, full-body interactions, and that participants employed the depth cues in their interactions.

In replaying the sound, the system attempts to change the replay speed to minimize the difference between the target of respiration phase and the observed (listener's) respiration phase. Thus, a listener using the system has more chances to listen to a specific phrase with a specific respiration phase. In an experiment, chromatic scale movements were presented with different replay strategies to evaluate the system. Although the participant did not know about the control system, they reported a difference in their arousal feeling. The results indicate that music presentation that follows the listener's respiration will have significant effect on the impression of sound, suggesting that we may extend the possibility of sound presentation.},

We discuss initial findings showing that emotional arousal does improve the quality of memory recall associated with emotionally arousing events. In particular, the high arousal photos support richer recall of episodic memories than low arousal ones, i.e. over 50% improvement. We also consider how various phenomenological characteristics of autobiographical memories such as event, emotions, thoughts, place and time are differently cued by the AffectCam.},

Heuristics are intended to provide a structure for improving game design. The technique of using heuristics to review designs has gained wide acceptance in productivity products. The PLAY heuristics [2] is the further iteration of HEP [1], general principles of optimal player experience. GAP is another set of principles, focused on first time player, tutorial use and initial game play. We conducted a study to assess the benefits of using heuristics for games. Results showed that heuristics are more effective than "unassisted intuition" not only in identifying problems, but also in inspiring recommendations for enhancements to the games' player experience. Future analysis of the data will take this analysis further, examining the quality of recommendations.},

By studying the language used by game players, we can explore the common traits of computer games which may reveal playability problems and information about game classification. As the first step to use the lexical approach, this study attempts to build a dictionary of game-descriptive words for future lexical analyses. The detailed development process was discussed.},

We manipulated attention because it is known to influence immersion and time perception differently.

Fifteen participants played a racing game in a range of conditions. Players' experience of immersion was captured via a subjective questionnaire and evoked cortical potentials to an auditory oddball task. Results indicated that slow wave potentials were sensitive to task demand, i.e. impossible demand reduced attention to the game. There was also a weak effect of display type at both frontal and central sites that was indicative of greater immersion for the large TV screen compared to other display types. This study provides preliminary data on the decomposition of immersion into sensory and cognitive components.},

Their preferences were assessed through electroencephalography (EEG) and a Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Our results show no significant difference in EEG intensity between participants using their preferred or non-preferred button settings. Preference also appears to have no significant effect on subjective feelings assessed by the GEQ. We have identified three distinct factors that may have potentially compromised this study.

Testing was performed with two different games, and a total of sixty users to validate our findings. Results show that different persuasive technique designs can effectively be used to improve player performance as well as regulating their physiological state into a decreased stress status.

Balancing play in exertion games has previously been explored by altering the physical effort. To further our understanding of how to design more balanced experiences, we extend this prior work by studying the affect on play of using a score handicap, which gives the less skilled player an initial score advantage. A performance handicap was also studied by asking the most skilled player to play with the non-dominant hand. We studied digital and non-digital table tennis games, which provide different game interactions, as examples of non-parallel, competitive games. Our results show that these different game interactions influenced the impact that the different handicaps had on player's scores. Therefore, we suggest that the game interaction is a key element to understand the suitability of score and performance balancing methods.},

abstract = {The human computer interaction (HCI) research continues to furiously enrich the natural interaction paradigm. Hence, new novel interaction techniques employ the whole body movements for interactions with ambient interactive systems. The recent wide spread adoption of this paradigm critically invokes the problem of interaction documentation. We therefore, as part of our research on dynamic interaction ensembles in ambient spaces, aim at a standard machine and human readable documentation method for natural interactions. Our approach extends previous research on movement description and analysis methods inspired by dance choreography, physical therapy, and drama. Particularly, we are focusing on Labanotation (Kinetography) as a documentation method to preserve and share kinetic-based interactions.},

We propose a novel way to control and interact with computers by moving fingers in the air. The positions of fingers are precisely captured by a computer vision device. By tracking the moving patterns of fingers, we can then recognize users' intended control commands or input information. We demonstrate this human input approach through an example application of handwriting recognition. By treating the input as a time series of 3D positions, we propose a fast algorithm using dynamic time warping to recognize characters in online fashion. We employ various optimization techniques to recognize in real time as one writes. Experiments show promising recognition performance and speed.},

Many of these videos show demonstrations of physical tasks, such as fixing a machine, assembling furniture, or demonstrating dance steps. It is often difficult for the authors of these videos to control camera focus, view, and position while performing their tasks. To help authors produce videos, we introduce Kinectograph, a recording device that automatically pans and tilts to follow specific body parts, e.g., hands, of a user in a video. It utilizes a Kinect depth sensor to track skeletal data and adjusts the camera angle via a 2D pan-tilt gimbal mount. Users control and configure Kinectograph through a tablet application with real-time video preview. An informal user study suggests that users prefer to record and share videos with Kinectograph, as it enables authors to focus on performing their demonstration tasks.},

With the rise in popularity of gestural user interfaces and computing devices that use gestures as their exclusive mode of interaction, database query interfaces require a fundamental rethinking to work without keyboards. Unlike domain-specific applications, the scope of possible actions is significantly larger if not infinite. Thus, the recognition of gestures and their consequent queries is a challenge. We present a novel gesture recognition system that uses both the interaction and the state of the database to classify gestural input into relational database queries. Preliminary results show that using this approach allows for fast, efficient and interactive gesture-based querying over relational databases.},

While speech systems can translate speech into text, they cannot yet understand the vast range of users' intentions. The use of speech is also expanding from mobile contexts to environments like the living room. Given these shifts, key design questions emerge. How do we encourage natural speech while conveying scope? How do we provide feedback of understanding? What is the role of text-to-speech in this context? This paper presents findings from studying a prototype speech system enabling users to find movies and TV shows. We show the influence of a novel approach for conveying examples, a method for seamlessly integrating text and audio feedback, and share guidance on the use of text-to-speech in the living room.},

Here, we consider the possibility of exploiting two such surfaces, one for each hand, as a means of affording efficient control over higher dimensional tasks. We investigate performance on a 6 DoF task, comparing such a two-surface multitouch input device against the results obtained using a standard 2D mouse, a single multitouch surface, and a 6 DoF free-space device. Our results indicate that two multitouch surfaces significantly improve user performance compared to the mouse and to a single surface.},

Moreover, the user can use Sinkpad as a conventional mouse pad because the pad serves as a flat surface unless the user sinks the mouse. Sinkpad allows the user to perform interesting techniques: sink, tilt, and sink+move. We also present three example applications to explore the possibilities of our techniques using the pad.},

In this paper we present our ongoing work towards highlighting parts of the interface to guide the user's gaze. In the conducted study, participants had to look at targets appearing at different screen locations. Using different cueing variants, the participants received hints of the next location.

abstract = {While multi-touch design allows natural and flexible figure gestures in interacting with mobile devices, the palm-size screen often limits its potential in application and arouses issues such as inefficient mode switch and incomplete gesture. To enrich the vocabulary of finger gestures in user interaction, we present Thumb Widgets, a mechanism that adopts thumb as assisted input channel to enhance the capabilities of multi-touch on touch-based mobile devices. Thumb Widgets expand the design space in gesture-based UIs and promote efficiency for tasks such as mode switching, parameter setting, etc. Also, Thumb Widgets enable incomplete gestures to be performed around the periphery of the device.},

abstract = {When we use a combination of personal computing devices, such as mobile phones, tablets, notebooks, and desktop PCs, we often want to transfer information from one device to another.Though a copy-and-paste function on the same computing device is easy it becomes cumbersome in a multiple computing environment, where we have to first locate and then select the target device from a list of devices on a network, even if the device is right in front of us.This paper proposes a novel direct manipulation technique for executing copy-and-paste operations between multi-touch devices. Under our interface concept, dubbed "Memory Stones," a user can "pick up" a data object displayed on one device screen, "carry" it to another device screen, and "put down" the object on that device using only his or her fingers.During this copy-and-paste operation, the user is invited to pantomime the act of carrying a tangible object (the "stone") and to keep his or her fingertip positions unchanged. The system identifies the source and target devices by matching the shape of the polygon formed by the fingertips when touching the respective screens. We have developed a prototype system for small-to-large-sized multi-touch computers including smartphones, tablets, notebooks, and desktop PCs, and have carried out a preliminary evaluation of its feasibility.},

abstract = {Nowadays control of a mobile device usually requires the use of a touch screen. In everyday life, while engaged in real world tasks, it is sometimes impossible to control a device with one's hands. Speech control is the most common solution to tackle this problem, but it is still error prone, uncomfortable and works poorly when ambient noise is present. Alternative control concepts must work in everyday surroundings with significant levels of noise and should not make use of the hands or require visual focus on the device itself. The prototype presented here is an attempt to provide a better solution to such situations: a headset that enables hands-free and eyes-free interaction for incoming phone calls as well as music player control. It enables safe control of the device in mobile situations as it neither requires the user to come to a standstill, nor does it distract his visual focus.},

In order to offer a secure and stable grip, we designed a virtual control called TouchShield, which provides place in which the thumb can pin the phone down in order to provide a stable grip. In a user study, we confirmed that this form of control does not interfere with existing touch screen operations, and the possibility that TouchShield can make more stable grip. An incidental function of TouchShield is that it provides shortcuts to frequently used commands via the thumb, a function that was also shown to be effective in the user study.},

Also by its force of restoration, the elastic screen gives users a natural passive force feedback when it is stretched, which in turn makes more intuitive interactions possible. We have applied this system to several applications including a browser for computed tomography data of human body and a graph navigation scheme based on physical user interaction forces.},

Results from a controlled experiment with 27 participants provide empirical evidence that people are able to target salient regions on their ear effectively and precisely.

In this first phase, we look at the effect sizes for different configurations of the Delboeuf illusion. The study finds that the target size is overestimated by 8% for both older and younger adults in one configuration, and 12% for older adults in another configuration.

It is not clear, though, which extreme mechanisms are most likely to trigger creativity. To investigate this, four brainstorm sessions were organized, of which three relied on extreme input stimuli: Extreme Ideas, Extreme Characters and Extreme Personas. The fourth session did not employ extreme input. Four experts assessed the output via a creative-idea-count. The preliminary results suggest that using Extreme Ideas as input for brainstorming in the early ideation phase leads to more original ideas than employing Non-Extreme Ideas.},

The participants answered the tasks by writing alphabet letters on a tablet monitor. Subjective ratings validated the increasing difficulty of the first task (Friedman ANOVA pp<p<0.05), and also indicated that the rest duration had a significant impact on the perceived difficulty of the subsequent task (p=0.048). In terms of pen features, the height of the written characters decreased significantly when the rest duration was reduced (ANOVA p<p<0.05), and the pen pressure decreased significantly as the task difficult increased (p=0.009). These encouraging results suggest the addition of a crucial time factor in the cognitive load theory, and benefits to HCI practitioners through better control of content and information pace.},

Results from 153 questionnaire, and 8 interview participants found navigation was often not pre-planned, had no clear route and changed organically as running was undertaken. From this we present the design of RunNav, a novel navigation system that uses Foursquare to provide support for the navigation practices runners employ. We illustrate its basic design, and plans for its future development and evaluation.},

Using its geo-locking feature, Picalilly allows its users to manually define geographical boundaries for sharing photos -- limiting sharing within user-defined boundaries as well as facilitating open sharing between strangers within such boundaries. To explore the potential of geo-locking, we carried out a small scale field trial of Picalilly involving two groups of students, who were part of a two-week long introduction program at a university. Our preliminary results show that Picalilly facilitated 1) sharing of 'places' and 2) localized explorations.},

In this work, we investigated two mechanisms for encouraging a more active lifestyle: a glanceable display of an individual's level of physical activity and mobile phone vibrations to interrupt extended periods of inactivity. We found that both mechanisms can help users become more aware of their activity patterns but may be ignored unless coupled with concrete advice on how to incorporate active moments into their day.},

The method is called Micro-Crowdfunding, and encourages people living in urban cities to support and contribute to the sustainability of small common resources, such as public sinks, toilets, shelves, office areas and so on. Micro-Crowdfunding is based on the crowdfunding concept and uses the local currency idea, as tools of the social mechanism, to increase people's awareness of how they participate in keeping the sustainability of common resources. Our approach aims to maintain the sustainability of common resources with people's small efforts. In this approach, an organizer introduces a new mission for keeping the sustainability of a resource, and investors fund it. Finally, a performer executes the mission, and completes it with minimal efforts achieving the resource's sustainability.},

abstract = {IAMHear is a novel tabletop interface for music performance and sound making, in which smart mobile devices are used as on-table objects for interaction. Thanks to the advanced features of smart mobile devices, IAMHear is by nature multi-modal and highly interactive.The system also allows for acoustic location mechanism using virtually inaudible sound without any special sensors, making itself simpler in structure and easier to implement. In addition, use of "everyday objects" also evokes interaction by intuitive gestures such as placement, movement, and rotation.As a music sequencer, IAMHear enables the user to make music by placing objects on table; inspired by the idea of spectrographic mapping with virtual scan line, pitch and timbre of sounds are determined by the location/orientation of tabletop objects as well as ambient noise.We present IAMHear as a simple and novel alternative to interactive tabletop interface for music and various multimedia applications as well.},

abstract = {To date, most tabletop systems are designed with only a single application visible and accessible at any time, which is, in many cases, an underuse of the tabletop spacious surface, and counter-intuitive to the normal working environment of a table. Desktop window managers provide users facilities to launch and interact with concurrent applications, as well as manage their work items. However, these managers are designed for single-user systems and cannot be directly utilized in tabletops without sacrificing usability. In our research, we want to bring window manager facilities to tabletops. We approach this by first constructing a conceptual framework based on workplace theories and tabletop investigations to understand how users structure their work in these environments (see Figure 1). We will then use the resulting framework to guide our design of a sample surface manager.},

abstract = {Interactive tables are well suited for co-located collaboration. Most prior research assumed users to share the same overall display output; a key challenge was the appropriate partitioning of screen real estate, assembling the right information 'at the users' finger-tips through simultaneous input. A different approach is followed in recent multi-view display environments: they offer personal output for each team member, yet risk to dissolve the team due to the lack of a common visual focus. Our approach combines both lines of thought, guided by the question: "What if the visible output and simultaneous input was partly shared and partly private?" We present Permulin as a concrete corresponding implementation, based on a set of novel interaction concepts that support fluid transitions between individual and group activities, coordination of group activities, and concurrent, distraction-free in-place manipulation. Study results indicate that users are able to focus on individual work on the whole surface without notable mutual interference, while at the same time establishing a strong sense of collaboration.},

In order to guarantee that the stimuli would not require the subjects' focal attention, they were asked to set the vibration intensity to just above their personal detection threshold when sitting still. At random intervals, the vibration stopped. Participants were asked to acknowledge these events as soon as they noticed. Our findings reveal that only 16.7% of events were acknowledged within one minute, and participants reported not to be annoyed by the signal in more than 95% of the events. These results provide first evidence that vibration patterns can form non-annoying, light-weight information displays, which can be consumed at the periphery of attention.},

We suggest that interaction with tangible interfaces is commonly governed primarily through visual cues, despite the emphasis on tangible representation. We do not doubt that visual feedback offers rich interaction guidance, but argue that emphasis on haptic and auditory feedback could support or substitute vision in situations of visual distraction or impairment. We have developed a series of simple TUIs that allows for the haptic and auditory exploration of visually hidden textures. Our technique is to transmit the force feedback of the texture to the user via the attraction of a ball bearing to a magnet that the user manipulates. This allows the detail of the texture to be presented to the user while visually presenting an entirely flat surface. The use of both opaque and transparent materials allows for controlling the texture visibility for comparative purposes. The resulting Feelable User Interface (FUI), shown in Fig. 1, allows for the exploration of which textures and structures are useful for haptic guidance. The findings of our haptic exploration shall provide basic understanding about the usage of haptic cues for interacting with tangible objects that are visually hidden or are in the user's visual periphery.},

abstract = {Life is full of moments that come with obvious or subtle expressions of energy. It is common for us as human beings to attach different emotions to such expressions. However, when we want to capture it and interact with them, we are often constrained to flat, 2D encapsulations of video, audio, or photographic recordings. Moreover, the way we would look back at a memory in this digital age is now often through a screen with hundreds of files digitally stored away, further removing the experience of the event's emotion. Authors question what if there was a way to experience this emotional energy again, and dynamically interact with it in infinitely complex ways. Here we present a concept and prototype that explores a novel physical-visual language of dynamic, emotionally expressive waveforms, designed to transform the way we perceive different forms of energy as we go about our daily lives. With the power of computation hidden within the physical materials used in the interface, we create an interactive form that takes one form of energy and transmute it into a waveform as its output, or Wave Alchemy.},

Our project is devoted to brainstorming different design possibilities for building interfaces for these smart objects. This paper explores one such possibility-outfitting the object with a speech interface. Study participants (N = 63) witnessed the experimenter sneezing, followed by a "Bless You" from either a nearby tissue box, a robot in the room, or a person in the room. Surprisingly, users found the speaking tissue box to be as social and agentic as a humanoid robot and a human. We also found significant moderating effects of users' preference for consistency, parasocial tendency and power usage. Participants who scored high on these traits were more likely to regard the study object as intelligent and likeable. Users also tended to show the same non-verbal reactions to the tissue box as they would to a human or a robot.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous Shortcuts is an image processing based method for making and using mnemonics set onto the real world using smartphones or other computing systems. The mnemonics can be created by taking photos of the user's vicinity and by binding them onto command sequences. The mnemonic is triggered every time a similar photo is taken. Our method uses natural feature matching algorithms and end-user programming approaches. The mnemonics can be concatenated into more complex command sequences. Thus, limited user input is realized by just taking photos with a camera embedded into a finger-ring, which enables rapid, subtle and socially acceptable user interaction. Our method can be used as semi-automatic way of achieving location and context sensitive services, activity recognition or tangible interaction.},

abstract = {Connectivity is embedded into our modern day society. Devices increasingly rely on permanent network connections, and people keep connected through social networks. Technological advances allow everyday objects to become part of large networks of interconnected entities. Connectivity within these networks allows for the design of novel interaction methods that utilise the digital input and output capabilities of connected entities. However, when specifically designing for interaction, entities become entangled and remain oblivious of each other's features. In this paper we report on the current progress in opening up the space of connectivity in order to reveal and make use of the available technological capabilities. We describe how this will open channels for new synergy and novel interaction methods. We conclude by discussing the preparation of a case study which incorporates our initial designs and proof of concepts.},

To do so, a notification system needs to determine the user's state of activity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating user states with a pressure sensor on a desk. We use a lattice-like pressure sensor sheet and distinguish between two simple user states: interruptible or not. The pressure can be measured without the user being aware of it, and changes in the pressure reflect useful information such as typing, an arm resting on the desk, mouse operation, and so on. We carefully developed features that can be extracted from the sensed raw data, and we used a machine learning technique to identify the user's interruptibility. We conducted experiments for two different tasks to evaluate the accuracy of our proposed method and obtained promising results.},

abstract = {Dialing a telephone number of an organization and coming across an automated system attending the call, instead of a human, has become common. These automated applications are known as Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems. In developing nations, IVR systems are mostly touch-tone (key-press) because of under-supported speech technologies for non-English native languages and accents. Optimizing such IVR systems is crucial as they are often considered as time consuming and frustrating and further becomes more challenging when the data for individual caller to perform optimization are often unavailable.In this work, we investigate the performances of adaptive interfaces for touch-tone IVR system to optimize for future callers based on past system usage by other callers. We show that a portion of the call duration goes into selecting the correct menu option in IVR. To reduce this, desired menu options by a prospective caller must appear early in the sequence. We show that adaptive approaches to decide the optimal menu structure for future caller outperform static menu based IVR system. We have designed, deployed and evaluated different adaptive schemes for IVR in a real world study.},

Instead, users are asked to consequently tap the appropriate number of fingers on a multi-touch screen. As it is shown, authentication with a chord interaction technique is simple and has some advantages that make it more appropriate for a number of applications. Early observations show that the presented technique protects the users more effectively from "shoulder surfing" compared to the traditional PIN entry, due to its integral characteristics of reducing visibility by hiding fingers and subdividing action.},

abstract = {We present a new method for displaying visualization parameters to guide casual data exploration. When visualizing datasets with large parameter spaces it can be difficult to move between data views. Building on social navigation and degree-of-interest visualization, we propose the concept of accentuation as the selection and emphasis of visualization parameters based on social and semantic signals. We describe how we designed an accentuated visualization interface, and discuss open challenges and directions for future research.},

New applications and services for smartphones, tablets, game consoles connected to TVs, and other embedded appliances are constantly appearing and diversifying the way we interact with technology. Thus when we design visualization and interaction strategies for the emerging lifelogging activity, it is important to consider affordances and contexts for these emerging interactive devices: by the time the lifelogging activity becomes truly ubiquitous, we will be interacting with even more diverse set of devices to support the activity. In this paper, we describe an early stage of our on-going project where we sketched a series of interactive visualization and their corresponding usage scenarios for three different interactive platforms: (1) smartphone, (2) tablet, and (3) desktop. Our sketch was rendered on these corresponding devices in such a way as to maximize the special interaction characteristics of each device and provides three very different lifelog data usage scenarios.},

For guiding the user through visualization tasks, these semi-automatic systems need to store and use knowledge of this interdisciplinary domain. Unfortunately, visualisation knowledge stored in one system cannot easily be reused in another due to a lack of shared formal models. In order to approach this problem, we introduce a visualization ontology (VISO) that formally models visualization-specific concepts and facts. Furthermore, we give first examples of the ontology's use within two systems and highlight how the community can get involved in extending and improving it.},

Our approach is grounded on a two-fold notion: (1) live thumbnails should be more informative than their static counterparts, and (2) live thumbnails can help the user disambiguate among perceptually similar pages. We evaluate a proof-of-concept prototype with 13 users. Preliminary results show that our approach has an interesting potential to enhance web page revisitation in a visually compelling way.},

To address this issue, we first perform a simple content analysis on app reviews from the developer's standpoint.

Currently our classifier can predict with roughly 68% accuracy, whether a project will be successful or not.

However, users increasingly search the Web on touch-enabled devices such as smart phones and tablets, where they zoom and swipe instead of mousing and scrolling. In this paper, we present, to our knowledge, the first study of the utility of touch interactions on a mobile devices for estimating Web search result relevance -- which can in turn be used for search result ranking and evaluation. In particular, we explore a variety of touch interaction signals as implicit relevance feedback, based on a user study of 26 users and hundreds of unique Web search queries, result clicks, and page examinations. Our experimental results show that touch interactions provide more effective implicit feedback compared to only the time spent visiting a document, resulting in substantially higher correlation of the estimated document relevance with the explicit relevance judgments.},

abstract = {Understanding the specificity of Web search queries can help search systems better address the underlying needs of searchers and provide them relevant content. The goal of this work is to automatically determine the specificity of web search queries. Although many factors may impact the specificity of Web search queries, we investigate two factors of specificity in this research, (1) part of speech and (2) query length. We use content analysis and prior research to develop a list of nine attributes to identify query specificity. The attributes are whether a query contains a URL, a location or place name along with additional terms, compares multiple things, contains multiple distinct ideas or topics, a question that has a clear answer, request for directions, instructions or tips, a specific date and additional terms or a name and additional terms. We then apply these attributes to classify 5,115 unique queries as narrow or general. We then analyze the differences between narrow and general queries based on part of speech and query length. Our results indicate that query length and parts-of-speech usage, by themselves, can distinguish narrow and general queries. We discuss the implications of this work for search engines, marketers and users.},

This will improve the consumer's online searching experience and potential interest in ads with branding focus. Increased personalization of search engine results and enhancement of users' interest in branded ads will also increase the revenue and profit of the advertisers. Our data consists of 7 million daily records from a keyword advertising campaign from a major US retailer. We segregate the key-phrases into six different categories. The gender orientation of terms has male, female and neutral categories each with two groups: - branded and unbranded phrases. Using one way Analysis of Variance, we analyze the effect of gender orientation of both branded and unbranded key-phrases on number of users' clicks on the queries submitted to web search engine. The result shows that the means of users' clicks significantly vary among the categories. Moreover the result shows that the group formed by combination of female gender with branded terms generates maximum number of clicks among all six categories. Females may be more attracted to the use of branded terms due to the positive attitude and customer loyalty generated by brand image.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of introducing search results overview in the form of a tag cloud displayed next to a textual search result list. Does such an overview make users faster in search task execution and lower the cognitive effort required to make progress? We use cognitive effort measures derived from eye tracking data to examine the effect of providing a tag cloud-like summary on a user's information search and navigation behaviors. The results show that a results overview helps a user become faster and more efficient. One contribution of this work is to describe the use of eye tracking data to create a simple model of reading and measures of cognitive effort. Another is to use those measures to explain the differences in interaction with two information search interfaces},

abstract = {Banner blindness, the phenomenon that the user will consciously or unconsciously ignore online banners while navigating a certain website, is a big problem for marketers and has been studied in the past. We present a study that tests the hypothesis whether the user's memory (free recall and recognition) is influenced by the user's goal orientation during navigation on a website and whether it is mediated by the correspondence of the banner content and website content (congruence). Participants in an explorative orientation show better memory for banners than users in a broad or narrow goal orientation. No differences between the congruent and incongruent conditions with regard to recall measures were found but the congruent condition yields slightly better recognition rates. Based on these findings further implications and research possibilities are discussed.},

As such, mechanisms to evaluate the web content credibility are needed. In this paper, we describe CredibleWeb, a prototype crowdsourcing platform for web content evaluation with a two-fold goal: (1) to build a social enhanced and large scale dataset of credibility labeled web pages that enables the evaluation of different strategies for web credibility prediction, and (2) to investigate how various design elements are useful in engaging users to actively evaluate web pages credibility. We outline the challenges related with the design of a crowdsourcing platform for web credibility evaluation and describe our initial efforts.},

abstract = {A common goal for user interface designers is to design efficient UIs that facilitate high levels of performance. In point-and-click interfaces, spatial memory has been shown to play an important role in reaching this level of performance, since it allows users to make quick decisions about item locations rather than resorting to slow visual search. However, spatial memory is rarely exploited by modern applications. Hierarchical menus force users through laborious action sequences to access commands, while window content is frequently elided and reshuffled in response to changing window geometries.In order to inform the design of UIs that better support spatial memory, we are studying the human and interface factors that affect the growth and resilience of spatial knowledge, and producing a series of exemplar interfaces that exploit users' spatial memory to rapidly achieve high levels of performance. A new command selection technique called CommandMaps demonstrates that when users have spatial memory of an interface, target acquisition can be vastly improved by removing control hierarchies. StencilMaps builds on the CommandMap technique, highlighting salient commands to accelerate novice visual search. Our ongoing research investigates the robustness of spatial memory and the role of 'effortful' learning in the development of spatial automaticity.},

abstract = {Evaluation has been a dominant theme in HCI for decades, but it is far from being a solved problem. As interactive systems and their uses change, the nature of evaluation must change as well. In this paper, we outline the challenges our community needs to address to develop adequate methods for evaluating systems in modern (and future) use contexts. We begin by tracing how evaluation efforts have been shaped by a continuous adaptation to technological and cultural changes and conclude by discussing important research directions that will shape evaluation's future.},

This question understands computation as a potential property of matter in a non-reductive way that plausibly spans formal divides between symbolic-semiotic, social, and physical processes. Full investigation greatly exceeds one brief paper. But we open this question in the concrete practices of computational sound and sound design.},

The accurate manipulation of UAVs is difficult as their control typically involves hand-operated devices. We can incorporate the UAV control using human motions such as walking, looking around and crouching. The system synchronizes the operator and UAV positions in terms of the horizontal and vertical positions and the yaw orientation. The operator can use the UAV more intuitively as such manipulations are more in accord with kinesthetic. Finally, we discuss flying telepresence applications.},

Three categories of target words were presented: hedonic, utilitarian and "geek" words. Longer response times were interpreted as stronger associations. Need-for-cognition and subject of undergraduate study (computer science vs. psychology) were taken as predictors for a hypothetical geek personality. The results suggest that persons with a geek predisposition tend to think of computers as objects of intellectual challenge and play, rather than tools or extensions of the self. },

We achieve this through novel techniques of adaptation and estimation of gesture characteristics. We describe two experiments. The first aims at understanding whether users can control certain gestural characteristics and if that control depends on gesture vocabulary. The second study uses a machine learning technique based on particle filtering to simultaneously recognize and measure variation in a gesture. With this technology, we create a gestural interface for a playful photo processing application. From these two studies, we show that 1) multiple characteristics can be varied independently in slower gestures (Study 1), and 2) users find gesture-only interaction less pragmatic but more stimulating than traditional menu-based systems (Study 2).},

abstract = {The number of studies in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) with animals has increased in recent years. When planning and carrying out the studies with animals, it is important and necessary to take into account the welfare of the animals as well as deal with the short- and long-term effects of the developed technology and related interventions on animal welfare. This paper addresses the ethical issues, presents the key concepts and provides guidelines for carrying out studies with animals based on a literature review. The guidelines cover the phases from planning of the studies, to carrying out and reporting the studies.},

We present one approach to anonymization of research results with search engines in mind, which we call un-Googling, that we have developed to minimize risk to our participants. We discuss the considerations that this approach raises and pose a challenge to the HCI community to take up this discussion not only as an ethical consideration but also as a socio-technical research and design opportunity.},

Human-scale farming depends on the labor of people to get things done, relying on hand tools and particular kinesthetic actions to change the earth in a plot.Digital media technologies afford the creation of tools that can materialize rhetoric, creating alternate functionality emphasizing issues of practice through use. Creating gardening implements that build on the repetitive physical nature of gardening work allows handwork to become something broader: representative of, more reflexive and meditative technological practice. },

I make the case that, far from being a niche research area, ACI is directly relevant to and even encompasses HCI. Thus ACI research firmly belongs at CHI.},

abstract = {This paper explores the metaphor of animism as a methodological framework for interaction design and, in particular, advocates for a form of animism the authors term 'heterogeneous multiplicity.' Animism can make valuable contributions within ubiquitous computing contexts, where objects with designed behaviors tend to evoke a perception that they have autonomy, intention, personality and an inner life. Furthermore, animism that supports heterogeneous multiplicity offers unique opportunities to stimulate human creativity through embodied engagement with an ecology of things. To demonstrate the concept of heterogeneous multiplicity, the authors present a speculative design project, AniThings, that intertwines multiple animistic collaborators to position activities of digital resource discovery and curation beyond the narrow domain of recommendation engines and personal feeds. The project illustrates an ecology of six tangible, interactive objects that, respectively, draw from a variety of digital resources and inhabit a range of variously positioned stances towards their human collaborators and each other. This diversity of behaviors, resources, and positionality makes AniThings ideal for supporting open-ended ideation and collaborative imagining activities.},

If users keep such an unhealthy posture for a long time, their neck and back muscles get chronically strained, which might cause diseases such as cervical myalgia. To prevent these diseases, we propose a new methodology to monitor the posture of smartphone users with built-in sensors. The proposed mechanism estimates a value representing user postures like head/neck tilt angle by analyzing sensor data from a front-faced camera, 3-axis accelerometer, and orientation sensor. It then informs the user if the estimated value is maintained within the abnormal range over a pre-defined time.},

The present paper questions this emphasis by analyzing data from five studies that systematically tracked both basic and non-basic emotions. The results indicate that engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration (all non-basic emotions) occurred at five times the rate of basic emotions after generalizing across tasks, interfaces, and methodologies.

abstract = {Pipeline is a new development process at Adobe designed to rapidly prototype and evaluate new product offerings. Pipeline has user research at its core, and success is defined by how much is learned about a given problem, not by how much product is built. Starting ideas for new product directions are identified through Contextual Inquiry. Once a product direction is selected, an iterative process of development and evaluation is carried out over a 13-week period. Opportunities to pivot are built in at 3-week intervals, driven by evaluation results from laboratory studies. The Pipeline process is explained through an example product prototype, called "Gadget". Gadget is an application targeted at Web developers that helps them more easily experiment with and modify the visual layout of a Web page.},

abstract = {Patient adherence is an important factor in improving health outcomes. However, as one of the causes of increasing population with chronic diseases, low adherence has become a major health care issue globally. Often, due to deferred benefits of treatment or lifestyle recommendations, many fail to adhere to their treatment regimen or health plans given by care providers until their conditions deteriorate. As poor adherence remains a significant yet inadequately addressed problem of severe health issues, it is critical to create effective interventions as part of the solutions.Previous studies have suggested that peer supports be effective to improve adherence, and social cognitive theories have indicated that personal realization and confidence enhanced through entertaining gaming elements could encourage behavior change. To understand how different motivation factors affect user experience through social networking, a health care adherence website with built-in behavior analyses was constructed to conduct experiments. Users' health adherence levels can be reported to the website and shared among consenting social members for discussion or competition. Key design and development components are illustrated through the case study, including a social gaming and learning portal, an engineering approach to supporting different application scenarios, and information interventions based on predefined rules to achieve effective adherence. The preliminary analysis showed that people using social media for health care adherence may be motivated differently and act strategically during their social interactions. },

abstract = {In 2002, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, during observations of space operations teams preparing for the 2003 Mars Exploration Rover Missions, the User Centered Technology Group from NASA Ames Research Center observed users coping with software interoperability issues. The packaging of software in multiple applications, each with its own pre-determined set of compartmentalized functions, forced users into the role of software integrators.In 2008 the Mission Control Technologies (MCT) project sought to address these issues by replacing multiple NASA Mission Control applications with composable user-objects. The primary stakeholders were NASA flight controllers and mission operations management.The feature that sold mission management on the project was that user objects modeled their real world counterparts. Once a user object was created, say for Space Station telemetry, that object could be reused. This meant that the association between a user object and it's data needed to happen once, as opposed to previous software systems, which required data to be associated with on screen displays each time a new display was built.While we sought to design and develop a new system, it was important to realize that the existing software was working, that users were familiar with that software from years of use, and the introduction of change was potentially disruptive to users.At the request of our customer, the initial MCT user objects would be for telemetry and monitoring of the Space Station. To design the software, we used participatory design (PD), in which the users are the domain experts and the designers facilitate the sessions. In addition to creating the artifacts that the team needed to build design specifications, the PD sessions forged bonds between the teams. For the users, the PD sessions were often the first time that they created explicit representations of their work.The team used agile development methods. Deliveries to the customer were made every three weeks, with a release every twelve weeks. A nightly build was available for download. A strategic road map guided priorities for design and development.The agile development cycle resulted in a multi-front set of engagements for the user experience team. The nightly build allowed the customer to provide daily feedback on features. The strategic road map guided priorities for the PD sessions. PD sessions typically lasted for several days and were planned. Daily feedback from nightly builds was often spontaneous.While participatory design was the core enabler for the developers and the customers to come together to create designs for which all felt a sense of ownership, agile development was the enabler that pushed the design specs into the world of real code and a working product. The constant availability of our product made our progress visible to all. This pushed everyone on the team to constantly improve it.},

abstract = {The operational challenges faced by law enforcement and public safety personnel are constantly evolving, while the training and certification process has stayed the same. New technologies such as virtual reality, mixed reality, or game-based simulators are being researched as promising enhancements to traditional training methods. However, their widespread adoption, particularly by smaller units, faces barriers such as cost - due in no small part to the difficulties of developing and especially evaluating such large-scale interactive systems. In this case study, we present MINT - a low-cost mixed-reality Multimodal INteractive Training system, aimed at supporting the training of small- and medium-sized law enforcement and infantry units. We discuss the challenges and approaches taken in the participatory design of the training system, its agile-based development and implementation, and its qualitative evaluation with users and subject-matter experts.},

abstract = {Navigation and assembly are critical tasks for Soldiers in battlefield situations. Paratroopers, in particular, must be able to parachute into a battlefield and locate and assemble their equipment as quickly and quietly as possible. Current assembly methods rely on bulky and antiquated equipment that inhibit the speed and effectiveness of such operations. To address this we have created a multi-modal mobile navigation system that uses ruggedized to mark assembly points and smartphones to assist in navigating to these points while minimizing cognitive load and maximizing situational awareness. To achieve this task, we implemented a novel beacon receiver protocol that allows an infinite number of receivers to listen to the encrypted beaconing message using only ad-hoc Wi-Fi technologies. The system was evaluated by U.S. Army Paratroopers and proved quick to learn and efficient at moving Soldiers to navigation waypoints. Beyond military operations, this system could be applied to any task that requires the assembly and coordination of many individuals or teams, such as emergency evacuations, fighting wildfires or locating airdropped humanitarian aid.},

In addition to strengthening women's progress, many interviewees also identified a diversity chasm within the HCI field that needs to be addressed. This panel aims at continuing and deepening the conversation that was started at CHI 2011 addressing the experience of women in the HCI field in both industry and academia and extending the conversation to include diversity. It will serve as a platform to discuss important issues such as mentoring, leadership, and career development and for creating networks for including and encouraging diversity in HCI.},

In particular we want to go a step further and strengthen the interdisciplinary dialogue on the relationship between theory and practice when talking about user experience. We invited panelists from academia and industry to join a fruitful dialogue talking about the different perspectives on user experience, theoretical roots, and the relevance of theory for practice and vice versa.

abstract = {Speech and natural language remain our most natural form of interaction; yet the HCI community have been very timid about focusing their attention on designing and developing spoken language interaction techniques. This may be due to a widespread perception that perfect domain-independent speech recognition is an unattainable goal. Progress is continuously being made in the engineering and science of speech and natural language processing, however, and there is also recent research that suggests that many applications of speech require far less than 100% accuracy to be useful in many contexts. Engaging the CHI community now is timely -- many recent commercial applications, especially in the mobile space, are already tapping the increased interest in and need for natural user interfaces (NUIs) by enabling speech interaction in their products. As such, the goal of this panel is to bring together interaction designers, usability researchers, and general HCI practitioners to discuss the opportunities and directions to take in designing more natural interactions based on spoken language, and to look at how we can leverage recent advances in speech processing in order to gain widespread acceptance of speech and natural language interaction.},

abstract = {Games and Entertainment has become an important area for researchers in Human-Computer Interaction. The community has grown dramatically in the past three years. During CHI 2012 a two-day workshop on Games User Research was held, and a growing number of game-oriented submissions shows the increasing importance of the field. In 2013 the successful Student Games Competition will continue and we plan to program engaging game experiences during CHI 2013. The games and entertainment community is the only community that got the agreement of the Conference Management Committee of SIGCHI to extend existence beyond the initial three years. The Games and Entertainment Community is thus extended for the years 2014 and following. It is of immense importance for the community to have the possibility to discuss new perspectives for the Games and Entertainment Community in a SIG.},

To enable native speakers to understand SL learners' questions, Xpress allows SL learners to compose "context-embedded" questions with the help of multimedia. In addition, Xpress allows SL learners to explore expressions broadly and search for topic-specific expressions. Finally, Xpress provides several facilities to help effective learning of expressions. The results of our study confirm the above design idea and show Xpress' potential to help SL learners effectively learn colloquial expressions.},

News articles have the potential to reach a wider audience and tell more effective stories if presented in a visual, succinct, and engaging manner. Comics are a medium that can become an alternative to news articles, because their storyboard format has the ability to both inform and excite readers. We propose Comic Circuit, a website where users can create and consume news comics that are based on news articles. Low and medium fidelity prototypes of the system were designed after interviewing expert cartoonists and creating personas of potential users. We used our mid-fi mockups to conduct user testing with young adults, and did additional quality assurance of our design with a quantitative study. We present a high-fidelity prototype of Comic Circuit based on this testing and research. The community of users can benefit from this system by consuming news quickly, gaining recognition for their comic creation work, and expanding their skill set.},

It is ever present, but at times hidden and even justified by the very person who suffers the attacks. Very often society silences or condemns those who dare denounce it. AME-C is a system that connects women in the state of Oaxaca, M\'{e}xico to change their perspective about violence so they can transform their lives. It tries to give them assistance to help recuperate their lost confidence and make them realize they are not alone. It bonds and motivates communication and collaboration between women, specialists and institutions, generating updated knowledge and understanding which in turn enables institutions to study intimate-partner violence.},

In its second iteration, it adds intelligent components to explore the tradeoffs between manual and automatic, and to examine how they can work hand in hand. A "flexible" approach informs the design. Two sub-strategies, versatility and robustness, are introduced and discussed here. The system is described and implications for designing for the unknown are briefly addressed.},

This suggests an opportunity to modify well-known, existing arcade games for the purpose of memorization and learning. A key challenge to modifying any existing arcade-style game is the incorporation of learning on top of an already fast-paced, mentally demanding game. This paper presents a web-based vocabulary-drill game, based on Tetris and augmented with speech recognition (Figure 1). To help adult learners acquire new vocabulary, we embed an in-game mechanism that presents vocabulary items to be learned via word-picture associations. Using our working speech recognition prototype, we investigate the extent to which retrieval practice, an educationally effective but cognitively demanding strategy, impacts learning and engagement in this fast-paced game environment.},

The current paper develops previous work in this area by using cognitive factors as a method to further analyse user experience. In an experiment, a comparison was drawn between older and younger adults examining Internet experience and multiple cognitive abilities. Overall, the results show that cognitive factors can be used to account for a substantial amount of disorientation felt by users and that these factors can be used to improve the understanding of reasons surrounding web usability. It is also shown that previous Internet experience and confidence differentially effect older and younger adults' feelings of disorientation, with increased confidence resulting in higher disorientation in younger adults but not older adults.},

abstract = {In the past few years, technologies designed to mediate intimacy have been growing, especially devices that support intimate acts and connectivity between geographically separated couples. However, romantic intimacy has several components, and the majority of couples are co-located, suggesting a design space to be explored. The current study aims to investigate how local intimate couples collaborate with each other to accomplish collective tasks in their daily life, and how couple collaboration may differ from teamwork within the workplace. The research process and findings will be discussed, and design implications for intimate technology will be provided. These insights could be used to explore novel design opportunities to mediate cognitive intimacy and mutuality within a couple.},

We conducted an observation and recorded user foot orientation and position in a public information display environment leading to data about 84 interaction sessions. Our observations show that characteristic foot patterns can be matched with two user intentions: (A) Users who seek access to specific information, and (B) users who don't seek specific information. With the goal to detect intention through foot patterns, we classified characteristic foot patterns with a SVM pattern recognition algorithm, which resulted in a detection accuracy of 84.4%. This work can be valuable for researchers designing context-aware public displays.},

We introduce a crowd-powered conversational interface, called Chorus, that allows users to interact with a group of crowd workers as if they are a single conversional partner. We use Chorus as a personal assistant, and show that our incentive mechanism enables workers to hold consistent conversations and answer 84% of questions accurately. We then discuss a number of potential improvements that can be made by integrating artificial intelligence, and future systems that our work enables.},

Theseus uses program traces to provide real-time in-editor feedback so that programmers can answer questions quickly as they write new code and interact with their application.

Multiverse encapsulates existing applications into cloneable virtual machines (VMs) that crowd workers control remotely. Because task state is captured in the VM, multiple workers can operate simultaneously on separate instances. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by implementing three existing crowd algorithms: (i) branch-and-vote, (ii) find-fix-verify, and (iii) partition-map-reduce. To implement these we introduce new crowd programming patterns: crowd merge and crowd annotate.},

We present iGrasp, which automatically adapts the layout and position of virtual keyboards based on how and where users are grasping the devices without requiring explicit user input. Our prototype uses 46 capacitive sensors positioned along the sides of an iPad to sense users' grasps, and supports two types of grasp-based automatic adaptation: layout switching and continuous positioning. Our two 18-user studies show that participants were able to begin typing 42% earlier using iGrasp's adaptive keyboard compared to the manually adjustable keyboard.},

Although examples exist in the non-digital games domain to support this point (e.g. Twister), we've found that there has been little exploration conducted on social awkwardness when it comes to digital play. In response, we present Musical Embrace, a digital game that calls for strangers to collaboratively apply pressure, in the form of awkward whole-body movements in close physical proximity, to a novel suspended pillow-like controller; as means of traversing a virtual environment. We use Musical Embrace to identify design tactics that utilize social awkwardness, to drive digital play. With our work, we hope to encourage designers to consider socially awkward interactions as a compelling ingredient for digital games.},

abstract = {Colours are an important part of user experiences on the Web. Colour schemes influence not only the aesthetics, but also our first impressions and long-term engagement with websites (e.g., Figure 1 shows a 'warm' website colour scheme). However, five percent of people perceive a subset of all colours because they have colour vision deficiency (CVD), resulting in an unequal and presumably less-rich user experience on the Web (Figure 2). Traditionally, people with CVD have been supported by recolouring tools that improve colour differentiability, but do not consider the subjective properties of colour schemes while recolouring (Figure 3 shows Figure 1 after standard recolouring; it is now 'cool' instead of 'warm'). To address this, we developed SPRWeb, a tool that recolours websites to preserve subjective responses and improve colour differentiability - thus enabling users with CVD to have similar online experiences (Figure 4 shows Figure 1 recoloured using SPRWeb; it is once again 'warm'). To develop SPRWeb, we extended existing models of non-CVD subjective responses to people with CVD, then used this extended model to steer the recolouring process. In a lab study, we found that SPRWeb did significantly better than a standard recolouring tool at preserving the temperature and naturalness of websites, while achieving similar weight and differentiability preservation. We also found that recolouring did not preserve activity, and hypothesize that visual complexity influences activity more than colour. SPRWeb is the first tool to automatically preserve the subjective and perceptual properties of website colour schemes thereby equalizing the colour-based web experience for people with CVD.},

Inspired by phenomenology, pragmatism and embodied cognition, we explore how we can use embodiment and skilful coping to connect people and to catalyse a constructive design "conversation" among people with different backgrounds (Hummels, 2012). During a two-weeks workshop with Master students at the Dept. of Industrial Design at the Eindhoven University of Technology, we developed six different interactive Engagement Probes: open, creative and playful tools aimed at engaging people in a design process more concrete and effective than a brainstorm session. These Engagement Probes have been validated in a five-hour workshop Hephaestus and the Senses, in which 80 participants from different background have used them as a mean to ignite their design process. Every team started to meet and getting to know each other in a playful way using their bodies through one of the Engagement Probes. Thereupon, they designed and prototyped in teams of 4-6 persons, an artefact for citizens to socially connect through their senses. The results of the workshop show that the Probes stimulate engagement, help people to get familiar and connect in a short period of time, and inspire and boost a design process with an emphasis on embodiment and tangibility (Trotto and Hummels, submitted).},

abstract = {Computing technologies continue to grow exponentially every day. However, appliances have become a class of technology that has remained stagnant through time. They are restricted by physical and cost limitations, while also aiming to provide with a lot of functionality. This leads to limited capabilities of input (through multiple buttons and combinations) and output (LEDs, small screens). We introduce the notion of mobile proxemic awareness and control, whereby a mobile device is used as a medium to reveal of information regarding awareness of presence, state, content and control as a function of proxemics. We explore a set of concepts that exploit different proximal distances and levels of information and controls. We illustrate the concepts with two deliberately simple prototypes: a lamp and a radio alarm clock.},

Second, users could soon adapt to the TapBoard and learn to rest their fingers in a touched state. Finally, we confirm by a controlled experiment that there is no difference in the text entry performance between the TapBoard and a traditional touch screen software keyboard. In addition to these experimental results, we demonstrate a few new interaction techniques that will be made possible by the TapBoard.},

When a thin magnetic sensor grid is attached to the back of the display, the 3D position and partial 3D orientation of the GaussBits can be resolved by the proposed bi-polar magnetic field tracking technique. This portable platform can therefore enrich tangible interactions by extending the design space to the near-surface space. Since non-ferrous materials, such as the user's hand, do not occlude the magnetic field, interaction designers can freely incorporate a magnetic unit into an appropriately shaped non-ferrous object to exploit the metaphors of the real-world tasks, and users can freely manipulate the GaussBits by hands or using other non-ferrous tools without causing interference. The presented example applications and the collected feedback from an explorative workshop revealed that this new approach is widely applicable.},

If players had perfect knowledge of their heart rate, they could easily defend themselves. However, since a player has no direct feedback from the sensors, their defence is weakened by their imperfect knowledge. Rather than trying to reduce the disparity between a player's physical state and their awareness of that state, we use our game as a platform to study ways to harness this disparity to create novel gameplay.},

abstract = {We present LaserOrigami, a rapid prototyping system that produces 3D objects using a laser cutter. LaserOrigami is substantially faster than traditional 3D fabrication techniques such as 3D printing and unlike traditional laser cutting the resulting 3D objects require no manual assembly. The key idea behind LaserOrigami is that it achieves three-dimensionality by folding and stretching the workpiece, rather than by placing joints, thereby eliminating the need for manual assembly. LaserOrigami achieves this by heating up selected regions of the workpiece until they become compliant and bend down under the force of gravity. LaserOrigami administers the heat by defocusing the laser, which distributes the laser's power across a larger surface. LaserOrigami implements cutting and bending in a single integrated process by automatically moving the cutting table up and down-when users take out the workpiece, it is already fully assembled. We present the three main design elements of LaserOrigami: the bend, the suspender, and the stretch, and demonstrate how to use them to fabricate a range of physical objects. Finally, we demonstrate an interactive fabrication version of LaserOrigami, a process in which user interaction and fabrication alternate step-by-step.},

The system consists of modular ceiling tiles for down-lighting and colored wall-washing for atmospheric lighting. The LightPad allows people to quickly adjust all light sources with an expressive touch; duration and force determine respectively the light color and intensity. This could be used near the entrance of a space to quickly set the lighting. The LightCube allows users to choose between various presets that are related to different activities. The top-facing preset is activated. The LightApp is a tablet interface that allows users to control many light sources in detail using simple gestures: dragging, pinching, rotating and wiping. This could be used to create specific atmospheres, or to create presets for the LightCube.},

Intentacles can respond to external stimuli such as music, light levels, or temperature, and/or to the wearer's physiological responses, such as pulse and movement. Preliminary user studies found that antennae actions which mirror stereotypical hand and eyebrow gestures are easily understood by other people. It helps if the actions are executed well, and if the antennae move intermittently, rather than continuously. After a while, people stop paying direct attention to the antennae per se, but they continue to notice changes, and to engage with the emotional expression. Further work will study the antennae in different social interactions.},

abstract = {Interactive technology can support exertion activities, with many examples focusing on improving athletic performance. We see an opportunity for technology to also support extreme sports such as skateboarding, which often focus primarily on the experience of doing tricks rather than on athletic performance. However, there is little knowledge on how to design for such experiences. In response, we designed 12 basic skateboarding prototypes inspired by skateboarding theory. Using an autoethnographical approach, we skated with each of these and reflected on our experiences in order to derive four design themes: location of feedback in relation to the skater's body, timing of feedback in relation to peaks in emotions after attempts, aspects of the trick emphasized by feedback, and aesthetic fittingness of feedback. As an exemplification and elaboration of this work we designed an interactive skateboarding system called Copy Paste Skate, using the 4 themes as a guide. We hope our work will inspire and guide designers and practitioners in the field of interactive systems for skateboarding and trick-focused sports in general, and will further our understanding of how to design for the active human body.},

abstract = {In this video we show TouchViz, a software system for visualizing multivariate data that harnesses the physical, embodied nature of tablet computers and physical models such as gravity and force to allow users to explore data along many dimensions at once. Data are represented as actual physical objects that can be manipulated through user touches, tilts, and finger gestures. TouchViz provides an open sandbox for user interaction, supplying an array of force-based tools for structuring and manipulating data made physical. These tools promote curiosity, play, and exploration, leading users to trends and actionable findings encoded in data. By closely mimicking real-world force, gravity, and momentum, TouchViz allows users to explore many dimensions at once through multitouch interactions.},

abstract = {We explore how to track people and furniture based on a high-resolution pressure-sensitive floor. Gravity pushes people and objects against the floor, causing them to leave imprints of pressure distributions across the surface. While the sensor is limited to sensing direct contact with the surface, we can sometimes conclude what takes place above the surface, such as users' poses or collisions with virtual objects. We demonstrate how to extend the range of this approach by sensing through passive furniture that propagates pressure to the floor. To explore our approach, we have created an 8 m2 back-projected floor prototype, termed GravitySpace, a set of passive touch-sensitive furniture, as well as algorithms for identifying users, furniture, and poses. Pressure-based sensing on the floor offers four potential benefits over camera-based solutions: (1) it provides consistent coverage of rooms wall-to-wall, (2) is less susceptible to occlusion between users, (3) allows for the use of simpler recognition algorithms, and (4) intrudes less on users' privacy.},

Using a Kinect camera and a projector, Flexpad transforms virtually any sheet of paper or foam into a flexible, highly deformable and spatially aware handheld display. It uses a novel approach for tracking deformed surfaces from depth images very robustly, in high detail and in real time. As a result, the display is considerably more deformable than previous work on flexible handheld displays, enabling novel applications that leverage the high expressiveness of detailed deformation. We illustrate these unique capabilities through three application examples: curved cross-cuts in volumetric images, deforming virtual paper characters, and slicing through time in videos.},

Using this system, touch-based interactivity can, without prior calibration, be placed on nearly any unmodified surface literally with a wave of the hand, as can other new forms of sensed interaction. From a user perspective, such interfaces are easy enough to instantiate that they could, if desired, be recreated or modified "each time we sat down" by "painting" them next to us. From the programmer's perspective, our system encapsulates these capabilities in a simple set of abstractions that make the creation of interfaces quick and easy. Further, it is extensible to new, custom interactors in a way that closely mimics conventional 2D graphical user interfaces, hiding much of the complexity of working in this new domain. We detail the hardware and software implementation of our system, and several example applications built using the library.},

By snapping them together, the player can build a modular system that functions according to he individual functionalities of the cuboino cubes.Cuboino establishes a new pathway that is not embodied in the marble, but adapts to the medium of its transmission. Signals can be received by multiple modules, creating more than one signal at a time. This allows signals to intertwine and thus create more dynamic and complex game outcomes.},

The viewer may then browse through the work's multiple states and closely examine its painted surface in one of two ways: sliding or rubbing. Our current prototype recognises realist painter Nathan Walsh's most recent work, "Transamerica". Repentir enables the viewer to explore intermediary stages in the painting's development and see what is usually lost within the materially additive painting process.

The installation uses motion-capture data of people describing personal experiences of pain. Their original gestural movements are extracted and translated into mechanical gesticulations that stretch and trace forms onto the surface of a canvas; mapping the twists, turns, contractions and accelerations of fingers and hands articulating an experience of pain. We manipulate the parameters of the original motions to ask in what ways can a disembodied translation of a human description of pain evoke recognition or empathy in the viewer?},

The 3D relief estimated from the images, and the dynamic changes applied to it by the user(s), are used to control two applications: For 3D scene authoring, the relief is directly translated into a terrain, allowing fast and intuitive map editing. For expressive audio-graphic music performance, both the relief and real-time changes are interpreted as activation profiles to drive corpus-based concatenative sound synthesis, allowing one or more musicians to mold sonic landscapes and to plow through them in an inherently collaborative, expressive, and dynamic experience.},

abstract = {The Metaphone is an interactive art piece that transforms biosensor data extracted from participants into colorful, evocative perceivable visual patterns on a big canvas. The biosensors register movement, pulse and skin conductance, the latter two relating to emotional arousal. The machine creates a traditional art form colorful paintings which can be contrasted with the pulsating, living body of the participants and the machine-like movements of the Metaphone. Participants interacting with the machine get their own painting drawn for them a highly involving activity spurring a whole range of questions around bio-sensing technologies. The participants engaging with Metaphone have to agree to share their personal data, thereby expanding the interactive discourse while questioning the extension of the body with the machine and involving participants with public exposition of their inner worlds.},

abstract = {Practitioner-led artistic research, combined with interactive technologies, opens up new and unexplored design spaces. Here we focus on the creation of a tool for opera-singers to dynamically disform, change and accompany their voices. In an opera composed by one of the authors, the title-role singer needed to be able to alter his voice to express hawking, coughing, snuffling and other disturbing vocal qualities associated with the lead role Joseph Merrick, aka "The Elephant Man". In our designerly exploration, we were guided by artistic experiences from the opera tradition and affordances of the technology at hand. The resulting instrument, The Throat III, is a singer-operated artefact that embodies and extends particular notions of operatic singing techniques while at the same time creating accompaniment. It therefore becomes an emancipatory tool, putting a spotlight on some of the power hierarchies between singers, composers, conductors, and stage directors in the operatic world.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a novel idea of crafting a physical object in tandem with the physical exercise using the heart rate patterns. Our aim is provide a new way of visualizing the exercise intensity. We present Sweat-Atoms, a 3D modeling and printing system, which generates abstract 3D designs using the heart rate patterns of individuals engaged in a physical activity. The crafted physical objects can act as souvenirs and be testimony to the human efforts invested in performing the physical activity. We believe the creative experience of crafting will help to change the monotonous nature of physical exercise.},

abstract = {Although it is desirable for wheelchair users to go out alone by operating wheelchairs on their own, they are often accompanied by caregivers or companions. In designing robotic wheelchairs, therefore, it is important to consider not only how to assist the wheelchair user but also how to reduce companions' load and support their activities. We specially focus on the communications among wheelchair users and companions because the face-to-face communication is known to be effective to ameliorate elderly mental health. Hence, we proposed a robotic wheelchair able to move alongside a companion. We demonstrate our robotic wheelchair. All attendees can try to ride and control our robotic wheelchair.},

abstract = {Interactive tables are well suited for co-located collaboration. Most prior research assumed users to share the same overall display output; a key challenge was the appropriate partitioning of screen real estate, assembling the right information "at the users' finger-tips" through simultaneous input. A different approach is followed in recent multi-view display environments: they offer personal output for each team member, yet risk to dissolve the team due to the lack of a common visual focus. Our approach combines both lines of thought, guided by the question: "What if the visible output and simultaneous input was partly shared and partly private?" We present Permulin as a concrete corresponding implementation, based on a set of novel interaction concepts that support fluid transitions between individual, group activities and coordination of group activities.},

abstract = {We present libmapper, a software library and protocol for providing network-enabled discovery and connectivity of real-time control signals. Today there is a trade-off present in the state of the art for music-related networking. At one extreme, we have many systems still using MIDI, an old and insufficient standard for specifying keyboard-oriented commands embedded in short, coded 3-byte messages, limiting modulation controls to a 7-bit range. At the other extreme we have Open Sound Control (OSC) [7], a flexible packet format that supports named data and a wide number of binary numerical representations, but lacks built-in semantic standards.The present work proposes a semantic layer built on OSC over multicast UDP/IP used to carry metadata about signals, which can specify peer-to-peer connectivity between nodes along with instructions for associated translation of data representations. The translation layer avoids the need for normalization or standardization of data representation while maintaining ease of use and providing a distributed, flexible approach to music networking. The goal is to provide a system for fast and dynamic experimentation during the mapping phase of instrument design.},

This means that users will have to find ways to support the device that often require one hand to hold it, constraining their ability to use two hands on the touchscreen. Our ongoing work explores the possibility of using novel input modalities mounted on the tablet to enable simultaneous two-handed input while the user is holding the device. This paper presents a bimanual scrolling technique that splits the control of scrolling speed and scrolling direction across two hands using a combination of pressure, physical dial and touch input.},

Bubble Popper, which uses very simple technology, also demonstrates that considering and facilitating body contact can be achieved without the need to sense body contact. Through reflecting on our design and analyzing observations of play, we are able to articulate what impact physical space layout in relation to digital game elements, and physical disparity between input and digital display can have on body contact. Our results aid game designers in creating engaging exertion games by guiding them when considering body contact, ultimately helping players benefit more from engaging exertion games.},

abstract = {SimpleTones is an interactive sound system that enables non-musicians to engage in collaborative acts of music making. The aim of SimpleTones is to make collaborative musical experiences more approachable and accessible for a wide range of users of different levels of musical expertise. This allows them to actively participate in the social aspects of collective musical improvisation, something usually confined to trained performers. Players can participate with ease and in real time by operating physical sound controllers in tandem. By using play as a catalyst and setting novices free from the requirement of previous musical experience, participants are able to focus on the collaborative aspects of performance, such as synchronizing movements, discovering the system's functionality together and making collective decisions.},

Our community is driven to publish novel results in novel spaces using novel designs, and to keep up with evolving technology. The aim of this workshop is to trial a new venue that embodies the plans made in previous SIGs and panels, such that we can begin to give people an outlet to publish experiences of attempting to replicate HCI research, and challenge or confirm its findings.},

abstract = {Geography is playing an increasingly important role in areas of HCI ranging from social computing to natural user interfaces. At the same time, research in geography has focused more and more on technology-mediated interaction with spatiotemporal phenomena. Despite the growing popularity of this geographic human-computer interaction (GeoHCI) in both fields, there have been few opportunities for GeoHCI knowledge sharing, knowledge creation or community building in either discipline, let alone between them. The goal of this workshop is thus two-fold. First, we will seek to sum up the state of GeoHCI knowledge and address GeoHCI core issues by inviting prominent researchers in the space to share and discuss the most important high-level findings from their work. Second, through our interdisciplinary organizing committee, we will recruit participants from both fields, with the goal of laying the groundwork for a community that works across intra- and interdisciplinary boundaries.},

The outdoor lighting domain however has focused mostly on the LED's efficiency and low cost of ownership to save energy and money for local governments. The use of the LED as a potential means for providing interactive city lighting for social good or entertainment is as yet a fairly unexplored area. This is therefore the focus of this workshop to bring together a community of researchers, designers and technologists to explore the potential of interactive city lighting and how it could support or enhance the lives of those living in a city.},

Consequently, we see an expressive need for continued in-depth discussion on how the diversity of application contexts could specifically benefit from the incorporation of the user's gaze. In this regard, we concentrate on gaze interaction in combination with post-WIMP interaction styles as opposed to traditional desktop setups to broaden the view for novel ways to interact with eye gaze. The objective of the CHI '13 workshop is to further promote this emerging field by addressing fundamental research questions regarding novel gaze-based interaction in the post-WIMP world.},

Yet, a multitude of good ideas and enthusiastic game design initiatives exist, where the games never see the light of day. Unfortunately, the causes of these failures remain often unexplored and unpublished. The challenges faced by researchers and practitioners are particularly complex when designing games for special target groups, such as children, or for a serious purpose. The HCI community would benefit from a discussion on these issues in order to avoid researchers and practitioners to repeat mistakes. We want to learn from projects that started with a promising idea, but failed or faced severe challenges. This workshop will be the first at CHI focusing on 'failed game projects'. In particular, workshop participants are encouraged to discuss issues that typically received little attention in publications and hereby contribute to the discussion on failures in the design, development and evaluation of games for and or with children. As a result, the community will benefit from these insights and lessons-learned, which will enhance the design of future (serious) games with/for children.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous technology, coupled with a surge in empirical research on people that engages people with multiple challenges in their lives, is increasingly revealing the potential for HCI to enrich the lives of vulnerable people. Designing for people with vulnerabilities requires an approach to participation that is sensitive to the risks of possible stigmatization and an awareness of the challenges for participant involvement. This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to explore the critical issues surrounding designing with and for vulnerable individuals. We aim to provoke discussion about how 'vulnerability' is defined in HCI, what methodological and ethical concerns are raised when working with specific cases, and ways of designing for future technologies that support vulnerable people in novel and sensitive ways.},

abstract = {Recent studies on how traditional HCI methods are applied in practice entail re-conceptualization of the nature of such methods, leading to the notion of 'method-as-set-of-resources'. Re-usable resources provide some, but not all, of the required resources for design work. Others must be provided within design work contexts. The expanding scope of use contexts alongside the shift of emphasis to user experience calls for the development of alternative HCI practices. These two trends can influence each other. Understanding, via structured case studies, how HCI professionals transfer the same (set) of design and evaluation methods across use contexts in terms of appropriating and configuring method-resources can provide applied knowledge for: (i) creating new methods, (ii) training novices, and (iii) laying a firmer groundwork for formal analysis of HCI methods. This workshop aims to bring together HCI professionals who have method-transfer experience and knowledge to share, analyze and synthesize insights so gained.

abstract = {The emergence of Online Video Games has led to new ways of socializing with friends. Nowadays a good online game is also associated with the pleasure of socializing and interaction with other players. One cannot play such a game solitarily in a meaningful sense without interacting with the other players. However, there are still no integrated ways of designing and evaluating the inherent sociability of online video games, nor are there methods or guidelines for designing and evaluating social user experiences. Designers of online video games are often left to use their intuition and experience, many times leading to design failures.This workshop aims to further the understanding of designing for sociability and evaluating such designs for online video games. The goal is to exact a framework for the design of sociability structures in online games, and identify methods of effective evaluation of those structures that are practical and can be applied in the industry. With the wide reach of online video games, the time is ripe to codify and integrate the methods that have been developed for designing and evaluating social player experiences. The results will then be turned into a methodological framework that enables online video game designers to select appropriately existing methods and tools to design and evaluate systematically the social player experience of their online computer game prototypes and products.},

abstract = {Time is central to HCI. Humans have varying conceptions and experiences of time: linear versus cyclical; discrete versus continuous; personal versus collective. Computational systems also represent time in various ways. And interaction itself plays out over time. Yet HCI has rarely examined time as a concept in its own right.In particular, the ways in which people conceive of and experience time are often at odds with the ways in which interactive systems represent and express temporal factors. In this workshop we aim to make explicit and question the tacit assumptions that underlie the use of time in human computer interaction. The focal themes for this workshop are: (1) examination of people's conceptions of time vis a vis various topics (e.g. career, fashion, sustainability); (2) exploration of representations of time in systems; (3) the design of time-oriented interactive systems that support long term reflection, action and behavior change (e.g., as it applies to activities and phenomena like careers, fashion, and sustainability).},

abstract = {This workshop explores the implications and opportunities of digital fabrication for the field of human-computer interaction. We highlight five themes: design tools and interfaces, online collaboration around physical objects, prototyping in the interaction design process, hands-on learning, and unique, personalized artifacts. For each, we provide an overview and a survey of related work. The workshop seeks to foster a network of researchers and others working in these and related areas. It explores potential research directions and ways that the CHI community can make a positive impact on design, craft, and maker culture.},

abstract = {Technologies inevitably break, degrade, and decline. In response, people mend and maintain what they already have: parts are replaced and software is updated. In this workshop, we propose to explore the fundamental work of repair and its impact on the study of design and technology as important - yet undervalued - forms of innovation. Broadly speaking, we hold the work of repair as acts of sustaining, managing, and repurposing to cope with attrition and regressive change. In order to investigate such processes, this workshop aims to bring together a range of scholars and practitioners from across the world to expand HCI's established views on design, development, and society.},

abstract = {Our workshop serves two purposes. First, to bring text entry researchers working in the human-computer interaction (HCI), natural language processing (NLP) and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) communities together at CHI. Second, we will set three major grand challenges for text entry research: a) removing the performance bottleneck in text entry; b) designing efficient localized text entry methods; and c) bridging the communication gap between users with disabilities and society at large. These challenges will be discussed in a panel format at the workshop. The discussions will center on support activities, such as identifying obstacles for success in meeting these challenges and formalizing procedures for measuring progress in the text entry field.},
