abstract = {Neri Oxman is an Architect, Designer and Associate Professor based at the MIT Media Lab where she is the founding director of The Mediated Matter Group. Her team conducts research at the intersection of computational design, digital fabrication, materials science and synthetic biology, and applies that knowledge to design across disciplines, media and scales from the micro scale to the building scale. Areas of application include architectural design, product design, fashion design, as well as the design of new technologies for digital fabrication and construction. Oxman coined the term and pioneered the field of Material Ecology, which considers computation, fabrication, and the material itself as inseparable dimensions of design. Oxman's work is included in permanent collections at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA), Centre Georges Pompidou, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (MFA), Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna (MAK), the FRAC Collection and the Boston Museum of Science, amongst others. Since 2005, Oxman and her team have won numerous awards and has grown in international scope and acclaim at venues such as the World Economic Forum and the White House.},

CHI research on graphical user interfaces, touchscreens, hypertext, mobile devices, and social media have dramatically changed family/friend relationships, business, medical care, education, and much more. Many of the changes are for good, but disruptive changes and destructive forces have also been unleashed. This session will track the history of the CHI community's dramatic growth, changing research methods, and substantial impact across disciplines, industries, and cultures. It will focus on some key personalities, while also drawing on my career, which includes being a founder of the CHI conference and a participant throughout. I will also present a fresh vision of research from my book "The New ABCs of Research: Achieving Breakthrough Collaborations."},

abstract = {The term "disability" connotes an absence of ability, but is like saying "dis-money" or "dis-height." All living people have some abilities [2]. Unfortunately, history is filled with examples of a focus on dis-ability, on what is missing, and on ensuing attempts to replace lost function to make people match a rigid world. Although often well intended, such a focus assumes humans must be adapted, and that interfaces, devices, and environments get to remain as they are. At the same time, our built things embody numerous "ability assumptions" imparted by their designers, and yet our built things remain unaware of their users' abilities. They also remain unaware of the situations their users are in, or how those situations affect their users' abilities [2,3]. An important shift in perspective comes by allowing people to "remain as they are," asking instead how interfaces, devices, and environments can bear the burden of becoming more suitable to their users' situated abilities. I call this perspective and the principles that accompany it "Ability-Based Design" [4,5], where the human abilities required to use a technology in a given context are questioned, and systems are made operable by or adaptable to alternative abilities. From this perspective, all people have varying degrees of ability, and different situations lead to different ability limitations, some long-term and some momentary. Some ability limitations come mostly from within the self, others from mostly outside the self. Ability-Based Design considers this whole "landscape of ability," respecting the human at its center and asking more of our technologies. In this talk, I will cover a decade's worth of projects related to Ability-Based Design, some directed at "people with disabilities" and others directed at "people in disabling situations." Rather than dive into any one project, I will convey a space of explored possibilities. I will also put forth a grand challenge: that anyone, anywhere, at any time can interact with technologies ideally suited to their specific situated abilities, and that our technologies do the work to achieve this fit.},

abstract = {About 800 million people in the world are completely non-literate and many are able to read only with great difficulty and effort. Even though mobile phone penetration is growing very fast, people with low levels of literacy have been found to avoid complex functions, and primarily use mobile phones for voice communication only. "Text-Free UIs" are design principles and recommendations for computer-human interfaces that would allow a first-time, non-literate person, on first contact with a PC or a mobile phone, to immediately realize useful interaction with minimal or no external assistance. Through an ethnographic design and iterative prototyping process involving hundreds of hours spent in the field among low-income, low-literate communities across rural and urban India, the Philippines and South Africa, we established design principles that use combinations of voice, video and graphics. We have applied these principles across several application domains, including job-search for domestic workers, health-information dissemination, map navigation, mobile money transfer, agriculture video search, and social networking for farmers. Rigorous user evaluations confirm that our non-textual designs are strongly preferred over standard text-based interfaces, and that first-time, non-literate users are, in fact, able to navigate through our UIs meaningfully.},

abstract = {Brad Myers has been doing research in the area of human-computer interaction for the last 40 years. Along the way, he and his students created over 60 software systems, whose names are often acronyms for gemstones. This talk's acronym, Ruby, is fittingly the gemstone associated with a 40th anniversary. Myers's MIT Master's thesis, Incense, was one of the earliest data visualization systems. While working for PERQ Systems Corporation, Brad created one of the first commercial window managers, called Sapphire, with a number of features that later became widespread. His PhD dissertation featured an interactive tool called Peridot, a programming-by-demonstration system that specified the look and behaviors of widgets without conventional programming. At Carnegie Mellon University, he created the Garnet and Amulet toolkits that incorporated novel designs for objects, constraints, output handling, input handling, command objects, and interactive tools. Many of the innovations in these projects have been adopted by later research and commercial systems. Brad was one of the early researchers on innovative uses for handheld devices, in a large-scale project called Pebbles. Another focus has been on using HCI techniques to improve programming for novice, expert, and end-user programmers.},

abstract = {Augmenting, or enhancing, human creativity is one of the most important goals that the practice of human-computer interaction can aspire to. As Steve Jobs put it, the computer is "the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds" [1]. But it takes creativity to work out how to change the world. One of the important strategies for encouraging new ideas is to make connections across boundaries. Viewing one domain from the point of view of another has been my approach. The talk will review the beginnings of my work, in and between Art and HCI, from 50 years ago. It will show how the two areas creatively fed off of one another and how collaboration and community building contributed to the quest for that equivalent of a bicycle. The computer inspired major developments in interactive art and interactive art challenged human-computer interaction. That inspiration and those challenges are still with us today. From the start I argued that iterative design was essential even though, at the time, it was rejected by mainstream computer science. User interface software had to be transformed and interactive graphics had to be reformulated in order to enable Art to progress. Crossing boundaries has been a key strategy for innovation: generating new interactive art forms, new HCI concepts, new research methods. In the light of this history the talk will speculate on what the next 50 years might bring and how best we might work towards that future [2].},

While many existing tools, such as string boards, or protractors with physical angle markers, can facilitate learning, these devices are highly specific. This problem contributes to low levels numeracy levels in visually impaired individuals. Addressing these problems, this paper presents Clicks, a digital manipulative for visually impaired children (KG to grade 3) that supports a range of geometry education tasks and ties physical adjustments to the device to a dynamic digital representation and additional audio feedback. The tool is a construction kit of simple geometric primitives that snap together to produce a range of more complex forms such as lines, angles, triangles and rectangles. When placed on a tablet computer, the geometry of these objects is sensed (via the capacitive touch screen and electrodes embedded in the objects) and audio feedback provided.},

They can share announcements, chat, and are encouraged to form lasting, real world relationships. ParentCircle also offers parents the ability to join various community groups, which provide information about local news, and events to take part in with their children. It differs from existing products and apps, because it actively encourages and facilitates physical interaction, with the intention of helping single parents build a support network which will ease the various burdens they experience.},

Specifically, VisualLink notifies elderly of a call using notifications on large screen (TV) and wearable device with haptic feedback. The elderly then pick up the call via a VisualLink phone with a traditional-look, which automatically uses speech recognition to transcribe the call and show the caption on the screen, with interactive visual content such as images authored by the caller. In the evaluation of the prototype, participants gave VisualLink positive feedback for its ease of use and usefulness for making them better connected to their family's life.},

abstract = {Dining out is one of the biggest challenges people with food allergies face. For young adults, especially, the fear of having an allergic reaction when dining out impairs social aspects of their life. The exhausting process of searching online and communicating with restaurants also increases their anxiety.To improve the quality of life for young adults with food allergies, we present AllergyBot, an intelligent and humane Chatbot that provides restaurants' allergy accommodation information based on users' allergens. We use established instant messaging platforms to create a form of conversation that young adults are familiar with. AllergyBot aims to reduce the users' inquiry overload, improve their overall dining out experiences, and support their social life.},

abstract = {We present a text-message system that increases access to hot meals for homeless populations. Homeless people in the USA face several challenges, a crucial one being food insecurity. Through contextual inquiry, we found that although the homeless community is aware of various sources of free food, most of the information is spread through word of mouth. This leaves knowledge incomplete, inconvenient for those on the move, and difficult to remember. We address these issues with a system that allows homeless users and their supporters to update and receive notifications about locations serving free hot meals in a given area, using technology they already have access to their (often non-smartphone) mobile phones. The system was prototyped, and an initial round of testing was completed with a homeless community in southern Michigan.},

abstract = {Nowadays, Syrian refugees are facing major challenges to mingle with the social life of German society. The purpose of this on-going study is to create support and increase empathy of German youths towards Syrian refugees with the developed concept called "Empathy- Up" (EMP-UP). The concept aims at levelling the playing field for them through a mobile game. The research done has shown two main critical problems faced by refugees (Syrian): (1) they do not get in contact with locals (Germans), and (2) they feel that Germans do not want to interact with them or accept them in their society.The study shows that when combining a geo-location based mobile game that addresses cultural differences within the game scenario, it's more likely to connect players emotionally with these different cultures. This resulted in minimizing prejudices by locals, increasing their willingness to get to know refugees, and making the first contact with a refugee simpler and more positive. The empathy is created during the game while players are going through the story scenario and when the game ends, both players (locals and refugees) surprisingly meet face-to-face in reality.},

abstract = {Homeless people lack stable housing conditions and often feel marginalised from broader society. Some charity organisations seek to improve the confidence and self worth of homeless individuals by providing artistic activities, in which impressive artworks are produced. However, much of the artwork remain unseen, due to lack of the resources and technology available to these charity organisations. This is why we designed StreetHeart, a multichannel service. StreetHeart gives the underprivileged (homeless) the power to upload their artworks independently, by using a portable camera device. Approved artwork is then shared through LED screens placed around the city, reaching larger audiences. By pressing a heart button embedded in the display, passersby can instantaneously send their appreciation to the artists and further purchase artworks via an online store. StreetHeart has the potential to not only increase the self-worth of those affected by homelessness, but also bring them closer to the society.},

In this paper, we explored and constructed a framework to help understand ST experience through the study of solo travelers. Solo travelers were found to have ample opportunities to reflect, especially outside of themselves, and thus studying solo travelers provided us with a platform to understand ST experiences.},

abstract = {Sketching is a valuable technique used across a variety of industries to aid creative thought. Although the benefits of sketching are widely known, there is limited instruction for the application of sketching in problem solving, particularly in the critical phase of generating ideas. This project seeks to encourage the usage of sketching in this phase by proposing a structured method to aid creative thought and divergent thinking. To inform the design of the method, exploratory research was conducted involving interviews with creative professionals from various creative disciplines in addition to concurrent think-aloud design sessions with User Experience designers. Sketches from the Royal Institute of British Architecture (RIBA) were also reviewed to collect observations from conceptual architectural sketches. The best practices and techniques uncovered in this research formed the foundation for the design of a lightweight sketching method. The main contribution of this paper is the method, Sketching for Ideation Version 1.0, which was evaluated by five User Experience Designers and two Business Consultants. The evaluation offered encouraging reviews of the method for improving idea generation and also constructive comments for future iterations.},

abstract = {Emotional intelligence (EI) development of children is comparatively an underexplored domain and is highly dependent on the quality of children's relationships with the adults and early care experience. Yet, the observed pattern of increasing parental employment is threatening communication and interaction between parents and children, hence affecting quality family time and parent-child relationship. In response to the aforementioned needs, this paper presents CUPA, a children companion tool that encourages EI and parent- child relationship. The two main contributions are: First, CUPA proposes a different approach to children's EI by combining 'interoception &amp; deep breathing' and 'emotional check-in &amp; review' methods to encourage emotional awareness and sensitivity, alongside various forms of interaction. Second, CUPA presents the use of ritual and routine to encourage children independence while promoting parent-child relationship, as well as healthy morning and sleep rituals. Functionality and interaction were explored with 21 participants and overall results returned positive. Additional roles and concept refinement of presented tool were discovered.},

In this paper, we introduce Ply, a DOM inspection tool which augments the Chrome Developer Tools to help developers explore complex professional web designs. To compute source code relevance, we introduce a technique called visual regression pruning, which uses pixel-level screenshot comparison to help developers locate CSS responsible for a webpage's appearance. A user selects an element, and Ply computes the visual impact of each matched CSS property. If a property does not affect the webpage, Ply hides the property from the inspector. In multiple iterations of needfinding studies, developers located relevant code more quickly using Ply. In a case study with the Airbnb homepage, Ply displays an average of 49% fewer CSS properties per element, compared to the Chrome Developer Tools as a control.},

We improved the methodology used in a previous study of phone presence and task performance [8], while testing an 'opportunity cost' model of effort and attention [2]. We were unable to replicate Thornton et al.'s finding [8] that presence of cell phones reduces performance in a simple cognitive task (additive digit cancellation). Moreover, contrary to our expectations, we found that participants who were more attached to their phones found the tasks more fun/exciting and effortless, if they completed them with their phone present.},

The research described here aims to distil the complexity of activity theory, embodied interaction, distributed cognition and human factors engineering into a HCI framework for understanding and developing visual designs in HCI (a design methodology). To assist this process, interviews were conducted with visual designers from human-computer interaction, marketing, art and design. The designers were asked about their design process and how they handle memory and cognitive load. The results revealed a consistent effort towards understanding a target audience, the effect of the situation of a design artefact and the effect of cultural experience and expectations on design. These results inform a simpler, generalist approach which targets the heart of making effective and inspiring design artefacts for HCI.},

This experiment uses a robot with remote controlled wheels that was hidden inside an art box. The approach taken to test the hypothesis was to separate users in three groups, each of these characterized by a unique form in which the robot would interact with the subjects. The three groups were categorized by its interaction mode: Proactive, Reactive and Manual. The first group found a robot that interacted with them in an insistent way, the second one only when the subject completed a task and the third one when the user explicitly requested its assistance. The experiment results are meaningful, because although there's no significant difference regarding quality of work between modes, there exists a difference in time of completion of the task, which is proof of a change in efficiency.},

abstract = {With the introduction of new Virtual Reality (VR) devices such as Microsoft HoloLens, Oculus, HTC Vive etc., one cannot ignore the fact that research related to Human and VR interaction is bound to take a big leap. One of the main areas that has already gain momentum, is the area of VR based stroke rehabilitation research. Although many VR based research studies have been performed for lower and upper extremity training purposes, very few research studies are related to development of VR based research platforms. However, these platforms are usually single device dedicated, and therefore cannot be used to add another device. This study contributes to the field of HCI by achieving three major goals-- 1) explore the design aspects of VR based training research; 2) innovate the field of VR based training research by developing a multi-interface platform; and 3) inspire future researchers by providing an open source SDK so as to expand the horizon for human VR interaction. A pilot study was conducted in order to test the applicability of our platform, using 25 healthy subjects across four different interfaces. From the promising results achieved during the pilot study we are currently in the process of evaluating our platform using stroke patients at the Spain Rehabilitation Center at the University of Alabama, in Birmingham. Our findings and insights could inform future VR based rehabilitation system designs and help researchers and other stakeholders to assess the viability of using VR based scenarios for training purposes.},

abstract = {Weight-training has become a popular way of maintaining health and general wellbeing. However, many U.S. emergency departments have had an increase in injury incidences related to weight-training. We have designed an application, called Oli, which tracks a user's form and highlights injury causing movements. Oli assists users with weight-training by providing real-time feedback &amp; analysis of lifts via utilization of frame by frame image processing. In this paper, we list our methods and the capabilities of our Kinect based system to process real time data and analyze form on particular weight-training movements.},

The relationship between question framing and subsequent discussions found within online forums for the video game Minecraft suggests opportunities for discussions to generate higher level of critical thinking. Questions found within the forum were analyzed by the Cognitive Presence Tool proposed by Garrison et al. [2]. We propose that seeding forums with appropriate question structures may be useful for framing as well as improving community-regulated learning.},

abstract = {Nowadays, users rely on the smartphones to do all sort of things more often. On average, a normal user accesses to his or her smartphone 150 times per day. These include accessing varieties of apps for different tasks. Accessing these apps via the traditional smartphone graphic interface, the user needs to navigate the UI hierarchy to look up the target app. However, with the increasing amount of apps installed, the looking up process takes a lot of time. Using gesture shortcuts directly to active an app can largely simplify the apps? look up process but its performances were not investigated by previous research. This study evaluated the speed and accuracy of accessing target app using the user-defined gesture shortcuts approach and the traditional graphic interface. The results suggest the user-defined gesture shortcuts approach can improve the app look up speed. Additionally, detail breakdowns of speed differences, as well as the advantages of each approach, were analyzed.},

Eating is sensed through capturing chewing sounds via a low-cost microphone solution. Unlike most VR games that stimulate mostly our visual and auditory senses, "You Better Eat to Survive!" makes a novel contribution by integrating the gustatory sense not just as an additional game input, but as an integral element to the game experience: we use the fact that with head-mounted displays, players cannot see what they are eating and have to entrust a second player outside the VR experience to provide them with sufficient food and feeding him/her. With "You Better Eat to Survive!", we aim to demonstrate that eating can be an intriguing interaction technique to enrich virtual reality experiences while offering complementary benefits of social interactions around food.},

abstract = {Many cooperative games share a common drawback: they are not entirely cooperative. These games usually highlight some form of personal gain, diminishing potential for positive interactivity. Phantasm is a game where players' skills are measured by how well they can communicate together. Players take on the roles of either special agent or master hacker. The goal is to get the agent to an exit. However, there are many enemies and obstacles that only the hacker can see, through various security cameras and filters. The agent, however, can hear sounds emitting from the walls and other objects. Both players must keep a constant flow of communication in aiding the agent of what routes to take, what and how to interact with the environments, and where, precisely, to shoot at invisible threats. This game will help bring players closer, as they will need to understand each others way of thinking in a tense and suspenseful gaming environment. },

We present Way Out, a game allowing players to navigate multi-layer panorama scenes by around-body interactions. Way Out explores the interaction possibilities of reaching out into panorama with depth. By utilizing the front-facing camera, the system tracks the player's face and infers the distance between the user and the device based on the size of the face, thus enabling depth interactions. In this game, the player can walk through a panoramic forest maze that consists of four layers in depth and drag items in physical 3D space.},

Technological countermeasures can only be deployed if the humans depending upon them are aware of how to use them, and hackers are beginning to take advantage of the knowledge gap that exists in this area. The recent DNC hackings during the 2016 US presidential election are evidence of this, as staff were tricked into sharing passwords which granted access to confidential information by fake Google security emails. Vulnerabilities such as these are due in part to insufficient and tiresome training when it comes to information security. A potential solution is the introduction of more engaging training methods, which teach information security in an active and entertaining way. To this end, we introduce the game What.Hack to teach information security and defense methods for social engineering threats.},

abstract = {Designing a user interface or input method requires to evaluate and trade-off many criteria. The corresponding design spaces are huge, making it impossible to consider every potential design. Therefore, my work focuses on the use of computational methods for the design of input methods. I follow a modelling-optimization approach: understand and model the characteristics of the interaction, formulate the design space and develop (multi-) objective functions to evaluate designs, and develop algorithms to systematically search for the best design. In my projects I applied this approach to develop better text entry methods. Among others, I modelled the performance and anatomical constraints of the hand to computationally optimize multi-finger gestures for mid-air input, and studied how people type on physical keyboards, in order to understand and model the performance of two-hand typing.},

abstract = {Type 1 Diabetes is a serious condition that demands careful balancing of lifestyle and medication to avoid serious complications. Current mobile health approaches for diabetes management are usually either automated insulin delivery systems or logbooks that depend on manual data collection and reflection. Both have their shortcoming such as loss of engagement and autonomy in the former approach, or fatigue and cognitive stress in the latter. Based on my pilot research, my thesis considers the wider implications of an approach that: (1) reduces workload through minimizing manual logging; (2) automates knowledge extraction from collected data (3) communicates insight in the right way at the right time; (4) creates a feedback loop that encourages previously effective behaviors. This thesis contributes to the exploration and evaluation of new strategies for mobile personalized support through ubiquitous computing technologies, and the development of tools for improving the lives of those with chronic health conditions},

For example, learning companions enhance learning through socio-motivational support and are more successful when users feel rapport. In this work, I explore social engagement in dialogue systems in terms of acoustic-prosodic entrainment; entrainment is a phenomenon where over the course of a conversation, speakers adapt their acoustic-prosodic features, becoming more similar in their pitch, intensity, or speaking rate. Correlated with rapport and task success, entrainment plays a significant role in how individuals connect; a system which can entrain has potential to improve social engagement by enhancing these factors. As a result of this work, I introduce a dialogue system which can entrain and investigate its effects on social factors like rapport.},

abstract = {There has been increasing attention paid to the necessity of Computational Thinking (CT) and CS education in recent years. To address this need, a broad spectrum of animation programming environments and games have been created to engage learners. However, most of these tools are designed for the touchpad/mouse and keyboard, and few have been evaluated to assess their efficacy in developing CT/programming skills. This is problematic when trying to understand the validity of such designs for CS education, and whether there are alternative approaches that may prove more effective. My dissertation work helps address this problem. After creating a framework based on a meta-review that carefully dissects embodiment strategies in learning games, I am building and evaluating tangible and augmented reality versions of a CT game. I plan to examine how these different forms of physical interaction help to facilitate and enhance meaning-making during the learning process, and whether/how they improve related learning factors such as self-belief and enjoyment.},

This work explores the implications of media companies' competition for limited attention from users on social media for news diversity.

To examine this hypothesis, I am analyzing sentiments of news articles that are shared and unshared on Twitter.},

In this study, we propose a method to display a menu on the user's forearm, which is always within reach of the user's hand. The user can obtain touch feeling by directly touching their forearm. An application was developed using this menu, and an informal user study at a previous conference was successful, leaving some minor points to be improved.},

abstract = {In this research, we develop an immersive mixed reality game environment using an actuated conveyor belt surface as a game stage. One game player creates the game environment by arranging tangible objects; those objects linearly flow and interact with a virtual character manipulated by another player. We expect that game enjoyment could be leveraged while being highly immersed into mixed reality game world. Also, new kinds of interaction between two players with different game roles are expected. The prototype was pilot-tested and planned for a future demonstration.},

However, this results in excluding all the people in the surrounding without an HMD to become sole bystanders and onlookers.

The process of building an augmentation is simply to connect actuator and sensor blocks and attach the resulting wearable to the body. The current design can be easily modified to incorporate additional electronics for desired sensing capabilities. Our universal connector designs can be extended to utilize any motors within afforded power, size, and weight constraints.},

Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST), a commonly used statistical analysis approach in many research fields, has been criticized over the years due to the prevalence of misconceptions and improper practice. We introduce StatPlayground, an exploratory tool as a viable solution to the root problem of statistical illiteracy. StatPlayground allows users to control data characteristics (e.g., mean, variance of distributions) by directly manipulating visualizations (e.g., box plots) to see the effect on the resulting inferential statistics (e.g., p-value, effect size) and vice versa. We believe that StatPlayground has the potential to help users improve certain statistical literacy skills. We elaborate on the motivation behind this tool and demonstrate its features through use cases.},

The goal is to combine established textile craft routines with electronic functionalities while avoiding being limited to either crafting or engineering qualities. A discipline's toolset is decisive in what material can be handled and what output can be produced as well as the skills needed to handle it. New tools presented here allow for new interactions with materials and make new routines accessible to the processes of electronic making and textile crafting, potentially being inclusive to new user groups in the respective fields. Here, traditional needlecraft tools are adapted to integrate electric engineering needs. Functionally, these tools augment processes of textile crafting with information about electric properties of the artifact in production. More broadly, they are a chance to reflect on the roles and cultural assumptions of the technologies, and indeed crafts, that these tools enable.},

The interface is presented through the use of modular lanterns, which users can configure and install in a 6x6 grid. We developed various algorithms that govern how lanterns interact and animate based on their neighbours' configuration; and guided by this feedback, users work together to optimize the diversity of the space. A system on the backend simulates and drives the lantern animations, while controlling the actual physical grid. This installation consists of a tall wooden frame which suspends up to 36 lanterns. Through the use of this installation, we hope to encourage dialogue about the value of diversity in our daily lives.},

Cadaveric dissection allows a medical student to understand the spatial relationships of different parts in the body in ways that a typical 2D representation cannot, due to its ability to provide an authentic learning experience which engages all the senses. However, in the modern times that we live in, the availability of suitable cadavers for medical education is low, and there is an urgent need to supplement the practice of cadaveric dissection with more sustainable and economical methods of teaching. Virtual Reality (VR) may serve as a suitable supplement owing to its ability to simulate an immersive 3D environment. However, the authentic learning experience is difficult to recreate in VR, due to the lack of design guidelines. This project is an early exploration into designing active learning interactions for learning anatomy.},

Current commercial devices typically deliver tactile feedback through controllers the user holds in the hands. Since both hands get occupied and tactile feedback can only be provided at a single position, research and industry proposed a range of approaches to provide richer tactile feedback. Approaches, such as tactile vests or electrical muscle stimulation, were proposed, but require additional body-worn devices. This limits comfort and restricts provided feedback to specific body parts. With this Interactivity installation, we propose quadcopters to provide tactile stimulation in VR. While the user is visually and acoustically immersed in VR, small quadcopters simulate bumblebees, arrows, and other objects hitting the user. The user wears a VR headset, mini-quadcopters, controlled by an optical marker tracking system, are used to provide tactile feedback.},

abstract = {As electronic music has made its way into the mainstream, the popularity of music production tools for both professional and amateur use has grown. Although the users of music technology are becoming more prevalent and diverse, there have been very few innovations in their user interfaces. The onset of high-quality, consumer virtual reality has allowed for the development of unique user interfaces that are able to make use of an interactive 3D space, as opposed to a standard 2D interface. We present Audiovisual Playground, a 3D virtual reality music application developed for the HTC VIVE. Audiovisual Playground builds off of a programmable music device called a sequencer, and extends its design metaphors to a large-scale, 3D environment.},

To explore how family and friends might be able to participate in outdoor leisure activities together over distance, we prototyped a shared bicycling technology probe using mobile video streaming. We conducted a study where half of our participants used our technology setup as a parallel experience where both cycled at the same time. The other half used it to connect a cyclist with a person at home. Participants highly valued the experience and the video and audio connections allowed to them to feel closely connected with their partner. Conversations typically focused on everyday activities, rather than the activity itself. Challenges immerged including difficulties in looking at the video feed while riding, boredom during longer rides, and feelings of obligation to make eye contact. These findings suggest important considerations for the design of video streaming technologies for shared outdoor activities.},

abstract = {3D food printing is getting the spotlight in the market by offering the opportunity of customizing food appearances that are usually troublesome to make by hand. Additive manufacturing techniques, similar to the majority of traditional 3d printers, extrude ingredients into a certain shape. However, this technique is not applicable for all types of food. Korean dumpling, Mandu, is an example that has a complicated cooking process. The cook needs to cut the dough into a certain shape, fill the stuffing, and finally fold it into a form. In this video, we propose a novel and hybrid process in which we fabricate custom tools that assist the cooking journey. CAD software generates the tools (stamp and jig system) based on the custom parameters, then the user cuts the dough with the stamp and assembles it by using the jig as a guide. Users can create mandu into various geometric shapes quickly without any special skills. With the Ori-mandu, we extended the current research on digital gastronomy by using digital fabrication to create custom tools for cooking.},

abstract = {Displacements of large objects induced by vibration are a common occurrence, but the motion is generally unpredictable. Think for instance of an unbalanced front-loading washing machine. For controlled movement, wheels or legs are usually preferred.In this work, we explore a strategy for moving everyday objects by introducing or harvesting random external vibration rather than using a mechanical system with wheels. We designed vibration modules that can be easily attached to furniture and objects. After learning how several random bursts of vibration affect its pose, an optimization algorithm discovers the optimal sequence of vibration patterns required to (slowly but surely) move the object to a specified position.This principle may be useful for displacing large or small objects in situations where attaching wheels or complete lifting is impossible assuming the speed of the process is not a concern. Embedding vibration modules as part of mass-produced objects may provide a low-cost way to make almost anything mobile.},

By repeatedly pinching the selected messages they break apart into words that tumble down in a Tetris like manner. Gradually words are deleted until the remaining words find their position and form a haiku.The video presents a walkthrough of how to interact with the application to select messages in various ways, how to apply "themes" to gain some control over the generation process, and eventually share created poems with others through social media.},

abstract = {With the apartment being a major residence styles, children are not provided with enough opportunities to play. Therefore, chances for learning many things that could be learned through playing these traditional plays are also decreasing. Interactive toy "Peekabot" was invented under this question that how could we re-invent the traditional play full of funny learning experience. Playing hide and seek is good for children. While looking for place to hide, they develop their own spatial-recognition. When finding other hiding children, one can provide physical stimulation to oneself. Also this task encourages children to develop the concept of objective permanence and perspective taking, therefore it improves cognitive development..Peekabot can blend into circumstances through color recognition and camouflage. Also, Peekabot can play color game with children. Through emotion recognition, Peekabot can mimic children's facial expression and build a strong emotional connection with them.},

Just as pixels are the programmed visual representations from the information output of computers, droplets can be generated from the information output of molecules. Using Organic Primitives, a toolbox of pH-reactive sensor-actuator materials, I explore multi-modal methods for human interaction with molecules. We typically use culturally recognizable symbols to communicate with Pixels. With Organic Primitives, objects such as apples are transformed into information displays, utilizing innate signals from nature to communicate. For example, we infer pain when we see blood, feel a sense of trypophobia or danger when we see spotted patterns, and have an inherent adverse response to sulphuric odors. Utilizing these color, odor and shape changing primitives, I demonstrate how interactions with organic, fluid-based systems can be made possible.},

This is realized by using a smartphone as a head-mounted display with a cardboard viewer. Our technique displays a pointer on the screen corresponding to the position of the hand, which is detected by the built-in back camera of the smartphone. The user can move the pointer by moving the hand in a thumbs-up position. The user can also select a target by folding the thumb, similarly to pushing a joystick button. Our technique can be implemented using only a smartphone with a built-in back camera; therefore, it is easy to apply to target selection in mobile VR environments. To test the feasibility of the design, we prototyped a proof-of-concept implementation. Furthermore, we developed a game using our technique and investigated user impressions.},

In this multidisciplinary, one-day workshop, we seek to bring together HCI scholars, designers, artists, and curators to explore the potential provided by Design Fiction as a method to generate ideas for Mixed-Reality Performance (MRP) through various archetypes including scripts, programs, and posters. By drawing attention to novel interactive technologies, such as bio-sensors and environmental IoT, we seek to generate design fiction scenarios capturing the aesthetic and interactive potential for mixed-reality performances, as well as the challenges to gain access to audience members' data -- i.e. physiological states, daily routines, conversations, etc.},

abstract = {Movement-based interaction design is increasingly popular, with application domains ranging from dance, sport, gaming to physical rehabilitation. In a workshop at CHI 2016, a set of prominent artists, game design-ers, and interaction designers embarked on a research journey to explore what we came to refer to as "aesthetics in soma-based design". In this follow-up work-shop, we would like to take the next step, shifting from discussing the philosophical underpinnings we draw upon to explain and substantiate our practice, to form our own interaction design theory and conceptualisations. We propose that soma-based design theory needs practical, pragmatic as well as analytical study -- otherwise the felt dimension will be missing. We will consider how such tacit knowledge can be articulated, documented and shared. To ground the discussion firmly in the felt experience of our own practice, the work-shop is organised as a joint practical design work session, supported by analytical study.},

abstract = {Over 21 million refugees are residing in camps, journeying through Europe or resettling in new countries [19]. The magnitude of the humanitarian crisis calls for technological innovation in addressing the challenges being faced by refugees and humanitarian aid stakeholders. At our CHI 2016 Special Interest Group (SIG) on Refugees and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) [17], HCI researchers expressed interest in exploring the difficulties faced by refugees and having a participatory approach when addressing these difficulties. Additionally, further consideration is needed regarding the methodological, organizational and practical challenges in working with refugee communities. Accordingly, this one-day workshop followed by a day of informal meetings with stakeholders aims to (1) explore research methods that can be adapted and applied to refugee contexts and to (2) formulate a research agenda for future work. Participants will be joined by members of organizations that engage with refugees in Denver and be presented with testimonials from refugees in order to develop a research agenda.},

abstract = {Computer-based interactions increasingly pervade our everyday environments. Be it on a mobile device, a wearable device, a wall-sized display, or an augmented reality device, interactive systems often rely on the consumption, composition, and manipulation of text. The focus of this workshop is on exploring the problems and opportunities of text interactions that are embedded in our environments, available all the time, and used by people who may be constrained by device, situation, or disability. This workshop welcomes all researchers interested in interactive systems that rely on text input or output. Participants should submit a short position statement outlining their background, past work, future plans, and suggesting a use-case they would like to explore in-depth during the workshop. During the workshop, small teams will form around common or compelling use-cases. Teams will spend time brainstorming, creating low-fidelity prototypes, and discussing their use-case with the group. Participants may optionally submit a technical paper for presentation as part of the workshop program. The workshop serves to sustain and build the community of text entry researchers who attend CHI. It provides an opportunity for new members to join this community, soliciting feedback from experts in a small and supportive environment.},

abstract = {In an age when machines are increasingly entering our daily lives, social robotics focuses on how robots can successfully share spaces, interface, and collaborate with people. Machines that fail to interact appropriately run the risk of becoming irritating and unwelcome; however, when personality and charm are added, functional machines can not only add value to their environment, but also engage, elicit trust, and foster bonds with their human partners. The central idea of this workshop is that even very simple robots, in terms of both sensing and degrees-of-freedom, are capable of charismatic interaction. Acting training can inform the development of such charismatic robots, but it is challenging to operationalize actor knowledge into computational systems. For example, people parse non-verbal communications intuitively, even from machines that do not look like people, and acting training contains explicit methodology for exploring the space of motion-based expression. Robotics researchers can gain insight on how to create interfaces that adapt the knowledge of human charisma experts -- such as actors and performers -- into robotics, developing robot social behaviors with humans in the loop. This workshop will be a forum for discussing minimal social robots and prototyping new ones. The program includes presentations exploring the social role of simple sensors and behaviors, a hands-on activity, and motivating talks from experts in the field. Accepted applicants will be invited to share their perspectives on minimal social robots during highlight talks, discussions, and a poster session. During the workshop, participants will work in small groups to craft an illustrative interaction for a minimalist robot whose communications they have designed. There will also be ample opportunities for early researchers to connect with experts in this field. A public website will provide an archive of accepted submissions and minimal social robot interaction videos in order to share the output of the workshop with the larger community.},

abstract = {End-users are often exposed to uncertain data in interactive systems such as personal health apps, intelligent navigation systems, and systems driven by machine learning. On one hand, communicating uncertainty may improve the understanding of data and predictions. On the other hand, communicating uncertainty can greatly confuse users and decrease trust. While some specialized guidelines for dealing with uncertainty exist within particular fields such as information visualization or context-aware computing, HCI lacks general design guidelines around the more basic question of "will communicating uncertainty rather help or confuse my users'" The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners from across HCI and related fields to establish a better understanding of when and how to design for uncertainty. The outcome of the workshop will be a set of real-world application scenarios with descriptions of the impact of presenting uncertainty in that scenario. Additionally, we will create a set of design guidelines that supports designers and researchers in this emerging space in evaluating whether and how to present uncertainty.},

abstract = {Traditional interfaces are continuously being replaced by mobile, wearable, or pervasive interfaces. Yet when it comes to the input and output modalities enabling our interactions, we have yet to fully embrace some of the most natural forms of communication and information processing that humans possess: speech, language, gestures, thoughts. Very little HCI attention has been dedicated to designing and developing spoken language, acoustic-based, or multimodal interaction techniques, especially for mobile and wearable devices. In addition to the enormous, recent engineering progress in processing such modalities, there is now sufficient evidence that many real-life applications do not require 100% accuracy of processing multimodal input to be useful, particularly if such modalities complement each other. This multidisciplinary, one-day workshop will bring together interaction designers, usability researchers, and general HCI practitioners to analyze the opportunities and directions to take in designing more natural interactions especially with mobile and wearable devices, and to look at how we can leverage recent advances in speech, acoustic, and multimodal processing.},

abstract = {We argue that the huge success of Augmented Reality game Pok\'{e}mon Go has little to do with clever design. Rather, the success is due to the nostalgic branding, with a franchise for which people already have great affection. As exasperated academics, rather than resist, we have decided to sell out. We suggest that a similar nostalgic branding strategy allows any mildly interesting HCI project to gain similarly huge benefits of public engagement. We provide the HCI community with a crude nostalgification tool -- MC Hammer's Hammer of Nostalgification -- and present a number of case studies that illustrate its power.},

Through a series of design narratives, we explore Human-FabMachine Interaction (HFI), a novel viewpoint from which to reflect on the importance of (i) interleaved design thinking and refinement during fabrication, (ii) enriched methods of interaction with fabrication machines regardless of skill level, and (iii) concurrent human and machine interaction.},

Based on a review of relevant literature from health and social care research, we suggest a process for supporting emotional work that can be adapted to other application contexts.},

We designed three unique chemical changing powders to reflect elevated levels of carbon monoxide (CO), ultraviolet (UV) rays, and ozone (O3). The powders achieve color changes distinguishable to the human eye, while maintaining an aesthetic appeal to the wearer. Our technical evaluations confirmed the performance of the powders to detect and display elevated levels. An 18-person exploratory study provided insight to the perceptions, possibilities, and challenges of a powder form factor for wearable environmental visualization. Through this paper, we intend to enable the use of colorimetric chemical displays for HCI researchers and designers.

We seek to open a discussion on how the notion of self is plastic, and how innately we are capable of empowering and extending ourselves through technologies. Neuroscience studies show using a tool not only offers new capabilities, but also reconstructs our cognitive architecture to include the tool as a part of ourselves. This adaptive nature of the body image poses an opportunity for designing interfaces that become natural extensions to us. In this paper we introduce previous studies drawn from various fields of study, and discuss the role of the body in the self-world relationship, body image plasticity, and how designing the body may affect neural developments. We also offer a categorization of related technologies, along with our current explorations. Finally, potential issues and challenges in realizing the presented form of interfaces are addressed.},

Thus, game designers and Second Language (L2) educators miss opportunities to learn from each other and to collaborate effectively in the game design process.

The case studies revealed unique patterns in user experience for moment-to-moment changes in enjoyment and frustration.

This paper reports findings from a series of PD activities with children aged 4-6 years in China. China is an interesting culture for PD, and there is a hole in PD research with Chinese children of this age group. PD sessions were found challenging to conduct in this context, but techniques such as using a familiar comic character as a metaphor, the facilitator as the drawer, and one-on-one communication in a group setting seemed to alleviate the difficulties. Based on the case study findings, the pros and cons of each tested technique in designing child-computer interaction are discussed.},

abstract = {Eco-feedback technology is generally concerned with the communication of information to affect individual or group behavior with respect to environmental impact. Electricity consumption feedback, in particular, has been studied from various viewpoints to understand its effects on consumption behavior and to explore the design space. Recent efforts have resulted in a wide array of device designs ranging from individual appliance feedback at the outlet to centralized devices for home consumption awareness. However, adoption rates for these technologies remain relatively poor, perhaps due to a lack of emphasis on specific user needs. In this paper, we contribute a participatory design study to examine differences and similarities among three targeted household demographics: older adults, families with children, and students in shared housing. In addition, we present our process for extracting personas from participatory design study data, alongside the set of resulting persona skeletons and one finished persona.},

We explore children's use of a range of devices (iPad, mobile phone, laptop, etc.) in terms of the layout of the table, the juxtaposition of artefacts, the timing of interaction around eating, and the management of behavior or "table manners". Ultimately we argue that mobile technology use is adeptly managed by a range of actors' children, parents, and restaurant staff -- to facilitate a positive dining experience. Further we find that mobile technology use provides unforeseen opportunities for learning, game playing, and intergenerational interaction while allowing families to spend time together. Finally, we outline design considerations for restaurants and designers to better support children's mobile technologies use in family-friendly restaurants.},

abstract = {Most interactive sports-oriented products that are commercially available focus on individual athletes. The ones that focus on team sports rarely go beyond performance monitoring. Therefore, in this case study we focus on team dynamics in secondary school sports teams. These teams typically have to deal with unbalanced engagement due to skill level differences. This can impede the goals of these PE-classes; to raise young people's enthusiasm for a variety of sports and to teach them how to work together as a team. In this project we explore a design solution aimed at balancing engagement in these mixed level sports teams, through an intelligent system of connected light jerseys. The jerseys, iteratively developed through experiential prototypes that were used during secondary school basketball games, were able to measure ball possession and give feedback through a series of light stripes. In this paper we describe two iterations of this case study and our quantitative and qualitative findings of team engagement.},

We illustrate this assertion with a historical example: the remarkable "Grand Tour" of the HMS Challenger in 1872, as well as case examples drawn from our work illustrating where theory and practice threatened to collide and swamp us, where the practicalities of established approaches and unexpected hurtles threw us into the fractal maelstrom that occurs when the known meets the unknown. We share these experiences and lessons learned in the spirit of fracticality (a term we will define). These "remixes" illustrate the importance of the theory-practice cycle for progress, and offer tips for breaking the rules.},

Thus we are presenting an explorative interactive technology installation as part of the campaign, to provoke and trigger transformation while at the same time collecting essential data to inform the next steps of the campaign. While mixing research and intervention in the real life ensures high impact, yet it is open for criticism on a methodological and ethical level.},

We also see how the inside knowledge of being a practitioner researcher offers unique insights into rich data and how product orientation can expose gaps in research, surprisingly not so different from the way that teaching students does: with neither developers nor students can you hide fuzzy thinking behind long words.

We found the success of using interactive systems in theater to be based mainly on how interaction is conceptualized in reference to the script. Adaptions are done on both sides -- system and user need to "understand" each other, and the audience's perception is not necessarily characterized by recognizing interactivity per se but ra-ther by experiencing it in a theatre play as a whole.},

In particular, little literature has debated around the definition of appropriate design and research methods. To contribute to this debate, we present two case studies from our past research, on the design and evaluation of two FUBILEs. We use these studies to set the stage for a critical reflection on methodological pitfalls and weaknesses of the approach we undertook at that moment. This post-mortem reflection offers a critical standpoint to discuss on appropriate design and research methods for FUBILEs. Finally, we discuss design guidelines and paths for research.},

While there is a general sentiment that a more mature UX practice leads to organizational success, there is surprisingly little data about what constitutes UX maturity. This case study describes the first steps into an empirically derived maturity model and describes what we've learned from interviewing seasoned UX professionals and surveying practitioners from dozens of organizations. Preliminary results indicate that our empirically-based approach is understandable and flexible enough to be applied across a broad range of organizations and industries. Ultimately, our objective is to move the practice of assessing UX maturity from snake-oil to science. To do so, we aim to identify the variables that differentiate immature from mature UX practices and establish a link between UX maturity and company success.},

abstract = {In the product design process, it is often desirable to quickly obtain information about current user behaviors for topics that cannot be obtained through existing data or instrumentation. Perhaps we would like to understand the use of products we do not have access to or perhaps the action we would like to know about (such as using a coupon) is an action taken outside of a system that can be instrumented. Traditionally, large market research surveys would be conducted to answer these questions, but often designers need answers much faster. We present a study investigating the reliability of fast survey platforms such as Amazon Mechanical Turk and Survey Monkey as compared to larger market research studies for technology behavior research and show that results can be obtained in hours for much smaller costs with accuracy within 10% of traditional larger surveys. This demonstrates that we can rely more heavily on these platforms in the product design process and provide much faster planning iterations that are informed by actual usage data.},

In this study, we investigate the validity of such an approach for a particular case with car design evaluation. We compare users' perceptual responses for photos and real cars. In particular, we employ both explicit and implicit response channels, i.e., subjective rating, electroencephalography (EEG), and visual attention. The results show that, although largely similar perceptual responses are obtained in the two cases, significant differences are also observed, which need to be considered in evaluation of product design and user experience.},

Each application satisfies different user needs and hence demands for a different evaluation criteria. The aim of this study was to devise a user centered design framework to objectively evaluate and enhance user experience of mobile applications. Using the Empathizing-Systemizing theory, we conducted a user study to understand the cognitive needs of users in user-technology interactions of mobile applications. We found out that even though user preferences are varied and contextual, the user experience is optimum when applications are designed for inclusivity of both the "Empathizing (E)" and "Systemizing (S)" aspects. We have assessed the same for a few popular reminder applications on mobile as a use case to explain and validate our proposed framework. This study also provides insights into the process of evolving such a framework.},

abstract = {Over several years, our team has been involved in participatory design of novel future technologies with people in resource-constrained contexts in India and Kenya. A key motivator is to include these groups, who often have lower literacy, infrequent access to data connections, low exposure to technology, and other constraints, in the process of shaping and appropriating devices and services. This is in contrast to what typically happens in such regions, where technologies from traditional markets (e.g., in USA and Europe) "trickle down" after several years. In this case study, we explore the potential and barriers of one such new platform - the Physical Web In resource-constrained contexts in Mumbai and Nairobi. The Physical Web is an open source Bluetooth-based beacon system, which aims to provide quick and seamless interaction with physical objects over a web platform. Our goal is to understand how this emerging technology might provide local small enterprise traders in these regions with the facility to quickly and easily create and distribute a simple online presence via a local broadcasting medium. In this case study we discuss the design rationale for the approach in terms of how it might address issues around users' resource constraints, and present initial findings from deployments in the two locations.},

In short, for a set of tools that are critical to most internet companies, advertising tools have received little attention in UX research literature. This case study explores the processes, challenges, and tactics employed by UX researchers in advertising products. It provides tactics to conduct effective UX research in this arena.

A major part of what we have heard from participants in weekly usability studies is that their primary use of email -- not limited to Yahoo Mail -- is for receiving coupons and deals; yet, this topic is underexplored in the HCI literature, with few clear implications for design. To understand how people save, share, or use promotional email, as well as how they deal with the overload of these emails, we analyzed quantitative data from a large marketing study and an online survey, and conducted a two-week diary study to qualitatively understand coupon use. We found that 92% of American adults have received a promotional email and 65% have used one in a 2-week period. We explore the flow of a digital coupon in a user's life and conclude with implications for the design of new digital coupon systems and email clients.},

However, it is not easy for small ride-sharing startups, which typically has limited budget and manpower, to boost the service in the early stages. In this paper, we present our on-demand service whose main operation is based on a mobile application for taxi-sharing which utilizes the users' trust network. We also explain in detail the three phased approaches we have applied in an attempt to increase the matching rate among the users. A high matching rate is crucial for survival of a ride-sharing service, because once a service fails to match customers in real-time, the retention rate falls sharply. Next, we analyze and interpret the implication of committing to each approach. Additionally, we also introduce one last method, which employs an AI agent to guarantee match making among users at all times by overcoming the time-spatial constraints.},

abstract = {HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the CHI community (and the HCI field at large) has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the unexpected variations in error rates when processing speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. As such, the development of interactive speech-based systems is mostly driven by engineering efforts to improve such systems with respect to largely arbitrary performance metrics. Such developments have often been void of any user-centered design principles or consideration for usability or usefulness. The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that HCI researchers and practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.},

abstract = {From Ergonomics to Embodied interaction, the body is a fundamental locus of interaction in HCI research and design. In HCI the body and all its awesome complexity, however, is largely treated as a black box where we focus on designing around the constraints of its input and output. If we understand, for instance, how sleep affects ability to see errors, or how stress suppresses creativity or affects recall, or how social interaction with movement enhances insight, we can immediately begin to explore new kinds of design challenges to help us perform better from general to specific contexts: how would we design a tool that identifies sleep and stress patterns to prompt counter-intuitive but beneficial increase of social engagement prior to a critical deadline, for instance? In this course we explore how, by cracking the lid of the body black box via three accessible heuristics, we can address these new kinds of questions to enable us to innovate better designs for human performance and enhanced quality of life for all.},

abstract = {Ever wanted to be a better moderator? Feel like you're stuck in a rut with your current interviewing approach? Go beyond the basics of user interviews with personalized coaching that will enable you to create an individual action plan detailing your strengths, bad habits, and missed opportunities where you might be 'leaving data on the table.' There are numerous tips and tricks for managing difficult participants and troubleshooting technology. This is not that class. Instead, you will learn by doing and observing: (1) watching video of yourself moderating, (2) watching video of fellow researchers moderating and providing feedback to them, and (3) receiving individualized feedback from the facilitators. This workshop draws on the concept of Kaizen, as famously employed by the Toyota Production System, to improve performance through participatory group oversight. Ultimately, our aim is to create a safe, supportive environment that allows us to turn the analytical lens on ourselves as researchers - working together to investigate patterns in our existing practice. You supply a non-confidential video of yourself moderating. We'll take care of the rest. Clips may be generated during a short study session for a nonprofit website (organized by the facilitators) or taken from an existing video from one of your recent studies. There is no need to select examples of your best or worst work. You'll gain the most from reviewing your standard practices. Course facilitators are seasoned User Experience Researchers with past or current Google affiliations and include: Elizabeth Elliott Baylor, Marianne Berkovich, Martin Ortlieb, Beverly Freeman, Dawn Shaikh, Utkarsh Seth.},

First we observe that interaction is not the same as collaboration. Collaboration involves mutual goal understanding, preemptive task co-management and shared progress tracking. Second, that much of the on-going discourse around human-agent interaction implies that agents can be trusted, collaborative partners. Our position is that while virtual and embodied agents have the potential to be work partners, for this goal to be achieved we need to better understand what partnership in collaboration involves. In this panel we ask: Can this potential for trusted collaboration be realized? If so, what will it take? This panel will bring together HCI experts who work on collaboration, virtual agent design and human-robot-interaction. Panelists will engage the audience through discussion of their shared and diverging visions, and through suggestions for opportunities and challenges for the future of human-agent collaboration.},

Open dilemmas include issues such as the shifting meaning of informed consent, anonymisation or privacy in an always-online world. The SIGCHI Ethics Committee has been established to look into the processes, practices and structures at SIGCHI venues to deal with such ethical dilemmas and how they can be addressed in a transparent, consistent and open way.

abstract = {Recent policy developments in both the USA and elsewhere have sparked significant concern within the HCI research community. Predominantly, increasing isolationism can have a serious impact on collaboration, community engagement and wellness, and knowledge sharing. Policy shifts also have the potential to affect freedom of scientific inquiry, the free flow of information, and funding for computing research. Moreover, what can SIGCHI as an organization do to best support the community under current conditions? In this panel discussion, designed to be heavily participatory, we will take on these issues and discuss what we can do to support our strong, diverse community of researchers.},

However, the best digital health interventions are not simply the result of the 'application' of HCI to the domain of healthcare, but emerge when researchers from both camps seek to overcome differences in disciplinary practices, traditions, and values in order to collaborate more effectively and productively. We propose a special interest group (SIG) to include interdisciplinary researchers (i.e., participants active in both communities) as well as researchers from either discipline, but with interests in the other field.},

The games for good movement tackles social problems and offers a potentially engaging intervention approach. Working with the research data on the lives and success factors of women in technology companies, the organizers and a group of students are building a set of games to raise awareness and change behavior in a fun way.

abstract = {Wayfinding is a participatory installation that serves as a poetic reference to the design concept that describes the ways in which people navigate from place to place. The installation is comprised of a set of four electromechanical sculptures that operate in subsequent harmony and discord based on participant and environmental impulses. Each sculpture, positioned at a cardinal direction, operates independently by way of a motor that strikes tensed bungee cables containing a glass orb with a glass marble. In effect, both movement and sound ensue and the sequence and speed at which the motors fire is continuously manipulated by proximity sensors that poll the environment and mine through data collected throughout the installation's exhibition history. Through the installation's symbolic embodiment of a compass, the work seeks to reflect on the socio-technological forces that guide our direction in life.},

Revealing the process of writing a poem to the audience, the writer's emotional states emerge through keystrokes and letters that are alive. Inspired by the tradition of live coding, the text written in live writing performance utilizes the expressivity of the language we speak and the target object that the code influences will be the minds of the audience. In this sense, we consider live writing to be a metaphorical form of live coding the audience's mind.},

However, some existing methods require the use of visible markers, which impairs the visual experience, while others require specially modified projectors.. To solve these problems, we propose a novel method that employs imperceptible color vibration to embed pixel-by-pixel data into images on an ordinary LCD display; this is achieved by fixing the luminance and vibrating only the chromaticity of the color of each pixel. We show that five different data values can be embedded and detected with adequate responsiveness for human-computer interaction (HCI). It is expected that our method will be applied to wearable tactile displays, robot controls, and other similar technologies.},

The device can recognize the general taxonomy, printed text, and dominant colors of an object. Moreover, FReAD recognizes hand gestures, allowing objects to be classified automatically as soon as they are grasped. This information is then voiced to the user via a Bluetooth headset. FReAD employs a "belt-style" form factor that allows for hands-free interaction with objects and an unobstructed view of the user's frontal zone, while still encouraging seamless integration within the user's daily life.},

The newer generation of beacons, e.g. Estimote Stickers with their small size, long battery life, and low cost make it easier to enhance portable objects with smart capabilities, broadcasting data about environment, location, motion, and interaction with other Bluetooth devices. In the first trials of our installation on James Joyce's Ulysses and proxemic surveillance, we chose to avoid interaction through mobile devices, instead making everyday portable objects (and the people who carry them) into 'nearables'. This enabled the tracking of human-human, as opposed to human-object, proxemics. We discuss the advantages and limitations of using small adhesive beacons to capture human-human proxemic data, and effective ways of visualizing these patterns.},

However, recent research has shown potential for text input with the use of word gesture keyboards (WGK), where these forms of interactions require the input system to identify when the gesture has started and when it has stopped. Previous research has had success where the same hand moved the cursor, and performed the activation gesture. In this paper we introduce bimanual interaction for gestural interaction to perform text input with WGK, where one hand moves the cursor while the other hand performs the activation. In our user studies, the bimanual method demonstrated significantly higher results than the state-of-the-art single handed method. We achieved 16 words per minute; about 39% higher than the benchmark, and with significantly lower error rates.},

Here, we explore the combination of two technologies for realizing natural targeted communication with potential applications in coordination of tasks or private conversations. For detecting words, we measure the bioelectric signals produced by facial muscles during speech. An electromyographic system composed of 4 surface electrodes had an accuracy of 80% when discriminating between 10 words. More importantly, the system was equally effective in discriminating spoken and silently mouthed words. For transferring the words, we used the sound-through-ultrasound phenomenon to generate audible sound within a narrow beam. We built a phased array of ultrasonic emitters, capable of emitting sound that can be steered electronically without physically moving the array. Two prototypes that combine detection and transfer of words are presented and their limitations analysed.},

abstract = {Rosacea is a chronic skin condition with multiple signs and symptoms, but typically associated with reddening of the face. Sufferers usually want to avoid and reduce flare-ups of the condition, and so will try to identify and limit possible triggers. In this paper we report an investigation into technology for managing rosacea, particularly for identifying and tracking triggers. Our study has included: a survey of the existing technology; a survey of the attitudes and opinions of people with rosacea on technology; and finally, the production and evaluation of a prototype for identifying triggers. This work is investigatory and so our formative evaluation and discussion focus on understanding the problem space and establishing directions for future development work.},

abstract = {In culture analytics, it is important to ask fundamental questions that address salient characteristics of collective human behavior. This paper explores how analyzing cooking recipes in aggregate and at scale identifies these characteristics in the cooking culture, and answer fundamental questions like 'what makes a chocolate chip cookie a chocolate chip cookie?'. Aspiring cooks, professional chefs and cooking hobbyists share their recipes online resulting in thousands of different procedural instructions towards a shared goal. However, existing approaches focus merely on analysis at the ingredient level, for example, extracting ingredient information from individual recipes. We introduce RecipeScape, a prototype interface which supports visually querying, browsing and comparing cooking recipes at scale. We also present the underlying computational pipeline of RecipeScape that scrapes recipes online, extracts their ingredient and instruction information, constructs a graphical representation, and computes similarity between pairs of recipes.},

GaPBIT leveraged game design patterns to streamline designer-therapist collaboration when ideating games for brain injury therapy. In user studies, professional game designers expressed enthusiasm about the patterns and the GaPBIT prototype, indicating that conceptual and information tools like GaPBIT would be well received by design practitioners and help them in their work. We argue that tools like GaPBIT are promising facilitators for promoting design of games for health and could potentially be used for educating designers interested in serious games.},

Images could constitute an important part of users' decision-making process but users reach them indirectly. Although recently researchers proposed several image-based search interfaces, how they can effectively arrange huge number of images in a scalable manner is still not clear. To address this, we introduce PicNav, an image-driven navigation system that automatically arranges photos according to their semantic similarity. PicNav is built on deep neural networks learned from the Yelp food dataset and enables effective zoom-in/out features. We conducted interviews with ten users to qualitatively assess the system's usability. The users identified a number of advantages of PicNav, providing insights into the general use of imagery in search-and-discovery services.},

abstract = {Programming environments for end-user personalization in the Internet of Things (IoT) are becoming increasingly common. They allow users to define simple IoT applications, i.e., connections between different IoT devices and services. Unfortunately, the adopted representation models are highly technology-dependent, e.g., they often categorize devices and services by manufacturer or brand. Such an approach is not suitable to face the expected growth of the IoT, nor it allows to adapt to yet undiscovered IoT services. In this paper, we present a generic and technology-independent representation for IoT end-user programming environments. The aim of this ``high-level' representation is to allow end-users to create abstract IoT applications that adapt to different contextual situations. We preliminary evaluated the representation by comparing it with the one used by existing programming environments in a user study with 10 participants. Results show that the representation is understandable, and it allows users to create IoT applications more correctly and quickly.},

abstract = {Facebook uses algorithmic curation---automated selection and ranking of content---to present a personalized News Feed to each user for consumption. However, the News Feed user interface provides little information to help users understand how the ranking algorithm works. We analyzed the company's "News Feed FYI' blog series to better understand the degree to which Facebook employs "how'and "why' explanations of its News Feed algorithm. These types of explanations have been used in other recommendation and intelligent systems as a means of promoting user understanding and acceptance. Our findings show that the "News Feed" FYI' blog posts focus more on explanations that justify why the algorithm works the way it does, and less on explanations that describe how the system works. These findings suggest that the "News Feed" FYI' series would be more helpful for increasing users' confidence in the system, but not improving their trust in the system.},

In this paper, we explore a preference-based approach towards smart notification delivery. By considering existing in-the-wild studies that directly involve users, we defined a set of preferences to customize the notification delivery, and we built a mobile application for their set up. We evaluated the understandability of such preferences, and the acceptance of our preference-based approach in a user study with 10 participants. Preliminary results show that the preferences were easily understood, and that users are willing to set them up.},

We investigate the impact of one of the first placements of AV passenger transport on public roadways: the Sion "SmartShuttle". This late-breaking research presents preliminary results from interviews with local shopkeepers, residents, pedestrians and drivers to understand their attitudes and opinions of the shuttle. We also discuss video-based fieldwork that demonstrates how drivers negotiate next moves with one another through their windscreens using embodied signals such as gestures, lip-reading, and head nods to coordinate and manage a traffic situation. Finally, we consider the implications for how fully autonomous vehicles might be designed to take into account the subtle negotiations that road users engage in to coordinate with one another.},

Given the growing number of emojis, this can incur user frustration, and instead we propose Face2Emoji, where we use a user's facial emotional expression to filter out the relevant set of emoji by emotion category. To validate our method, we crowdsourced 15,155 emoji to emotion labels across 308 website visitors, and found that our 202 tested emojis can indeed be classified into seven basic (including Neutral) emotion categories. To recognize facial emotional expressions, we use deep convolutional neural networks, where early experiments show an overall accuracy of 65% on the FER-2013 dataset. We discuss our future research on Face2Emoji, addressing how to improve our model performance, what type of usability test to run with users, and what measures best capture the usefulness and playfulness of our system.},

Triagers must quickly assess a victim in less than 45 seconds and move on to the next. Information in near-realtime is desirable, but reporting the state of the process and localizing the victims for following paramedics takes too long. Research in practical emergency response and literature reveals that, although technically feasible electronic triage systems have been proposed, none of them is truly accepted by end users or applied in the field. This work analyzes approaches from literature as well as extensive fieldwork from a four-year research process in the scope of emergency management. The result is a first set of dimensions for a design space for e-triage systems that allows the categorization, comparison, assessment of approaches against the dimensions, as well as ground for new design ideas.},

In this paper, we empirically study the performance of mid-air finger motion and touch as input techniques for small target acquisition on smartwatches with 16 participants. Results show that mid-air finger motion can be as fast as touch but has significantly fewer errors. No statistically significant difference has been found in either mental or physical demand while using two techniques, but mid-air finger motion technique is perceived to have better performance with less frustration compared with touch.},

This paper introduces BrightBeat, a set of seamless visual and auditory interventions that look like respiratory biofeedback, rhythmically oscillating, but that are tuned to appear with a slower speed, with the aim of slowing a stressed computer user's breathing and, consequently, bringing a sense of focus and calmness. These interventions were designed to run easily on commonplace personal electronic devices and to not require any focused attention in order to be effective. We have run a randomized placebo-controlled trial and examined both objective and subjective measures of impact with N=32 users undergoing work tasks. BrightBeat significantly influenced slower breathing, had a lasting effect, improved self-reported calmness and focus, and was highly preferred for future use.},

We present SmartRSVP, an attentive speed-reading system to facilitate text reading on small screen wearable devices. SmartRSVP leverages camera-based visual attention tracking as a play/pause control channel, and uses implicit physiological signal sensing to adjust speed in real-time to make text reading via Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) more enjoyable and practical on smart watches. Through two pilot studies, we received positive feedback on the visual attention controlling feature and confirmed the feasibility of the speed adjusting feature of SmartRSVP.

As a preliminary work, we conducted an online survey on the Turkish Tennis Federation's website with 1567 participants. Later we conducted in-depth interviews with 20 professional and international tennis players to get a better understanding of their wishes. Our initial results suggest that with the increase of tennis playing frequency the wearable usage frequency increases, which has not been indicated by previous studies. However, the most striking outcome of the study is the tennis players' need for feedback regarding mental states, which should be considered for future wearables.},

abstract = {Reducing workload in a UI while still letting users feel in control is not trivial. This workload/control tradeoff is described in the literature and deserves attention in design practice. However, there is no evaluation framework for it supporting both explicit and implicit measurement, mainly because measuring sense of control implicitly is just difficult. A recently proposed implicit evaluation methodology - measuring sense of agency via interval estimation - seems promising and calls for further investigation. We studied its feasibility in a continuous control task - cinematographic camera motion - and compared a multi-touch software joystick to a mid-air gesture UI (N=8). Data was collected both explicitly and implicitly. Our results suggest that the mid-air gesture design does not increase the sense of agency. Both methodologies yielded similar results but the implicit one was more sensitive and the combination of both led to convincing overall results.},

It is unclear, however, what the impetus behind these motivations are and whether individuals are motivated to use PNAs for other reasons. To explore these questions, we analyzed a dataset of 14 active PNA users' semi-structured interviews and found that participants' first experiences using PNAs were associated with significant life events such as moving to a new area or ending a relationship. We conducted an online survey (N=142) to explore these findings further and investigate whether they generalized across a broader set of active PNA users. We confirm our past findings and contribute ways in which future technologies can detect specific life changes to increase the opportunities for individuals to benefit from PNAs.},

We explore whether people have different interpretations of animated GIFs, how those interpretations differ, and what factors impact the degree of difference. Through an online survey, we solicited people's interpretations of a sample of GIFs, and analyzed the variance in sentiment based on the emotions participants used to describe GIFs. We find diverse interpretations of GIFs, and that duration of GIFs has a significant impact on interpretation. Positive GIFs also have more variance in interpretation than negative GIFs. Overall, we show that there is potential for miscommunication in animated GIFs, and animated GIFs may be a more nuanced form of nonverbal communication than emoticons and emoji.},

Potentially this makes it possible for devices to adapt their settings to a changing context, inferred from user interactions. In a pilot study we enabled hearing instrument users to remotely enhance auditory focus and attenuate background noise to improve speech intelligibility. N=5, participants changed program settings and adjusted volume on their hearing instruments using their smartphones. We found that individual behavioral patterns affected the usage of the devices. A significant difference between program usage, and weekdays versus weekends, were found. Users not only changed programs to modify aspects of directionality and noise reduction, but also continuously adjusted the volume. Rethinking hearing instruments as devices that adaptively learn behavioral patterns based on user interaction, might provide a degree of personalization that has not been feasible due to lack of audiological resources.},

To evaluate the UI concepts, an in-lab experiment was conducted with 57 participants in a semi-naturalistic driving environment. Implications for interface design of visual assistance and its impact on brake reaction time, mental workload and perceived usefulness are discussed.},

For this, we designated the mobile SNS users from those in the 10s to 60s, and gave directions to the subjects to use the APP service in person. As a result, the participants could express the feelings to the family they normally could not, with relative ease and freedom, and showed the most active attitude toward the conversation between family members.},

This data, however, has also been the source of pervasive privacy concerns. In this paper we probed the sources of the underlying privacy concerns. Through user studies, we investigated the level of concern with URL collection compared to higher-level profiling into interest or preference categories. Consistent with intuition and industry practice, our results indicate that most users do indeed find URLs much more sensitive than the profiles built from them. Interestingly, however, we found that a great challenge in this area is comprehension of what categorization actually means, which is essential to properly make privacy decisions when services collect categories rather than URLs. This paper also investigated whether certain categories may also be a source of privacy concern. We tested sensitivity of a range of categories. Most categories were considered sensitive by relatively few users, and the categories deemed sensitive followed a power-law distribution.},

In our approach, users' personality traits are inferred from their written texts, and are correlated to a canonical set of consumption preferences. The consumption preferences are then mapped to product descriptions based on their semantic similarity.

Researchers worked to thus investigate the underlying socioemotional effects of technology during the aging process. Initial results suggest research opportunities in regards to HCI's awareness of and potential influence upon personal perception of 'time'. Beginning with a sample of older adults previously interested in technical innovation, we point to (1) the processes behind intention to learn about novel technologies and (2) personal perception of "time" or longevity coinciding with said investment. We pose questions and aim to inspire discussion and future investigations into time as a foundation for self-reflection and perception.},

abstract = {The Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) sensor has been becoming increasingly common in devices such as smart phones and smart watches. These devices often use BVP to monitor the heart rate of an individual. There has been a large amount of research linking the mental and emotional changes with the physiological changes. The BVP sensor measures one of these physiological changes known as Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV is known to be closely related to Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) which can be used as a measurement to quantify the activity of the parasympathetic activity. However, the BVP sensor is highly susceptible to noise and therefore BVP signals often contain a large number of artefacts which make it difficult to extract meaningful features from the BVP signals. This paper proposes a new algorithm to filter artefacts from BVP signals. The algorithm is comprised of two stages. The first stage is to detect the corrupt signal using a Short Term Fourier Transform (STFT). The second stage uses Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) to approximate the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the BVP signal. The algorithm has shown to be effective in removing artefacts which disrupt the signal for a short period of time. This algorithm provides the capability for BVP signals to be analysed for frequency based features in HRV which traditionally could be done from the cleaner signals from electrocardiogram (ECG) in medical applications.},

Microwaves are non-ionizing and at controlled levels do not pose a danger. A wave that is capable of passing through materials and image humans could have useful applications in human-computer-interaction. However, only recently the full potential of microwaves for interactive devices has begun to be explored. Here, we present a scalable, low-cost system using an array of off-the-shelf microwave Doppler sensors and explore its potential for tabletop interactions. The arrays are installed beneath a desk, making it an ubiquitous device that enables a wide range of interactions such as 3D hand tracking, gesture recognition and different forms of tangible interaction. Given the low cost and availability of these sensors, we expect that this work will stimulate future interactive devices that employ microwave sensors.},

However, sites with a "liking" feature, such as Facebook, also permit users to edit or change the content of the original post after it has been published and "liked" by other users. This can be problematic if a transparent edit history is not (easily) available. In this paper, we report an online survey that assessed how individuals interpret what has changed in such a case. We tested four interface designs to see whether making the evolution of "likes" and edited comments more explicit improved users' understanding of what had happened. We found, that in contrast to what is displayed in current interface implementations, alternate interface designs make clearer how "likes" are associated with posts that changed over time. These have the potential to help users understand what has been changed in the post more easily.},

However, there has been relatively limited work to assess 1) the efficacy of such games with respect to critical educational factors such as enjoyment and programming self-beliefs; and 2) whether there are advantages to alternative, physically embodied design approaches (e.g., tangibles as input). To better explore the benefits of a tangible approach, we built and tested two versions of an educational programming game that were identical in design except for the form of interaction (tangible programming blocks vs. mouse input). After testing 34 participants, results showed that while both game versions were successful at improving programming self-beliefs, the tangible version corresponded to higher self-reports of player enjoyment. Overall, this paper presents a comparison between the efficacy of tangible and mouse design approaches for improving key learning factors in educational programming games.},

Everyone, one way or another, sometimes fails to effectively regulate their emotions, making this a challenging problem with broad potential impact. In our research, we are exploring three ways in which haptics-enabled wearables can facilitate effective emotion regulation, formulated based on Gross's model of emotion regulation. We hypothesize that an individual-level biofeedback haptic could foster healthier and more effective patterns of emotion regulation. We have designed and implemented HapLand, a scalable, robust biofeedback haptic system testbed to facilitate research-based haptics-enabled wearables design for the purpose of emotion regulation. In this paper, we give an overview of HapLand and our plans for using HapLand for future research.},

This system aims to offer the following functionalities: (1) gives children the opportunity to practice social skills in a safe environment, under various contexts. (2) changes the dynamics of the interactions based on the child's affective states. (3) provides visual support for children to teach them different social skills and facilitate their learning. (4) reduces the cognitive load on the interactor (a trained human orchestrating the avatars' behaviors) by providing real-time feedback about a child's affective states and suggesting appropriate visual supports using a recommendation system.},

abstract = {Modern information workers typically juggle multiple tasks at the same time and manage these multiple task threads or working contexts through either physical or digital artifacts. These artifacts help the worker to keep track of the identity and state of the tasks. This practice of using artifacts in this manner isn't as well supported for digital representations of work contexts. This paper details work on a prototype system, "Context Manager", that creates explicit representations of work contexts and their related documents and links them to physical RFID-infused artifacts. An evaluative study of the system was conducted and its findings are analyzed in accordance with grounded theory.},

However, it is challenging to use existing commercial video chat systems (e.g., Skype, FaceTime) to prototype new types of futuristic experiences. Existing video communication tools are limited in granting designers access to augment video frames and control them based on contextual information. Creating video communication systems from scratch can be time intensive even with new APIs (e.g., WebRTC).

abstract = {With the increasing popularity of mobile video games, game designers and developers are starting to integrate geolocation information into such games. Although popular location-based games (LBGs) such as Ingress and Pok\'{e}mon Go have millions of users, research still needs to be carried out to fully understand the ways in which such games impact upon a player's interaction with other players and their physical surroundings. Consequently, there is limited knowledge on how user behavior can be addressed and drawn upon as a design resource to further engage and motivate players to play. To further understand this, we developed a LBG called CityConqueror and have conducted an in 'the wild' study. This initial study starts to unpack the ways that human territoriality can be expressed in LBGs to facilitate player motivation, engagement and can support the integration of the game in the player's daily life. Based on our findings we propose a series of design implications for LBGs. The primary purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the importance of territoriality and the way that this can be drawn upon as a resource for design.},

We present an intelligent gaze gesture-based system that authenticates users from their unique gaze patterns onto moving geometric shapes. The system authenticates the user by comparing their scan-path with each shapes' paths and recognizing the closest path. In a study with 15 users, authentication accuracy was found to be 99% with true calibration and 96% with disturbed calibration. Also, our system is 40% less susceptible and nearly nine times more time-consuming to video analysis attacks compared to a gaze- and PIN-based authentication system.},

However, state-of-the-art elicitation methods of human cognitive strategies require from researchers to apply explicit, in-lab, and time-consuming "paper-and-pencil" techniques, compromising real-time integration of human cognitive strategies in interactive system design. Aiming to elaborate an implicit elicitation framework of human cognitive strategies, this paper reports on an in-lab eye-tracking study, which embraced sixty seven participants, who performed a credible "paper-and-pencil" cognitive strategy elicitation technique. Eye tracking analysis based on gaze transition entropies revealed quantitative differences on visual search patterns among individuals within visual pattern recognition tasks of varying complexity. Results of this study could drive the development of an implicit elicitation framework of human cognitive strategies.},

All was developed and evaluated with 20 surgeons. The results show that our techniques can be used with minimal learning time and no significant differences regarding completion time and usability compared to the control condition relying on verbal instruction of an assistant. Furthermore, IVOR as a tool was well received by the surgeons, although they had no prior experience with virtual reality. This confirms IVOR is an effective tool for user-centered design and evaluation, providing a portable, yet realistic substitution for a real OR for early evaluations.},

The use of auditory alerts and warnings has the potential to alleviate drivers' workload, increase drivers' situation awareness, and facilitate efficient and safe driving. The present study assessed the ability of individuals to react to auditory warnings. The warnings took the form of text-to-speech (TTS), spearcons at two levels of linear compression, and auditory icons. To assess usability, the NASA Task Load Index and an annoyance question were used. Participants pressed a space bar when they recognized a warning, and then identified auditory warnings by selecting a picture corresponding to the meaning of the warning. The results showed that participants responded to the fastest spearcon warnings more quickly compared to TTS and auditory icons. Responses to auditory icons were slowest compared to all other auditory types. Importantly, responses to spearcon warnings were no less accurate in comparison to TTS warnings.},

However, little work has studied multitasking motion video games which can be more directly beneficial for overall wellbeing. This project investigates the efficacy of multitasking motion video games for the cognitive enhancement of the elderly. As a response to this situation, we developed a custom-made game called Safari Move. Here we report the initial step towards our goal in which we studied whether or not elderly people enjoy playing our game. Two important game elements were studied - skill balancing methods and controller types. Our results demonstrate that our participants enjoyed playing our game, and that they prefer manual over dynamic difficulty adjustment, and Microsoft Kinect over Gamepad. Future work will use neuroimaging and cognitive assessment tools to investigate the effectiveness of Safari Move to enhance cognitive function.},

Further, more and more people use tablets in their everyday work for remote control, observing diagrams, performing web analytics, etc. However, the full potential of the tablet usage is not tapped yet; built-in sensors like accelerometer or gyroscope offer a wide range of interaction capabilities, which are not fully used. In this paper, we introduce Waggle -- a novel concept for orientation-based two-handed touch-less interaction on mobile devices through smart tilting and turning. Future design decisions can be founded on two parameters (movement angles and discretization), which are examined in two pilot studies. The first pilot study evaluates the maximum angle for basic rotation axis. The second pilot study tackles the discretization of tilt and turn angles. Both pilot studies are conducted and used to gain the optimal configuration for the two-handed Waggle interaction.},

In a systematic audit of the top 100 web sites in Germany, we explore if diversity in current real-world password policies prevents password reuse. We found that this is not the case: we are the first to show that a single password could hypothetically fulfill 99% of the policies under consideration. This is especially problematic because password reuse exposes users to similar risks as weak passwords. We thus propose a new approach for policies that focuses on password reuse and respects other websites to determine if a password should be accepted. This re-design takes current user behavior into account and potentially boosts the usability and security of password-based authentication.},

The main focus of the study was to identify and assemble bones in the live-animal orientation, using real thoracic limb bones in a bone box and digital pelvic limb bones in the Anatomy Builder VR. Eleven college students participated in the study. The pilot study showed that participants most enjoyed interacting with anatomical contents within the VR program. Participants spent less time assembling bones in the VR, and instead spent a longer time tuning the orientation of each VR bone in the 3D space. This study showed how a constructivist method could support anatomy education while using virtual reality technology in an active and experiential way.},

During the experiment, subjects viewed some funny movies while wearing Laugh Log. We analyzed logged data and observed features of pressure change when subjects laughed. Although further experiments are required, the results suggest that it is possible to detect laughter using Laugh Log.},

In this work, we present a prototype called "PlayBetter", an application that can help childcare bystander parents easily play with their baby. Based on the results of the preliminary study, two modes were designed to motivate parents to play with their baby, and to support their efforts to do so: (1) baby play supporter; and (2) motivational message notification.

Regular formats like neighborhood meetings, which are used as spaces for participatory design, are only attended by a certain type of elderly people. Hence, we present our ongoing work of creating empirical life situation types and selecting corresponding representatives. Our approach combines methods from social science, requirements and usability engineering to especially include groups who are rather difficult to integrate into open participation formats increasing representativeness in the participatory design process.},

SenseBelt enables proxemic interactions between people and their personal devices. SenseBelt also supports cross-device interaction between personal devices and stationary devices, such as public displays.

In this work, we explore four different designs, i.e., graphical, illustrative, artistic and ambient representations, by visualizing physiological data in individual settings. Following the Research through Design model, we compare these four designs in terms of their abilities to facilitate biofeedback interpretation through a within-subject controlled experiment with 24 participants. The results suggest that users' visual perception is affected by different design styles.},

abstract = {We present BaroTouch, a technique that leverages a waterproof mobile device's built-in barometer to measure the touch force. When an airtight waterproof device is touched, the distorted surface changes the air pressure inside that device and thus changes the built-in barometer value. Although this change varies under different airtightness conditions, our technique can measure the touch force independent of the airtightness conditions. To investigate BaroTouch's characteristics, we conducted three experiments. First, since the change in the barometer value varies under different airtightness conditions, we evaluated BaroTouch's characteristics under two levels of airtightness conditions. Second, we investigated the relationship between the sensor value and the touch positions or forces and found that the touch screen increased approximately in a linear manner. Last, in a controlled user study with 10 participants, the participants could exert three levels of touch force with an accuracy of over 92.2% accuracy using BaroTouch.},

Wearables like smart textile and data gloves can provide hand gesture recognition to potentially replace, augment or improve existing input methods. Although recent bikes provide advanced functions with electro mechanical components, the input metaphor still relies on mechanical switches or levers. In this paper, we investigate the acceptance and performance of using hand gesture during cycling. Through an observational study with 16 users, we devised a taxonomy of hand gestures. Users prefer subtle micro hand gestures to ensure safe cycling while maintaining a flexible controllability. We also implemented a wearable prototype that recognizes these gestures. In our evaluation, the prototype shows an average of 92% accuracy while showing similar response time to existing mechanical inputs.},

Allowing in-place interaction, it reduces hand movements and avoids cluttering the interface with menus and palettes.

abstract = {Insufficient input modality on touchscreens causes icons, toolbars and mode switching steps required to perform different functions. Although various methods are proposed to increase touchscreen input modality, touch gestures (e.g., swipe), usually used in touch input, are not provided in previous methods (e.g., Force Touch on iPhone 6s). This still restricts the input modality on touchscreens. Hence, we propose SegTouch to enhance touch input while providing touch gestures. SegTouch uses thumb-to-index-finger gestures, i.e., the thumb slides on the index finger, to define various touch purposes. Based on a pilot study, the middle and base segments on the index finger are suitable input areas for SegTouch. To observe how users leverage the proprioception and natural haptic feedback from index finger landmarks to perform SegTouch, different layouts on the index finger segments were examined in the eyes-free. Including the normal touch without thumb-to-index-finger gesture, SegTouch provides 9 input modality and touch gestures on the screen, so novel applications are enabled.},

Existing situated learning platforms limit the learner and implicitly enforce the designer's intent by hard-coding content and predetermining what elements in the environment are actionable. In this paper, we define the framework of Serendipitous Learning in Mixed Reality as situated, incidental learning that occurs naturally in the user's environment and stems from the learner's curiosity. This framework is explored within the context of second language acquisition. We present WordSense, a Mixed Reality platform that recognizes objects in the learner's vicinity and embeds holographic content that identifies the corresponding word, provides sentence and definition cues for practice, and displays dynamic audiovisual content that shows example usage. By employing markerless tracking and dynamically linked content, WordSense enables serendipitous language learning in the wild.},

In motion matching systems, targets move continuously in a singular and pre-defined path -- users interact with these by performing a synchronous bodily movement that matches the movement of one of the targets. Unlike previous work which tracks user input through optical systems, WaveTrace is arguably the first motion matching technique to rely on motion data from inertial measurement units readily available in many wrist-worn wearable devices such as smart watches. To evaluate the technique, we conducted a user study in which we varied: hand; degrees of visual angle; target speed; and number of concurrent targets. Preliminary results indicate that the technique supports up to eight concurrent targets; and that participants could select targets moving at speeds between 180 and 270/s (mean acquisition time of 2237ms, and average success rate of 91%).},

To begin answering this question empirically, we conduct a user study, in which 21 participants are each given 3 information seeking tasks to solve using a text-based chat interface. To complete each task, participants conversed with three conversational agents: an existing commercial system, a human expert, and a perceived experimental automatic system, backed by a human 'wizard' behind the curtain. The observations and insights of our study help us understand the aspirations of users and the limitations of the current conversational agents -- and to sharpen a frontier of work required to improve conversational assistants for search scenarios.},

Specifically, we explored 1) why MTurk workers self-organize into online communities (Turker communities), and 2) how the workers' self-organization impacts the requesters and 3) the workers. In the first study, we conducted a field experiment by advertising the same survey tasks on both MTurk and on Turker communities. In the second study, we interviewed two founders of the Turker communities. The results suggest that 1) workers' main motivation to participate in communities is to "find good HITs". 2) For requesters, there is no indication of differences in work quality between the tasks posted on MTurk and the ones advertised on Turker communities. 3) For workers, participation in Turker communities is associated with higher income, controlled for working hours. We also learned from the interviews about why founders built the communities and their future plans.},

abstract = {Low-cost 3D printing methods have revolutionized DIY fabrication, and it is only a matter of time before high-fidelity color 3D printing technologies reach the average consumer market. In parallel to this trajectory, our paper describes an ultra low-cost, DIY method for augmenting 3D objects with surface detail. We developed a software tool that maps 2D images onto 3D surfaces and an easy workflow for layering the resulting, warped images onto 3D printed artifacts. We assessed our approach in a workshop where local makers created 3D-printed nested dolls overlaid with personally designed images. Our workshop demonstrates the feasibility of our ultra low-cost method for adding rich surface detail to 3D objects, and our ongoing work will streamline this process and support more complex shapes.},

Although recent years have seen the rise of social search systems as a promising alternative, their application for populations across the digital divide that are starved for information has been overlooked. Drawing on research on social search, information search, and information poverty, we identify three dimensions of information poverty in web search, and hypothesize affordances of social search platforms that could address the details of each issue. Finally, we propose research questions and two associated studies to investigate these hypotheses.},

However, such cues often go unnoticed by users and, even when noticed, are ignored. Our aim is to investigate the potential for using other modalities to improve comprehension of, and adherence to, security warnings, starting with thermal feedback. Thermal stimulation has inherent links to emotion and danger, so may provide unique advantages over current visual cues. However, interpretation of feedback varies, so research is needed to measure associations. We used an online questionnaire (n=45) and lab study (n=12) to investigate whether people associate a particular temperature range with different states of web security. Our results indicate that people generally associate a cold temperature with a secure page and warm with an insecure page, findings we will take forward into future work on the effect of thermal feedback on security-related behaviour},

However, relatively little research has examined the surface texture of 3D models. To meet the increasing requirements of HCI researchers who are prototyping 3D forms with information on the surfaces to build multivariate interfaces, we present infoTexture, a novel rapid prototyping system that produces 3D objects both in a mesh structure and covered by a surface texture simultaneously. Based on mesh structure of 3D models, infoTexture supports a highly customizable software platform, which is applicable for seamlessly splitting freeform surface into planar pieces with a regular grid and serves as a guide for easy assembly. The key idea is to establish user interfaces on the surfaces of 3D model, which can be achieved by the programming shape of texture, the mapping pattern of texture and the interactive way with the texture.},

BVP signals were analyzed in order to establish relationships between BVP and cognitive load levels. A set of features (e.g. peak and max features) was found to be significantly distinctive across different cognitive load levels. The identified BVP features can be used to set up machine learning models for the automatic classification of CL levels in intelligent systems.},

Given recent success of actigraphy as a passive objective measure of the physical activity construct that relieves participants of the burden of biased self-report, researchers are aiming to find a passive objective measure of caloric intake to improve understanding of problematic eating behaviors in obese and non-obese participants. Passive sensing food intake systems have failed to go beyond the lab and into behavioral research in part due to low adherence to wearing passive monitoring systems. This paper presents preliminary results in obese and non-obese participants performing structured and unstructured eating experiments to understand wearable adherence as affected by: 1) perceived data privacy; 2) stigma of wearing devices; 3) comfort. Wearables examined include neck- and wrist-worn sensors, and video camera-based systems.},

A randomized crossover study was conducted in a pain clinic with 30 chronic pain patients. OR was found to be significantly more effective than both the Cardboard VR and the control condition. Nevertheless, the results of this study demonstrate that Mobile VR has potential to become an effective tool for managing chronic pain because it is comparatively more affordable than VR that is restricted to desktop computers, because it can be deployed in numerous contexts, and because of its ease of use.},

We conceptualized "Save the Kiwi", a personal mobile application that communicates food safety information to encourage better food management, primarily in consuming purchased food products before they expire. Instead of simply relaying food information to its user, the application combines elements of behaviour change and persuasive design theories, and uses personified icons to notify its user about the expiry conditions of the associated food items. In an exploratory study, we found that the application has the potential to help users reduce their food waste. We discuss our results and recommend future work to create a viable solution to address food waste issues.},

Smart windows using see-through displays can be controlled on a per-pixel basis and thereby have the potential of fine-grained control. In this paper, we explore future interaction with such smart windows and conducted an elicitation study with 16 potential users. We provide both a mid-air gesture set and a smartphone interface to define regions for glare protection and brightness control. The study was conducted on a working 1.6 x 2.6 m smart window prototype with 130 x 144 individually switchable pixels.},

This allows the shoe to adapt its shape to different surfaces and users' foot morphology, or to alter users' gait. Inflashoe can not only change the overall inflation, but can also individually control the inflation of the back and front of the insole, creating different levels of elevation across the shoe when needed. In this paper we describe our prototype implementation and present the results of a preliminary evaluation study. We show that 85% of participants found Inflashoe to be equal to or more comfortable than their ordinary shoes, and that nearly 60% of them would prefer comfort to style. In the light of the results, we then discuss the potential applications of Inflashoe, in particular targeting specific kinds of pain or injury.},

In response to the current lack of culture, expression and emotions in VR avatars, we propose a two-fold solution. First, integration of bio-signal sensors into the HMD and techniques to detect aspects of the emotional state of the user. Second, the use of this data to generate expressive avatars which we refer to as Emotional Beasts. The creation of Emotional Beasts will allow us to experiment with the manipulation of a user's self-expression in VR space and as well as the perception of others in it, providing some valuable tools to evoke a desired emotional reaction. As this medium moves forward, this and other tools are what will help the field of virtual reality expand from a medium of surface-level experience to one of deep, emotionally compelling human-to-human connection.},

Through an online role-playing exercise, we explore attitudes to a range of services including home automation, Internet-of-Things and financial services. We find that individuals do not only consider the privacy-related attributes of applications, devices or services in the abstract. Rather, their decisions are heavily influenced by their pre-existing perceptions of, and relationships with, the companies behind such apps, devices and services. In particular, perceptions about a company's size, level of regulatory scrutiny, relationships with third parties, and pre-existing data exposure lead some users to choose an option which might otherwise appear worse from a privacy perspective. This finding suggests a need for tools that support users to incorporate these existing perceptions and relationships into their privacy-related decision making.},

Thus, many second-generation graphic based schemes are specifically designed to be resistant to OSA. This is often achieved by not having users select targets directly, but by adding cognitive operations to create seemingly random response patterns. This study takes the first step to directly compare three prototypical graphical password schemes to determine their relative resistance to OSAs employing a within-subjects design. We found that schemes requiring cognitive operations in response to target patterns were superior to direct selection of targets. Convex Hull Click was most secure, followed by What You See is What You Enter, while Use Your Illusion showed high vulnerability to OSA. In addition, we discuss a diversity of previous measurements, which are meant to examine security strength of new approaches. We highlight the need for standard OSA resistance measures depending on threat model needs.},

In this paper, we present the design and development of a prototype which collects and visualizes users' browsing histories over time. We explore the use of animation in the visualization and learn how users analyze and reflect on their browsing behaviors. Through a formative study using this prototype with 11 participants, we find that an animated visualization allows users to better reflect on their browsing habits and discover patterns of which they were previously unaware, especially when compared to the traditional history list view in most browsers. We discuss specific findings across six areas and their implications for future design and research.},

abstract = {Large-scale judgment analysis from multiple opinions is a challenging job in terms of time and cost involved. Over the last few years, with the popularity of crowd-powered models, the process of decision making is efficiently getting done by using the knowledge of crowd. In management science, a closely related class of problems, popularly known as group decision making, is often addressed. Unfortunately, majority of the algorithms developed for this purpose work for binary or multiple opinions without taking care of the semantic meaning of the options. Moreover, group decision considers a feedback set comprising range of continuous values unlike the judgment analysis problem. In this paper, we address this problem, hereafter termed as multi-opinion group decision making, with a probabilistic approach taking into account the annotator accuracy, annotator bias and question difficulty. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying this on a benchmark group decision making dataset.},

What is not captured is how the added benefits a system provides increases user retention. We hypothesize that both benefits and burdens of a mobile app predict usage. To show this, we design and validate a User Benefit Scale to complement the User Burden Scale, for the evaluation of benefits of mobile apps. Our scale consists of four constructs: if an app is 1) useful and informational, 2) enjoyable and enables pursuit of interests, 3) enables social interaction, and 4) has good usability and visual/ interaction design. We administered the benefit and burden scales to 347 participants. Our results suggest that benefit is more predictive of mobile app usage than burden, and our model of app usage includes constructs from both the benefit and burden scales.},

We built an Android prototype app to deliver feedback for bad driving maneuvers to both drivers themselves and to their corresponding supporters, and conducted a field study evaluation. The results from the survey showed that even though many of the drivers thought they drove safely before this experiment, they realized the app feedback on their driving behavior increased their knowledge of their own driving habits. Further, supporter feedback based on the app helped them drive safer. Based on the results, multiple design implications are drawn for improving driving habits through increasing self-awareness and providing support from loved ones.},

We implemented a habit formation technique to help people establish the daily weighing habit and tested the use of a WiFi-connected "smart" scale to help people with data reporting. We found that the smart weight scale did improve compliance compared to a manual scale, but that the habit manipulation ("implementation intention" plus coaching through text messaging) did not have an effect. Emergent factors, identified through coding of interviews, raised additional hypotheses about mechanisms involved in determining compliance with a daily weighing habit.},

In our methodology, participants play the role of attackers, viewing video-recorded footage of PIN and graphical password pattern authentication input with various camera angles, hand positions, phone sizes, and authentication length and strength. Based on the data collected and recording methodology developed, we aim to provide insight into the factors of mobile unlock authentication which best and least resist shoulder surfing attacks and examine scenarios where weaknesses may occur. The goal is to identify more effective guidance for mobile device users to avoid observational attacks. We also aim to advance the methodologies used to measure the shoulder surfing attack surfaces where baselines of comparisons to preexisting systems (e.g., PINs and patterns) are not standardized. Utilizing the methodology and recordings, other researchers may build upon this approach to analyze future systems and replicate our results.},

abstract = {This study takes an instructor-centric approach to Learning Analytic (LA) research by analyzing instructor use of the LA within an educational streaming video platform called TrACE. The goal of this study is to understand how instructors naturally interact with analytic dashboards through an empirical analysis. To accomplish this, data of 14 instructors from three institutions that used TrACE from Spring 2015 to Spring 2016 was collected. Data was analyzed to identify frequency of analytic visits, duration of analytic use, differences in analytic use, and differences in use between semesters. Instructors demonstrated preferences for some analytics over others, but the majority of teachers generate short sessions that may not allow for in-depth exploration in analytics. Finally, instructor activity is not always consistent between semesters. Focus groups were conducted to explore motivations behind these findings and future work includes developing LA that address discovered issues.},

abstract = {Challenge is arguably the most important experience that players seek in digital games. However, without a measure of how challenged players feel during the act of play, it is hard to design games that are neither too easy nor too hard and, therefore, truly enjoyable. Especially in industry, challenge is dominantly assessed by means of manual play testing in ad-hoc trials. The aim of this research is to create a more systematic, complete, and reliable instrument to evaluate the level of players' experienced challenge in games in the form of a questionnaire. This paper presents the key results from an extensive literature survey which will inform further development. We survey definitions of challenge, challenge types, and their relation to player experience based on the observations of game designers. We furthermore draw from empirical findings in a diverse range of fields such as game studies, human-computer interaction (HCI) and artificial intelligence (AI).},

abstract = {As robots become ubiquitous in our everyday environment, we start seeing them used in groups, rather than individually, to complete tasks. We present a study aimed to understand how different movement patterns impact humans' perceptions of groups of small tabletop robots. To understand this, we focus on the effects of changing the robots' speed, smoothness, and synchronization, on perceived valence, arousal, and dominance. We find that speed had the strongest correlation to these factors. With regard to human emotional response to the robots, we align with and build on prior work dealing with individual robots that correlates speed to valence and smoothness to arousal. In addition, participants noted an increase in positive affect in response to synchronized motion, though synchronization had no significant impact on measured perception. Based on our quantitative and qualitative results, we describe design implications for swarm robot motion.},

AAPIs increasingly engage in online forums to disclose their experiences and opinions, and in doing so, take part in lengthy discussions that shape the views of their community. We retrieved over 72,000 Reddit comments posted between January to July 2016 for a mixed-methods study of AAPI identity work, analyzing discursive patterns of user-deleted and banned comments. We found that while conservative AAPIs tend to comment anonymously more frequently, progressive AAPIs are less likely to ban comments that did not fit the behavior and norms of their community. AAPI redditors engage differently between conservative and progressive online communities through a process of what we conceptualize as identity work as deliberation.},

Prior research in interactively specifying the time component for such queries has been focused on defining temporal relationships in data, i.e., querying event sequences through ordinal patterns. However, there has been much less emphasis on how to specify time as a quantitative data dimension in temporal queries. Motivated by the advent of the Internet of Things (IoT), we present a formal model that can be used to represent complex time specifications. Our model is the first step in an effort to enhance temporal user interfaces that enables discrete time specifications through a visual query interface.},

We present ABBAS, a novel integration of four different bio-sensors into an assistive system, using in-situ projection for providing feedback and measuring workers' stress levels during assembly work tasks through bio-sensors in real-time. It adjusts work steps according to the worker's state. In two user studies, we assessed the suitability of different bio-sensors to detect the worker's stress level and showed the feasibility of GSR to create adaptive assistive systems that consider the workers' current physiological state. Finally, we discuss how integrating bio-sensors influences assistive systems and leads to both opportunities and challenges for assistive technology in general.},

The complexity of these systems previously required specialized prototypes, but newly available commercial products like the Microsoft HoloLens make the technology more available.

Physiotherapy can help with improving the situation, however, a lack of motivation to perform repetitive exercises, as well as achieving an adequate quality of execution and level of exertion are considerable challenges. Motion-based games for health (MGH) can motivate patients and support them in performing such exercises. But the important interaction between therapists and patients is often not sufficiently considered in MGH design and therapists' means for intervention and adjustment of such games are limited. We integrate local live direction into MGH, enabling simultaneous adjustments by the therapist while the patient is playing. We evaluated our prototype with 9 therapists, collecting feedback on usability, user experience, and practical applicability. Our results show that the concept was received well, as evidenced by excellent quantitative usability ratings and very positive qualitative feedback.},

In the past, we determined that knife pressure is important for creating paper-cutting designs. Therefore, we developed a device on a tablet computer to measure pressure when the user cuts paper. In an experiment, to confirm the effectiveness of our device, we compared it with a general utility knife that had a pressure sensor. Our test procedure was as follows: 1) our subjects cut paper with utility knife, and 2) each subject performs paper cutting using each device. For our experiment, we used seven subjects in each of three groups: G1 (practice using the Stylus Knife), G2 (practice using only the utility knife), and G3 (practice using the utility knife with a textbook). We compared the changes between Steps 1 and 2 exhibited by each group. As a result, group G1was able to apply sufficient pressure for a line pattern, while the others cut a line pattern with insufficient pressure. We confirmed that the novice subjects were able to cut paper with appropriate pressure by using our knife.},

abstract = {Recently, virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) applications have become popular. Hence, designers must be trained to be better equipped to design VR applications and games. However, current VR prototyping approaches present many obstacles to design students; for example, most applications require programming skills that involve a steep learning curve for design students without technical backgrounds. A VR/AR prototyping method that involves a gentle learning curve is thus required. This study proposed such a method, and conducted a 3-hour workshop with master-level design students. The outcome is reported in this paper. Observations and reflections are presented.},

abstract = {Public health surveillance systems gain significant benefits from integrating existing early incident detection systems, supported by closed data sources, with public available data. However, identifying potential alerting incidents relies on finding accurate, reliable sources and presenting the high volume of data in a way that increases analysts work efficiency; a challenge for any system that leverages publicly available data. In this paper, we present the design concept and the applied design science research methodology of ChemVeillance, a chemical analyst surveillance system. Our work portrays a system design and approach that translates theoretical design methodology into practice creating a powerful surveillance system built for specific use cases. Researchers, designers, developers, and related professionals in the health surveillance community can build upon the principles and methodology described here to enhance and broaden current surveillance systems leading to improved situational awareness based on a robust integrated early warning system.},

Observational Quality of Live (QoL) methods are frequently used in the dementia context, but not designed for formative evaluations. In this paper we present Proxemo, a prototypical approach combining the strengths of methods from both domains. By enabling evaluators to accurately document emotions of people with dementia Proxemo overcomes the problem of UX tools requiring self-report and the vague timeframes of QoL methods. In a preliminary study experienced evaluators from the domains of UX and dementia interacted with the prototype intuitively and were keen on applying it in an evaluation. In future work we will optimize Proxemo for rating emotions of multiple users.},

Not only does the current web document current design trends, historical snapshots of the web are a lens into past fashions. The Internet Archive cite{internetarchive} has captured snapshots of the public Internet each year going back to 1996. In this paper, we present a curated dataset of 21 years of web design, scraped from the Internet Archive. We report initial analysis of design trends apparent in this data, and we demonstrate how the data can be modeled with deep neural networks to enable novel design applications, such as predicting the apparent year of a web design. The novelty of our work is two-fold: (1) mining the long-term temporal evolution of designs on the Internet, and (2) using deep neural networks as a tool for discovering design elements, which can complement the hand-curated features so far used in data-driven design mining.},

A common problem with telepresence robots is their limited capability of interacting with the physical environment. A potential solution, explored in the present study, is supporting "double remote control" interaction, that is, making it possible for the pilot, in addition to remotely controlling the robot, to also remotely control objects in the local setting. In the study we enacted meaningful scenarios of employing telepresence robots with and without double remote control capabilities. The evidence collected in the study allows us to tentatively assess the effects of double remote control interaction on user experience and social context. Issues for future research are discussed.},

Our results suggest that heart rate and GSR (galvanic skin response) data are the major predictors of memorability for photographers, and that the sensor signals are not particularly useful for predicting memorability ratings of subjects in the photos.},

Prior work explored crowd-sourced approaches to collect landmark data, but most of that work focused on explicit user input to gather the data. In this paper, we presented our work towards a system to automatically infer suitable landmarks for pedestrian navigation instructions from mobile eye-tracking data. By matching the video feed of the scene camera of a head-mounted eye tracker to Google Street View imagery, our system is able to cluster the visual attention of the users and extract suitable landmarks from it. We present early results of a field study conducted with six participants to highlight the potential of our approach.},

To address these limitations, prior work proposed a variety of interaction techniques based on input sensors beyond the touchscreen. These were evaluated from a technical perspective. In contrast, we envision a smartphone that senses touch input on the whole device. Through interviews with experienced interaction designers, we elicited interaction methods to address touch input limitations from a different perspective. In this work, we focus on the interview results and present a smartphone prototype which senses touch input on the whole device.

Prior work on crowdsourcing software engineering has addressed this problem by performing an a priori decomposition of the task into well-defined microtasks that individual crowd workers can complete independently. Alternatively, ad hoc teams of experts recruited from online crowds can remotely collaborate, avoiding the up-front cost to end users of task decomposition. However, these temporary ad hoc teams can lead to high coordination costs during the session itself. In this paper, we explore the types and causes of these coordination costs for transient software teams in existing collaborative programming tools: a version control system and a real-time shared editor. Based on our findings, we suggest design elements of shared programming environments that help teams effectively self-coordinate on their task.},

We argue that smooth pursuit--based selection will be important in eye-tracking systems with low spatial accuracy, such as very low cost trackers, certain self-made systems, and calibration-free systems.},

The patterns are "Feel For Fun", "Conjoining Self Images", "Eye To Eye", and "Nudge People Together". Articulating possible approaches for increasing conviviality may broaden the repertoire of developers concerned with social settings and collaboration.},

abstract = {Programming and computational thinking skills are promoted in schools worldwide. However, there is still a lack of tools that assist learners and educators in the assessment of these skills. We have implemented an assessment tool, called Dr. Scratch, that analyzes Scratch projects with the aim to assess the level of development of several aspects of computational thinking. One of the issues to address in order to show its validity is to compare the (automatic) evaluations provided by the tool with the (manual) evaluations by (human) experts. In this paper we compare the assessments provided by Dr. Scratch with over 450 evaluations of Scratch projects given by 16 experts in computer science education. Our results show strong correlations between automatic and manual evaluations. As there is an ample debate among educators on the use of this type of tools, we discuss the implications and limitations, and provide recommendations for further research.},

abstract = {Bias is a common problem in today's media, appearing frequently in text and in visual imagery. Users on social media websites such as Twitter need better methods for identifying bias. Additionally, activists --those who are motivated to effect change related to some topic, need better methods to identify and counteract bias that is contrary to their mission. With both of these use cases in mind, in this paper we propose a novel tool called UnbiasedCrowd that supports identification of, and action on bias in visual news media. In particular, it addresses the following key challenges (1) identification of bias; (2) aggregation and presentation of evidence to users; (3) enabling activists to inform the public of bias and take action by engaging people in conversation with bots. We describe a preliminary study on the Twitter platform that explores the impressions that activists had of our tool, and how people reacted and engaged with online bots that exposed visual bias. We conclude by discussing design and implication of our findings for creating future systems to identify and counteract the effects of news bias.},

abstract = {Smartphone apps that enable workers to listen to nature soundscapes are increasingly popular. There is, however, little evidence that these soundscapes have the effects that they claim to have. Previous research exploring the effect of listening to background music during tasks has shown that while such music may have a positive effect on emotional state, it can disrupt reading and memory-based tasks. This paper explores the effects of nature soundscapes on mood and performance. A diary study of the use of soundscapes whilst studying suggests that students view such soundscapes as: aiding focus whilst studying; creating feelings of calm and peace; helping to manage stress and anxiety; and hiding distracting sounds. A second study -- an experiment -- investigated the effects of nature soundscapes on mood and performance. Whilst we found no effect of soundscapes on mood and arousal during the task, our results demonstrate that high acoustic variation in a soundscape may cause a disruption to serial recall tasks. The implications of our findings suggest that nature soundscapes with high acoustic variation may be detrimental to task performance compared to working in silence for serial based thinking tasks.},

The study was conducted in Singapore with 29 participants in 10 sessions, each one lasting around 2 hours. Participants conveyed their requirements verbally, as well as visually through sketching. The extensive rounds of discussions revealed an underlying trend of general mistrust towards AVs expressed in three requirement categories concerning: safety, empowerment and interaction style. In response to these requirements, designers need to ensure the vehicle's reliability is "expressed" in users' "language", passengers are allowed to have some decision power during navigation (despite the car being autonomous) and are able to interact with the AV in a flexible, easy and straightforward manner. We believe such design decisions would be beneficial to generate more trust towards AVs and improve the overall UX.},

We present the design and preliminary results of the validation of the Player Uncertainty in Games (PUG) questionnaire. Based on various sources from games user research and work done with regards to searching digital archives, we designed a questionnaire that measures the experience of uncertainty in games. The scale was refined down to 66 items via interviews with players and expert reviews, which was then validated and further refined based on data gathered from gamers in an online survey. The Principal Component Analysis showed high level of internal consistency for the scale and each of its four factors: Disorientation, Exploration, Prospect, and Randomness. This work demonstrates the initial findings towards a validated tool for measuring uncertainty of players in digital games.},

Results indicate marked variance in how people refer to the device, with over half using the personified name Alexa but most referencing the device with object pronouns. Degree of device personification is linked with sociability of interactions: greater personification co-occurs with more social interactions with the Echo. Reviewers mentioning multiple member households are more likely to personify the device than reviewers mentioning living alone. Even after controlling for technical issues, personification predicts user satisfaction with the Echo.},

We propose the use of text-mining on a corpus of architectural discourse in social media. With concepts extracted from this initial step, we will conduct a series of experiments on collaborative qualification using a mobile application. We will show how the challenge of organizing a discourse on computational process in architectural design could involve computation in productive new ways.

Using a simulated second user, we found that CameraOverlay and Avatar had the fastest travel time around an obstacle, but BoundingBox had the fewest collisions at 0.07 collision/trial versus 0.2 collisions/trial for Avatar and 0.4 collisions/trial for CameraOverlay. However, subjective participant impressions strongly favoured Avatar and CameraOverlay over BoundingBox.

abstract = {Independent navigation is important to individuals who are blind and visually impaired (VI). Researchers have long explored how blind and VI people navigate to inform the design of more useful, accessible wayfinding devices. However, there has been little research on the role language plays in providing effective Text-to-Speech directions for this population. In this paper, we investigate the language and cues expressed in written navigational directions exchanged between blind and VI members of a Yahoo! Group mailing list. Through qualitative analysis, we unpack the types of and frequencies of information exchanged, including how distances are represented, how direction is indicated, and what landmarks are referenced. We notably found that written directions often included warnings about when a navigator may have gone too far, which alternate routes are easier to navigate, and how welcoming and accessible destinations might be for people with disabilities.},

abstract = {Personal interactions using cell phones are so embedded in our everyday lives that they go almost unnoticed. We may try to protect ourselves from releasing sensitive information by increasing privacy protections, but how much can be inferred from our most basic phone usage? Using a large-scale annotated dataset of cell phone usage, we build a predictor to determine location context (home, work, commute) and social relationships (with close friend, with family) based on the clock of the phone and sequences of apps executed. Surprisingly, we show that just using this basic information we can accurately predict whether someone is at home, at work, and/or with close friends, family. We note that this is almost inevitable because it only depends on using the phone and not the privacy settings. Our results suggest that our relationship with technology gives away more than we might suspect. This presents opportunities and challenges discussed in this paper.},

A key challenge for synthesis-based autograders is how to design personalized feedback for students that is as effective as manual feedback given by teachers today. To understand the state of hint-giving practice, we analyzed 132 online Q&amp;A posts and conducted a semi-structured interview with a teacher from a local massive programming class. We identified five types of teacher hints that can also be generated by program synthesis. These hints describe transformations, locations, data, behavior, and examples. We describe our implementation of three of these hint types. This work paves the way for future deployments of automatic, pedagogically-useful programming hints driven by program synthesis.},

abstract = {Virtual reality industries claim that 360 videos are a powerful tool for creating empathy because they are an immersive medium, and wearing headphones is encouraged for the full immersive experience. To investigate these claims, we carried out a 2x2 between subjects lab study (n=40) to explore whether 360 viewing platform (magic window / google cardboard) and headphone use (with / without) have an effect on Film-Immersion for the 360 video Fire Rescue. Our results reveal a significant interaction effect: headphones increased immersion for google cardboard, but decreased immersion for magic window. However, not all dimensions of the immersive experience were affected. This suggests that head-mounted displays increase presence, but do not necessarily lead to more empathy and greater interest in the 360 video. Thematic analysis of interview data suggests contributing factors such as fear of missing out (FOMO). These findings have implications for film makers and researchers of 360 videos.},

While there are many applications that encourage physical activity through social interaction (such as rankings, sharing, or messaging), few of them have shown that community composition and trends can help people do more physical activity. Here, we created fictitious communities with different trends to investigate how different community trends affect users. We found that most of the participants in the growth community had more walking steps and all participants in the decline community had fewer walking steps than before. The fictitious community trend displayed through the leaderboards might allow our participants to experience the process of social learning and social comparisons implicitly and then change their intentions and behaviors. The results of this study provide some design implications for building fictitious communities in mobile applications to encourage users to do more physical activity.},

High-fidelity simulators are expensive; in consequence, many researchers use consumer gaming hardware and flat screens as an alternative. In recent years VR devices have become affordable and are applied already in some driving studies. It has not been shown whether driving simulations can use VR to increase immersion in low-cost setups. We conducted a pilot study with 20 participants using a racing game as simulation software. The results of this pilot study indicate that using a VR headset can potentially dissociate participants to a higher degree from the real world compared to the use of flat screens. However, participants felt a higher discomfort using the VR HMD. Despite expectations, today's VR technology does not appear to be a generally better choice than flat screens for driving simulator studies.},

However, relying on speech alone as the medium of communication can be a limitation; non-verbal aspects of communication also play a vital role in natural human discourse. Thus, it is necessary to identify the use of gesture and other non-verbal aspects in order to apply them towards the development of computer systems. We conducted an exploratory study to identify how humans use gesture and speech to communicate when solving collaborative tasks. We highlight differences in gesturing strategies in the presence/absence of speech and also show that the inclusion of gesture with speech resulted in faster task completion times than with speech alone. Based on these results, we present implications for the design of gestural and multimodal interactions.},

The framework includes two parts: standards for the basic elements of survey-relevant mobile device operation and guidelines for the building blocks of mobile survey questionnaires. In this presentation, we will describe five behavioral experiments designed to collect evidence for developing the standards.

Recent investigations have revealed that similar synchronization during interaction also occurs in brain activity and autonomous physiology. However, it is not known to what extent this synchronization emerges during computer-mediated interaction and whether its absence contributes to the widely acknowledged problems of online communication. We suggest that measuring the synchronization of biosignals is meaningful for assessing emotional capacity of computer-mediated communication systems, and intentionally increasing synchronization could improve understanding between people. As a proof-of-concept an interactive real-time system to quantify and visualize the synchronization of facial expressions, ECG, EEG and EDA of two players was piloted and results are presented in this paper.},

To enable researchers to embed experiments in online lessons while maintaining instructors' editorial control, Collaborative experiment authoring is needed. To enable instructors to use data for rapid improvement while maintaining statistically valid data for researchers, we apply an interpretable machine learning algorithm for Dynamic experimentation. We worked with an on-campus instructor to implement a proof-of-concept CDE system to experiment within their online calculus quizzes. The qualitative results from this deployment provided insight into how the CDE framework can facilitate alignment of research and practice.},

Three communication modalities were examined: friends that communicate 1) only face-to-face, 2) only through computer-mediated communication, or 3) both. Results from a survey (N= 283) indicate that sociability, a dimension of extraversion, moderates the effect of communication modality on perceived social support. Social support-regardless of modality-increases positive affect, but only support from friends communicated with face-to-face is associated with lower levels of loneliness and higher levels of life satisfaction in comparison to support received from friends that only communicate through mediated means.},

abstract = {Virtual Reality games have shown potential to make exercise fun and engaging. This is because many virtual reality games, using devices like the HTC Vive, offer engaging experiences where interaction requires the player to physically move around, moving their arms and body. This paper presents the first work evaluating the actual and perceived exertion in four existing virtual reality games. Our key contribution is in the insights about the exertion provided by four diverse types of VR games, highlighting their potential value for improving exercise levels. Our work points to the need for standards to classify VR games in terms of both the cardiovascular level and the particular muscle groups},

abstract = {The Workshop on Interactive Systems in Healthcare (WISH) brings together industry and academic researchers in human-computer interaction, biomedical informatics, and other disciplines to develop a cross-disciplinary research agenda that will drive future innovations. In addition, the workshop facilitates a common, safe space to share and discuss methods, study designs, and dissemination within each community. Finally, the workshop has actively provided mentoring opportunities to junior and new health informatics researchersâ€¯? from undergraduates to mid-career researchers who want to change their focus. This will be the sixth WISH in the series of successful workshops that has brought together different research communities around challenges of designing, implementing, and evaluating interactive health technologies.},

abstract = {At CHI 2016, the Development Consortium titled HCI Across Borders (HCIxB) was widely attended by 71 participants from 20 countries and six continents. The goal of this workshop was to build community and invite collaborationsâ€¯?across borders? on themes of interest for the participantsâ€¯? researchers actively involved in international HCI research, with many of them working in parts of theâ€¯?developing? world. In 2017, our goal is to extend these conversations to fuel community building beyond the workshop. The question we ask, therefore, is how we might align our efforts to reach potential members of our larger HCI community, even those who do not or are unable to attend CHI, to work towards a more cohesive global community. Further, we ask, what might the format of these efforts be? We invite proposals along these lines with the intention of bringing people together to discuss and workshop ideas for research directions, venues, activities, and events that would be natural extensions of HCIxB 2016 as well as HCIxB 2017, that we propose herein.},

abstract = {The World Health Organization predicts that by the year 2030, depression and other mental illnesses will be the leading disease burden globally. The rapid penetration and advancement of mobile phones and technology have given rise to unprecedented opportunities for close collaboration between computation researchers and mental health practitioners. The intersection between wearable computing, design of naturalistic observation experiments and statistical causal inference offers promising avenues for developing technologies to help those in mental distress; yet human factors inquiry and design are often the missing ingredients in this powerful mix. This second inter-disciplinary workshop will provide an opportunity for researchers in mental health, computation and causal inference to come together under the much needed auspices of human-centric design, towards the development and deployment of new technologies mental health technologies and interventions.},

abstract = {The goal of the Career Development Forum is to provide a supportive environment for recent PHDs (under 5 years) to discuss issues related to career development, including defining a research trajectory, identifying funding sources, getting involved in professional service within SIGCHI and elsewhere, communicating their work and strengthening their public profile, and balancing work, family and social life. A selected group of recent PHDs will interact with senior researchers from academia and/or industry. Each recent PHD will be provided with a 20+ minute slot to discuss his/her career and career development with the other attendees. There will also be a series of panels in which senior HCI researchers discuss research development, getting involved in professional service, and work/life balance.},
