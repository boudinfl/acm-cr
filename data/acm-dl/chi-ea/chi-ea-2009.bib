abstract = {Although modern ease of access to technology enables many of us to obsessively document our lives, much of the captured digital content is often disregarded and forgotten on storage devices, with no concerns of cost or decay. Can we design technology that helps people better appreciate captured memories? What would people do if they only had one more chance to relive past memories? In this paper, we present a prototype design, PY-ROM, a matchstick-like video recording and storage device that burns itself away after being used. This encourages designers to consider lifecycles and human-computer relationships by integrating physical properties into digitally augmenting everyday objects.},

abstract = {We present a novel playground platform that will hopefully help in countering two important issues in children in the developed world: lack of physical activity and lack of socialization. The system underlying the platform will eventually adapt automatically to and modulate the amount of physical activity of children by applying a new notion in interaction: that of "interaction tempo". The concept of beats per minute seems especially adequate as the base structure of a physically-based activity. As an exertion interface we expect that, through the design of collaborative experiences, it will also enhance socialization of children.},

This concept is exemplified through the design process of soft(n), an interactive tangible art installation developed in conjunction with V2_Lab in Rotterdam. Somaesthetics is a term coined by Richard Shusterman, a pragmatist philosopher interested in the critical study of bodily experience as a focus of sensory-aesthetic appreciation and agency. In the context of interaction, somaesthetics offers a bridging strategy between embodied practices based in somatics, and the design of an aesthetics of interaction for HCI. This paper argues for the value of exploring design strategies that employ a somaesthetic approach, presents a definitional framework of somaesthetics that can be applied to interaction, and links the concept of somaesthetics to a specific design case in which tactile interaction is applied to the design of a networked, tangible interactive artwork called soft(n).},

Using the Internet, or Dr. Google, as a first opinion can be problematic due to misinformation, misinterpretation of valid information, and the fears that can arise due to lack of medical knowledge, inexperience, and limited perspectives. When patients do visit their doctor for a second opinion, some do not disclose the fact they already received their first opinion and often their doctors do not ask. The result is that patients may suffer needlessly if their fears, concerns, misunderstandings, and misinterpretations are not addressed by the healthcare providers with the expertise and skills to assist them. A pernicious disconnect exists between many patients who use the Internet for health information and the medical professionals who care for them. The medical profession can alleviate this disconnect by taking the lead in establishing guidelines for systematically talking to patients about, and guiding, their Internet research. Human-computer interaction professionals can collaborate with the medical community in ensuring credible health Web sites become the gold standard that patients use to achieve better health.},

Unlike other tactile feedback systems, it does not require any complicated mechanism for position sensing and tactile actuation. Instead, it directly converts time-modulated structured light into haptic sensations. By sensing this light with a photo detector, users can feel this time-modulated light as haptic sensations. The system can easily add haptic feedback to a wide variety of applications, including surface computing systems and 3D interactive spaces.},

Should we encourage the current trend of increasing number of authors per paper, or might we be loosing something in that process? I do not hope to answer these questions, but rather to encourage their discussion.},

Products designed with this method are expected to be used unconsciously by users with reduced environmental impacts. In this paper, we present a framework of design space matrix and initial case studies for the design method. For the framework, we identified the types of interaction behaviors causing environmental impacts and the attributes of unconscious human behaviors. Based on the framework, three design cases - a power cord, a trashcan and a speedometer of an automobile - were developed. The proposed framework and design cases can be used as a base of an advanced eco-friendly interaction design method.},

A high domain knowledge barrier makes it difficult for a person from outside this field to imagine the user experience simply through observation. The globally distributed nature of the core drilling community imposes further design constraints. We used this approach to embed a computer scientist trained as a junior core technician. This process allowed the developer to experience authentic user activities and enabled the design of an innovative system for solving real-world problems. This approach made the best use of precious co-located opportunities, overcame the initial domain knowledge barrier, and established a trust relationship between the developer and the domain scientists. The system designed through this approach formed a sustainable and adaptive foundation that the domain scientists can build on. Through in-situ deployment, observation and interview evaluations from on-going expeditions, we present the advantages of this process.},

The way user involvement actually progresses depends on how the users are situated in relation to the design process. Their influence may extend from the results of the design project to planning and managing the course of the design project. Sequential techniques developed for the rational problem solving or reflective process have a limited application in highly dynamic design processes. More precisely, in sequential design processes validation steers reflection into a single direction. For this reason, a methodological approach not based on the sequential (hypothetical-deductive) paradigm but on the dialectical inquiry (inductive paradigm) between designers and users is considered. The versatile and holistic nature of this co-reflective process makes it suitable for dynamic and unstructured design processes based on different streams of reflection.},

abstract = {In many organizations, actively engaging in user-centered design (UCD) techniques is standard practice when delivering products into the commercial marketplace or to external customers. But in these same organizations -- or in organizations not delivering products to an external customer -- the creation of systems for use by employees is a conversation between IT and the business unit. UCD professionals are either not participating, or they have very limited influence. This SIG creates a forum for people with real-world experience and challenges to discuss how -- and whether it is even possible -- to bring UCD into the IT organization.},

Incentive-centered design was used to craft a solution to fit the needs of all types of shoppers. TreasureHunter consists of an online community that is also accessible from mobile phones so that it can be used while at a thrift store. The proposed system works best on smartphones, though any Internet-capable phone could also be used. By motivating more people to buy used goods instead of new, everyone can benefit as consumers pay less for the goods they desire and fewer resources are wasted in the transportation and consumption of new goods.},

We conducted a user-centered design process in which we interviewed 17 local organizations, built an affinity diagram, and devised personas and scenarios. Using this information, we designed a social network, WantKnot, which allows businesses to find other local organizations interested in absorbing some of their waste streams. Based on a preliminary round of usability testing, we found that WantKnot connects businesses in valuable ways, and in doing so, reduces waste and transportation resources.},

abstract = {Electricity production emits carbon dioxide and other gases into the atmosphere, adversely influences global climate change, depletes limited natural resources, and negatively impacts the lives of those who live near power plants. We designed a residential electricity monitoring and feedback system called WattBot, that allows users to track their home energy usage and encourages them to reduce consumption. Our solution is an application for the Apple iPhone and iPod touch that receives data from a wireless hub, allowing users to view, compare and analyze their electricity usage over time.},

Some districts are encouraged to recycle by paying for their waste according to its weight. Similarly, some businesses are subject to a 'pay by weight' scheme. The WYW system proposes to tackle issues for users in these schemes. However, users that are not subject to these schemes can still benefit from the device by using it as a learning tool.},

Evaluating the usability of these systems is difficult, especially in the early stages of development when their use cannot be observed in context. While many different evaluation methods have been proposed for evaluating stand-alone technologies, evaluating very large-scale integrated systems requires techniques appropriate both for individual components, and the whole of the human-computing context being designed. Results from the case study reported here suggest that the usability of any individual application is highly determined by its integration with other applications in the distributed system. Modern evaluation methods need to account for this integration in both their perspective and the measures they use.},

The goal of my dissertation is to employ functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a non-invasive brain measurement device, to augment an interface so it uses brain activity measures as an additional input channel. I have measured and classified brain signals that are interesting in HCI context, such as mental workload and difficulty level of a task. My future work will focus on creating an interface that responds to one of those measures by adapting the interface. By combining brain signal measured with an adaptive interface I expect to contribute a functional passive brain-computer interface that measures and adapts to the user's brain signal.},

This research explores the possibility of detecting cognitive and physical stress by monitoring keyboard interactions with the eventual goal of detecting acute or chronic changes in cognitive and physical function. Preliminary results indicate that it is possible to classify cognitive and physical stress conditions relative to non-stress conditions based on keystroke and text features with accuracy rates comparable to those currently obtained using affective computing methods. The proposed approach is attractive because it requires no additional hardware, is unobtrusive, is adaptable to each user, and is very low-cost.},

This socio-technical mixed methods study is positioned at the intersection of high school social groups, uses of social media, and students' participation in extracurricular activities, with particular interest in civic participation. Design implications will be drawn from analysis of three data sets: a student questionnaire with sociometric questions, interviews, and observations of students' daily activities.

In order to further understand users and find potential solutions to the design challenge, I explore how users perceive their everyday computational resources becoming outdated and in reaction how they deal with the problem during maintenance, appropriation, and adoption of computational resources on an ongoing fashion.},

These devices can sense varying levels of pressure at a resolution high enough to sense and distinguish multiple fingertips, the tip of a pen or pencil and other objects.Other potential applications include writing pads, floor mats and entry indicators, bio-pressure sensors, musical instruments, baby monitoring, drafting tables, reconfigurable control panels, inventory tracking, portable electronic devices, hospital beds, construction materials, wheelchairs, sports equipment, sports clothing and tire pressure sensing.},

abstract = {We present Silicone iLluminated Active Peripherals (SLAP), a system of tangible, transparent widgets for use on vision-based multi-touch tabletops. SLAP Widgets are cast from silicone or made of acrylic and include sliders, knobs, keyboards, and keypads. They add tactile feedback to multi-touch tables and can be dynamically relabeled with rear projection. They are inexpensive, battery-free, and untethered widgets combining the flexibility of virtual objects with tangible affordances of physical objects. Our demonstration shows how SLAP Widgets can augment input on multi-touch tabletops with modest infrastructure costs.},

To improve on this, we have developed an enhanced auditory and graphical zoomable user interface that leverages the human brain's capability to single out sounds from a spatial mixture: The user shines a virtual flashlight onto an automatically created 2D arrangement of icons that represent sounds. All sounds within the light cone are played back in parallel through a surround sound system. A GPU-accelerated visualization facilitates identifying the icons on the screen with acoustic items in the dense cloud of sound. Test show that the user can pick the "right" sounds more quickly and/or with more fun than with standard file-by-file auditioning.},

Several studies have indicated the importance of privacy for consumers, yet current mechanisms to present privacy policies of websites have not been successful. This research addresses the present gap in the communication and understanding of privacy policies, by creating an information design that improves the visual presentation and comprehensibility of privacy policies. Drawing from the nutrition, warning, and energy labeling, as well as from the effort towards creating a standardized banking privacy notification, I present the process and ongoing results of the development of a usable information design for privacy policies.},

We begin with a discussion of social networking by isolating key characteristics of social interactions in three research areas: Social Networking Sites, Mobile Computing, and Wearable Computing. These characteristics are analyzed to suggest a design framework that can be applied to the design of social networks. Using this framework, we have designed and created a wearable social network called Patches, which extends the social interactions available in most wearable devices today.},

In this paper, I report the preliminary findings of an ongoing contextual user research study conducted in three different Indian villages in Maharashtra State. This research is targeted to uncover a deeper understanding of the information needs of Indian rural farmers through field observations and interviews, as well as to guide the human-centered design of potential Information and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions to cater to the information needs of small scale rural farmers in India.},

There is no denying that one of the needs of human beings is to share what they read and understand other readers' feelings about the books they have read. Recent developments in Web 2.0 technologies characterizing personalized information organization have led to an interest in social tagging behavior of a variety of items, such as books, images, web pages, videos, etc. However, a major issue with this kind of application is that tags are growing in an uncontrolled manner. In fact, it is chaos. Several studies have recognized the existence of affective tags, but there is no user interface designed to separate affective tags from other tags. To address that affective tags are navigation aids for readers, this work gives an account of design of a novel interface for visualization of affective tags at a social cataloging website, LibraryThing.com.},

Using this method, one can easily guess the emotion of music from the corresponding icon shape and find the music he or she wants.},

The effect of accelerometer placement on different parts of the body, despite its apparent significance, received little consideration. This paper documents through experimentation the different characteristics of accelerometer output on the waist, arm, wrist, thigh, and ankle in the context of translational body motion (walk). Furthermore, it offers experimental formulas that transform peripheral body measurements to more reliable, center body (i.e., waist) measurements, and these in turn to caloric measurements, which are the standard physical activity units. The importance of these results on the design of ubiquitous health applications and the ensuing user experiences cannot be underestimated. The paper's methodology can be used in further studies in other physical activity contexts, where more elaborate body motion patterns are involved.},

abstract = {Knowledge workers increasingly use multiple devices such as desktop computers, laptops, cell phones, and PDAs for personal information management (PIM) tasks. The use of several of these devices together creates higher task difficulty for users than when used individually (as reported in a recent survey we conducted). Prompted by this, we are conducting an experiment to study mental workload in multi-device scenarios. While mental workload has been shown to decrease at sub-task boundaries, it has not been studied if this still holds for sub-tasks performed on different devices. We hypothesize that the level of support provided by the system for task migration affects mental workload. Mental workload measurements can enable designers to isolate critical sub-tasks and redesign or optimize the user experience selectively. In addition, we believe that mental workload shows promise as a cross-tool, cross-task method of evaluating PIM tools, services and strategies, thus fulfilling a need expressed by several researchers in the area of personal information management. In this paper, we describe our ongoing experiment of measuring mental workload (via physiological as well as subjective measures) and its implications for users, designers and researchers in PIM.},

To generate this information, tags that are attached on a given place by users give the characteristics of a place and the reasons for visiting the place.},

abstract = {Web search and browsing have been streamlined for a comfortable experience when the network connection is fast. Existing tools, however, are not optimized for scenarios where connectivity is poor, as is the case for many users in developing regions where fast connections are expensive, rare, or unavailable.This study examined how users' web search and browsing behavior differs when the connection is slow, and whether users employ techniques to alleviate the problem. In a preliminary study involving 15 subjects on a university campus in Kerala, India, we identify unique mitigating behaviors of users who routinely suffer low-bandwidth or intermittent connections. We examine the challenges faced by these users and find that existing web search and browsing infrastructure is simply incapable of providing a good experience. Finally we outline potential design improvements.},

abstract = {VJing is a live performance of visual media. In their performances VJs utlize technologies in ways which subvert and evolve current interfaces; presenting qualities such as performativeness and expression. By developing interfaces in direct response to a VJ's work, we can learn how to develop fresh styles of interaction. The subtle nuances of a VJ's use of technology may not be achieved through a simple observation or dialogue with VJs; as they are difficult to decouple from the performer's creative process.In this film we present a design process that utilizes video documentary to explore the working practices of a collection of VJs. The documentary frames our engagement with the creative processes which shape an individual artist's performance. We describe the process detailing the initial creation of the documentary, and a participatory design workshop inspired by the film. We conclude with an example of how the process has been used in the design of a personal interactive tool for one of our participants.},

Unearthing fragments of previously lost archival footage, a disembodied HCI historian (Jonathan Grudin) introduces a first attempt to reconstruct the history of our field. Pioneering systems like NLS and Sketchpad are reviewed alongside more recent work from CHI and related conferences.

The extent of the collaboration on these mobile devices was to make phone calls, which has led to their worldwide distribution. Despite their broad proliferation, there are limitations such as small screen size and limited interaction space. We believe that by bringing devices and people together, these limitations can be overcome. In this video submission, we illustrate the potential of devices and people working together by showing how children can collaboratively read and create stories using mobile devices and exploit the shoulder-to-shoulder collaborative situation to share and expand the interactive space.},

Comm.unity is designed to work on as many devices as possible, and with as many different radios as possible (WiFi, Bluetooth, IR, etc.). It is designed as a platform over which many different networked applications could be developed with ease, from the bottom layers of the network all the way up to the user interface. In this short movie we present some use cases for Comm.unity based applications, including the "Social Dashboard" -- a readily usable control for one's digital aura -- as well as a brief working demo showing an image propagate across multiple devices.},

The slit-tear visualization technique is a generalization of the traditional photographic slit-scanning and more recent video slicing techniques: after a user specifies a pixel path of interest, the system generates a timeline that replicates those pixels for each frame in the video. These rich visualizations of the video data help users to discover and explore spatio-temporal patterns of activity in a video. In this video, we illustrate the use of slit-tear visualizations to detect movement and incidence of activity in a video scene, accentuate directional motion and small changes in the video, and discover patterns of activity between spatially distinct areas of the scene.},

We are developing a series of experimental films that can convey user-experience without explicitly depicting the object that generates that experience. In doing this, we are building upon the idea (well rehearsed in the scientific debate about mental imagery) that some visual representations can be inexplicitly non-committal about the presence or absence of certain objects or features. Our films are explicitly non-committal about the objects they describe -- in the sense that the devices are deliberately kept hidden or invisible to the user. We present one such film that captures a security device we call a Biometric Daemon -- essentially an electronic pet that thrives on biometric signals. Crucially, the Daemon is never shown in the film, while the relationship between the Daemon and the user is made apparent.},

Many people use their mobile phones as multimedia players, cameras, messaging systems, etc. Therefore, it is required to design a user interface that improves the usability of multi-functional mobile phones. For this purpose, we proposed a novel user interface that utilizes touch sensing technology to support multi-functional devices. The proposed user interface is based on the assumption that the device can detect how a user holds the device. By analyzing the user's grip-pattern, the device recognizes the user's intention and adjusts itself to meet the specific needs of the user such as accessing an application. The concept of the user interface is presented through several use-case scenarios. In addition, the technical feasibility of the proposed interface is validated by implementing a working prototype system.},

'QUICKIES' enriches the experience of using sticky notes by linking hand-written sticky notes to the mobile phones, digital calendars, task-lists, e-mail and instant messaging clients. The project explores how the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), RFID, and ink recognition technologies can make it possible to augment physical sticky notes that can be searched, located, can send reminders and messages, and more broadly, can act as an I/O interface to the digital information world.},

However, research has shown that most current implementations support only light or moderate exercise. We are presenting "Remote Impact - Shadowboxing over a Distance", in which players punch and kick a life-size shadow of a remote participant in order to win the game. The game includes a novel multi-touch large-scale interaction surface that is soft (so no-one gets hurt), but can detect the location as well as the intensity of the players' even most extreme impacts. Remote Impact shows that computer-augmented games can support extreme exertion while supporting novel experiences, such as a reduced risk of injury and supporting distant players, offering a new way of thinking in which areas Human-Computer Interaction research can contribute to our lives.},

Family members have difficulty accessing the personal accounts of the photo organizer, navigating to these photos, or finding the desired ones within the vast number of photos stored on disk. Viewing photos on a standard PC screen is also awkward due to crowding. To promote in-home photo sharing, we designed Souvenirs, an RFID-based system that lets people quickly link digital photo sets to physical memorabilia. These memorabilia trigger memories and serve as social instruments; a person can enrich their story-telling by moving the physical memorabilia close to their large-format television screen, and the associated photos are immediately displayed. A person can also bring a mobile device near memorabilia: the photos appear on that display. Through pick and drop, a person can also transfer the photo display from the mobile device to the large screen for easier viewing. This video motivates and illustrates how all this works.},

We propose a biologically inspired approach based on human associative learning. In the first stage, which corresponds to the stimulus encoding in natural learning, we use unsupervised training of HMMs to model the incoming stimuli. In the second stage, the associative learning, these models are associated with a meaning using an implementation of classical conditioning. Top-down processing is applied to take into account the context as a bias for the stimulus encoding. In an experimental study we evaluated the learning of user feedback with our learning method using special training tasks, which allow the robot to explore and provoke situated feedback from the user. In this first study, the robot learned to discriminate between positive and negative feedback with an average accuracy of 95.97%.},

This capability enables a person to naturally predict another person's future actions in a situation and produce appropriate joint or shared actions. In like manner, a human-like planning agent (or sociable robot) should be able to understand the user's action goal and come up with subgoal-based plans to achieve the goal. In this paper we focus on how the agent can automatically construct the subgoal-based action hierarchy corresponding to the user's high-level goal. As a first step, we implement an action-planning engine based on ConceptNet, and indicate the drawbacks of using ConceptNet for this purpose. Also, we present the structure of a new goal-oriented commonsense-reasoning knowledgebase for the agent's action-goal representation and action planning.},

The lack of reference points and the inability to access visual cues are its main causes. We aim to overcome this issue allowing users to walk through unknown places, by receiving a familiar and easily understandable feedback. Our preliminary contributions are in understanding, through user studies, how blind users explore an unknown place, their difficulties, capabilities and needs. We also analyzed how these users create their own mental maps, verbalize a route and communicate with each other. Structuring and generalizing this information, we were able to create a prototype that generates familiar and adequate instructions, behaving like a blind companion, one with similar capabilities that understands his "friend" and speaks the same language. We evaluated the system with the target population, validating our approach and orientation guidelines, while gathering overall user satisfaction.},

One pair of cameras is used for the estimation of the optical axis of the left eye, and the other pair is used for the estimation of the optical axis of the right eye. The point of intersection of optical axis with the display is termed the point of the optical axis (POA). The POG is approximately estimated as the midpoint of the line joining POAs of both the eyes with the display. We have developed a prototype system based on this method and demonstrated that the midpoint of POAs was closer to the fiducial point that the user gazed at than each POA.},

abstract = {People with dementia have problems carrying out multi-step tasks such as making a hot drink. Intelligent systems are being built to prompt people through such tasks. However, the prompts used by these systems are likely to be viewed as novel. As people with dementia are known to be sensitive to novelty this could be a problem. An experiment was performed to determine how to prompt people with dementia with which knob controls which burner on a cooking range. A highly novel implicit attentional cue using fluorescent wire was found to provide comparable or better results than more conventional alternatives. It is concluded that design in this area does not need to be constrained by the need to avoid novelty. The experiment is also of interest because of the way that it was embedded in a natural cooking task suitable for people of varied cognitive capacity.},

To obtain minimal presence, physical plasticity of the interface is considered in the present work. This allows the interface to shift between invisible and visible states; the concealed interface appears when it is put into use and disappears after use. In addition, our recent project, Shade Pixel, is presented as an example of an unobtrusive interface with minimal presence. We also briefly describe a design concept for the interface to provide inspiration for its practical application.},

In this paper we present the first phase of our service UX study in which three Web services were evaluated by three UX experts each, using an initial set of service UX evaluation heuristics. We discuss how well these heuristics covered the positive and negative service UX evaluation findings, and how the heuristics and the expert evaluation approach of UX should be developed further.},

The theatrical set comes alive in the form of robotic, visual, and sonic elements that allow the actor to extend his range and influence across the stage in unique and dynamic ways. This environment must compellingly assume the behavior and expression of the absent Simon. In order to distill the essence of this character, we recover performance parameters in real time from physiological sensors, voice, and vision systems. These gesture and performance parameters are then mapped to a visual language that incorporates cognitive and semantic models informed by modal relationships. This language allows the off-stage actor to express emotion and interact with others on stage. Our Disembodied Performance system takes a new direction in augmented performance by employing a non-representational abstraction of a human presence that fully translates a character into an environment.},

While there have been many studies of navigation design guidelines for using maps or speech- or tactile-based guidance in mobile devices, in this paper we propose an initial study of multimodal navigation design utilising the theory of designing episodes of motion originating from urban planning. The implications of designing cues and providing rhythm, as the theory of episodes of motions suggests, are explored, with pedestrians as the subjects using wayfinding tasks in an urban area. The main contributions of this paper are in investigating the design principles, evaluating them in the context of mobile wayfinding tasks, and reflecting upon the results in terms of users' wayfinding behaviour. It is concluded that by designing predictive clues and rhythm into mobile multimodal navigation applications, we can improve navigation aids for users.},

We therefore explore possible designs for accessible mouse-based goal crossing widgets that avoid triggering unwanted goals by using secondary goals, gestures, and corners and edges. We identify four design principles for accessible desktop goal crossing widgets: ease of use for motor-impaired users, safety from false selections, efficiency, and scalability.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe a virtual game where game play is afforded by the user's silhouette interacting with on-screen 3D gaming objects, e.g. a soccer ball or a "chapteh" (Shuttlecock Kicking) -- a game played traditionally in villages, i.e. "kampongs", in Asia. The virtual game system projects a life-size image of the location where the game is often played, e.g. soccer field when soccer is played or village playground in the case of "chapteh". The player's silhouette is super-imposed on the screen as the user interacts with the on-screen virtual 3D object using his body movement, e.g. bounce or lift. We compare the game play when different design variables were changed, e.g. replacing the soccer field image or removing the silhouette outline, to evaluate which design variable affects a user's experience during game play.},

Map use research has often focused on higher order use goals or cognitive interpretations of static map representations. In order to address the problem of understanding foundational user-map interaction behavior, we are studying user interactions in complex geovisualizations, with an initial focus on analysis tasks. This paper describes an exploratory user study to examine general interaction issues with complex map visualizations.

Spatial audio, which allows us to localize a sound source in a 3D space, can offer a means of altering focus between audio streams as well as increasing the richness and differentiation of audio cues. However, the implementation of spatial audio on mobile phones is a recent development. Therefore, a calibration of this new technology is a requirement for any further spatial audio research. In this paper we report an evaluation of the spatial audio capabilities supported on a Nokia N95 8GB mobile phone. Participants were able to significantly discriminate between five audio sources on the frontal horizontal plane. Results also highlighted possible subject variation caused by earedness and handedness. We then introduce the concept of audio minimization and describe work in progress using the Nokia N95's 3D audio capability to implement and evaluate audio minimization in an eyes-free mobile environment.},

Traditional paper-based maps provide high-resolution, large-scale information with zero power consumption. There are numerous implementations of magic lens interfaces that combine high-resolution paper maps with dynamic handheld displays. From an HCI perspective, the main challenge of magic lens interfaces is that users have to switch their attention between the magic lens and the information in the background. In this paper, we attempt to overcome this problem by using a lightweight mobile camera projector unit to augment the paper map directly with additional information. The "Map Torchlight" is tracked over a paper map and can precisely highlight points of interest, streets, and areas to give directions or other guidance for interacting with the map.},

Our results indicate that availability and perceived quality of information were the primary reasons for searching in a non-native language. Language switching within a search only occurred when information could not be found with the original search language. We also observed a language-related use case where the goal was not to find information in a typical sense, but rather to check for correct phrases in the non-native language using search engines.

abstract = {Multi-touch interfaces are becoming popular as a new input means for the various applications. In this paper, we suggest a new Korean text entry method using a multi-touch interface called MPT (Multi-Point Touch) input method. We conducted a text entry performance test comprising 4 sessions for 10 participants, and compared the result with an existing commercial SPT (Single-Point Touch) input method. The experimental results show that the entry speed of MPT was slower than that of SPT method in the initial session. However, the entry speed of MPT input method was improved more rapidly than the speed of SPT method as sessions were proceeded. We observed a statistically significant learning effect from the result of MPT method. Moreover, we found no significant difference between the task loads of SPT and MPT input methods.},

We developed first, second, third, and fourth order models and evaluated each model for accuracy of prediction. Findings show that Reformulation and Assistance account for approximately 45 percent of all query reformulations. Searchers seem to seek system searching assistant early in the session or after a content change. The results of our evaluations show that the first and second order models provided the best predictability, between 28 and 40 percent overall, and higher than 70 percent for some patterns. Implications are that the n-gram approach can be used for improving searching systems and searching assistance in real time.},

It assesses consumer product interest in terms of an overall interest scale plus three subscales assessing interest in features and choices, personal image as affected by a product, and interest in optimizing one's choice with regards to a product. We report factor structure in a sample of N=225 US consumers and replication with N=180 US consumers. The results establish reliability of the overall 12-item scale and subscales in a broad consumer sample (Cronbach's alpha = 0.89 overall, 0.82-0.88 for subscales). Validity measures in the validation sample demonstrate convergent and discriminant validity with product ownership and product involvement measures. We regard PIES as currently being in beta form (PIES-beta). It is suitable for usage now but will undergo further revision in 2009.},

This model is then used in a program, which plays the ESP game without looking at the image. Even without any use of the actual image, the program manages to agree with the randomly assigned human partner on a label for 69% of all images, and for 81% of images which have at least one "off-limits" term assigned to them.We discuss how the scoring system and the design of the ESP game can be improved to encourage users to add less predictable labels, thereby improving the quality of the collected information.},

However, little research has been done investigating whether these injuries are associated with the software being used. One reason is the difficulty in measuring muscle strain (a predictor of muscle related injuries). Here we present preliminary results of study on the relationship between objective and subjective measures of muscle strain during computer use. As users completed sets of tasks using MSWord®, SEMG muscle activity was recorded for the muscles associated with using a keyboard and mouse. After each task set, users completed surveys asking the level of strain they experienced during the tasks. Correlations between the measures suggest that subjective measures can provide reliable information regarding the muscle strain associated with software use. These easily obtained subjective measurements could assist in producing software interaction designs that are better for users.},

abstract = {With the growing volume of digital information users must deal with, management and retrieval tasks have become increasingly problematic. A popular way to help users organize their information is tagging, as is the case in web sites such as flickr, delicious or youtube. Unlike traditional hierarchically-based organization principles, tagging is less strict and easier to employ. However, it is not without its own problems. Low tag reuse is just one of several issues that might hinder retrieval of a document or photo at a later time. We propose that narratives can provide a better way of tagging photos. Describing a photo by telling a story about it may yield more and better tags, as information in stories is organized as a structured, coherent whole. We present a prototype web application, StoryTags, that allows users to tell stories to tag their photos, and then to use those stories to retrieve them.},

abstract = {Decisions about what to eat are often made close to mealtime, when hunger clouds people's ability to think creatively or conscientiously about their meal choices. As a result, people we studied tended to resort to "everyday meals": recipes that are tasty, quick, and cheap. These choices often run counter to cooks' stated values regarding health, variety, ingredient choice, and so forth, but are chosen for their convenience and familiarity. This lack of variety seemed to stem from a scarcity of "everyday" recipes compounded by the fact that usually, at the time they are preparing the meal, cooks are tired, hungry, and don't want to search for or try less familiar recipes. Based on a study of current cooking practices, we developed the SuChef prototype: a low-fidelity probe supporting the in-kitchen display of everyday meal ideas along with the sharing of recipes among members of social groups. The probe was deployed for a week among 5 geographically dispersed but socially connected households and yielded insights into the design space for technology to support everyday cooking.},

We describe why it is important to recognise and consider carers in the design of home health monitoring technology, and why it is important to help carers maintain their health and well being. We present design guidelines for home monitoring technology. These guidelines are distilled from a survey distributed to carers in a rural part of Scotland on health information sharing. We used these guidelines to design a new home monitoring system called @Hand. The main difference with current systems is the focus on facilitating information sharing between cared-for and carer rather than cared-for and health professional.},

abstract = {Intercultural collaboration is often hampered by the manner in which teams communicate, or fail to com-municate, their ideas, concerns, and feelings. Computer-mediated communication and the virtual nature of collaboration tend to exacerbate such communication issues into problems of conversation dominance, misattribution, and group conflict. New communication tools have the potential to mitigate some of these problems by augmenting individuals' and team's awareness of their communication inputs and processes. We explore how such feedback affects the communication content, attention distribution, and affective states of Chinese and American collaborators engaged in a creative de-sign task. We describe our tool, present preliminary findings from an ongoing lab experiment, and discuss next steps in our research regarding ways of detecting the impact of real-time conversation feedback in inter-cultural collaboration environments.},

Existing communication aids lack flexibility and adequate customization functionality failing to address this variability and to satisfy individual user needs. We tackle these shortcomings by incorporating adaptive and adaptable capabilities in ViVA which is designed to assist communication for users suffering from aphasia. The visual vocabulary for aphasia implements a novel approach that organizes the words in the vocabulary according to user preferences, word usage and certain semantic measures, thus continuously tailoring the tool to the user's profile.},

In this case study, we try to identify promoting and limiting factors. We conclude that the value of uncertainty visualization is severely limited by the quality and scope of uncertainty data, by the limited confidence in the data itself, and by the perceptual and cognitive confusion that the depiction of this data can generate. We hope to broaden the discussion on the utility of uncertainty in visualization from the purely technical and perceptual issues to social and organizational factors.},

abstract = {Information is traditionally confined to paper or digitally to a screen. In this paper, we introduce WUW, a wearable gestural interface, which attempts to bring information out into the tangible world. By using a tiny projector and a camera mounted on a hat or coupled in a pendant like wearable device, WUW sees what the user sees and visually augments surfaces or physical objects the user is interacting with. WUW projects information onto surfaces, walls, and physical objects around us, and lets the user interact with the projected information through natural hand gestures, arm movements or interaction with the object itself.},

There are technologies that tackle the problem of interaction with such devices by providing natural interaction to larger surfaces. We argue, however, that large-scale displays offer physical freedom that is not yet being applied to interaction. To better understand how distance affects user interaction, we present a comparative study of interaction metaphors for large-scale displays. We present three metaphors: Grab, Point and Mouse. The metaphors were included in our tests as we felt that each would be more suited to a specific distance: this is the focus of our tests. We then asked the users to solve a puzzle using those metaphors from different distances. We discovered that the point metaphor achieves better results on all tests. However, there is evidence that grab and mouse remain valid for specific tasks.},

Mobile multitasking creates an attention deficit for the user.

We explored these questions through an experiment (N = 243) guided by the heuristic-systematic model in social psychology. Bandwagon/peer cues are generally more persuasive, but when they are inconsistent, the authority cue influences decisions. In general, task involvement promotes systematic processing of these cues. Interestingly, we found no difference in perceived authority between CNET Editor's Choice seal and a seal from a fictitious "authority" (Zig!), among other indications of heuristic processing.

We are investigating the benefits of adding body-based interaction to complement keyboard and mouse interaction in desktop gaming. We present a proof-of-concept implementation of body-based navigation for the game World of Warcraft, and a formative evaluation to test the feasibility of this kind of interaction. Our observations provide evidence that body-based interaction in addition to keyboard and mouse can help players perform more tasks at the same time and can be especially attractive and helpful to new players. Our study also revealed design consideration for this type of interaction.},

abstract = {Existing wearable hand gesture interaction devices are very bulky and cannot be worn in everyday life, because of the presence of a large visual feedback device. In particular, an eyeglass-type head-mounted display is very large for constant usage. To solve this problem, we propose Brainy Hand, which is a simple wearable device that adopts laser line, or more specifically, a mini-projector as a visual feedback device. Brainy Hand consists of a color camera, an earphone, and a laser line or mini-projector. This device uses a camera to detect 3D hand gestures. The earphone is used for receiving audio feedback. In this study, we introduce several user interfaces using Brainy Hand. (e.g., music player, phone)},

abstract = {Architectural designs are not just collections of 3D objects. Architects have both high-level aesthetic design intent, and intent for the functionality of the building; these must eventually translate into real-world construction materials and processes. Physical prototypes are still essential for the architect and their clients to get a feel for whether designs "work". An exciting recent development in architecture is the use of industrial robots to automatically construct 3D prototype architectural models. But programming the robots requires tedious procedures of low-level commands, far removed from the designer's intent.Adeon is a system that integrates high-level architectural design knowledge, including aesthetic and stylistic intent, with knowledge about materials and construction processes, and robot programming code for constructing prototype 3D physical models. It centers around collecting and associating "common sense" knowledge, expressed in English and converted to a knowledge representation about the various levels. It provides a graphic editor that allows architects to draw high-level aesthetic designs, perhaps referencing known styles or historical examples, and retrieving relevant construction, materials, and cost information. It automatically produces a robot program for constructing the prototype. We present examples detailing the design of various styles of brick walls. Adeon is an interesting example of how to provide an interface for creative work that spans both high-level and low-level concerns.},

However, operational methods to capture triggering contextual reasons are not functional in the industry. In addressing this gap, we propose systematic analysis of qualitative user feedback data resources from the field by utilizing our Disconfirmed Expectations Ontology (DEO). DEO provides for an efficient means to elicit relevant -but currently unrecognizable- feedback from the field to communicate that to the respective units in a product development process. We further demonstrate the utilization of DEO on a rich qualitative data set regarding the Apple iPhone".},

Cheese Cam is a camera that can induce unconscious facial reactions in a photography subject, based on mirror neuron theory and facial mimicry theories. A small facial expression icon displayed on Cheese Cam's screen induces unconscious facial reactions in the subject. Experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of Cheese Cam on the facial reactions of subjects, and the results are discussed in this paper.

The goal is to improve the quality of tags, and to reduce the proliferation of incorrect or incomplete tags often found in social networking systems. We also explore the concept of "micro-tagging," which has begun to appear in web-based applications. In "micro-tagging," the user attaches a tag to a subset of large media, such as a segment in a video or a region of an image. InSight allows users to create and edit video micro-tags. Users can mark specific time intervals within a video, and specific spatial locations within video frames, and these tags can be edited by subsequent users. We also present an empirical study which demonstrates an improvement in factual tag quality when the community of users is allowed to edit and delete each others' tags. These results provide a first step in demonstrating how refining tags would make them more valuable for search.},

We designed the evaluations of this tool to evaluate the extent to which designers found the tool valuable and users found the tool true to the way they understand their ecology of interactive artifacts-rather than how closely user's perception of their ecology represents how these devices are actually connected.

The result from this initial study showed that employing a physical metaphor does not always guarantee an improvement of performance; a different effect can be drawn according to the interaction style.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new way for measuring key typing pressure when using off-the-shelf laptop computers. Accelerometers embedded in laptop computers to protect hard discs from sudden motion are becoming very common. This paper explores the concept of utilizing this accelerometer for sensing non-verbal aspects of key typing, such as key typing pressure. This possibility enables a wide variety of pressure-sensitive user interfaces through the use of software without requiring any additional hardware/sensors. Such software can be distributed easily to a substantial number of potential users. To confirm the feasibility of this idea, we compared typing finger velocities (obtained by high-speed camera images) with sensor data from an accelerometer embedded in a laptop computer. We then confirmed that there is a clear correlation between these two sets of data. We also investigated differences in typing pressure patterns among different users. By combining keystroke speeds and typing pressure, we found it is possible to distinguish among users. This feature can be used for security purposes such as preventing a laptop computer from being used by non-owners. We also present possible application ideas such as rich text expression, new types of user interface elements, and authentication.},

abstract = {Users of radar control systems and monitoring applications have to constantly extract essential information from dynamic scenes. In these environments a critical and elemental task consists of tracking multiple targets that are moving simultaneously. However, focusing on multiple moving targets is not trivial as it is very easy to lose continuity, particularly when the objects are situated within a very dense or cluttered background. While focus+context displays have been developed to improve users' ability to attend to important visual information, such techniques have not been applied to the visualization of moving objects. In this paper we evaluate the effectiveness of a focus+context technique, referred to as Semantic Depth of Field (SDOF), to the task of facilitating multiple target tracking. Results of our studies show an inclination for better performance with SDOF techniques, especially in low contrast scenarios.},

abstract = {Public displays are typically situated in strategic places like town centers, and in salient positions on walls within buildings. However, currently most public displays are non-interactive and are typically used for information broadcasting (TV news, advertisements etc). People passing by pay little attention to them. As a consequence, public displays are under-utilized in the everyday world. We are investigating whether use of interactive public displays might increase people's interaction with one another, with a resulting increase in sense of community. In this paper we describe the design and first deployment experiences of a platform-independent, interactive video commenting system using a large public display in two sections of a large-enrollment university class. Our preliminary evaluation suggests that students enjoyed the activity of commenting, that they participated a great deal, and that their sense of community was greater after using the system. We discuss lessons we have learned from this initial experience, and describe further work we are planning using this and similar interactive activities.},

Jadeite's "placeholders" let users add new "pretend" classes or methods that are displayed in the actual API documentation, and can be annotated with the appropriate APIs to use instead. Since studies showed that programmers had difficulty finding the right classes from long lists in documentation, Jadeite takes advantage of usage statistics to display commonly used classes more prominently. Programmers had difficulty finding the right helper objects and discovering how to instantiate objects, so Jadeite uses a large corpus of sample code to automatically identify the most common ways to construct an instance of any given class.},

abstract = {Audio guides are a common way to provide museum visitors with an opportunity for personalized, self-paced information retrieval. However, this personalization conflicts with some of the reasons many people go to museums, i.e., to socialize, to be with friends, and to discuss the exhibit as they experience it [1]. We developed an interactive museum experience based on audio augmented reality that lets the visitor interact with a virtual spatial audio soundscape. In this paper, we present some new interaction metaphors we use in the design of this audio space, as well as some techniques to generate a group experience within audio spaces.},

abstract = {The benefits of pet ownership to physical and mental health are extensive and well documented. Online social networks have the potential to strengthen these relationships and build community among pet owners. In this work, we present several results on the difference in behavior between dog and cat owners in pet-oriented social networks. We extend this analysis to divisions between urban and rural users. Our results show that there are significant differences among these groups. We propose a theory for future testing that more socially isolated the owners are from real-world communities of similar pet owners, the more active they are in forming social connections on these websites, and we offer initial evidence to support this. These results show that these pet social networks are already being used to help support the human-animal bond online, and that different types of pet owners would benefit from different types of support within the systems.},

However, most designs have investigated the use of direct input behind the screen. We demonstrate that behind-the-display interaction with cursor input is promising and can be a useful augmentation to handheld devices. We developed a prototypical system on a PDA to which we affixed a wireless mouse. The mouse is mounted on the rear of the PDA with the optical sensor facing outwards. The system is designed to be used with one hand, and prevents occlusion and finger-reach. Through several applications we propose the benefits associated with behind-the-display cursor interaction. A preliminary user evaluation indicates that users can benefit from such an interaction when operating a handheld using one hand.},

When couples are interested in an item they observe the item for a longer duration of time and have a more balanced speaking style.

Specifically, we discuss practices surrounding hybridities of portable devices and social circles. The layerings of portables help in de-personalizing interactions through evasions, pretence, and resistance. We argue that non-use is not a reason for failure, but is a form of use in itself.},

In a collaborative people-tagging system, users can tag each other with the terms they want, and tags from different users are combined and aggregated. Tags applied to a user usually describe the user's attributes, such as her affiliation, expertise, and the projects she has been involved in. We can thus effectively find interested recipients by matching the content of messages with people's tags. A prototype of our solution has been implemented for a real-world and large-scale people-tagging system in IBM.},

To evaluate such games, researchers observe communication between players synchronized with their actions in-game, discovering instances of team coordination. Coordination is a composite of communication and in-game action; thus it is essential to observe both in context. The tool enables simultaneous observation from each player's viewpoint, synchronized with communication using log files and time-stamped audio. Viewpoints and voice tracks can be selectively soloed and muted, enabling researchers to focus attention. The application can be expanded to support logs and audio from other user studies.},

abstract = {This paper describes the preliminary results of a study conducted to answer the question: Do users attribute moral accountability to personified agent technologies? A pilot study was conducted in which 20 college students interacted with a personified agent, were insulted by the agent, and observed a researcher interacting and insulting the same agent. A semi-structured interview was conducted to investigate the participants' judgments of the observed interactions. Results suggest that most users will hold a designer, programmer or creator responsible for moral violations enacted by the personified agent, rather than attributing accountability to the agent itself.},

As viewers of these visualisation tools, it is up to us to accurately perceive and keep up with the constantly shifting view, mentally noting as visual elements are added, removed, changed and rearranged, sometimes at great pace. In a complex data set with a lot happening, this can be a strain on the observer's comprehension, with changes in layout and visual population disrupting their internalised "mental model" of the data, leading to errors in perception. We present Time Sequences, a novel dual visualisation technique which dilates the flow of time in the visualisation so that observers are given proportionally more time to understand changes based on the density of activity in the visualisation.},

In order to meet the users' needs, the most suitable user interface for a task should be chosen and different kinds of user interfaces have to be integrated appropriately. We addressed these topics and applied a generative framework to structure and analyze a creative work process in the domain of Art History.

We are exploring tools for machinima authoring that use a 3-pronged approach: authoring via metaphor, performance, and automation.

There are some corporations that are famous for their usable products, but small and medium-sized businesses tend to prefer features over usability.

Once defined for a domain, these allow non-usability experts to systematically verify the usability of a given system without any users involved. We picked a sample domain with some basic tasks and found strong indication of our hypothesis: test specifications can be applied by non-experts and are able to find major design flaws. Future work will extend this method to more complex tasks and evaluate the economic benefit.},

The lack of intuitive organization in web browsers forces users to make arbitrary choices on where to store bookmarks. As a result, bookmarks are often lost, never to be used again. These web pages a user bookmarks can say a lot about the user, though. A person's personality is reflected by the web pages a user visits and deems important enough to bookmark. By taking the user's bookmarks along with one's browser history and visualizing them, the user is able to notice things about oneself that he or she did not notice before. In this paper, we describe the iteration of a tool that visualizes all of user's bookmarks. We conclude with areas for future work.},

In this paper, we provide a categorization of multitouch hand and foot gestures for the interaction with spatial data on a large-scale interactive wall.

It does so in a way that takes volume, pitch and content into account. With this information, the visualizations display the data in a meaningful way. Users can use these images in the future to review past conversations whether it is for nostalgia's sake or to recall some piece of information.

abstract = {Email is no longer perceived as a communication marvel, but rather as a constant source of information overload. Several studies have shown that accessing, managing, and archiving email threatens to affect users' productivity. While several strategies and tools have been proposed to assuage this burden, none have attempted to empower users to fight the overload collaboratively. We hypothesize that despite differences in email management practices and frequencies of filing among users, there is some degree of similarity in the end-product of the organizational structures reached by those working in close cooperative roles (e.g. members of a research group, employees of an organization). In this paper, we describe a system that enables collaborators to share their filing strategies among themselves. Tags applied by one user are suggested to other recipients of the same email, thereby amortizing the cost of tagging and email management across all stakeholders. We wish to examine if such system support for semi-automated tagging reduces email overload for all users, and whether it leads to overall time savings for an entire enterprise as network effects propagate over time.},

abstract = {Location-based services are becoming increasingly Web-based, as a result of the availability of networked mobile devices and mobile Internet access. The "Location and the Web (LocWeb)" workshop targets the capabilities and constraints of Web-based location-based services, which can be implemented as browser-based applications, or as native applications using Web services. The focus of this CHI workshop is on approaches which handle the complexity of location-based services, specifically looking at location abstractions, location sharing, context-relevant information, privacy issues, and interface and interaction design. The goal of this workshop is to serve as a starting point for attaining a better understanding of how the Web has to change in order to embrace location as a first-level concept, and how these changes might be reflected in applications and user interfaces that transform the Web into a platform for location-based services.},

This one-day CHI'09 workshop would convene a multidisciplinary group of researchers to discuss strategies for creating community resources that might accelerate research on development of home technologies. In particular, the participants will discuss how to collaboratively gather high quality synchronized data streams from real homes, as well as qualitative material about home occupants and their behaviors. The resultant datasets could facilitate work on context modeling and enable researchers in other areas of HCI to explore contextual factors influencing the use of technology in naturalistic settings. The outcome of the workshop will be a community index of existing shared datasets of home behavior and guidelines for those interested in creating and disseminating new datasets.},

abstract = {This workshop aims to further the understanding of the challenges relating to the evaluation methods of usability and user experience that are specific to Reality-Based Interaction (RBI), and to identify effective practical responses to these challenges. The emergence of Post-WIMP interfaces has led to new ways of interacting with technologies. However, there are still no integrated ways of evaluating the usability and user experience of these interfaces. Developers and designers are left to discover their own metrics and evaluation methods. This approach presents problems, in that the metrics used in each case may provide results that are neither valid nor meaningful. For this reason, the time is ripe to integrate the methods that have been developed for evaluating interfaces that belong to the RBI umbrella. The measures and techniques will then be turned into a framework that enables designers of RBI interfaces to select appropriately existing methods and tools to evaluate systematically the usability and user experience of their prototypes and products. Reusing and adapting validated evaluation approaches can not only avoid reinventing the wheel and wasting time but also further improve and consolidate these approaches. Such a framework will also provide a basis for comparison between designs of RBI interfaces in different application contexts.},

abstract = {The confluence of two major trends in scientific research is leading to an upheaval in standard scientific practice. A new generation of scientists, working in large-scale collaborations, is repurposing social software for use in collaborative science. Existing social tools such as chat, IM, and FriendFind are being adopted and modified for use as group problem-solving facilities. At the same time, exponentially greater and more complex datasets are being generated at a rate that is challenging the limits of current hardware, software, and human cognitive capability. A concerted effort to develop new software tools to handle this data tsunami is redefining the collaboratory and represents a new frontier for computer supported cooperative work.We are hoping this workshop can build community among researchers studying and/or building software for scientific collaborations.},

abstract = {People tinker, hack, fix, reuse, and assemble materials in creative and unexpected ways, often codifying and sharing their production process with others. Do-it-yourself (DIY) encompasses a range of design activities that have become increasingly prominent in online discussion forums and blogs, in addition to a small-but-growing presence in professional/research forums such as CHI. This workshop will explore DIY practice from the ground up--examining DIY as a set of methods, communities, values and goals and examining its impact in the domains of traditional crafts, technology development, and sustainable design.},

abstract = {Sustainability is an increasingly prominent and critical theme in the field of HCI. More needs to be known about how to critique and assess design from the perspective of sustainability, and how to integrate sustainability into the practice of HCI. This workshop focuses on achieving this integration, identifying challenges, and defining directions for Sustainable Interaction Design (SID).},
