abstract = {For the huge amounts of audio and video material that could usefully be included in digital libraries, the cost of producing human-generated annotations and meta-data is prohibitive. In the Informedia Digital Video Library, the production of meta-data supporting the library interface is automated using techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI). By applying speech recognition, natural language processing and image analysis, the interface helps users locate the information they want and navigate or browse the digital video library more effectively. Specific AI-based interface components include automatic titles, filmstrips, video skims, word location marking and representative frames for shots.},

abstract = {MOBI-D (Model-Based Interface Designer) is a software environment the design and development of user interfaces from declarative interface models. End-users informally describe tasks and data, from end-users, from which developers construct formal models of user tasks and domain objects. The system supports development of presentation and dialog specifications from such models, and allows visualization of interface designs as units encompassing all relations and dependencies among the elements of task, data and user-interface specifications, MOBI-D is the first development environment to define an interface model as a comprehensive conceptual object, to identify an interface design as a declarative component of an interface model, and to establish a development cycle based on such a model. The sharable nature of the interface modeling language of MOBI-D, along with the open architecture of its system opens the door for many research areas in HCI to explore the benefits and potential of using interface models.},

A key component of the system is the continuous scaling of the scene so that it always appears just behind the screen. This scaling is done even when flying over a virtual landscape. Because the scene is scaled, it is always in the right position for Fish Tank VR viewing. In addition, the scaling removes some of the problems that commonly occur with stereoscopic displays, it puts objects in the appropriate place for manipulation, and it can be used to modulate the flight velocity. The system is demonstrated with a cable laying application.},

Third, Dynomite's properties and keywords allow retrieval of specific ink and notes: the user sees a view of a subset of the notebook content that dynamically changes as the users add new information. Finally, Dynomite continuously records audio, but only permanently stores portions highlighted by the user, making it is possible to augment handwritten notes with audio on devices with limited storage.},

abstract = {In end-user programming it is still hard to overcome the tension between usability and expressiveness. Some end-user programming approaches focus on simple use but they make it hard or even impossible to write programs expressing useful functionality. Other programming approaches can be very expressive by allowing the construction of arbitrary complex programs but this expressiveness comes at the price of usability. End user programming approaches that are at least reasonably usable and expressive at the same time require not merely a syntactic improvement of programming languages but a new way to conceptualize the programming process in a social context. Social behavior processing describes the idea of elevating programming components to the level of easily composable and decomposable entities that can be shared through the World Wide Web with a community of end-users. The Agentsheets Behavior Exchange is outlined here as a forum for end-user programmers, including middle school kids and professionals, to (a) compose behaviors in order to create interactive SimCity™-like simulations and games, to (b) comprehend behaviors created by other users or by themselves, and to (c) share these behaviors with other users.},

In order to compensate for these shortcomings it is necessary to integrate interpretation and interaction abilities of individual users into future presentation and editing systems. We are developing a chart editing system which generates critics by user request. These critics are based on a user model, on expert knowledge in chart editing and on the currently edited chart. The system helps the author to avoid commonly made mistakes. It empowers recipients to adjust certain parameters (e.g.: colors) to their individual abilities and needs.},

This study will evaluate how the inclusion of landmark icons in ATIS displays affects users' navigation performance.

The potential for the use of computers in support of interaction between learners, their peers and remote information sources has revealed important weaknesses inherent in current approaches to navigation support.

abstract = {Telematics applications are applications based on the integration of information and communication technologies and services, e.g. tele-medicine systems, telework systems, traffic management systems. New technologies in this field are potentially very important for co-operation and exchange of information within and between organisations and communities. There is however a critical aspect in the development of these applications: the design and evaluation of these new technologies are often mainly technology-driven. The development and introduction of new technologies would progress more adequately if they could be evaluated systematically from a users point of view. In evaluating user aspects of telematic applications, a set of related interacting factors should be considered: i.e. the interaction of users, tasks and technical system in a 'context-of-use'. In this Special Interest Group attention is given to approaches and methods to evaluate telematic applications from a user(organisation) perspective and in the framework of the total development process. This implies simultaneous attention to several questions: to what extent is the interface 'usable', to what cum is interpersonal communication adequate, and what are the effects on task performance and (organisational) context.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web is often viewed as the latest and most user friendly way of providing information over the Internet (i.e., server of documents). It is not customarily viewed as a platform for developing and deploying applications. In this tutorial, we introduce and demonstrate how Web technologies can be used in combination with Web browsers to design, create, distribute and execute collaborative applications. We discuss how HTML in combination with CGI scripts, JavaScript, and Java can be used to develop interactive and collaborative applications. We discuss recent extensions and additions that support sophisticated application development as well as the constraints with the WWW 'Shell' approach. The term World Wide Web 'Shell' is used in a manner analogous to the use of the term Expert System Shell. Specifically, the components of the WWW provide basic functionality and services for developing application in much the same way as an expert system shell provides components for developing expert system applications.},

How should the customers be chosen and how should visits to them be set up? Who should be on the project? It's no wonder people find it hard to get started with these new techniques in their own organizations.This tutorial gets participants over the roadblocks in the way of using contextual techniques in their projects. We walk through the different aspects of a contextual project, describing the issues that need to be resolved, the different approaches that can work, and the principles which guide making a choice. We use exercises to give participants the chance to plan aspects of their own projects, so they can do the thinking process themselves and raise any questions raised by their own situations.This tutorial is appropriate to anyone wishing to use field methods to gather customer data for their projects.

abstract = {Field data gathering techniques such as Contextual Inquiry enable a design team to gather the detailed data they need. These techniques produce enormous amounts of information on how the customers of a system work. This creates a new problem---how to represent all this detail in a coherent, comprehensible form, which can be a suitable basis for design. An affinity diagram effectively shows the scope of the customer problem, but is less effective at capturing and coherently representing the details of how people work. Design teams need a way to organize this detail so they can use it in their own development process.In this tutorial we present our latest methods for representing detailed information about work practice and using these representations to drive system design. These methods have been adopted over the last few years by major product development and information systems organizations. We show how to represent the work of individual users in models, how to generalize these to describe a whole market or department, and how to use these to drive innovative design. We present the process by which we build and use the models and practice key steps. We show how these methods fit into the overall design process, and summarize Contextual Design, which gathers field data and uses it to drive design through a well-defined series of steps.The tutorial is appropriate for those who have used field techniques, especially Contextual Inquiry, and would like to put more structure on the process of using field data.We use shopping as our example of work practice throughout this tutorial, since shopping is simple and understood by everyone. We encourage participants to go grocery shopping shortly before the tutorial, and bring any shopping list they may have used, their store receipt, and a drawing of the store layout and their movement through it.},

Dynamic queries involve the interactive control by a user of visual query parameters that generate rapid (100 ms update), animated, and visual displays of database search results. The data of early implementations was stored in local memory to guarantee optimal speed. Problems arise when the data is very large and distributed over a network. To overcome the problems of slow networks and data volume we propose a two-phase approach to query formulation using query previews and query refinements [1]. Preview mechanisms have been used in the past [2] and we believe that their use will be a major component of successful networked information systems interfaces (e.g. [3]).},

abstract = {Interaction design is becoming increasingly complex and diverse. Complexity increases because existing technologies are becoming smaller and cheaper and thus more ubiquitous, even as new I/O devices are invented. This complexity is increased by the task of integrating technologies into workplaces which we are recognizing as filled with existing customs and practices. Simultaneously, interaction design is becoming more diverse. Within CHI, it is well accepted that anthropologists, psychologists, and visual designers, as well as engineers and computer scientists, have roles to play in systems design. And as new technologies and application domains appear on the scene, the need for disciplines such as industrial and product design, architecture, interior design, music and film becomes evident. Another factor driving diversity is customization. As systems become increasingly customizable, more design is done in-house by MIS departments, outside consultants, or the end users.

A body of research is beginning to accumulate that explores systems, such as pen-based sketching applications, to support the user in dealing with ill-defined concepts and materials. The key idea is that a person needs be able to easily create a visual representation, even for abstract and verbal ideas, and then respond to it perceptually to discover new arrangements and shapes representing new ideas. The new concepts emerge from the concrete materials of the visual representation. (This basic idea is expressed by the sociologist Donald Sch\"{o}n in The Reflective Practitioner.)},

abstract = {Usability studies are usually conducted in a compressed time scale (measured in hours) compared with a user's eventual experience with a product (often measured in years). For this reason, typical usability evaluations focus on success during initial interactions with a product (sea for example Dumas &amp; Redish, 1994 and Nielsen &amp; Mack, 1994). Success on initial use is often driven by familiarity. Are what we call "intuitive" user interfaces really just familiar user interfaces? This "familiarity effect" can often swamp the usability differences between design alternatives. If usability evaluations continue to emphasize initial success with a product we may inhibit innovation in user interface design. There is a tension between initial usability (measured by success at first encounter) and efficiency of skilled performance. Initial learning of a product's user interface often results in quite rapid increases in efficiency of use. A narrow focus on initial usability elevates learnability above efficiency once "up the learning curve". While this approach is appropriate for some products targeted primarily for casual / occasional users, it fails to capture the usability issues associated with power users (those with significant experience, training, or a professional orientation to their interaction with the product).},

abstract = {There have been dramatic improvements during the last decade in the performance of both automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems and the computers on which they run. Speaker independent recognition with an active vocabulary of over 1,000 items is now possible even under the difficult conditions imposed by the public switched telephone network. The impressive raw recognition power of commercial recognizers has led to the development of a wide range of complex information, call management, and transaction services that rely on ASR. Despite this progress, it has become clear that recognition performance in the lab is not a good predictor of success in the field, and that extensive work on dialogue design and human factors "tuning" is required before most services can be used successfully by the general population. Since recognizer capabilities strongly influence user-interface design, and since these capabilities have been changing rapidly over the past decade, there is no clear body of knowledge that a designer can turn to when developing new services that rely on speech.},

The evolving art work / browsing session can be shaped by the user. The temporal composition of the collage develops with relation to its visual composition and semantic content. The CollageMachine engine combines structured randomness and the user's expression of preferences and interests with design rules and semantic rules to make decisions about the collage's layout, and about which media to retrieve.

abstract = {This poster describes a study conducted by the Human Interface Design department at Fidelity Investments Systems Company. The purpose of this study was to obtain performance and preference data about various methods of displaying data definitions in online help. The four methods studied were an alphabetical list of data elements with pop-up definitions, a window-ordered list with pop-up definitions, a screen shot of the window with pop-up definitions, and a table listing all data elements and their definitions. Performance and preference data indicated that the alphabetical list was the best.},

Seven techniques were studied: no indication, bold field labels, chevrons in front of the labels, check marks to the right of the input fields, a different background color, grouping them separately, and a status bar indication. Performance and preference data were collected. In general, we found that the two worst methods were no indication and the status bar. The best method was separate groups.},

abstract = {Expert users of programs that handle complicated data management problems develop methods for coping with data overload, multi-user cooperation, and real-time situations. These expert methods incorporate domain and/or user interface knowledge. If such methods were inherent in a system, then novice users could benefit from the expert's experience, the learning curve would be shortened and a more effective system would result. Defining and implementing a complete set of expert methods at design time is a daunting task. Collecting such information from a system's usage, after it has been deployed, should provide a more accurate database of expert methodologies, Current adaptive systems attempt to capture and automate such features during run-time. However, these systems can never evolve very far beyond their original design, since the adaptations occur within the scope of that design. Our method is to offer the expert's usage database as input to the designer, reintroducing the designer in the development cycle after a system has been deployed initially, so that a more effective system can be produced in the next generation.},

An innovative debrief process was developed to understand, summarize and document each visit. In addition to a structured debrief questionnaire, the team created graphical summary notes using "mind maps." These mind maps efficiently captured a nonlinear, graphical clustering of key ideas. A "causal loop diagram" was also developed to document the team's understanding of the internal and external driving forces for each organization. Taken together, the debrief questionnaire, the mind maps, and the causal loop diagrams provided a rich multimedia representation of the field data.},

abstract = {We describe a prototype two-ball mouse containing the electronics and mechanics of two mice in a single chassis. Unlike a conventional mouse, which senses x-axis and y-axis displacement only, our mouse also senses z-axis angular motion. This is accomplished through simple calculations on the two sets of x-y displacement data. Our mouse looks and feels like a standard mouse, however certain primitive operations are performed with much greater ease. The rotate tool -- common in most drawing programs -- becomes redundant as objects are easily moved with three degrees of freedom. Mechanisms to engage the added degree of freedom and different interaction techniques are discussed.},

This paper describes a set of tools that allow designers to view documents stored locally while experiencing response time delays as if the documents were delivered from a different location on the network. By using measured network latencies to drive an instrumented World-Wide Web server, we allow designers to view the documents they create from the perspective of someone sitting down the hall, across the country, or across an ocean.},

abstract = {This paper investigates human bias, consistency and individual differences when performing object manipulation in a virtual environment. Eight subjects were asked to manipulate a wooden cube to match a 3-D graphic target cube presented in 3 locations and 2 orientations. There were two visual conditions for the experiment: the subject performed the tasks with or without vision of the hand and the wooden cube. The constant errors of object translation and orientation suggested specific human biases. In terms of the variable errors, visual feedback appeared to be more critical for object transportation than object orientation. It was also found that individual differences were more pronounced in human bias than in consistency during object manipulation. These results suggest tolerance for human bias and variability should be accommodated in human-computer interface design.},

abstract = {Understanding scientific engineering concepts requires learners to correlate between different model representations. Simple engineering models are formulated mathematically, visualized with one or more graphs, and verbally interpreted with engineering terminology. Past [4] and present systems [1] allow learners to modify a limited set of model parameters but not the graph-plot itself. This paper describes a set of interactive learning models consisting of standard interactors together with novel direct-manipulation Responsive Graphs. By setting values with sliders and visually modifying graph-plots, users qualitatively explore and comprehend abstract engineering concepts through interactive experimentation. All model representations are continuously updated in real-time enabling users to compare and move between different model representations. These highly interactive learning experiences are the result of a collaboration between interaction designers seeking direct manipulation of graphics and engineering domain-experts.},

The results demonstrated user sensitivity to delays. As expected, for text-and-graphics documents, shorter delays provoked more favorable responses. However, for text-only documents, the shorter the delay, the less favorably a document was viewed. The results indicated that users may prefer multi-media web sites but are unwilling to tolerate the substantial network delays often associated with delivering graphics, video, animation, and audio.},

It is intended to address the children's need for increased human interaction and social development, mastery and control, and comfort and security. Billow addresses these needs by enabling isolated children to play together and communicate in a locally networked, audio-visual play environment.},

An evaluation experiment was performed in which the experimental system changed each of five kinds of targets (1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 dots in diameter respectively, 0.36 mm per dot) and eight directions of penmovement, while using each of six kinds of strategies of approaching the target on a pen-based computer. Two results were obtained: (1) The "Land-on2" strategy was found to be the best strategy for selecting a minute target among the six strategies, in terms of error rates, selection time and subjective evaluation. (2) This study also clarified a boundary value of target which controlled difficulty of strategy. When a target is less than 5 dots (1.80 mm), it is necessary to pay attention to the determination of the strategy in the software design.},
