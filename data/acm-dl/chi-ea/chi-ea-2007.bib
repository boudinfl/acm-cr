abstract = {The design of gestural user interfaces is uniquely challenging because the input is freeform, personal, and often carries subconscious meanings that are domain-specific and difficult to articulate. These features suggest an approach of observation-based design: learning from what people do, rather than relying on what they say. To facilitate observation-based design, this dissertation is exploring two design methods: gesture brainstorming, a Wizard of Oz method for early prototyping of new interfaces, and gesture log analysis, a machine learning-based log analysis method for improving existing interfaces. These design methods will be tested by applying them to two gestural interfaces: a 3D pathway selection interface (CINCH, see Figure 1), and a 3D modeler (Google SketchUp). Experience with CINCH already suggests the utility of observation-based design, while work on Google SketchUp is anticipated to begin this summer. These test cases should inform observation-based design for gestural user interfaces in general.},

Even though recent advances on ICT have enabled people to be in touch with remote family or friends, community context obtained by migrants is arguably partial. My dissertation will focus on an exploratory study of different communication channels used by migrants to communicate to and from their community of origin. The contributions of my work will provide an understanding of the nature of community connectedness of migrants as well as the information elements involved on increasing the sense of connection itself. This knowledge might be used for the better design of communication technologies.},

In order to conduct such an investigation, I recorded ten meetings of graduate student designers charged with redesigning documents for the United States Postal Service. I then used discourse analysis techniques to determine how the designers used findings from research phases as evidence to support proposed design decisions in meetings concerning prototype alterations. Results show that these designers overwhelmingly do not support their design decisions with specific evidence from usability studies. This neglect of research-based evidence may indicate that these novice UCD designers may resort to designer-centric design behaviors in decision-making periods. My analysis will focus on the rhetorical reasons why designers may avoid research-based evidence.},

Consequently, the technical mechanisms fail to match the highly flexible, nuanced, and contextual human spatial activities.

This combination proved useful without the high cost of driving simulators and instrumented test subjects. Using cognitive modeling, we could identify the potential problems for certain tasks. For example, we found that automating the task of running a license plate with a typical mouse-keyboard interface, could increase the workload by more than seven hundred percent compared with doing the same task via radio contact with dispatcher. We also found measuring by glances instead of time to be a useful technique in practice.},

How can we avoid leaving the less gifted and less enthused students behind in a 12-week module packed with theories, methodologies and with a new development tool to learn? This paper describes how educational research findings were deployed to address the above issues across four semesters in an HCI module at a UK university. Kolb's experiential learning cycle was successfully applied to the design and scheduling of course content and learning activities to enhance students' learning outcomes. Surveys of the students - both at the beginning and at the end of each semester - consistently showed improvement in students' understanding, perception and satisfaction with the module.},

A central design theme influenced the software solution: If a networking expert was advising a user on how to set up, configure, and secure a home network, what would this person tell the user to do?.In this case study, insights about creating a new home networking program to solve the challenges are discussed. Results indicated animations, good default settings and a network map increased the user success rate for network setup.},

We found that the activity helped students learn about the difficulties involved in observing and being observed. It also taught them about the value of observing users, even if they are performing tasks familiar to the observer. Having international students in the class brought an additional perspective to the activity which benefited everyone. These students discussed the difficulty of observing experts conduct tasks that are unfamiliar to the observer.

These include (1) the need for customized test environments, (2) the potential for audio interference between screen reader output and the moderator to participant dialogue, and (3) the difficulty for observers inexperienced in accessibility technology. In this paper we outline several techniques for dealing with these challenges, including some variations on traditional think-aloud techniques that are useful when a usability participant is using a screen reader.},

Customers can get e-mail information by touching their IC card ticket on the reader located near the poster. Two pilot tests are conducted before the service has begun. The first test revealed that many people preferred the interactive poster but the registration process was complicated. The second test was conducted after improving the registration process. The lessons learned through two pilot tests are that in addition to the easier registration process, the increased popularity of two dimensional barcode reader in mobile phone has lowered the barrier of registration process.The SuiPo has been introduced in July 31st, 2006 and started service at Shinjuku Station and Tokyo Station. We hope the implementation would change customers' perception of Suica not only as a ticket or e-money but also as an information tool.},

But to.get real. in HCI prototyping and evaluations risks placing even greater (more unrealistic) demands upon the HCI researcher.

We show how the dynamics of the physical model can be shaped to make the handling qualities of the mobile device fit the browsing task. We implemented the proposed algorithm on Samsung MITs PDA with tri-axis accelerometer and a vibrotactile motor. The experiment used seven novice users browsing from 100 photos. We compare a tilt-based interaction method with a button-based browser and an iPod wheel. We discuss the usability performance and contrast this with subjective experience from the users. The iPod wheel has significantly poorer performance than button pushing or tilt interaction, despite its commercial popularity.},

abstract = {City maps are an important means to get an impression of the structure of cities. They represent visual abstraction of urban areas with different geographic entities, their locations, and spatial relations. However, this information is not sufficiently accessible today to blind and visually impaired people. To provide a non-visual access to map information, we developed an interactive auditory city map, which uses 3D non-speech sound to convey the position, shape, and type of geographic objects. For the interactive exploration of the auditory map, we designed a virtual walk-through. This allows the user to gain an overview of an area. To be able to focus on certain regions of the map, we equip the user with an auditory torch. With the auditory torch users can change the number of displayed objects in a self directed way. To further aid in getting a global idea of the displayed area we additionally introduce a bird's eye view on the auditory map. Our evaluation shows that our approaches enable the user to gain an understanding of the explored environment.},

abstract = {This interactive project uses the metaphor of human sleep and dreaming to present a novel paradigm that helps address problems in adaptive user interface design. Two significant problems in adaptive interfaces are: interfaces that adapt when a user does not want them to do so, and interfaces where it is hard to understand how it changed during the process of adaptation. In the project described here, the system only adapts when the user allows it to go to sleep long enough to have a dream. In addition, the dream itself is a visualization of the transformation of the interface, so that a person may see what changes have occurred. This project presents an interim stage of this system, in which an autonomous agent collects knowledge about its environment, falls asleep, has dreams, and reconfigures its internal representation of the world while it dreams. People may alter the agent's environment, may prevent it from sleeping by making noise into a microphone, and may observe the dream process that ensues when it is allowed to fall asleep. By drawing on the universal human experience of sleep and dreaming, this project seeks to make adaptive interfaces more effective and comprehensible.},

In combination, Building Upon Everyday Play furthers a pervasive gaming experience through appropriation of objects in the player's environment and enables new ways to play.The project consists of a combination of a portable, wireless motion-sensing clamp that can be attached to everyday objects to turn them into game controllers by proxy, and a programming-by-demonstration system that translates sensor data reported by the controller into game events. In the demonstration, participants will be able to play custom video games projected on a large 2D screen by attaching the clamp to their bodies or provided household objects, and to invent their own moves to control the provided games.},

A focus on experience also means that research concentrating on such technologies produces a different kind of knowledge than task-focused HCI, and that this knowledge must be validated in different ways. Importantly, this focus means that evaluation techniques designed for evaluating task-focused measures, such as classical notions of usability, are inadequate (although far from unnecessary) for the evaluation of experience.

Similarly, the non reliability of interactive software can jeopardize usability evaluation by showing unexpected or undesired behaviors. Lastly, iterative design processes promote multiple designs through evolvable prototypes in order to accommodate requirements changes and results from usability evaluations thus reducing reliability of the final system by lack of global and structured design.

Furthermore, many existing strategies for conveying these characteristics and teaching the deaf how to perceive them do not seem efficient, especially when dealing with the concept of pitch. As a result, some deaf people are not fully capable of differentiating between voice characteristics. Paradoxically, this doesn.t only apply to the deaf, but many of the hearing do not know the difference between pitch and loudness; when asked to generate a higher-pitched sound, many generate a louder sound. These were some of several reasons that led to my exploration of additional approaches to the visual representation of voice. I developed and employed non-speech voice-controlled applications in analyzing the interaction patterns of seven deaf children. The aim was to explore the potential role of paralinguistic vocal control of interactive media in enabling the deaf to have a greater understanding of voice and to offer their instructors more efficient and engaging strategies for explaining voice characteristics.},

We apply this new approach to a Tangible User Interface, built as a Wizard of Oz interface, to illustrate the new method, and compare CoDeIn.s results to a GOMS model. We show that CoDeIn provides some promise of representing the parallel processing and new modes of physical interaction inherent in reality-based interfaces, and CoDeIn does a better job in predicting the completion time of an example task than GOMS.},

abstract = {Tabletop interfaces provide a new medium for collocated collaboration. Consequently, tabletops need to support access to file systems, just as a core facility of conventional computer systems is to provide an interface to a file system. However, the constraints of tabletop interfaces call for rethinking standard approaches to file system interaction. This paper presents the design of OnTop, a novel associative-search approach to file system interaction: users navigate multiple file systems by selecting focus files, retrieving similar ones. We report a small-scale qualitative evaluation of OnTop against a more conventional file browser approach: OnTop was consistently preferred and found to be more efficient, especially for larger file collections.},

A two condition, between-subjects study was conducted in which 60 eight and nine year-old children interacted with a personified agent and observed a researcher interacting with the same agent. A semi-structured interview was conducted to investigate the children.s judgments of the observed interactions.

abstract = {In India there is an inequitable distribution of wealth and resources; while 70% of population lives in villages, about 80 % of ophthalmologists practice in cities [4]. India has 1 ophthalmologist per 100,000 of its population [4] and this ratio is even more dismal for rural areas. In such circumstances, ophthalmologist- based model is not a cost- effective screening method. On the other hand, an ophthalmologist led screening model offers a cost-effective and feasible screening model for screening of eye diseases. Such a model can be beneficial in filling the critical gaps in the government health services. Based on ethnographic studies conducted in Assam, India, We propose and discuss the design of an experimental interactive interface that can help trained rural health workers diagnose and classify the extent of cataract in the preliminary stages. This has two significant benefits:1. The Cataract patients, usually old, and living in rural areas do not have to travel miles away from home only to be told to come back a few months later as the cataract was not sufficiently mature for a surgery yet.2. It provides for a more efficient system that helps the already overburdened ophthalmologists concentrate their time on patients who actually need immediate surgeries thus directly influencing the quality of eye care.},

A pilot study indicates that such a system helps equalize sketching contribution within a group although it reduces total sketching of the group as a whole. This finding suggests that individual access to a shared sketching space has implications for the brainstorming process such as a greater awareness of the quality and the relative amount of individual idea contribution.},

To achieve this, we match visualization and interaction metaphors by the principle of dimensional congruence. This results in a sophisticated and more intuitive user interface.

abstract = {Interactions in which computer agents comfort users through expressed empathy have been shown to be important in alleviating user frustration and increasing user liking of the agent, and may have important healthcare applications. Given the current state of technology, designers of these systems are forced to choose between (a) allowing users to freely express their feelings, but having the agents provide imperfect empathic responses, or (b) greatly restricting how users can express themselves, but having the agents provide very accurate empathic feedback. This study investigates which of these options leads to better outcomes, in terms of comforting users and increasing user-agent social bonds. Results, on almost all measures, indicate that empathic accuracy is more important than user expressivity.},

Drawing on critical theory it considers how value might be added to digital music by embedding it in artifacts. Three product design students were briefed to create concept designs for.digital music boxes. that would contain and display particular back catalogues of music. The paper reflects on their sketches and models and argues that critical theory can inform new approaches to design work.},

abstract = {We present and evaluate a new technique for performing diary studies under mobile or active conditions. Diary studies play an important role as a means for ecologically valid participant data capture. Unfortunately, when participants are asked to capture data while mobile or active, they are often unwilling or unable to invest time in thorough, reflective entries. Ultimately, this leads to lowered entry quality and quantity. The technique presented here suggests the capture of only small snippets of information in the field. These snippets then serve as prompts for participants when completing full diary entries at a convenient time. We describe how this system automates collection of snippets via text (SMS), picture (MMS) and voicemail messages and later presents these snippets for full entry elicitation. We then present results from a preliminary evaluation of this technique.},

First, a framework is adapted for the taxonomy of empirical mobile usability studies. Second, results of a qualitative review of 45 empirical mobile usability studies include: i) a summary of the core and peripheral usability dimensions measured; ii) a detailed analysis of contextual factors studied; and iii) key findings that provide the basis for a research agenda in mobile usability.},

It supports a strong motivational framework based on ubiquitous computer gaming, appealing enough to likely change the behavior of "couch potatoes" on their own volition. This novel generation of computer games (NEAT-o-games) is fueled by activity data recorded by small wearable sensors. Data from the sensors are logged wirelessly to a Personal Digital Assistant/Cell Phone (PDA), which acts as the central computing unit of the system. Algorithmic software processes these data and computes the energy expenditure of the user in real-time. The paper presents a prototype implementation of NEAT-o-games and initial evaluation results.},

abstract = {This paper presents our research on the process of creating new communication experiences in the private sphere of users. To do this, we have chosen to study the concept of social presence, and also the notion of communication. The communication models that we have examined come from various disciplines and all have in common the fact that they focus on exploring the communication act once the decision to communicate has been taken. We have build upon them and conceived a model that includes an analysis of the factors that influence the decision to communicate. This initial analysis has helped us integrate the specific needs of our targeted users and has allowed us to materialize them in a working prototype of a communication terminal called TACT.},

abstract = {Tactons (tactile icons) are structured vibrotactile messages which can be used for non-visual information presentation. Information can be encoded in a set of Tactons by manipulating parameters available in the tactile domain. One limitation is the number of available usable parameters and research is ongoing to find further effective ones. This paper reports an experiment investigating different techniques (amplitude modulation, frequency, and waveform) for creating texture as a parameter for use in Tacton design. The results of this experiment show recognition rates of 94% for waveform, 81% for frequency, and 61% for amplitude modulation, indicating that a more effective way to create Tactons using the texture parameter is to employ different waveforms to represent roughness. These results will aid designers in creating more effective and usable Tactons.},

abstract = {When authoring in visual storytelling environments, children are often limited to use characters and props available in libraries or have to create their own using software. We present a novel alternative in the early design and implementation of Vuelta, a tool for creating animated characters and props using real-world objects. Vuelta authors can create animations for real-world characters and props by capturing animation frames using a high-definition camera. Each frame is captured from many directions enabling the characters and props to be positioned in any direction. We use an image difference algorithm to extract the characters and props from the frames. Our setup is designed to support creativity by enabling authors to use objects of their choice that they may create with their own hands and by not putting limits on the types of animations that may be created. Vuelta is also designed to support collaboration by enabling more than one author to participate in the process. The next steps in our development of Vuelta include working with children to design a tool to edit the animations, as well as integrating Vuelta with a storytelling environment we are developing.},

abstract = {Because they are easy to create and modify, low fidelity prototypes are commonly used in early evaluations of user interface designs. Designers typically use either pen-and-paper or various computer-based tools to create and test low fidelity prototypes; however, our informal analyses of these existing technologies indicate that they do not optimally support the two key, complementary tasks of (a) prototype creation and (b) wizard of oz testing. To address this problem, we have been developing WOZ Pro (Wizard of Oz Prototyper), a pen-based software environment for the quick and easy creation and testing of low fidelity user interface prototypes. We are designing WOZ Pro to be as easy to use as pen-and-paper, but to hold key advantages over pen-and-paper and existing computer-based tools. When designing interface screens in WOZ Pro, designers can easily (a) propagate a design change to other related screens, and (b) specify the set of screens that are reachable from a given screen. In a wizard of oz test, WOZ Pro reduces the cognitive load on the wizard by allowing navigation only to those next screens that are valid. We are planning a controlled experiment to compare WOZ Pro against paper-and-pencil along several measures in a set of prototype creation and evaluation tasks.},

We suggest using an alternative metric that varies the cutoff date according to the properties of each individual blog, and show how its results relate to those of the standard 30-day active metric.

This means that calibration between the two coordinate systems of a projector and a camera will have to be no more a one-time setup procedure but a dynamic process. The best solution will be to remove the need for calibration from the beginning by having a projector and a camera share the same lens system. The iProCam is a projector-camera system that realized this idea using a beam splitter and a time-multiplexing scheme. Sharing the same lens system also makes it possible to keep a projector in focus by keeping a camera in focus.

This paper uses an interactive genetic algorithm to evolve XUL user interface layouts by combining objective and subjective metrics. The genetic algorithm encodes expert knowledge from prominent usability guidelines as objective heuristics. Further, the graphical user interface developer (or user!) biases and guides the evolution of the interfaces by subjectively evaluating and selecting the.best. and.worst. interfaces from a small set of displayed interface prototypes. We explore how the selection of individuals from the population to be displayed to the user for subjective evaluation affects the convergence of the genetic algorithm and show that our methodology can produce effective interfaces that reflect subjective user-preferred aesthetics.},

An isovist is defined as the set of all points visible in all directions from a given vantage point in space. The overlap in isovists from two or more locations can be used to assess reciprocal visibility and thereby assist in the placement of large displays for public or shared use. We illustrate the value of isovists for HCI research using field data from two OR suites in two major urban hospitals. First, we show how patterns of interaction between anesthesiologists and nurses in each of two OR suites are associated with quantity of isovist overlap.

abstract = {Multimodal user interfaces (MMUI) allow users to control computers using speech and gesture, and have the potential to minimise users. experienced cognitive load, especially when performing complex tasks. In this paper, we describe our attempt to use a physiological measure, namely Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), to objectively evaluate users. stress and arousal levels while using unimodal and multimodal versions of the same interface. Preliminary results show that users. GSR readings significantly increase when task cognitive load level increases. Moreover, users. GSR readings are found to be lower when using a multimodal interface, instead of a unimodal interface. Cross-examination of GSR data with multimodal data annotation showed promising results in explaining the peaks in the GSR data, which are found to correlate with sub-task user events. This interesting result verifies that GSR can be used to serve as an objective indicator of user cognitive load level in real time, with a very fine granularity.},

abstract = {Wikis are an invaluable tool for quickly and easily creating and editing a collection of web pages. Their use is particularly interesting in small teams to serve as a support for group communication, for co-ordination, as well as for creating collaborative document products. In spite of the very real appeal of the wiki for these purposes, there is a serious challenge due to their complexity. Team members can have difficulty identifying the structure and salient elements of the wiki. This paper describes the design of WikiNavMap, an alternative visual representation for wikis, which provides an overview of the wiki structure. Based on analysis of student wikis, we identified factors that help team members identify which wiki pages are currently relevant to them. We hypothesised that a structural overview coupled with the visual representations of these factors could assist users with wiki navigation decisions. We report a preliminary evaluation with a large group wiki, created over a full university semester by a group of ten users. The results are promising for a small wiki but point to challenges in coping with the complexity of a larger one.},

However, people are often unwilling to spend the time and effort to carry out annotation. To solve this problem, we focus on real-time annotation where photographs are annotated at the time when they are taken. We propose a novel digital camera,.WillCam., which enables users to capture various information, such as location, temperature, ambient noise, and photographer facial expression, in addition to the photo itself. WillCam also helps users express their interest -what object or information in the picture/scene is most important for them- visually.},

abstract = {Within the HCI community, there is a growing interest in how technology is used and appropriated outside the workplace. In this paper, we present preliminary findings of how large displays, projection systems, and presentation software are used in American megachurches to support religious practice. These findings are based on ten visits to church services by the study.s authors. We describe how large display technology augments and replaces certain church traditions, and finish by discussing issues related to the design for church environments that are highlighted by this use of technology.},

We compared the new methods with the mouse acceleration that is the most common cursor control method. An evaluation study showed that the new methods required smaller number of scrapings and shorter distance of scraping on the touchpad while their efficiency is similar to that of the mouse acceleration. All participants preferred the new methods to the mouse acceleration.},

Our hand-held wand can be used to (1) record sound, then (2) playback the recording by brushing, scraping, striking or otherwise physically manipulating the wand against physical objects. During playback, the recorded sound is continuously filtered by the acoustic interaction of the wand and the material being touched. Our texture kit allows for convenient acoustic exploration of a range of materials.An acoustic instrument.s resonance is typically determined by the materials from which it is built. With the Sound of Touch, resonant materials can be chosen during the performance itself, allowing performers to shape the acoustics of digital sounds by leveraging their intuitions for the acoustics of physical objects. The Sound of Touch permits real-time exploitation of the sonic properties of a physical environment, to achieve a rich and expressive control of digital sound that is not typically possible in electronic sound synthesis and control systems.},

More specifically, the workshop will focus on methodologies and techniques that are suitable to design co-creative applications for non-professional users in different contexts of use like the office, the home, or in public spaces. Special attention goes to stimulating user participation and motivation in small network communities, and how social interaction can be supported through the interface. Co-experience is an evolving concept, which gives insight both into the lives and interaction between people and their in-between user experience. A special focus lies also on advanced evaluation approaches for the production of these forms of user experience in different contexts of use.

Examples include affective interactive systems, games, and relationship-building systems. For these kinds of applications, the CHI community is struggling with a new set of design values and accompanying challenges that can be hard to articulate and thus to advance as a community. These application spaces and interaction modes require an emphasis on the quality of experience rather than outcome, and often involve subtleties of the dynamics of engagement with such interfaces and with others through these interfaces.

In this workshop we will examine case studies from user researchers who have modified a classic user research technique or created a new technique to meet the exigencies of such challenges. The workshop is organized around three aspects of methods design: the impetus for creating the new or modified method, the challenges of implementing the method, and the impact of the innovation on the design or design process.},

abstract = {Vocal interaction research has primarily been focused on the use of systems for automatic speech recognition and synthesis. Whilst ASR has been successful in various domains, it can be impractical in some contexts of use such as in time-sensitive and continuous controls and in applications involving users with speech impairment. This workshop aims to discuss the state of the art in vocal interaction methods that go beyond word recognition by exploiting the information contained within non-verbal vocalizations (e.g. pitch, volume, or timbre). The overarching objective of this workshop is to sketch a research agenda on the topic of the emerging discipline of non-verbal vocal interaction and its implications for the design of interactive systems. The workshop will be of interest to researchers, designers, developers, and users that are interested or would benefit from use of the non-verbal interaction.},

abstract = {A key challenge when producing usable and useful software is the lack of impact of usability work on software development. We aim at developing a more coherent and realistic understanding of this challenge and the possibilities of how to increase the impact from usability work when developing high quality software products. We present a workshop gathering usability practitioners and researchers in order to establish and thoroughly discuss a corpus of case studies covering a broad range of usability practices in software development. The result of the workshop will be summarized in a conference paper and an international recognized scientific publisher will publish the case studies.},

abstract = {The model of search as a turn-taking dialogue between the user and an intermediary has remained unchanged for decades. However, there is growing interest within the search community in evolving this model to support search-driven information exploration activities. So-called "exploratory search" describes a class of search activities that move beyond fact retrieval toward fostering learning, investigation, and information use. Exploratory search interaction focuses on the user-system communication essential during exploratory search processes. Given this user-centered focus, the CHI conference is an ideal venue to discuss mechanisms to support exploratory search behaviors. Specifically, this workshop aims to gather researchers, academics, and practitioners working in human-computer interaction, information retrieval, and other related disciplines, for a discussion of the issues relating to the design and evaluation of interfaces to help users explore, learn, and use information. These are important issues with far-reaching implications for how many computer users accomplish their tasks.},

abstract = {Our everyday lives are characterised by encounters, some are fleeting and ephemeral and others are more enduring and meaningful exchanges. Shared encounters are the glue of social networks and have a socializing effect in terms of mutual understanding, empathy, respect and thus tolerance towards others. The quality and characteristics of such encounters are affected by the setting, or situation in which they occur. In a world shaped by communication technologies, non-place-based networks often coexist alongside to the traditional local face-to-face social networks. As these multiple and distinct on and off-line communities tend to carry out their activities in more and more distinct and sophisticated spaces, a lack of coherency and fragmentation emerges in the sense of a shared space of community. Open public space with its streets, parks and squares plays an important role in providing space for shared encounters among and between these coexisting networks. Mobile and ubiquitous technologies enable social encounters located in public space, albeit not confined to fixed settings, whilst also offering sharing of experiences from non-place based networks. We will look at how to create or support the conditions for meaningful and persisting shared encounters. In particular we propose to explore how technologies can be appropriated for shared interactions that can occur spontaneously and playfully and in doing so re-inhabit and connect place-based social networks.},
