abstract = {Minowe is an online community dedicated to teaching and learning Ojibwe, an American Indian language. Its goal is to enable certain Peripheral American Indians (defined below) to better connect with their American Indian communities. Building on prior research in language education, the Minowe website and mobile app emphasize situation-based learning. Minowe introduces non-speakers to Ojibwe through the use of game-oriented lessons. It facilitates language learning by connecting fluent speakers and non-speakers via video chat. Minowe encourages collaboration by incorporating user-generated vocabulary into future lessons and activities.},

Equipped with only basic technologies, refugees must utilize the little they have to navigate their new environments. Currently, there are no digital systems in place that ease the transition for newly arriving refugees into the USA. In response to this, we have developed Lantern, a cost-efficient mobile service that combines previous generation technology with modern, near field communication capabilities, enabling refugees to learn and navigate within their new surroundings.},

abstract = {These days, many of us frequently use mobile apps to help us navigate. However, these apps with touch screens are not user-friendly for visually impaired people who are eager to be able to leave their homes independently. Moreover, the most widely used apps are not specially made for the visually impaired, so they create much confusion and result in a problematic user experience. The main purpose of this research is to provide a new mobility-aid solution in the form of a navigation app that remembers meaningful information over the journey and makes the trip safer and smoother. Unlike those applications that provide visual guides, we want to refer to the way blind people recognize and remember their route, and provide multi-sensory messages combining familiar reference points that they have learned from O&amp;M training. "BlindNavi" is an app prototype with a 3-step simple search, flat flow design, voice feedback consisting of multi-sensory clues, combined with micro-location technology, to assist visually impaired people leave their homes and safely explore the outside world on their own.},

Research shows that sleepwalkers not only face safety issues, but also social embarrassment leading to conflicts in their self-image and self-awareness. We present Sleepstellar that includes a safety kit to protect sleepwalkers and a platform to encourage digital storytelling for overcoming embarrassment issues. The safety kit provides customized RFID stickers to stick to the potentially harmful places (like staircases, kitchen stove) and connecting it with a sleep tracking wearable that alarms when the patient is close to an RFID sticker. The accompanying mobile app tracks sleepwalking pattern and creates stellar-like beautiful visualizations to be viewed by sleepwalkers and share anonymously with the public along with their individual stories to encourage public engagement, thus enhancing a sleepwalker's self-image and overcome embarrassment issues.},

Like the deceased of this incident, energy poor are continuously exposed to life threatening-either directly or indirectly-danger. On the other hand, there is a dilemma of lightings in Hangang, the river of Seoul. Since earlier this year Government of Seoul decided to reduce the lighting hour of Hangang from 5hrs/day to 3hrs/day in order to save budget but ended up using more. Project Bikon started from a suggestion to relate and solve both energy poor and Hangang lighting issue. The needs and solutions of the project were defined based on the research on statistics and interviews of each user groups.},

To rebuild such pretend play, immersive gaming experience is required throughout the gameplay. We introduce Fighting Gulliver, featuring an innovative game design that integrates cutting-edge technologies including virtual reality (VR), body motion input methods, mobile devices, and wearable devices. The player with VR headsets and body motion capturing devices plays as the giant, while others without the two devices join forces to defeat the giant. Players playing character roles other than the giant are not limited on a desktop device. Entering the game through different devices results in different character roles, skills, and user interfaces. As a result, Fighting Gulliver is a cross-platform multiplayer online role-playing game (MORPG) with novel gaming experience and unique game settings rarely found in previous works. Game balance design and a user study are also discussed in this work.},

Overall, this has led to sports video games being heavily based on statistical simulations (e.g., how high a shot statistic is determines the success of a shot, not player skill). This takes away from the sport-like aspect of true competition between the players of the game. Jelly Polo is a team-based sports video game which uses small-scale exertion. By providing small-scale exertion, in terms of movement, players can gain expertise development, have individual differences in how they play, and get tired during the course of a game. This makes the game more sport-like and competitive because players have to work to strategize as a team, counter-balance fatigue, and increase their physical and mental skills to win against opponents.},

abstract = {Developments in citizen science, community sensing, and crowdsourcing offer the opportunity of large scale data collection of the physical world because of the ubiquity of sensor-rich, mobile devices. Despite this opportunity, large-scale data collection about physical spaces is currently not widespread because of high-effort participation. In this paper, we explore the ability for people to contribute on the go. We developed Gaze, a system that will collect information about people's responses to physical spaces through low-effort feedback. To enable low-effort contributions for large scale data collection, we have developed a design pattern called Identify-Focus-Capture that identifies opportunities for users given current situational context, helps users to focus in on the opportunity, and captures useful data through simple actions or gestures. Through our pilot, users successfully helped collect 50+ data points about their environment, showing that useful data can be collected when the opportunity is low-effort.},

We introduce Blowatch, a novel input method for smartwatches and potentially for other mobile devices, which provides hands-free interaction and avoid the occlusion problem. Users blow air on the smartwatches so as to invoke several operations, such as adjusting the music volume, taking a picture or answering the call. In this paper, we explore the input dimension of blowing-gesture set and examine potential usage of the gestures with a simple user study. Finally, to illustrate the potential of our approach, we developed a series of example applications for our blow-based gestures.},

While a number of studies have focused on how human avatars relate to other humans, little attention has been paid to the particularities of human avatar to human avatar interaction. This paper examines characteristic features of such interaction through Cyrafour, a playful embodied identity game in which two human avatars clone various conversations generated elsewhere. Such cloning, or speech shadowing, seems to allow for an empathic embodiment of the meaning transmitted and appears to create a frame for further discussion on the topics raised.

To determine if either approach offers an advantage, we have created an interactive tutor for the Git revision control system that uses the user's own installation of the program for maximal realism. We intend to compare this tutor to one that uses a simpler, but less accurate simulation of Git. In a pilot study, participants, despite having challenges with secondary programs used by the real Git, remained engaged and were able to discover and learn commands not available in the simplified interface. These findings suggest that designing for authenticity in interactive tutorials may be beneficial.},

The exercise is displayed within the dead-space resulting from the pull to minimize intrusiveness, and allows the user to complete the exercise without leaving the email context. In multiple iterations of preliminary user testing with 10 users and a pilot deployment with 3 users, we found that participants were able to non-intrusively integrate learning into their existing mobile activities.},

Adding a graphical emoticon improved support, measured on four scales of appropriateness, helpfulness, effectiveness and sensitivity. Images of flowers were rated higher than text; additionally, appropriate and sensitive ratings were consistently higher than effective and helpful ratings. There was no difference between explicit and implicit gifts. Participants reported that adding flowers to the support message was sympathetic and represented an effort to cheer the carer up.},

Unlike currently available body gesture input systems that depend on external cameras or distributed motion sensors across the user's body, Cyclops is a single-piece wearable device that is worn as a pendant or a badge. Owing to the ego-centric view, Cyclops turns posture recognition into a highly controllable computer vision problem. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept device and an algorithm for recognizing static and moving bodily gestures based on motion history images (MHI) and a random decision forest (RDF). Four example applications of interactive bodily workout, a mobile racing game that involves hands and feet, a full-body virtual reality system, and interaction with a tangible toy are presented.},

When presented with large amounts of information, people are prone to miss or forget details which can be essential later. TakeTwo builds on the capabilities of such wearable devices to provide a virtual extension of memory, i.e. augmented memory, to aid users in learning and recall. In particular, we use Google Glass to capture audiovisual content of ongoing events, and allow users to actively bookmark moments for later review. The Thalmic Labs Myo armband allows users to create bookmarks with discrete hand gestures. Future work will explore automatic bookmark creation triggered by physiological signals such as electrodermal activity, EEG, eye tracking, and motion. This will allow users to review events based on signals of emotional arousal, confusion, focus, or understanding, furthering their ability to recall and reinforce memory when it is needed most.},

With this application, users can input numbers by placing the dice in the specific area after throwing it. The second application is a simple drawer with a color picker cube. The third application is a math learning game with five different sizes of cubes. (The strength of the magnetic force is proportional to the size of the cubes).},

abstract = {We propose a new way of eyes-free interaction for wearables. It is based on the user's proprioceptive sense, i.e., rather than seeing, hearing, or feeling an outside stimulus, users feel the pose of their own body. We have implemented a wearable device called Pose-IO that offers input and output based on proprioception. Users communicate with Pose-IO through the pose of their wrists. Users enter information by performing an input gesture by flexing their wrist, which the device senses using a 3-axis accelerometer. Users receive output from Pose-IO by find-ing their wrist posed in an output gesture, which Pose-IO actuates using electrical muscle stimulation. This mechanism allows users to interact with Pose-IO without visual or auditory senses, but through the proprioceptive sense alone. We developed three simple applications that demonstrate symmetric proprioceptive interaction, where input and output occur through the same limb, as well as asymmetric interaction, where input and output occur through different limbs. In a first user study, participants using a symmetric proprioceptive interface re-entered poses received from Pose-IO with an average accuracy of 5.8° despite the minimal bandwidth offered by the device. In a second, exploratory study, we investigated participants' emotional response to asymmetric proprioceptive interaction and the concept of the user's body serving as interface. Participants reported to enjoy the experience (4.6 out of 5).},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have experienced rapid development and achieved substantial attention from learners, educators and practitioners. Although MOOCs have been widely accepted, they have been plagued by tremendously high drop-out rate. However, while some studies have focused on students' retention and engagement issues, very little attention has been given to the population of students who do not finish the courses in which they register. I propose to understand retention in MOOCs by analyzing qualitative (interview) data and quantitative data (course-related information from completed MOOCs) to characterize the motivations and experiences, learning activities, and outcomes for all MOOC students, by focusing on the vast majority, those who do not finish MOOCs. I will use this richer understanding to identify instructional and platform design implications.},

The proposed method provides users with a broader interaction area and higher input expressiveness, enabling a precision interaction with a less occlusion. To illustrate the potential of our approach, we present a series of example applications with several input vocabularies. We also describe the overall architecture of our system. We believe that our technique would greatly help users control a smartwatch easily and conveniently.},

abstract = {Epidemiologists struggle to integrate complex information about the incidence and spread of disease, in relation to population density and other demographic conditions, at geographical scales ranging from global air travel down to local commuting. A partial solution overlays air travel as arcs above color-coded maps. However, commuting is not shown and it is often challenging to understand changing relationships due to the visual complexity arcs introduce. Moreover, when region sizes and shapes vary their color-codings become difficult to perceive. We introduce three visualizations which combine representations of population, movement, and disease spread at a local scale that is consistent with a zoomable global scale: (1) a map with commuting border encodings, (2) a centroidal Voronoi tessellation morphing technique, and (3) a meta-layout showing commuting alongside air travel. Our work provides mid-level abstractions that expert epidemiologists can use for insights into contagion.},

We demonstrate an eye typing technique, which does not require the user to dwell on the letters that she wants to input. Our method automatically filters out unwanted letters from the sequence of letters gazed at while typing a word. It ranks candidate words based on their length and frequency and presents them to the user for confirmation. Spell correction and support for typing words not in the corpus are also included.},

When an object of academic investigation, these patterns are interpreted by researchers and conclusions are drawn about people's habits and routines. Alternatively, interpretations are provided by users themselves during extensive post-study interviews. Such approaches inevitably expose personal data collected about individuals to researchers, which can potentially change the behavior under investigation. We introduce a new approach to using wearable sensor data in research. It allows people to interpret and self-reflect on their data and submit for investigation only reflections, without sharing their raw data. In this interactivity, we present and discuss the Datawear mobile application prototype, which is designed to conduct "in the wild" studies of personal experiences.},

abstract = {Low-fidelity fabrication systems speed up rapid prototyping by printing intermediate versions of a prototype as fast, low-fidelity previews. Only the final version is fabricated as a full high-fidelity 3D print. This allows designers to iterate more quickly-achieving a better design in less time. Depending on what is currently being tested, low-fidelity fabrication is implemented in different ways: (1) faBrickator allows for a modular approach by substituting sub-volumes of the 3D model with building blocks. (2) WirePrint allows for quickly testing the shape of an object, such as the ergonomic fit, by printing wireframe structures. (3) Platener preserves the technical function by substituting 3D print with laser-cut plates of the same size and thickness. At our CHI'15 interactivity booth, we give a combined live demo of all three low-fidelity fabrication systems-putting special focus on our new low-fidelity fabrication system Platener (paper at CHI'15).},

There is also no intrinsically defined front or centre of the display, offering different views from different viewing angles. This creates shared and private areas of the display given users' varying perspectives. Trajectory based games have a dramatically different experience when played on a spherical surface. Side-scrolling games are also exciting on a spherical surface, becoming "rotating" games where users' action affect others playing at different points around the screen. This Interactivity exhibit showcases two multi-player games that specifically exploit the affordances of a spherical display in a social setting.},

A visitor to our installation notices a faint sound appearing to emerge from a tree, and might feel a slight vibration under their feet as they approach. By resting their head against the tree, they are able to hear sound through bone conduction. To create this effect, an audio exciter transducer is weatherproofed and attached to the tree trunk underground, transforming the tree into a living speaker that channels audio through its branches. Any source of sound can be played through the tree, including live audio or pre-recorded tracks. For example, we used the ListenTree to display live streaming sound from an outdoor ecological monitoring sensor network, bringing an urban audience into contact with a faraway wetland. Our intervention is motivated by a need for forms of display that fade into the background, inviting attention rather than requiring it. ListenTree points to a future where digital information might become a seamless part of the physical world.},

To do this, a surrogate user wears a mask-shaped display that shows a remote user's live face, and a voice channel transmits a remote user's voice. A surrogate user mimics a remote user by following the remote user's directions. This design is based on our hypothesis assuming physical and social telepresence can be embodied by such a surrogate human who imitates the remote user. It also eliminates many difficulties of teleoperated robots wandering in the environment. Our pilot study confirmed that people could regard the masked person as a right person.},

The digitally augmented tangible interface is evaluated by professionals and students in interaction design.

We complete studies without informed consent and without intervention from an experimenter in order to gain new insights into how people use technology in public settings. We argue there is clear value in this approach, reflect on the ethical issues of such investigations, and describe our ethical guidelines for completing Deep Cover HCI Research.},

abstract = {Motivated by a concern with mindlessness in living and designing and how it might lead to outcomes that are poorly considered in their broader ecology, we ask: what if we imagine technology conceived with mindfulness in mind? To develop this thought, we examine two 'found designs' that have a cultural significance and are deeply embedded in everyday practices -- the cigarette and the torii gate. These objects are seen as somewhere between a detour or a portal for the authors in practicing mindfulness. Using these examples, we discuss the subtle space between designing for mindfulness, which we believe is unachievable, and being aware as designers that the tools we make can have this further potential use.},

abstract = {There is currently a widespread uncertainty regarding the ability of citizens to control privacy online in the face of ubiquitous surveillance. This is a huge and complex societal problem. Despite the multi-faceted nature of the problem, we propose that HCI researchers can still make a positive contribution in this space through the design of technologies that support citizens to engage with issues of surveillance. In this paper we describe the design of a messaging application called Captchat. Captchat enables people to send everyday messages embedded into images, with the added ability to apply visual distortions to the message to resemble an online CAPTCHA. We propose the chief benefit would be that Captchat messages (with potentially "one-time" distortions) can increase the difficulty for algorithms to index private messages and necessitate the involvement of much more costly human labor in the surveillance process. We developed a prototype and conducted a user study; the results suggest that people were likely to create Captchat messages that were difficult to index for an OCR package but still easy to understand by humans, even without explicit instructions to interact 'securely' with the application. While more work is still required to understand the limitations of Captchat, we hope it can open discussion on how HCI researchers can respond to the challenges faced from ubiquitous surveillance.},

abstract = {Shop windows are the paradigmatic design environment for attracting and holding people's attention. They also provide a handy mirror in which people can check their appearance. The 12-way mirror project plays with this duality by building and testing an interactive installation that tracks people's reflections as they look into a shop window. Three versions of the installation are compared, one with static mirrors, one with moving mirrors and one with face-tracking mirrors. These were tested over a 5 day period in the window display of an Eyewear shop on a busy commercial road in East London. Data were collected on how many people looked in the window, for how long and what they did while looking. The results show that while movement attracts people's attention and stops them, their own reflection is most effective in keeping their interest.},

abstract = {Telecare is personal and environmental sensors that support people to remain safe and independent in their own home for longer. Telecare plays an important role in addressing the challenges of an ageing population. However, many people do not wear the most common form provided, the community alarm, for reasons that include the way that it looks. In the UK, a contributing factor to this problem is that manufacturers cater to telecare service providers (e.g. local authorities) and as a result, service users are not involved in design processes. This paper describes a redesign of the community alarm by a leading manufacturer, involving participatory design activities with users and the wider public, and design internships. The main innovation of the new community alarm, called BodyGuard, is that it connects with the user's smartphone to enable it to work outside the home. We report insights and lessons learned during the innovation process, within the context of social care reforms giving people more control and choice over the services that they receive.},

By engaging an artist specializing in color, we created colormaps that provide the ability to see greater detail in these high-resolution datasets. The new colormaps applied to the POP dataset enabled scientists to see areas of interest unclear using standard colormaps. Improvements in the perceptual range of color allowed scientists to highlight structures within specific ocean currents. Work with the COSIM team members drove development of nested colormaps which provide further detail to the scientists.},

The current project seeks to use Connectivist Massive Open Course (cMOOC) technology to capture and scale this professional development through the use of video, imagery, and community building in order to integrate Native American learning processes. The overall objective is to enable Pueblo teachers to more effectively teach STEM subject matter, as measured by an increase in both teacher and student content knowledge scores. If successful, the use of these technologies should facilitate rapid expansion of the program in all Native American reservation schools in USA, Canada, and Mexico.},

For such teams to reduce this testing time and to quickly glean usability insights we leverage human performance modeling via CogTool. Our work compares CogTool's expert user model's task time with actual user time from lab sessions in two user studies. In these two studies CogTool's task time estimates were statistically significantly lower when compared to lab based user times but the two task times were positively correlated. We leverage this correlation between CogTool task times and lab user times to build a predictive user model. Next, we apply this user model to rapidly evaluate two new designs without lab based user testing. Based on these results we provide recommendations for Agile UX teams to harness CogTool for enhancing user research efforts and thereby reduce the bottleneck of lab based user testing.},

Archival organizations have recognized the importance of email archives and often collect email when they acquire the papers of eminent donors; however they find it difficult to screen, process and provide access to email for research, due to its sheer volume. We describe the considerations we encountered with the email archives of two prominent individuals in the special collections of Stanford University Libraries. We have designed novel approaches to the challenges of (1) Reconciliation with authority records, (2) Making "finding aids" of the archive available to the general public, without revealing confidential information, and (3) Browsing an email archive when one may not know what exactly to look for. Our solutions have been implemented in a publicly available and open source system called ePADD. As a result, we enable donors and archival organizations to appraise, process and screen large-scale email archives, thereby unlocking the historical value embedded in them. },

It informs them only about the level of general consensus regarding each representation generated by different participants. It does not provide answers to those questions, which ask how the representation is to be achieved. Identification of different representation strategies adopted by different participants can reveal the rest of the story. In the presence of more than one or no strong contenders (population stereotype), adoption of the right representation strategy can be really beneficial. As most of the representational strategies are complementary to each other, the combination of different representational strategies can lead towards a more representative icon development.},

abstract = {The Pay-E-Safe system is a token-based car battery powered electronic micropayment system for emerging markets in East Africa. This is the story of how it was developed with different ethnic groups in Kasese, Uganda, combining methods from HCI, software development, and business modeling. We created a system that is inexpensive to implement, sensitive to the Ugandan context (e.g. low incomes, unreliable power supplies and unstable Internet connections) and provides benefits to local vendors as well as added value to users and their families. Using observations, interviews and prototype evaluations with local Ugandans we studied people's spending behaviors and then explored alternative design solutions with them. Along the way, we discovered that a micropayment system could actually add value to the user experience beyond the exchange of money for services. This case study reports on how we designed the system and the additional value it afforded users.},

We learn that, in terms of design, its not just a question of saying voice is better for one type of functionality and gesture is better for another; rather, the benefits are circumstantial. Thus, there is a case for building in redundancy in control with both voice and gesture.},

We conducted a field study to investigate whether androids could sell goods in a department store. As a result, our sales strategies worked well and the android could sell 43 sweaters that cost approximately 100 dollars each for 10 days.

abstract = {In the context of using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in hostile environments, gestures allow to free the operator of bulky control interfaces. Since a navigation plan is defined before the mission, only a few commands have to be activated during the mission. This allows a gestural symbolic interaction that maps commands to a set of gestures. Nevertheless, as gestures are not universal, this asks the question of choosing the proper gestures that are easy to learn memorize and perform. We propose a four step methodology for eliciting a gestural vocabulary, and apply it to this use case. The methodology consists of 4 steps: (1) collecting gestures through user creativity sessions, (2) extracting candidate gestures to build a catalogue, (3) electing the gesture vocabulary and (3) evaluating the non-ambiguity of it. We then discuss the relevance of the GV.},

abstract = {Two great inventions that opened the era of human-computer interaction design-desktop and mouse-are now disappearing. Computers are becoming smaller and smaller, smarter and smarter. Everyone is now surrounded by many visible and invisible computers, which are all highly connected through the Internet ubiquitously. A new world of artificial intelligence is emerging. When the intelligence of human-being is expanded to his/her surroundings, condensed into a new kind of Intelligent life, the relationship between human-being and the rest of the world has been redefined. How to cross the boundaries and to enable the sustainable interaction between nature (the 1st system), human-beings (the 2nd system), artificial world (the 3rd system), and the cyber world (the 4th system), becomes an interesting proposition and merits new design. But before that, it's necessary to rethink the anthropocentric view and even design itself. The most attractive feature of design is optimistic. What makes a human being human, lies in that one is not leading a kind of life which merely has needs to be fulfilled, but can also use his/her subjective initiative to control and conduct his/her behavior for a certain common value. Today sustainability is not only a value of ethics, but a value of surviving. How to use and encourage a new kind of HCI design, to generate sustainable behaviors and social changes, further, to redesign the commensalism of the four systems mentioned above will be the main focus of my talk.Professor Dr. Lou Yongqi is Dean of the College of Design and Innovation at Tongji University in Shanghai. He is a full professor at Tongji, Visiting Professor at the School of Art, Design, and Architecture at Aalto University in Finland, and Visiting Professor at the School of Design of Politecnico di Milano in Italy. Lou has been the pioneer in China for design-driven innovation education that connects design, business, and technology. He advances these issues through his leadership of two institutions at Tongji University: the College of Design and Innovation, and the Sino-Finnish Centre. He also furthers this agenda through international collaboration.Prof. Lou is a leading figure in sustainable interdisciplinary design education, research, and practice. Lou was the first designer in China to connect social innovation and sustainable design thinking with rural development. This is the subject of his latest book, Design Harvests: An Acupunctural Design Approach Toward Sustainability. Lou's design works include the United Nations Pavilion of World Expo 2010, the LiangPing New Jindai Sustainable School funded by the China-US Center for Sustainable Development, and the TsingTao Horticultural Expo 2014. Prof. Lou is Vice President of CUMULUS, the International Association of Universities and Colleges of Art, Design, and Media. He is Founding Executive Editor of She Ji -- the Journal of Design, Innovation, and Economics published by Tongji University and in cooperation with Elsevier.

abstract = {The current advancement of IoT technology has accelerated the era of hyper-connectivity in our lives. This has vastly driven convergence among different fields along with the expansion of our thoughts and behaviors. However, to provide meaningful experiences, these relational expansions and unprecedented possibilities opened up by IoT need to be founded on core human values. Furthermore, harmonious integration between technology and design is also essential. Today, I would like to talk about what must be done in order to foster the IoT as a human-centered innovation and how UX design can realize the well balanced and harmonious IoT environment.Donghoon Chang is Executive VP, Head of Design Strategy Team and UX Center in Corporate Design Center, Samsung Electronics. Since joining Samsung in 2006, he has played a critical role in establishing the company's design vision for the future which has gradually shifted from a focus on style and convenience to a holistic user experience design and has developed mid to long-term design strategies, including 'Design 3.0' which envisions design that delivers new meaning and delight to people and contributes to society by creating sustainable and innovative value. Chang received two MFA degrees from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (Chicago, USA) and Seoul National University (Seoul, Korea). He worked for IBM Korea and Times; Space Tech inc. as a communications specialist and art director respectively. Before joining Samsung, he was a professor at EWHA Womans University (Seoul, Korea) where he taught visual design, information design as well as user experience design.

abstract = {Over the last decade, the rise of web services has made it possible to gather traces of human behavior in situ at a scale and fidelity previously unimaginable. Large-scale behavioral data enables researchers and practitioners to detect adverse drug reactions and interactions, to understand how information diffuses through social networks, how people browse and search for information, how individual learning strategies are related to educational outcome, etc. Using examples from search, I will highlight how observational logs provide a rich new lens onto the diversity of searchers, tasks, and interactivity that characterize information systems today, and how experimental logs have revolutionized the way in which web-based systems are designed and evaluated. Although logs provide a great deal of information about what people are doing, they provide little insight about why they are doing so or whether they are satisfied. Complementary methods from observations, laboratory studies and panels are necessary to provide a more complete understanding of and support for search which is increasingly a core fabric of people's everyday lives. The CHI community should lead the way in shaping best practices and policy in behavioral log studies.Susan Dumais is a Distinguished Scientist at Microsoft and Deputy Managing Director of the Microsoft Research Lab in Redmond. Prior to joining Microsoft Research, she was at Bell Labs and Bellcore, where she worked on Latent Semantic Analysis, techniques for combining search and navigation, and organizational impacts of new technology. Her current research focuses on user modeling and personalization, context and search and temporal dynamics of information. She has worked closely with several Microsoft product groups (Bing, Windows Desktop Search, SharePoint, and Office Online Help) on search-related innovations. Susan has published widely in the fields of information science, human-computer interaction and cognitive science, and holds several patents on novel retrieval algorithms and interfaces.

abstract = {We think with things, with our bodies, with marks on paper, and with other people. Thinking is a distributed, situated, and social activity that exploits the extraordinary facilities of language, representational media, and embodied interaction with the world. Today we increasingly think with computers. This includes desktop and laptop computers but more and more involves massive computer networks that deliver search results and provide access to a vast array of cloud-based services. At the same time, the monolithic computer of the recent past is coming apart and being reassembled in myriad new forms, including cell phones, tablets, digital pens, cameras that allow focusing after a picture is taken, glasses that can take a picture of what we see and tell us about it, sensors that capture our activity and support interaction by movement of hands and bodies as well as voice and eyes, and even cars that drive themselves.We are on the threshold of an era that is being described as the Internet of Things or, perhaps more accurately, as the Internet of Everything. The historical moment when people primarily worked in front of a single computer has passed. Computers are ubiquitous. They are being embedded in virtually every new device and the Internet and wireless communication enable their connection to each other and to ever-expanding information resources with previously unimaginable computational power. This is being accelerated by a radically changing cost structure in which the price is the same or less to use a thousand computers for a minute or a day than to use one computer for a thousand minutes or days. These and related developments are fundamentally changing the world in which we live and the ways we think, communicate, and interact within it.Yet for all their capacity and speed, using computers too often remains difficult, awkward, and frustrating. Even after six decades of design evolution there is little of the naturalness, spontaneity, and contextual sensitivity that characterize other activities nor is there the conviviality and flexibility of working with tangible media. Most time using computers is spent within applications, each designed to support specific functions and allowing interaction with information in only predetermined ways that are rarely sensitive to overall activity context or history of use and far too often we can look, but not touch, annotate, or personalize the information involved.Access to information needed to conduct daily life is spread across multiple applications and resources, resulting in fragmentation of activities and increased complexity. The rapidly expanding world of mobile apps, which are often walled off from each other and from other information sources, and the increasing use of multiple devices further fragments the ways we work and interact. Although we commonly use paper and digital work materials together, they remain elements of two distinct worlds.Disconnects between digital and physical worlds, lack of naturalness and context sensitivity, inability to tailor and personalize information and our interaction with it, and fragmentation of real activities across multiple applications and devices are systemic problems and unfortunately becoming accepted features of modern life.In this talk I argue that we need to challenge the legacy document- and application-centric view of information. We must design environments that move beyond simple metaphor-based imitation of static information entities to ones in which information is dynamic, operating according to cognitively-inspired physics that exploit human abilities, are sensitive to context and history, link the digital and physical worlds, and support web-scale information activities.},

Additionally it expands consideration to include not only official responders (who tend to be the focus in policy and technology-focused matters), but also members of the public. It therefore views emergency response as a much broader socio-technical system where information is disseminated within and between official and public channels and entities. Crisis informatics wrestles with methodological concerns as it strives to develop new theory and support informed development of ICT and policy. Palen will describe the range of work her team has engaged in at CU-Boulder since 2006, and highlight the different branches of crisis informatics research through discussion of the multidisciplinary research they have conducted here.BIO:Leysia Palen is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder.

abstract = {Transdisciplinary design which is the idea of design that transcends disciplinary boundaries has been proposed as a fourth design paradigm of interaction design education, scholarship, and practice alongside the technical, cognitive, and ethnographic paradigms. As an educational concern in particular, its aim is to teach students how to bring a values orientation to interaction design. Its focuses are design frameworks, values and ethics, design for important themes such as sustainability, equity, adaptation, justice, and social responsibility. This panel maps the state of the art in transdisciplinary interaction design education, considering also design scholarship and practice in relation to design education. The panel collects together a group of educators from chosen to provide a global perspective, with panelists from Canada, Denmark, Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan.},

abstract = {To commemorate the tenth anniversary of alt.chi, two of this year's alt.chi chairs, Ames and Lindtner, will moderate a panel with chairs from previous years to reflect on the legacy of alt.chi in the broader CHI community and discuss where the track should be headed in the future. We intend the panel to be highly interactive, incorporating the audience in discussion and debate. We encourage those with thoughts on alt.chi as well as those who want to learn more about the track, to attend and actively participate. The following questions will start the discussion: 1. What is the role of alt.chi in the CHI community, and how has it shifted across the last decade? 2. What alt.chi research papers or themes have been particularly influential or provocative? 3. What is the state of critical discourse and reflection in alt.chi? Has alt.chi been a successful venue for such work? Should it be? 4. Where is alt.chi headed, what is missing, and how could it change?},

abstract = {In the mobile device ecosystem, standardization is a key component of user interface, user interaction, and user experience development. Application Programming Interface (API) standards play an especially important role in connecting software to silicon, creating consistent development environments and accelerating media. The Khronos Group is a non-profit industry consortium creating open standards for the authoring and acceleration of parallel computing, graphics, dynamic media, computer vision, and sensor processing on a wide variety of platforms and devices. OpenGL, the graphics standard API from Khronos Group, is widely used for the foundation layer in GUI development in many types of projects: from personal devices including PC, iOS, and Android; to safety-critical applications such as avionics. OpenCL, the cross-platform parallel programming interface, is widely used for massive computation in fields such as machine intelligence and computer vision. Mobile devices require powerful new user interaction capabilities. Khronos open standard APIs enable applications to access capabilities such as the use of sensors to collect user and environment information, and processing power to manipulate and understand the sensor data. Recently, Khronos Group announced the release of new API standard, which can be used as the foundation layer for innovative user experience applications in the near future. This workshop is organized to discuss these new Khronos Group technologies, and to share the features and the UI/UX innovations that mobile devices may realize in the future.},

In 2015, the CCI SIG aims to take advantage of the positioning of CHI in Seoul to consider how it might, as an academic community, best direct its work to broaden to different cultures of play, education and activity.The CCI2015 SIG will therefore seek to examine its own work by asking what cultural assumptions underpin its main theories and practices. The CCI SIG at CHI will mix together a set of 5-minute cameo presentations -- each examining a highly cited CCI paper -- with a world caf\'{e} approach and will develop solutions and priorities. The CCI SIG will be the natural meeting place for members of this community at CHI and will disseminate its discussion to the CCI and CHI communities through the production of visual and interactive materials at the CHI conference.},

This research SIG will bring together female and male academics, industry researchers, and practitioners with three goals in mind: (1) to build community across research/practice boundaries; (2) to pool our knowledge on promising practices for design and evaluation of software from a gender perspective; and (3) to begin to build a shared, on-line research and literature base to support solid, well-informed progress on this important issue.},

Specifically, as the first step in designing such a system, we try to understand the preferred interaction interface requirements of the visually impaired population using a set of interviews conducted over 28 visually impaired participants. Our results show that the smartphone usage rate of our interview participants is ~60%; thus, smartphone-based applications should not be considered as the "everyone-will-use-platform" when interacting with the visually impaired. Results from an extensive set of questions reveal that interaction interfaces in the form of key chains and wrist watches can also be effective for various interactive applications.},

To identify the proper approach of skeuomorphism we articulated two factors such as degree of realism and level abstraction. We employed "call", "contact", and "camera" icons and created eight alternatives, four degrees of realism by two levels of abstraction for each. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 30 Korean elderly and asked about their preference and understandability depending on how the app icons are visualized. A conjoint analysis revealed that the degree of realism is more important for having an aesthetic satisfaction, whereas the abstraction level is more relevant for better understanding the function of an icon. Overall, the degree of realism is positively correlated with both preference and understandability. Moreover a direct metaphoric icon has an advantage to appeal more and to inform more efficiently, particularly for female or novice elderly users.},

This paper presents our initial work toward the development of a collaborative system that supports multi-author writing. We describe methods for tracking paragraphs, identifying significant edits, and predicting parts of the paper that are likely to require changes as a result of previous edits.

abstract = {Ethics and social responsibility is one of the hot topics in HCI research. This paper describes a case of a Japanese AI journal's cover design that evoked a huge public and academic discussion of its ethical and social implications in December 2013. The case implies a lack of dialogue and collaboration between the AI community and researchers in social sciences and humanities that may, in the long term, have a negative impact on the public perception of AI research. Although this is a case study in Japan, we expect that the case will serve as a warning for HCI researchers about the importance of being conscious about social and ethical research perspectives.},

As a result, we see a promising potential to significantly empower our decision-making process by providing relevant information just in time/space. In this paper, we present AfterMath, a user interface concept of predicting and visualizing consequences of a user's potential actions. We explore new possibilities through a prototypical system that harnesses physics simulation as a consequence-prediction method and uses augmented reality technology to visualize potential consequences. Finally, we suggest general guidelines for designing systems utilizing this concept.},

abstract = {Mobile Augmented Reality (MAR) is a mature technology mainly owing to optical tracking libraries capable of determining the position and orientation of tangible markers. However, most of the applications employ only one marker or use them inside a limited interaction space. Here, we present two applications that try to go beyond these previous limits. Firstly, the PathMaker is a game in which a path in the real world is constructed with tangible markers. Meanwhile, virtual creatures will walk through the path requiring its exploration and maintenance. Secondly, TurtAR is a tangible programming language similar to Logo that uses as parameters several degrees of freedom from the markers. Finally, we present a simple algorithm that works on top of existing tracking libraries and supports multiple markers to track the device as well as to interact with the applications.},

The traditional tools of presenting external image, such as mirrors or videos, are limited in their mobility, perspective, and immediacy. To address the issue, we present OutsideMe, a vision-sync mixed reality system that enables dancers see their body movements as external observers through a head-mounted display (HMD) device. This system captures dancer's posture and blends it into scenes from the dancer's original field of view in an interactive frame rate. The dancers can observe themselves without distracting their presence identities. In this research, we develop four work modes for supporting dancer's training, and carry out a feasibility study and a user study. The feedbacks from the participants performing various dancing styles are analyzed and discussed. The preliminary experimental results support our design.},

Programming blocks in TanProStory are surface-sensitive, i.e. only the command on the top surface can be detected.

The profile of the educator who practices is different from the educator who does not practice, and the educator who does not practice is more evangelical about the subject.

abstract = {Due to the ever-growing amount of textual information we face in our everyday life, the skill of scanning and absorbing the essence of a piece of text is crucial. We cannot afford to read every text in detail, hence we need to acquire strategies to quickly decide on the importance of a text and how to grasp its content. Additionally, the sheer amount of daily reading makes it hard to remember the gist of every text encountered. Research in psychology has proposed priming as an implicit memory effect where exposure to one stimulus influences the response to a subsequent stimulus. Hence, exposure to contextual information can influence comprehension and recall. In our work we investigate the feasibility of using such an effect to visually present text summaries that are quick to understand and deliver the essence of a text in order to help readers not only make informed decisions about whether to read the text or not, but also to build out more cognitive associations that help to remember the content of the text afterward. In two focus groups we discussed our approach by providing four different visualizations representing the gist and important details of the text. In this paper we introduce the visualizations as well as results of the focus groups.},

abstract = {Many people in present culture have a desire to improve themselves in some way, be it increased physical fitness, healthy eating, better sustainable practices, etc. Yet it can often be difficult to follow through with self-improvement goals. To address this, we designed the Gauntlet, a platform for creating and sharing user-generated challenges that can be carried out in real-world settings. We describe the participatory design activity we used to inform our design followed by the final design of the Gauntlet user interface. We also propose how this platform can be used to support personal goal and community improvement.},

This information is already abundant and available via Online Social Media. The missing link is a rigorous, anonymized and open source artefact that gives feedback to stakeholders and constituents. To address this, BeWell, an unobtrusive, low latency multi-resolution measurement for the observation, analysis and modelling of community dynamics, is proposed. To assess communal well-being, 42 Facebook pages of a large public university in Germany are analyzed with a dictionary-based text analytics program, LIWC. We establish the baseline of emotive discourse across the sample, and detect significant campus-wide events in this proof of concept implementation, then discuss future iterations including a community dashboard and a participatory management plan.},

abstract = {In developing countries where Internet is not readily accessible and literacy sometimes low, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems have been shown to provide opportunities in a variety of civic activities. In this way, such systems can give the opportunity to more easily influence and participate in public affairs. However the lack of an efficient system of administration can delay delivering the collected reports to the relevant organizations or authorities. This paper presents a study of a citizen reporting system that was developed, implemented and tested in Uganda. This was done in collaboration with the Women of Uganda Network an organization to empower women using ICT. We studied an IVR system called U-Call that allows administrators to easily publish and tag audio reports over the Web (reported by citizen) using low generation mobile devices. We highlight a number of issues, including multiple authentication process that needs to be taken into account for future development. We emphasize the importance of field studies in understanding and designing for this user group and understanding the reality of the technical infrastructure available.},

Since this is a new, and potentially disruptive technology, little is yet known about farmer attitudes towards robots, how robots might be incorporated into current farming practice, and how best to marry the capability of the robot with the work of the farmer.

However, for these systems to be useful, geospatial information needs to be presented in ways that those systems can minimize users' difficulties of learning about a new place. This raises a fundamental question about what kinds and representations of geospatial information are effective in making a place more familiar, so that people can adjust to the place more easily even before visiting the unfamiliar world. This study focuses on modeling representations of geospatial information, and their effects on people's familiarity of places. The results show that content and format of geospatial information matter in their familiarity about a place in terms of their perceptions and knowledge. Designers and researchers of social computing systems can benefit from this study so that geospatial information can be more effectively distributed through online systems.},

In this study, we classified donors into five groups and analyzed donor behavior based on the following criteria, i.e., activeness, self-expression, and topical interests. We found that donors who contribute small amount of money and only a few times are critical for the projects' success.

However, there are two problems with current tabletop displays: The display area is limited to horizontal surfaces, and there is a lack of view-dependent appearance regarding displayed images. The aim of this paper is to overcome these limitations by adding dual-sided vertical mid-air images to a horizontal surface for a richer and more impressive visual presentation. For this purpose, we introduce a plate-shaped mid-air imaging optics as a tabletop surface and a diffusion control film for the projection of horizontal images. The proposed system, "HoVerTable," can display a combination of horizontal and vertical images for users facing each other. We have developed interactive applications on HoVerTable, including a card battle game and an application for the augmentation of physical objects.},

Human factors-such as cognitive workload and limited attentional capacity-have been shown to affect operators' ability to detect critical incidents. The current standard surveillance environment comprises a large screen layout that simultaneously displays multiple camera feeds. Although having access to all sources of information at once seems intuitively appealing, there is ample evidence to suggest that it can, in fact, lead to poor detection performance. We propose a design solution that is based on principles grounded in cognitive psychology and user experience design. One key objective is to test empirically whether an atypical design pattern that is consistent with serial cognitive processes induces better performance than the current standard surveillance environment. Three variations of the alternative display pattern will be tested by comparing their effects on detection performance within a surveillance microworld.},

To get the desired answer, though, we need to find the right person, and have the right affordances to send and receive the relevant information. In this paper, we define a class of micro-presence systems for just-in-time micro-interactions with remote companions, and explore dimensions of the design space. Informed by theories of contextual memory and situated learning, we present TagAlong, a micro-presence system conceived for learning a second language in context with help from a remote native speaker. TagAlong uses a connected head-mounted camera and head-up display device to share images of the wearer's visual context with remote peers. The remote companion can convey knowledge using these images as a point of reference-- images are sampled, annotated and then sent back to the wearer in real time. We report on a quantitative experiment to determine the effectiveness of using visual cues that involve spatial and photographic elements as a means of "pointing" at things to draw the wearer's attention to them.},

abstract = {The handling of 3D content increasingly permeates amateur activities and occurs spontaneously on public displays. The design of interaction techniques for such scenarios is subject to tensions between established expert user interfaces, 3D touch interaction and the requirements of the usage context. We present a novel concept for 3D touch interaction on a curved display targeted at non-expert and spontaneous interaction scenarios. We further present preliminary results from an experiment, during which we compared our interaction technique with an established one for different 3D interaction tasks. The results indicate that for the chosen tasks both techniques perform equally well and point out room for further improvement.},

However, very little is known about contexts of game use in real-world rehabilitation settings. In this paper, we explore contexts of commercial game use in BI therapy through observation of inpatient therapy sessions. Based on a systematic analysis of the observation recordings, we found that (1) only 30% of session time was used for gameplay; (2) therapists needed to provide various kinds of cognitive and physical patient support during the play sessions; and (3) therapists adopted multiple strategies to reinforce the therapeutic values of the games. This study is helping us create decision and information sharing tools to support the use and creation of games for BI rehabilitation.},

The play environment fulfills a 'sport over the distance' them via the attempt to mimic the real world ball-passing exercise (or rehabilitation sessions) except that the players can be miles away from each other, and they interact without a physical ball. Moreover, our system allows each player to see the other two and their physical environment respectively, which is a combination of the physical world where players are situated and the virtual world where they play with each other. Kinect sensors are used to map players' action into a virtual world including the passing of the virtual ball. The system prototype was tested with two groups of players; a revised version was pilot tested with 48 players and lead to the final version of the system. Pilot testing results were encouraging in that players reported collective fun and increased social bonding. Meanwhile, player anonymity increased players' willingness to play the virtual-ball game with a stranger, which indicates that the game might be more suitable for those with less social fluency.},

This paper looks at how we can bring the focus back on the co-players providing for more intimate social play without losing the advantages of digital games and visual display. Such games may provide social/relational benefits and increased enjoyment as well as may be of use for social learning, teambuilding, and therapy. The design of our game, Mind Reader, attempts to both learn from non-digital games as well as exploit the potential of mobile devices to create a more social form of video game. The game was built around two main features: face-to-face play and a shared physical space designed to promote social gameplay. We then present a way to test this new form of gameplay against traditional mobile gaming to determine its effect on social interaction.},

The interface recognizes only hand motions and does not recognize poses of a hand or fingers, which enables high-speed stable recognition without complicated processing. The experimental system recognized hand motions with a processing time of about 8.33 [ms/frame] (about 120 [fps]).

The application's distinguishing feature is its interactive virtual pet, which acts as a motivational factor to promote healthier sitting habits. The application analyzes sensor readings from the seat device and prompts users with their virtual pet to take physical action.

abstract = {Smartwatches are widely available and increasingly adopted by consumers. The most common way of interacting with smartwatches is either touching a screen or pressing buttons on the sides. However, such techniques require using both hands. We propose glance awareness and active gaze interaction as alternative techniques to interact with smartwatches. We will describe an experiment conducted to understand the user preferences for visual and haptic feedback on a "glance" at the wristwatch. Following the glance, the users interacted with the watch using gaze gestures. Our results showed that user preferences differed depending on the complexity of the interaction. No clear preference emerged for complex interaction. For simple interaction, haptics was the preferred glance feedback modality.},

abstract = {Direct touch gestures are getting popular as an input modality for mobile and tabletop interaction. However, the finger touch interface is considered as not accurate compared with pen-based interface. One of the main reasons is that the visual feedback of the finger touch is occluded because of the size of fingertip. It has made difficult for perceiving and correcting errors. We propose to utilize another modality to provide information on occluded area. Spatial information on visual channel is transformed to temporal and frequency information on another modality. We use sound modality to illustrate the proposed trans-modality. Results show that performance with additional modality is better for drawing where the visual information is important than only with the visual feedback.},

abstract = {The squeeze of an arm during a tense moment in a story -- an absentminded caress on the back of the hand while listening to an engaging tale -- the physical presence and interpersonal touch of a loved one can be an important part of reading to a child. However the thrill of the tale is often lost and the intimacy diluted when separated families have to resort to the flatness of a video-call or mobile app to share a bedtime story with their loved one. This project is setting out to create a physical story portal, a magical object which uses technologies to link teller and listener through sound, light and touch to help bridge this gap when families are separated. While the development of the InTouch reading system is still in the preliminary stages, a prototype handheld device has been created to allow adults and children to share touch-based messages during story time. It has been trialled with several families in the lab, and the initial results have pointed to both guidance and design considerations that should be taken into account for such a system to be successfully deployed.},

Also most representative emotions drivers want to express while driving were identified, which were made into emoticons. Interactive prototypes which display emoticons were installed in the front and back of vehicles so that drivers can express their emotions while driving. Experiments were conducted to verify whether drivers' stress was reduced when the prototype was installed in the vehicle, thereby enabling them to share their feelings with other drivers. The results showed that stress was indeed reduced in drivers compared to their original state.},

The recovery of such victims, includes psycho-motor therapies to reduce neuromuscular aftermaths, such as phantom limb pain (PLP). Therefore, improving rehabilitation strategies can potentially have a large positive impact in the recovery outcomes for long-term treatments. ViLimbs is a Virtual-Reality-based (VR) system aimed at enhancing classical mirror therapy for amputees using an immersive video-wall that renders the patient himself with a superimposed virtual limb. The patient-virtual-limb interaction is achieved by means of brain computer interfaces (BCI) and myoelectric signals read from the remaining part of the limb. Thus, voluntary movements get naturally transferred from patients to virtual limbs. Last but not least, patients sense of ownership over an alien virtual limb is enhanced through multisensory feedback (cardio-visual), which tends to lessen rehabilitation times.},

We further demonstrate that this type of classification can be done at the level of individual gestures. Furthermore, we describe how we captured a new data set for data exploration and discuss a tool we developed to allow manual annotations of gesture phase information. Initial results we obtained using the new data set annotated with our tool show a precision of 0.95 for recognition of the gesture phase and a precision of 0.93 for simultaneous recognition of the gesture phase and the gesture type.},

We developed a crowdsourced study online in which participants were presented with a series of images containing graphs and diagrams and asked to describe them. Each image was blurred so that the participant needed to click to reveal bubbles - small, circular areas of the image at normal resolution. This is similar to having a confined area of focus like the human eye fovea. We compared the bubble click data with the fixation data from a complementary eye-tracking experiment by calculating the similarity between the resulting heatmaps. A high similarity score suggests that our methodology may be a viable crowdsourced alternative to eye-tracking experiments, especially when little to no eye-tracking data is available. This methodology can also be used to complement eye-tracking studies with an additional behavioral measurement, since it is specifically designed to measure which information people consciously choose to examine for understanding visualizations. },

A metal plate with an embedded electrode was used to provide the user with electrotactile stimuli when touching the surface with a finger that is also equipped with an electrode. The distortion of material textures projected on the touched surface was used to visually simulate surface deformations. We show through an experiment that both, electrotactile and visual feedback can induce the illusion of surface deformation when provided separately. When tactile and visual touch feedback is presented at the same time, the perception of surface changes does not increase compared to just using one feedback modality only.},

As social media is increasingly adopted in health related discourse, we examine how these new platforms might be allowing honest and candid expression of thoughts, experiences and beliefs. Specifically, we seek to detect levels of self-disclosure manifested in posts shared on different mental health forums on Reddit. We develop a classifier for the purpose based on content features. The classifier is able to characterize a Reddit post to be of high, low, or no self-disclosure with 78% accuracy. Applying this classifier to general mental health discourse on Reddit, we find that bulk of such discourse is characterized by high self-disclosure, and that the community responds distinctively to posts that disclose less or more. We conclude with the potential of harnessing our proposed self-disclosure detection algorithm in psychological therapy via social media. We also discuss design considerations for improved community moderation and support in these vulnerable self-disclosing communities.},

abstract = {The global need to effectively address mental health problems and wellbeing is well recognised. Today, online systems are increasingly being viewed as an effective solution for their ability to reach broad populations. As online support groups become popular the workload for human moderators increases. Maintaining quality feedback becomes increasingly challenging as the community grows. Tools that can automatically detect mental health problems from social media posts and then generate smart feedback can greatly reduce human overload. In this paper, we present a system for the automation of interventions using Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques. In particular, we focus on 'depression' and 'anxiety' related interventions. Psychologists evaluated the quality of the systems' interventions and results were compared against human (i.e. moderator) interventions. Results indicate our intervention system still has a long way to go, but is a step in the right direction as a tool to assist human moderators with their service.},

abstract = {Designing to support physical activity is a growing field of interest in interaction design. However, existing explorations in this area have mostly focused on using screens to graphically report physical activity data such as heart rate. The use of edible mediums such as 3D printed food for representing such data opens up new possibilities and challenges to push the field forward. Supporting this, we present EdiPulse that 3D prints in chocolates, personalized cheerful messages and emoticons, displaying heart rate data from physical activity session. By varying the thickness of the printed letters and emoticons, the system also supports abstract visualization of the heart rate data, while the printed chocolate incentivizes participation in physical activity. Ultimately, with this work, we aim to inspire and guide design thinking on food printing and edible quantified self representations, which we believe opens up new interaction possibilities to support the physical activity experience.},

Recent developments in mobile computing have enabled ubiquitous monitoring of walking activity via the smartphone accelerometers. Typically, walking apps map accelerometer values to caloric values through a calibration algorithm. However, these calibration algorithms assume a flat surface, which is not always true and can introduce significant errors. In this paper, we outline a novel calibration method that estimates surface inclination for uphill walking, thus, improving the caloric estimation in mobile walking apps.},

In this work we discuss the requirements for the design of unobtrusive technologies to support the communication between patients and their relatives. We also present design concepts and prototypes based on these requirements. These devices are especially useful when illness inhibits the patient from using conventional methods of communication or if the patient doesn't wish to burden their loved ones with the depth of intimacy they crave.},

Motivational factors were studied through contextual interviews, an adapted cultural probe activity and a survey with a group of young adults currently active in sports. From our preliminary findings we determine that staying healthy, achieving specific goals and socialising represent key motivational factors for young adults to be active in sports, but also, that exercise is not considered a high priority in their daily lives. A link between the motivation of achieving specific goals and a technology to measure and track activities was established. The study concludes with three implications for the design of technology to motivate young adults to participate in sports.},

They were motivated to initiate flu-preventive behaviors when their personal risk bars rose. Our next step includes studying reward strategies, users' motivations to share personal health information, and building a more accurate model of flu risk.},

Recent research involving technology to help people quit smoking has had limited success. Personal face-to-face counseling has historically proven the most successful and effective means to help people quit, but most people are reluctant or too busy to attend counseling sessions. As a potential solution to this problem, we explore providing personal counseling to users via their mobile phones. The advice, written by experts, is based on data about the user and their actual smoking habits collected through smart phones. From a prototype deployment with users in real life context, we found that this type of personal counseling is influential in changing peoples' smoking behaviors for the better. In addition, being made aware of actual smoking habits helps people form strategies that improve their ability to quit.},

While new technologies such as mobile applications that help individuals measure, log, and reflect on their activities hold great promise, they rely on individuals already having the motivation to change their behaviors. How can technology motivate people in increasing their level of physical activity? We explore this question through the design, development, and evaluation of an automated assistance system that draws on a counseling method called motivational interviewing (MI) and utilizes a humanlike robot as a motivational agent. Through dialogue and nonverbal engagement, the agent enables individuals to talk about and reflect on underlying reasons for their lack of motivation regarding physical activity in order to increase intrinsic motivation for behavior change. In this work-in-progress, we describe our system design and discuss findings from a preliminary study that evaluated the impact of the robot's use of MI on user motivation and behavior.},

HabitStar is a star-shaped lighting that can connect with the HabitStar mobile application. The lighting is synchronized with the app by the network server. The user can interact with both the lighting and the app to manage their habits. It helps the user recognize their goals by making them self-record their trials. It also encourages minimum approach for changing habits by providing the norm data as an indicator for practical goals. The lighting can help the user stay motivated by its ambient visualization.},

abstract = {Contemporary micro-location technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) show promise in enabling new experiences when interacting with physical spaces. An emerging BLE technology is iBeacons, with the retail sector pioneering their use to enhance shopping experiences. There is scope for the HCI sustainability community to explore the use of iBeacons to raise awareness around sustainability issues, particularly in public and communal spaces. This work presents embryonic research exploring the design of a prototype iBeacon-based sustainability application called 'Close-the-Loop'. The application builds on previous sustainability and just-in-time feedback research to encourage end-users to engage in recycling behaviours in a large university canteen space. Findings from a focus group and short ethnographic study provide design insights to further develop the prototype to increase engagement with appropriate recycling practices.},

abstract = {Recent study reported that users were shutting down their smart thermostat due to the poor performance in comfort and energy saving. This study aims to explore how automation in energy conservation system should be designed from a new perspective: comfort-energy trade-off. Scenario-based survey was conducted with 106 participants. Results showed that monitored control (high level of automation) was most satisfied in energy-saving-motivated control scenario and consensual control (low level of automation) was most satisfied in comfort-motivated control scenario. Users perceived the same sense of control in consensual control and monitored control as in manual control (no automation) in most scenarios. Thus, the results indicated that automatic environment control should not always be the same, but adaptively designed in accordance with specific comfort-energy trade-off situations, considering different control scenario, personal requirement and culture.},

With the proliferation of digital cameras and smartphones, it is now common for travelers to record their micro activities in fine detail by taking photos without ever missing a moment. However, how to enhance the travel experience by utilizing such recorded micro activities has not been determined. Thus, we aim to 1) investigate how travelers record micro activities in photos through a user study and 2) design a system to enhance travel experiences utilizing travel photos. Based on the user study, we devise a "questification" strategy that motivates travelers to change their photos into quests. We implement a research prototype, Travel Q, a community platform that allows users to share their micro activities through photos. The results of a field study with the prototype suggest that questification is an applicable strategy for enhancing travel experiences.},

Today the concept of 'Energy Sharing' is often limited to householders 'selling' their surplus of locally generated energy to the energy grid. Rather than shared locally, transporting energy back to the grid results in a loss of energy through the power lines. The research aims to understand present and future social dimensions and values of energy sharing from a people's perspective. In this paper the Energy Management game 'Electric City', is presented and results from gaming sessions.The game serves as a platform for informants to reflect upon values and expectations associated with Energy Sharing.},

In this paper, we present an interview study to investigate why and how people use WeChat, particularly focusing on its three novel opportunistic social features: Shake, Drift Bottle, and Look Around. Drawing from 25 interviews, our results suggest that WeChat usage was motivated by a wide range of user needs. Notably, we found these social features supporting fleeting encounters among strangers. The seemingly conflicting practices of dwelling with close people and fleeting encounters with strangers vividly co-existed in the WeChat social space. These results suggest that MIMs as a rich design space for supporting divergent social interactions.},

We show how a flexible mobile device with unrestricted folding can create more realistic and augmented experiences: building on people's existing abilities to manipulate real world objects. We demonstrate this with shape enhanced "Wizard of Oz" demo applications including a book, online shopping, a board game, street navigation, and a dynamic browser.

Because the management of many itching conditions is not necessarily about curing the condition but instead about properly maintaining or controlling the condition, a proper understanding of these types of conditions and accurate recognitions of scratching behavior are important. In particular, a clear understanding of scratching behaviors can be difficult for young children or for those who engage in nocturnal itching while sleeping. In this work, we design a prototype system with two smartwatches which recognize scratching motions and validate the results using an infrared camera to provide the ground truth. We classify scratching motions with the C4.5 algorithm and analyze the data to understand the scratch patterns and to validate our system. Our initial results from the sleep data of three healthy participant show that the proposed method can provide accuracy that exceeds 90%.},

However being investigated since decades, TUIs still play a marginal role compared to other UI paradigms. This is at least partially because TUIs often involve complex hardware elements, which make prototyping and production in quantities difficult and expensive. In this paper we present our work towards paper TUIs (pTUIs) -- easily makeable interactive TUIs using laser-cut paper, brass fasteners, metal bands, mirror foils, and touch screen devices as platform. Through three examples we highlight the flexibility of the approach. We rebuilt the seminal work URP to show that pTUIs can replicate existing TUIs in DIY manufacturing. We implemented tangible Pong being controlled by paper rackets to show that pTUIs can be used in highly interactive systems. Finally, we manufactured an interactive Christmas card and distributed it to 300 recipients by mail to show that pTUIs can be used as apparatus to explore how pTUIs are used outside the lab in real life.},

The exercise is designed to consider a user's motivation level in terms of intention and readiness to change his/her behavior. Despite a short trial period and small sample size, our results show that users who participated in the decisional balancing exercise were more likely to be receptive to their own intervention methods designed to moderate their smartphone use than those who did not participate. Thus, the results suggest that employing decisional balance exercise has the potential to moderate problematic smartphone usage.},

By embedding proofreading features into existing mobile keyboards, SocialKeyboard also achieves easy access anytime and everywhere in mobile environments. Moreover, it aims to induce faster responses by implementing 1) Push based task assignment to mobile crowd workers, 2) Real-time track changes, and 3) Synchronous task chaining of proofreading and verification. We present a first working prototype of SocialKeyboard and describe the interplay between Requester, Proofreader, and Verifier. Our preliminary evaluation showed promising results in terms of task speed, and we plan to perform a large-scale study in the near future.},

abstract = {We present Palette, a method to objectively quantize material color and airiness to provide representative description of a product in online shopping scenarios. Photos and keywords are often used to describe color, texture, and airiness of products. However consumer photos are usually taken under uncontrolled realistic imaging conditions, whereas keywords are fuzzy and highly subjective. Palette leverages active spectrophotometry approach that involves synchronized illumination to measure the reflection and transmission properties of a material as a function of wavelength. We use a Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) sensor equipped camera to capture visible light and near-infrared light intensity. We show that by analyzing the obtained light spectrum, we are able to provide a metric to represent material color and airiness. In this paper, we describe the details in principle of operation and proof-of-concept prototype implementation, as well as reporting results of our analysis using 4 types of garments. To the best of our knowledge, Palette is the first work to exploit spectrophotometry to represent garment color, texture, and airiness; as an effort to enrich user experience in online shopping.},

abstract = {Tangible widgets are one possible answer to the lack of haptic feedback on touch screens and tabletops. In this publication, we focus on tangibles that provide input and output channels by spatially relocating a part of the touch input and visual output area from the touch screen onto their own arbitrarily shaped surface. Optical fibers that transmit light between the widget's base and its surface can be used for this purpose, but input on such tangibles only works on vision based, not on capacitive touch screens, and it forces input and output to be co-located on the surface of the tangible, excluding designs with spatially separated input and output channels, for example, back-of-device interaction. We propose Transporter tangibles that exploit the technological separation of input and output channels in current capacitive touch screens. By integrating thin conductive wires into optical fiber based widgets, we can apply independent spatial transformations to both channels. This technique allows us to create tangible widgets in which the arrangement, scale, and shape of the input and output surfaces on the tangible can be designed independently and flexibly. A series of use cases illustrates the possibilities of this technology. We also explore the space of construction parameters for widgets that reliably transmit touch.},

A personal screen can be operated by touch operations and a shared screen can be operated by pointing with fingers. Touch and pointing direction are recognized from the depth image and the confidence map obtained by a depth camera. We developed an early prototype system for verification and implemented a presentation application that supports collaborative work to the system. This application allows a user to move a window between the shared screen and the personal screen and to perform various operations on the slides.},

abstract = {During use of touch-screen tablet devices, the user's hand can occlude regions of the screen. Here, we present results from an exploratory study of hand orientation and occlusion among American primary school students using a touch-screen tablet device. We investigated hand orientations, amount of occlusion, and the effects of tablet tilt angle (flat or tilted) on students preferred hand orientations when using a touch-screen tablet device. From 18 interviews with 5th-7th grade students using interactive science simulations, we found five common hand orientations corresponding to a range from high to low occlusion. Tablet tilt angle considerably impacted students preferred hand orientations. Based on these results, we suggest that encouraging students to work on tablets with a moderate tilt angle (30-45 degrees), rather than lying flat on a table, could significantly decrease occlusion and increase the effectiveness of touch-screen tablet devices for learning.},

To improve the virtual keyboards, we focus on two observations. First, all alphabetic keys are already allocated to each finger of skilled typists. Second, non-touching fingers move in correlation with a touching finger because of the intrinsic structure of the human hand. Based on the first observation, we suggested a new virtual keyboard that restricts each finger to enter the pre-allocated keys only. Then, we statistically proved the second observation in our experiment. Through this experiment, we found the significant correlations between a touching and some of the other non-touching fingers. Finally, we discussed how these correlations can help to improve the performance of the virtual keyboards.},

We introduce a solution that automatically freezes the video, and present the results of a user study comparing it with manual freeze and no freeze conditions. Auto-freeze was most preferred by both remote and local participants who felt it best solved the issue of annotations appearing in the wrong place. With auto-freeze, remote users were able to draw annotations quicker, while the local users were able to understand the annotations clearer.},

While these devices continue to improve, there is, as yet, no device that affords six degrees of freedom (6-DoF) control and directional haptic feedback. We present The Cage, a 6-DoF controller for piloting an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The Cage is comprised of a handle suspended by eight lines, each coupled to a vertex, within a physical cuboid cage. Each line in turn is connected to a stepper motor, allowing the pilot to move and rotate the handle freely to control the UAV whilst obtaining accurate directional force feedback. This feedback can both subtly and absolutely constrain the control of the UAV to within the flight area thus preventing the pilot from hazard collisions. We define 4 modes of force feedback and a range of application areas. We then provide details of a proof-of-concept device and suggest areas for future work.},

abstract = {This study aims to develop PicLight, a user-centered lighting control interface based on the behavior of photo editing as an analogy for controlling light. The PicLight application allows users to takes photos of a space, then uses those photos to display simulations of lighting scenarios through filter effects, providing users with guidance for easy selection of optimal lighting conditions. We formed 20 lighting presets each of that engages user activity, affection. In order to determine whether the presets were suitable, we conveyed a validation test and validated context-based presets are effective features for designing lighting control interfaces.},

abstract = {Interactive artifacts are normative, as they materialize the norms of their designers in order to guide human action in a use-context. A better understanding of how interactive artifacts transmit norms can support designers and users to critically reflect about appropriate human and designed artificial behavior in context. In this paper we introduce 'normative types', which are artifacts that disable, guide, or empower people's bodily actions, in order to deliberately address and explore what is normative physical action in context. We present four design explorations of normative types, named 'Petal Table', 'Toilet Companion', 'Keep-Up-With-Me Table', and the 'Ring Fork'. Based on initial field trials we suggest that socially (in)appropriate bodily action can be imposed, exposed, juxtaposed, or opposed by normative types. We suggest that these modes of intention can aid designers in developing a critical self-reflective and contextually informed design approach.},

Instead of using 3D for entertainment, we explore the 3D effect as a mean to spatially structure user interface (UI) elements. To evaluate potentials and drawbacks of in-car 3D displays we mounted an autostereoscopic display as instrument cluster in a vehicle and conducted a real-world driving study with 15 experts in automotive UI design. The results show that the 3D effect increases the perceived quality of the UI and enhances the presentation of spatial information (e.g., navigation cues) compared to 2D. However, the effect should be used well-considered to avoid spatial clutter which can increase the system's complexity.},

Good touch performance cannot solve the "fat-finger" problem, which results from occlusion and the size disparity between fingers and targets. We propose Hover Cursor, a method to improve small target selection using hover-sensing over a touchscreen. Using a capacitive touch sensor that also provides hover data, the hover position of the user's finger is displayed with a cursor, and selection is performed with a tap. In a Fitts' study, we compared Hover Cursor with direct-touch selection. Users made fewer selection errors with Hover Cursor. Hover Cursor was slower overall, but faster and more accurate for small targets.},

Behind the scenes, however, there is a complex and error-prone choreography of multiple people controlling separate motion axes and camera attributes. This strict separation of tasks has mostly historical reasons, which we believe could be overcome with today's technology. We revisit interface design for camera motion starting with ethnographic observations and interviews with nine camera operators. We identified seven influencing factors for camera work and found that automation needs to be combined with human interaction: Operators want to be able to spontaneously take over in unforeseen situations. We characterize a class of user interfaces supporting (semi-)automated camera motion that take both human and machine capabilities into account by offering seamless transitions between automation and control.},

Traditional document exploration interfaces require multiple keywords to be typed in, which is cumbersome and time-consuming using a touch-driven device. We present BigGo - an interface for exploration of documents using touch gestures. Our interface goes beyond common binary touch gestures as "like" or "dislike": the user is given a chance to not just provide binary feedback, but also explain why they like or dislike a certain document. Since the feedback is richer, it allows BinGo to provide a better recommendation of documents, and aid exploration of the documents. The ability to provide richer feedback improves the exploration experience and decreases the overall gesture cost for targeting the proper document set. User studies and the results show that BinGo outperforms binary gestural interfaces on recommendation quality while maintaining the usability on traditional like / dislike exploration mechanism on touch interfaces.},

Further study is to be conducted to investigate the effect of automatic email delivery mediation on the cognitive cost and work efficiency.},

The availability of large, responsive pools of workers means that low quality work can often be treated as noise and dealt with through standard data processing techniques. This approach is not practical in all scenarios though, so efforts have been made to stop poor performance occurring by preventing satisficing behaviours that can compromise result quality. In this paper we test an intervention -- a task lockout -- designed to prevent satisficing behaviour in a simple data-entry task on Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results show that workers are highly adaptable: when faced with the intervention they develop workaround strategies, allocating their time elsewhere during lockout periods. This suggests that more subtle techniques may be required to substantially influence worker behaviour.},

One of these stages is the intention retention stage, in which a person has to stay vigilant of the task and recognize when it can be carried out. Within the retention process there is the need to maintain groupings of tasks based on one's areas of responsibility as well. To aid in task retention overall, external memory aids are often used. Still, there are occasions where intentions are not retained when external memory aids are used due to the aid's inability to convey task information or cue execution of a task. In our work, we look to design an external memory aid that supports retention of individual task knowledge as well as retention of task knowledge in a user's different areas of responsibility. With this tool we will observe its use to verify or deny its ability to support these two activities. We have conducted a survey of task management practices and results from the survey, along with related work, have aided in our initial design.},

And it the meantime, they are difficult to find as they don't have an immediate textual description. Our approach is first to create a taxonomy of textual terms to describe visualizations, both in a general and in a specific way using economics visualization as application domain. Then we designed and implemented a search engine to query this vocabulary on a real website, The Atlas of Economic Complexity, using economics data. Results from an exploratory study informed us on the types of tasks to support and on the visual design of the search box, such as showing recommendations similar to Google results. Those early and promising results pave the way for a more diverse and complex vocabulary that exploits the full wealth of information that graphical elements can contain. Such a search feature has wide ranging applicability, from making visualizations more accessible for less technical users, to using other input modalities such as voice.},

abstract = {We studied how the integration of small visualizations (word-scale visualizations) into a sentence affects reading speed and memorization during a brief reading task. In particular, we were interested in how different placement types with their inherent text appearance and layout changes affect readers. We designed a quantitative study in which we gave sentences with or without visualizations for participants to read. Then, we invited them to answer questions on the sentences. We found that the information encoded in the visualizations is more prominent and easily remembered than information in the written text, but that different placement options had little to no effect on reading performance, even if participants had different preferences.},

We describe a workflow which allows the user to browse live entities associated with 65 million articles. In the on-line interface, each query leads to a specific network representation of the most prevailing entities: topics (words), authors, journals and Dewey decimal classes linked to the set of terms in the query. This network represents the context of a query. Each of the network nodes is clickable: by clicking through, a user traverses a large space of articles along dimensions of authors, journals, Dewey classes and words simultaneously. We present different use cases of such an interface. This paper provides a link between the quest for maps of science and on-going debates in HCI about the use of interactive information visualisation to empower users in their search.},

Our user experience and insight analysis study showed that the tangible interface allowed for more personal, reflective insights, whereas the graphical user interface was considered more efficient in time. These findings were confirmed during an in-the-wild observation study in a hospital waiting room. We therefore formulated a set of design implications for the future interaction design of casual, tangible visualizations on small screens.},

In contrast to previous work we explore how users' performance scales with an increasing amount of large display space when working with text documents. In a controlled experiment, we determine participants' performance when searching for titles and images in large text documents using one to six 50" 4K monitors. Our results show that the users' visual search performance does not linearly increase with an increasing amount of display space.},

abstract = {Digitally mediated tasks are becoming an indispensable part of our daily life. However, they often suppose different kinds of strategies to be solved with success (e.g., creativity, accuracy). The strategies people use to for task solving might unintentionally be influenced by graphic user interfaces' (GUI) visual characteristics. The present research investigates this topic by focusing on impacts related to isolated colors and forms. First, a word association test showed that specific color and form characteristics are associated to ideas of threat or, on the contrary, of comfort. An anagram-solving test then demonstrated that color and form stimuli influence performance differently depending on these associations: Participants solved comfort-related anagrams faster when presented in combination with visual stimuli associated to comfort ideas (i.e., orange, round forms). Conversely, vigilance-related anagrams were solved faster when presented in association with visual stimuli associated to threat. These findings strongly suggest that color and form elements used in GUIs can impact user's approach and sensitivity to specific information. Depending on the kind of tasks (e.g., demanding creativity or accuracy), the effects can either support solving or impair it. Further researches should transfer the present results to concrete computer mediated tasks.},

abstract = {Analysts use scripts, visualization tools, and spreadsheets as they process and understand data. We focus on two phases of analysts' work: discovery, where the field definitions are understood, and profiling, where assumptions are tested by searching, observing, and running counts on data. Lack of data exploration and understanding can lead to faulty assumptions and misinterpretation. In practice, analysts use SQL queries and scripts to subset big data, reducing it for visualization or spreadsheet pivots. However, due to large-size and high-dimensional data, it is challenging to determine precise subsets of interest without thorough data exploration and discovery. We reduce the cost of previewing subsets by combining search with an information rich visualization of high-dimensional data. To enable discovery and profiling, Quarry supports (1) rapid query generation and visualized search; and (2) defining and previewing subsets of data for potential export for further processing. This work presents the design of Quarry and results from a formative study involving 11 analysts/data scientists and a dataset with 80 columns and 15 million rows.},

We present a brief description of the algorithms behind image selection, evaluate how effective they are in creating a sense of narrative, and discuss the wider implications of our work. Results show that semantic tagging, a dynamic programming algorithm, and a simple narrative structure produced triptychs which were significantly more story-like, with a significantly more coherent order, than a random selection, or a neutral sequence of images.},

The algorithm produces design rankings that are positively correlated with existing social metrics such as number of likes, but also allows designs with second-order social import to rise through the ranks. We demonstrate that the algorithm converges, and analyze the rankings it produces on both simulated and scraped social design networks.},

As regular crowdsourcing, friendsourcing requesters needs to incentivize potential workers (i.e., friends) to actually engage and complete the requested tasks. However, it is unclear how to effectively motivate friendsourcing workers and what incentives, which may include both social and monetary ones, are considered feasible in friendsourcing, especially by taking social relations between requesters and workers as part of the calculation. In an exploratory study, we asked participants to report their estimations of feasible payment as a requester, and reward as a worker in friendsourcing. We compare the estimated costs of friendsourcing to regular crowdsourcing, and find that there exists a gap between requesters' and workers' expected costs. Individuals would like to pay more as a requester, and expect to receive less as a worker in friendsourcing. Consideration of social transaction and relationship maintenance is involved. We discuss the implications for designing friendsourcing systems.},

However, the method in which particular persuasive design principles are chosen over others remains unclear. Meanwhile, the use of socio-ecological model has been widely utilized in clinical research, as a basis to understand the factors in the entire ecological system that influences behavioural patterns. Because persuasive technology aims to change the behaviour and attitudes of users, we believe that the use of socio-ecological model would be beneficial to inform the design of persuasive applications. Accordingly, in this paper, we attempt to demonstrate the mapping of the socio-ecological factors and persuasive design principles by conducting interviews and expert reviews. Based on our approach, 12 socio-ecological factors that influence physical activity behaviour, and corresponding relevant persuasive design principles to deal with these factors, are identified.},

In our research, we are exploring the translation of these lightweight social interactions into the physical world as design provocations. In this paper, we introduce one example called "I Like This Shirt", a tangible manifestation of the ubiquitous Like button embedded in an interactive t-shirt.

abstract = {Many users of online dating systems have a multitude of relationship goals including casual encounters. However, most studies of online dating systems have focused exclusively on users' abilities to find long-term relationships. This has restricted our understanding of how to design systems for users that have multiple relationship goals. To address this gap in understanding we explored how people use online dating systems in regards to casual encounters. We did this through an interview study with users of a popular online dating system in the USA and a study of online dating coaches who give behavioral advice specific to the pursuit of casual encounters. Findings highlight how users subtly disguise and probe for openness to casual encounters, while coaches try to overcome ambiguities in user intentions through a series of targeted dating methods.},

abstract = {The emergence of social media has had a significant impact on how people communicate, interact, and socialize. People engage in social media in different ways by not only adding content such as photos, texts, and videos, but also adding tags, Likes, comments, and following others. Through these activities, people form and develop social connections and networks. In this paper, we present a two-dimensional Like network formed and developed by people who have a same tag in their photos. Based on the dataset consisting of 51K photos posted by 36K users in Instagram, we present the structural and relational aspects of tag-based Like networks. Our study results highlight that Like networks have different sizes and degrees of network components depending on a tag type. We also found that a large portion of Likes came from random users for all networks.},

abstract = {The rapid advancement of Web2.0 technologies has made social networking sites, such as Facebook and twitter, important venues for individuals to seek and share information. As understanding the information needs of users is crucial for designing and developing tools to support their social Q&amp;A behaviors, in this paper, we present a new way of classifying questions from a design perspective, with the aim of facilitating the development of question routing systems according to individual's information need. As an attempt to understand the questioner's intent in social question and answering environments, we propose a taxonomy of questions posted on Twitter, called ASK. Our taxonomy uncovers three different kinds of questions: accuracy, social, and knowledge. In addition, to enable automatic detection on these three types of information needs, we measured and reported on the differences in ASK types of questions reflected at both lexical and syntactic levels.},

Based on positive psychology research, we hypothesize that the act of reviewing content that led to smiles will improve positive affect, and consequently, overall wellbeing.

abstract = {When taking a photo, such verbal prompts as "cheese" or "smile" are often used by photographers to get natural smiles from their subjects. However, since the obtained smiles usually look forced or resemble a grimace, capturing a natural smile is difficult. We propose an active camera system called "Laughin'Cam" that obtains natural-looking portraits by eliciting spontaneous smiles by presenting the sound of laughter. The proposed system utilizes an emotional contagion effect, which is the tendency of emotional behavior to spread from person to person. We conducted an evaluation experiment with our proposed system using computer vision and also performed a subjective experiment. Our results suggested that our system could efficiently induce naturally-looking and spontaneous smiles.},

This applies to both personal contexts (e.g. checking banking information in a coffee shop) and professional contexts (e.g. sharing patient information in a hospital ward). It is important to explore ways to support visual privacy that are appropriate for mobile device use in public settings and in dynamic workflows. In this paper we present the design, prototype implementation, and ongoing evaluation of a range of privacy notifications and privacy control mechanisms for tablets. Preliminary results show that: 1) spatial information such as distance and orientation can be used to mediate privacy management for tablet interfaces. 2) Privacy notifications and control mechanisms should be designed to complement our existing physical awareness and protection mechanisms. 3) Selecting a specific design is highly context-dependent.},

abstract = {Material expression has always been an important non-verbal, sensual method for designers to communicate with users of a designed object. A critical non-verbal mode of communicating is rooted in the expression of emotion which directly relates bodies to the environment. [1, 3, 6, 7, 8] Computational textiles which transform through electronic commands over time augment the choices and expressions possible for designers to communicate with people using these textiles. The problem is what exactly is communicated emotionally to people through the transforming textural expressions of the material? The author presents a study which relates communication of emotion to people via the aesthetic textural expression of computational textiles or textiles which transform through electronic commands over time. The author presents the preliminary results of the study as one of many methods which when combined with other design methods from architectural design will be used to fabricate a computational textile that can express a range of emotions through its textural transformations},

A variety of smart media, such as tablet PCs and robots, are being used to train children with autism spectrum disorders on emotional vocabulary use through language therapy. In this work, we explore the effectiveness of robot-based intervention (compared with PC-based intervention) on children with HFA; in particular, we evaluate the impact of using emotional stories to understand how intervention impacts the total number (and the diversity) of words to express their emotions. Our initial results revealed that children with HFA showed significantly higher performance when using robot intervention than PCs, in terms of the total number of emotional words used. Our study thus suggests that robot-based intervention can be used as a potential therapeutic tool for training children with HFA to increase their ability to use words to express their emotions.},

However, there are negative aspects to using this kind of software, for example, it has been found that people communicating in the text-chat environment may experience a lack of trust and may face different levels of cognitive load [1, 11]. This study examines a novel way to measure interpersonal trust and cognitive load when they overlap with each other in the text-chat environment. We used Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), a physiological measurement, to collect data from twenty-eight subjects at four gradients and overlapping conditions between trust and cognitive load. The findings show that the GSR signals were significantly affected by both trust and cognitive load and provide promising evidence that GSR can be used as a tool for measuring interpersonal trust when cognitive load is low and also for measuring cognitive load when trust is high.},

To address this problem, we present ApplianceReader - a system that combines a wearable point-of-view camera with on-demand crowdsourcing and computer vision to make appliance interfaces accessible. ApplianceReader sends photos of appliance interfaces that it has not seen previously to the crowd, who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface. Computer vision techniques then track the user's finger pointing at the controls and read out the labels previously provided by the crowd. This enables visually impaired users to interactively explore and use appliances without asking the crowd repetitively.

The opportunities and challenges that are raised by such technologies are investigated and discussed. We describe an exemplary application of the approach and point out the arising possibilities and limitations. As the main contribution we present a method for evaluating the ethnographic research data that is being produced through this kind of research approach. Furthermore, we propose a set of frameworks for analyzing the resulting images and related metadata. This method is considered a first attempt to facilitate the analysis process of the produced qualitative and quantitative data and is subject to further investigation and development.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a low-cost context-aware technique for determining a user's walking quality. This is achieved by filtering and analyzing the acoustic signal generated when users walk. To extract the acoustic values of footsteps, we implemented a simple wearable device attached on the user's ankle. To verify our approach, we conducted a preliminary test using several pattern classification algorithms. The results show that our system achieves an 89.6% average for three different walking styles (best, good, and bad) and 86.9% for four different real-world ground sets (carpet, asphalt, sand, and wood). We believe that our technique can be applied to existing context-aware techniques as well as various unexplored domains in wearable devices.},

Results from a between-subjects experiment (N = 40) revealed that health information in a comparative and textual format was more effective in encouraging health conservation in participants than identical information presented in a non-comparative and image format. In addition, participants' level of health consciousness emerged as a significant predictor. The implications of the key findings are discussed.},

Although alternative input modalities such as speech input could be used, these can also introduce other issues regarding privacy or ease of use. Consequently, HCI researchers have been exploring novel input techniques for smartwatches. In this paper, we introduce WatchMe, a smartwatch application that uses the smartwatch camera and image processing techniques to allow for providing input on a drawing canvas composed of everyday objects and surfaces. We rely on a cloud OCR engine to retrieve text from captured images. Combining these characteristics, we illustrate some scenarios in which WatchMe could be used, such as a novel method for two-factor authentication.},

abstract = {While Mark Weiser's vision of ubiquitous computing is getting closer to reality, a fundamental part of it - the interconnection of devices into a "ubiquitous network" - is not achieved yet. Differences in hardware, architecture, and missing standardizations are just some reasons for this. We think that existing research is not versatile enough and too tailored to either single applications, hardware, or location. We contribute Connichiwa -- a versatile framework for creating web applications across multiple devices. We base Connichiwa on four key goals: integration of existing devices, independence of network infrastructure, versatility of application scenario, and usability of its API. Connichiwa runs web applications on off-the-shelf consumer devices. With no external dependencies, such as a server, it enables a great variety of possible scenarios. We tested the technical feasibility of Connichiwa in seven example applications and plan to evaluate the framework and the usability of its API in a one-week Hackathon.},

It highlights an emerging interest in personal digital archiving and sees this as a fruitful area for more transformative forms of cross disciplinary working. A study is described in which an attempt is made to expose and actively engage UK based archivists and records managers with a selection of literature and research about personal digital archiving taken from the ACM Digital Library. The aim of the study was to see what, if anything, could be learnt through this process and whether, and in what way, such interaction might engender new insight and innovation. Although little new insight and innovation were so engendered, the study still makes a contribution as a provocation to reflect on cross disciplinary working and its importance for shaping new fields of study such as personal digital archiving.},

abstract = {Up until now, several studies have shown that a speech interface system giving verbal suggestions with beeping sounds that decrease in pitch conveyed a low system confidence level to users intuitively, and these beeping sounds were named "artificial subtle expressions" (ASEs). However, all participants in these studies were only Japanese, so if the participants' mother tongue has different sensitivity to variations in pitch compared with Japanese, the interpretations of the ASEs might be different. We then investigated whether the ASEs are interpreted in the same way as with Japanese regardless of the users' mother tongues; specifically we focused on three language categories in traditional phonological typology. We conducted a web-based experiment to investigate whether the ways speakers of German, Portuguese (stress accent language), Mandarin Chinese (tone language) and Japanese (pitch accent language) interpret the ASEs are different or not. The results of this experiment showed that the ways of interpreting did not differ, so this suggests that these ways are language-independent.},

The design approach, developed iteratively through consultation, demonstration and testing led to an "unsurprising interface" aimed at maximizing use and appropriation across cultures by unifying visual, text and spoken contents in both passive and interactive displays in a modeless manner.},

abstract = {Our interactions with the spaces around us are frequently defined by space usage rules (SURs) like "no smoking", "no dogs allowed", and "stay on the trail". These rules are important public health tools and help protect the environment, among other applications. However, despite their importance, no large-scale database of SURs currently exists. This prevents online/mobile maps from presenting these rules to users, as their traditional paper counterparts have been shown to do regularly. The lack of a SUR database also prevents developers from building novel SUR-based applications, e.g. mobile apps that inform users where they can smoke or walk their dog. In this paper, we present an in-development user interface to support the semi-automatic encoding of SURs expressed in natural language in documents such as laws, city ordinances, park rules, and institution FAQ pages. Our system will allow an untrained user to easily enter complex rules into a spatial data format compatible with OpenStreetMap.},

To address this issue, we presented a novel prototyping tool, called SNAP, which enables designers to implement sensor-based interactions easily. Our concept was drawn from a natural language programming and microinteraction model. Hence, it does not require any programming skills or schemes. We believe that our approach will shed a light on prototyping works in the design process.},

As a first step towards this vision, we present a survey assessing the users' view and their video recording behavior. Findings were used to inform the design of a prototype based on off-the-shelf components, which allows users to create meaningful video clips of their daily activities in an automated manner by using their phone and any wearable camera.

In addition, those high in neuroticism were most likely to browse for music by activity or genre. Our findings can support music streaming services to further personalize user interfaces.

abstract = {Budgeting is an important means of controlling ones finances and reducing debt. This paper outlines our work towards designing more user centred technology for individual and household budgeting. Based on an ethnographically informed study with 15 participants, we highlight a misalignment between people's actual budgeting practices and those supported by off-the-shelf budgeting aids. In addressing this misalignment we outline three tenets that may be incorporated into future work in this area. These include (1) catering for the different phases of engagement with technology; (2) catering for the practices of hiding and limiting access to money, and; (3) integrating materiality into technical solutions.},

In this paper, we discuss the relation of brand experience and user experience, and suggest combining the forces of experience designers and marketing people to deliver a consistent, strong experience in all touch points between the company and its external stakeholders. We report a work-in-progress case from one company as an example of how company-wide experience goals can be defined for enabling consistent experience in all touch points. We propose experience design researchers to pay more attention to brand experience and to all touch points.},

abstract = {In recent years, researchers aimed to understand different facets of positive experiences with technology. Positive psychology, and recently also HCI, makes use of a hedonia/ eudaimonia distinction. Hedonia is understood as providing enjoyable experiences, whereas eudaimonia is associated with meaningful experiences. However, it is not clear how eudaimonia manifests in the HCI context. The aim of this explorative study is to provide empirical evidence for eudaimonia in HCI and outline what characterizes hedonic and eudaimonic user experiences. Results indicate that hedonic and eudaimonic user experiences often seem to occur at the same time. Preliminary analysis of user narratives show rich data and experiences with a huge range of different devices are described. Based on these findings further implications and research possibilities are discussed.},

In the tendering process a procuring organization defines usability requirements, evaluation procedures and selection criteria, while IT vendors try and build and propose solutions that best fulfill these requirements. Existing usability research has instructed the procuring organizations on how usability should be included in the request for proposals, in order to ensure the usability of the selected system. However, the IT vendor perspective on request for proposals and related usability work during the tendering process remain unexplored. This paper grasps the issue with an empirical study on large-scale IT procurement. The preliminary findings give practical advice to vendors planning usability work and buyers writing request for proposals.},

abstract = {Recent advances in materials science have resulted in a range of commercially viable and easy-to-use conductive inks which many practitioners are now using for the rapid design and realization of interactive circuits. Despite the ease with which hobbyists, educators and researchers can construct working circuits, a major limitation of prototyping with conductive ink is the difficulty of altering a design which has already been printed, and in particular removing areas of ink. In this paper we present Circuit Eraser, a simple yet effective tool which enables users to 'delete' existing conductive patterns. Through experimentation we have found an effective combination of materials which result in the removal of only the thin surface layer composed of ink particles, with minimal damage to the surface coating of the paper. This important characteristic ensures it is possible to re-apply conductive ink as part of an on-going design iteration. In addition to a lab-based evaluation of our Circuit Eraser which we present here, we have also used our technique in several practical applications and we illustrate one of these, namely the iterative design of a radio-frequency antenna.},

abstract = {Psychologically, "Kansei" is related to emotion and cognition and sociologically is related to culture and tradition. Historically, as a Japanese term, the origin of the concept of "Kansei" goes back to "Aesthesis" by Aristotle and "Aesthetics" concepts by Baumgarten and Kant. When this concept was imported to Japan in Meiji era, about 150 years ago, the concept was translated as "Bigaku" or the science of beauty as well as was translated as "Kansei" or the concept with the connotation including sensitivity, sensibility, emotion and feeling. Hence Kansei is related to the science of beauty in its historical background in Japan. JSKE (Japan Society of Kansei Engineering) started a series of KEER (Kansei Engineering and Emotion Research) conference in the latter sense of aesthetics. This is a peculiar situation of the Japanese language and its academic culture. Similarly, The term "Kansei" can be interpreted differently from country to country, and from culture to culture. This workshop is organized to discuss the concept of "Kansei" from different cultural perspectives. For example, "kawaii" is now used internationally as can be found in Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawaii). At the same time, this workshop aims not only to differentiate the differences among various cultures, but also expects to find out the common aspects based on the fact that we are all the human beings with the emotional system and the cognitive system.},

Technology is increasingly playing a role in the way people connect to these services at the (hyper)local level. While there has been considerable research on designing technology to support conventional, established systems of community organization and governance; mobile and ubiquitous technologies offer strong potential for alternative systems to be established in the local level. Do It Yourself (DIY) and maker movements are enabling grassroots activist groups to develop their own technologies or to hack existing tools to support bottom-up systems of self-organization, democracy and commerce. Based on these trends and the recent worldwide economic, political and societal crisis, this workshop will bring together researchers, practitioners and activists to re-envision how HCI tools can support alternative systems of local civic engagement.},

When, how and why do people invoke or exploit notions of online versus offline? When does this notional "seam" dissolve? We will articulate a broadened agenda for understanding behavior across contexts. We aim to continue and update discussions of on- and offline with a deeper focus on people's practices and experiences around the creation and maintenance of a sense of "self" and identity and discuss designers' and developers' roles and responsibilities in enabling and supporting those practices.},

abstract = {With HCI researchers conducting studies in increasingly sensitive and difficult settings, ethics is emerging as a key concern for the HCI community. New technologies are now being designed and evaluated in settings that involve vulnerable or marginalized participants and that can be emotionally challenging for researchers. Research in these settings can produce complex ethical dilemmas that are often emergent, diverse, and highly contextualized. In addition, there may be discrepancies between the realities of HCI fieldwork and the formal and often rigid processes of obtaining ethics approval in research institutions. Given these issues, it is important for researchers to communally reflect on ethical encounters in HCI research. This workshop will provide a forum for researchers to share experiences about ethical challenges they have faced. These discussions will be used to develop a handbook of practical lessons representing the breadth and depth of ethical issues emerging in HCI research in sensitive settings.},

In an effort to promote human-centred knowledge exchange and design expertise between these communities, this workshop aims to explore interaction design for intended smart home users at and transitioning between successive life stages. Ultimately, we will aim to address how smart home technologies can be designed to evolve with their users over the life course.

abstract = {The question "What to Study in HCI" has two parts. First it asks how HCI researchers think about the research challenges they tackle: how do they decide what problems to engage with and how to study them? Second, the question also asks what is the subject of HCI: which challenges should researchers address and, ultimately, what makes us unique as a discipline? While there have been intermittent discussions on this topic in HCI, the present workshop emphasizes this question and explore some possible answers among a group of seasoned researchers. One reason is our belief that researchers can benefit from addressing these questions so as to develop their practical understanding (e.g., "tricks of the trade") of how to tackle the complexity of selecting "what to study". Second, we argue that researchers can benefit from thinking about the epistemological grounds upon which they base their everyday work, that is, thinking about what HCI is. The workshop results in publicly available key readings and position papers on "What to Study in HCI".},

abstract = {Engaging children in play for wellbeing is coming to prominence in HCI as the community increasingly engages with issues to do with health, care and therapy. To date, research in this area has primarily focused on engaging children with special needs or who suffer from mental health problems in organized play to improve their self-efficacy or support therapeutic treatment. However, play could be more broadly beneficial for all children and their wellbeing. This workshop aims to build an interdisciplinary community of researchers, designers, and practitioners to share and discuss their work. Additionally, it seeks to explore the interaction between play and wellbeing in the context of interaction design and children and to identify directions for future research.},

abstract = {HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the HCI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that CHI researchers and general HCI, UI, and UX practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centred principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.},

abstract = {Experience Sampling Methodology (ESM) is a type of longitudinal diary study that allows one to understand a person's experience in the moment. It combines the qualitative richness of longitudinal diary studies, artifacts of a field study, and quantitative data of a large-scale survey or app tracker. Using a free, open-source mobile app called "PACO (Personal Analytics COmpanion)," we can conduct ESM studies with participants anywhere in the world. These studies can be conducted after qualitative studies (e.g., ethnography, interviews) to ascertain how broadly your observations apply to your user population or they can be done in advance to identify insights you want to study in-person, in-depth. By combining these methodologies, you create a, deeper, more holistic understanding of your users. This workshop will give attendees the skills to design, conduct, and analyze data from ESM studies at any scale.},

abstract = {We as researchers and User Experience (UX) designers want to identify and create products that change the world and therefore, we choose to engage in strategic research and design. In the real world though, coming up with a breakthrough idea or transformative design doesn't mean it will automatically be accepted or get to market. By definition, innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking. Organizations by nature seem to have anti-innovation antibodies [1] that often kill new ideas [2] even disruptive innovations [3] that could help companies differentiate themselves from their competition. As difficult as coming up with a game-changing idea can be, getting an organization to act on the idea often seems impossible. Perhaps we find ourselves in work routines that do not provide space to think differently. Our experience is that practitioners and academics alike need new tools to meet this challenge-tools that empower UX teams in both business and universities to identify transformative new ideas, and then to get these big ideas and designs accepted. This course proposes rapid design labs-a design-led, facilitative, cross-functional, iterative approach to innovation that aligns organizations and generates value at each step. It provides tools and methods that turn attendees into catalysts, who systemically identify new ideas, and align multi-disciplinary teams around their ideas. Attendees learn how to lead workshops that foster ideation, collaboration, trust, and free expression. These workshops enable intensive brainstorming, purposeful play, design, user testing, and rapid prototyping. Learn how innovative companies and universities, such as Splunk, Deutsche Telekom Laboratories, the Berlin Technical University, Yahoo!, Mindjet, zSpace, HP, and more identify, design, and bring great products to market.},

abstract = {A crucial step in designing a user interface for a software application is to design a coherent, task-focused conceptual model (CM). With a CM, designers design better, developers develop better, and users learn and use better. Unfortunately, this step is often skipped, resulting in incoherent, arbitrary, inconsistent, overly-complex applications that impede design, development, learning, understanding, and use. This course covers what CMs are, how they help, how to develop them, and provides hands-on experience.},

abstract = {Our vision-driven design research is carried out through an artistic approach. Whereas much of today's mainstream Human Computer Interaction (HCI) research addresses functional concerns the needs of users, practical applications, and usability evaluation -- Tangible Bits and Radical Atoms (transformable physical materials) are driven by vision [Fig.1]. This is because today's technologies will become obsolete in one year, and today's applications will be replaced in 10 years, but true visions -- we believe -- can last longer than 100 years. This course introduces the trajectory of our vision-driven design research from Tangible Bits towards Radical Atoms, and a variety of interaction design projects that were presented and exhibited in Media Arts, Design, and HCI communities. Especially, we focus on the recent development in the two streams of Radical Atoms: 1) Dynamic Shape Display, and 2) Programmable Materials.},

A wide range of material will be covered, from dedicated e-reading devices to best practices for presenting reading material on screens and in apps. The course will review the history and flow of paper-based reading through the ages, using this to motivate and illustrate better digital reading designs for the future. Attendees will be introduced, interactively, to the many issues that are present when displaying text on screens, including poor interface choices, and affordances that have been badly migrated from paper. In the process, we will explore how future designs can support greater immersion and accessibility without compromising on readability. By the end, attendees will have learnt several techniques for designing better future digital reading systems.},

abstract = {A growing number of HCI professionals are interested in how we might design technology to foster psychological wellbeing. Meeting such an aim will involve a crossing of disciplines, of methods, and a new way of thinking about what technology should be doing for us. By turning to the well-established research and methods available in psychology, education, neuroscience, and HCI, we can begin to cultivate a field dedicated to the design and development of technology that supports wellbeing and human potential, a field we refer to as positive computing [1]. In this course we will explore multidisciplinary approaches to evaluating and designing for digital experience that supports wellbeing determinants like self-awareness, autonomy, resilience, mindfulness, and altruism. The objective of this course is to provide participants with: a theoretical foundation, a practical framework, a look at the state of the art, and group-generated design strategies to better support wellbeing in their current and future projects.},
