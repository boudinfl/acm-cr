abstract = {The goal here was to determine whether computer interfaces are capable of social influence via humor. Users interacted with a natural language capable virtual agent that told persuasive information, and they were given the option to use information from the dialogue in order to complete a problem-solving task. Individuals interacting with an ostensibly humorous virtual agent were influenced by it such that those who judged the agent unfunny were less likely to be persuaded and departed from the agent's suggestions. We discuss the implications of these results for HCI involving natural language systems and virtual agents.},

StoryFaces invites children to record emotional expressions and then automatically composes these recordings in storybook illustrations. After children watch their faces bring a story to life, they can "go backstage" to play with the story by rearranging the videos and altering the story text. This paper presents our exploratory prototype, a design rationale that focuses on supporting children's emotional growth through storytelling play and reflection, and reports on a formative evaluation with two children ages 4-6. Results from the evaluation suggest that children ages 4-6 are engaged in the activity, are excited to create a variety of emotional expressions, find the narratives funny yet clear, and work to re-craft and reinterpret story meanings through iterative editing and play with both video and textual content. Our goal is to provoke new ideas about how pretend play with digital tools can empower young children in a narrative process.},

More generally, this interface is intended to act as a technology probe for exploring an emerging research agenda around fearsome interactions. We describe the deployment of our gas masks in two events: as a control mechanism for an interactive ride, and to enhance a theme park horror maze. We identify six broad dimensions - cultural, visceral, control, social, performance and engineering - that frame an agenda for future research into fearsome interactions.},

Communiclay builds on trends in tangible interfaces and explores the ways in which future actuated materials can enable a variety of tangible interfaces. We present applications that stem from past research in tangible media, and describe explorations that address ways in which people make meaning of remote communication through gesture and dynamic physical form. Our hypothesis is that current research in programmable matter will eventually converge with UI research; Communiclay demonstrates that we can begin to explore design and social issues with today's technologies.},

We are beginning to understand how some of this information can be utilized to improve the users' experiences with interfaces and with one another.

Personality has been shown to be relevant to many types of interactions; it has been shown to be useful in predicting job satisfaction, professional and romantic relationship success, and even preference for different interfaces. Until now, to accurately gauge users' personalities, they needed to take a personality test. This made it impractical to use personality analysis in many social media domains. In this paper, we present a method by which a user's personality can be accurately predicted through the publicly available information on their Facebook profile. We will describe the type of data collected, our methods of analysis, and the results of predicting personality traits through machine learning. We then discuss the implications this has for social media design, interface design, and broader domains.},

To do this, we first examine conceptual dimensions of form in interactive artifacts through the lens of three existing perspectives with their respective focus on: material, meaning, and making. We then apply these perspectives in our analysis of specific forms of interactive artifacts. Based on this analysis, we suggest a model of four different types of forms: the cognitive, embodied, expressive, and exploratory forms. Reflecting on this model, we propose form-driven interaction design research with its epistemological and methodological implications.},

We argue furthermore, that realism can be increased while still maintaining control: analogue experiments allow researchers to conduct experiments in more ecologically valid environments and online experiments bridge the gap between the cleanroom and field. While increasing the level of realism in an experiment can introduce noise, technological developments have made it easier to collect rich analytics on behavior and usage.},

abstract = {This paper presents computationally and physically augmented desktop objects - "Things that hover" - that is capable of moving autonomously on desktop, and discusses about technical mechanisms, future possible interaction styles and applications based on this architecture. A goal of the design is to create self-moving robotic modules on top of a flat surface. Integrating lightweight piezoelectric air-blow actuators and contact-less power providing technology from desktop surface, tiny robots can hover and control the direction of movement without any battery, which illustrates that our approach is practically feasible.},

abstract = {We developed a floating avatar system that integrates a blimp with a virtual avatar to create a unique telepresence system. Our blimp works as an avatar and contains several pieces of equipment, including a projector and a speaker as the output functions. Users can communicate with others by transmitting their facial image through the projector and voice through the speaker. A camera and microphone attached to the blimp provide the input function and support the user's manipulation from a distance. The user's presence is dramatically enhanced compared to using conventional virtual avatars (e.g., CG and images) because the avatar is a physical object that can move freely in the real world. In addition, the user's senses are augmented because the blimp detects dynamic information in the real world. For example, the camera provides the user with a special floating view, and the microphone catches a wide variety of sounds such as conversations and environmental noises. This paper describes our floating avatar concept and its implementation.},

Recent techniques used for real-world visual content creation, such as those used for sports broadcasting and motion pictures, also incorporate cameras moving in 3D physical space to provide viewers with a more engaging experience. For such purpose, wired cameras or mechanically controlled cameras are used, but they require huge and expensive infrastructure, and their freedom of motion is limited. To realize more flexible free-space camerawork at reasonable cost, we propose a system called "Flying Eyes" based on autonomous aerial vehicles.

However, usability issues occur when standard mouse interaction is applied to workstations with large size and high pixel density. Previous studies show users navigate physically when interacting with information on large displays by rotating their chair. ChairMouse captures this natural chair movement and translates it into large-scale cursor movement while still maintaining standard mouse usage for local cursor movement. ChairMouse supports both active and passive use, reducing tedious mouse interactions by leveraging physical chair action.},

One of these drawbacks is the activation of the recognition system -- trigger gesture - which is generally tiring and unnatural. In this paper, we propose two natural solutions to easily activate the gesture interaction. The first one requires a single action from the user: grasping a remote control to start interacting. The second one is completely transparent for the user: the gesture system is only activated when the user's gaze points to the screen, i.e. when s/he is looking at it. Our first evaluation with the 2 proposed solutions plus a default implementation suggests that the gaze estimation activation is efficient enough to remove the need of a trigger gesture in order to activate the recognition system.},

abstract = {In the study of human-robot interaction, the aesthetic design of socially active machines is a relatively new endeavor, and there are few precedents on which to rely for guidance. Whereas some of the early social robots such as Kismet [1] had expressive body characteristics such as eyeballs, eyelids and ears, the form was not unified into a holistic design. That is, features varied from one another in aesthetic characteristics, and the overall form still gave the impression of being a metal frame to which a series of parts were affixed. As subsequent social robots have been developed, they have varied wildly in terms of overall aesthetic creative direction. In the development of Simon, a humanoid robot currently in progress at the Georgia Institute of Technology, the authors sought to give industrial design an important role, and included creative direction at the very start of the project. Mechanical design, AI development and industrial design were all explored in tandem. The shell design, particularly for the head, was not looked upon as an external layer that would sheath the underlying mechanisms, but rather a core means for defining the robot's entire movement and behavioral characteristics.},

abstract = {Sellers on eBay today can use a variety of web page designs to distinguish their items from similar merchandise sold by other sellers. While such inconsistency in information display may lead certain items to be more memorable than others, it was also hypothesized to make it more difficult for buyers to compare items when making a purchase decision. To investigate this hypothesis, eBay gathered user feedback on a more consistent page design using two survey approaches that yielded markedly different results. The first approach involved presenting the new design in isolation, while the second approach involved presenting the new design in the context of a larger task flow. Respondents in the first approach tended to focus on specific design aspects and the inconvenience they might face in acclimating to a new design, whereas respondents in the second approach were better able to appreciate the benefits to overall shopping efficiency. This case study underscores the importance of context when gathering user feedback about designs, especially when such designs are intended to provide more holistic real-world benefits.},

Today they have moved off the printed page into websites, online applications, smart phone screens and interactive documents. Sparklines display hundreds of data points over time: stock prices or sports statistics for the prior year, for example. But how well do they perform with millions of data points acquired in microseconds? What if users capture these data every couple of minutes? How well do sparklines, primarily designed for static display of historical data, fare in the context of an interactive application? In this case study, the author describes interactive sparklines his team designed and developed to assist electronic engineers debugging their electronic circuits. The case study presents an iterative user-centered design process from the initial proposal of sparklines through to their refinement after several releases. The study concludes with reflections about future improvements to interactive sparklines.},

It starts from a dis-cussion of different types of feedback employed by earlier design cases. Based on this, we designed the Calendar concept as an ambient, persistent and indi-vidualized feedback. A field study with two families (6 individuals) revealed that the Calendar fosters goal setting, comparison, competition, and communication. In addition, quantitative data showed one family to have been more successful in translating the Calendar's offer into actual behavior change, i.e., saving water. This highlights that change is not achieved by the product itself (as in automation or regulation), but by the people involved.},

abstract = {Numerous companies have demonstrated that game- changing design can differentiate them competitively. FastCompany[1] and BusinessWeek[2] magazines show examples weekly. At the same time, as difficult as coming up with a new idea that differentiates a company's product from those of its competitors can be, just coming up with the idea itself sometimes seems easy compared to the challenge of getting an organization to accept and act on it. Enabling User Experience Research and Design teams to deliver design solutions that change market dynamics often requires changes to culture and process. It also requires improving the political positioning of the User Experience organization. This case study highlights a method one UX team used to bring key stakeholders, including UX, Engineering, and Product Management, to the strategy table, and enable such strategic design. This UX team introduced collaborative design workshops to enable them to collaboratively generate great ideas and align their multidisciplinary product team around them. Such workshops enabled integrative thinking[3] to enable teams to arrive at the optimal solution. They also fostered trust, promoted free expression, and quietly created a new strategy table, where UX led the discussion about product strategy, introducing design as a key differentiator. In this example, such workshops provided a venue for engaging a cross-functional team in brainstorming and creative ideation, filtering a large set of ideas, collaborating on design, rapidly gathering user feedback and iterating designs, and getting the consensus the team needed to drive innovative products to market.},

abstract = {We are introducing a zoomable, canvas based editor called Prezi, in which multiple users can collaborate synchronously, and share a common workspace for various purposes. They can develop a presentation together, create a mindmap, a storyline or do brainstorming. In this paper we would like to describe our key ideas, when designing the user experience of the collaboration function. We are arguing that the use of avatars in zoomable user interfaces are providing a uniquely efficient environment for collaboration in productivity applications. This kind of representation in a ZUI collaboration environment is raising group awareness, articulation work, and also gamifies presentaion editing, facilitating casual interaction between the participants.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe the process of designing an e-solution for linking informal self-help groups in Africa as a case study. As in many parts of the developing world, participation in these groups in Africa is very popular. Also loosely referred to as Merry-Go-Rounds (MGRs) these are groups of people who come together for either or all of: sharing knowledge, news, ideas, tradition, supporting one another in times of need (social welfare), saving and borrowing together in a rotational manner (informal banking), and carrying out local income generating or self / community development projects. In Africa majority of MGRs are geographically isolated particularly those in rural areas hence interaction between different groups in different regions is minimal yet linking the groups could benefit them in various ways as described in this paper. Worthy of consideration is the implementation of linkages through e-solutions that would help overcome the geographical dispersion of groups. The MGR Solution designed by Nokia Research Center (NRC) Africa is one such tool. It is a mobile solution for self-help groups to better manage their group activities and link them to other groups thus creating financial and social synergy. It provides for various functions to support internal group activities (administrative, financial and projects), group to group activities (e.g. sharing news, ideas, and assets, pooling finances, collaborating on projects) and other external functions (organizations that desire to be linked to and work with groups). To satisfy this, the prototype developed includes a website for the MGR service designed to be accessed from a mobile phone based on the limited screen size and a website that can be accessed from a Personal Computer (PC) as it has more features as compared to the strip down version for mobile phones. The solution also includes a mobile client for the internal group management activities, ability to access MGR web services via the mobile client, and use of SMS for communication by the MGR service. This paper examines the design process of the MGR Solution through ethnographic research, concept development and implementation, and generated user feedback, and hence related Human Computer Interaction (HCI) circumstances, consequences and opportunities. A virtual platform for sharing and exchange provides a good opportunity for growth and development of self-help groups due to increased access to information. It mitigates the geographical hurdle and other related socio-cultural and cost challenges. However certain things may need to be taken into account. These include possible language barriers and how to overcome these e.g. through translations, low literacy levels hence potential to explore audio technologies such as speech to text and text to speech, and elements that can be incorporated on the virtual platform to help build and increase trust amongst the users so that they are able to interact successfully. For example, groups using the system need to be able to verify authenticity of other groups, have some kind of guarantee or mitigation of risks associated to resource sharing with other groups and control and ownership of the shared content.},

abstract = {Computer mediated communication tools have multiplied the possibilities to stay in touch and interact with the people in our social network. The dynamics of use for these tools suggest changes in the context of self-disclosure. Although research has explored online self-disclosure of students (who are expressing large breaches in previous norms of privacy regulation), much less attention has been paid to disclosure behavior of older, and particularly experienced users. A mixed-method approach will be used to explore different aspects of this complex phenomenon, including a survey, interviews and experience sampling. Results of this project should reveal the most salient drivers for online Self-Disclosure for this group.},

abstract = {Vocal production is one of the most ubiquitous and expressive activities of people, yet understanding its production and synthesis remains elusive. When vocal synthesis is elevated to include new forms of singing and sound production, fundamental changes to culture and musical expression emerge. Nowadays, Text-To-Speech (TTS) synthesis seems unable to suggest innovative solutions for new computing trends, such as mobility, interactivity, ubiquitous computing or expressive manipulation. In this paper, we describe our pioneering work in developing interactive voice synthesis beyond the TTS paradigm. We present DiVA and HandSketch as our two current voice-based digital musical instruments. We then discuss the evolution of this performance practice into a new ubiquitous model applied to voice synthesis, and we describe our first prototype using a mobile phone and wireless embodied devices in order to allow a group of users to collaboratively produce voice synthesis in real-time.},

This is made possible with the engineering of an interaction framework that distills the complexity of control processing to a set of semantically-rich modal controls that are discoverable, composable and adaptable.

The goal of the game is for the chaser to capture a token displayed on one of the Lumalive shirts, by pressing a touch sensor located on the shirt. When the chaser is in close proximity to the token player, the token jumps to the shirt of the second closest player, making this children's game more challenging for adult players.

A research agenda is proposed to understand this relationship, as well as to learn how to integrate 3D-Press in multimodal interfaces for constantly-changing mobile use contexts.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a spherical display with Fish-Tank VR as a means for interacting with three- dimensional objects. We implemented the spherical display by reflecting a projected image off a hemispherical mirror, allowing for a seamless curvilinear display surface. Diffuse illumination is used for detecting touch points on the sphere. The user's head position and the position of the sphere are also tracked using a Vicon motion capture device. Users can perform multi-touch gestures to interact with 3D content on the spherical display. Our system relies on the metaphor of a snow globe. Users can walk around a display while maintaining motion parallax corrected viewpoints of the object on the display. They can interact with the 3D object using multitouch interaction techniques, allowing for rotating and scaling of the 3D model on the display.},

Intuitive interactions are used to perform tasks such as keyword searching, results browsing, categorizing, and linking to online resources such as Google and Twitter. The interaction-based query style also naturally lends the system to different types of user input such as multi-touch gestures.

In particular, there have been emerging lines of tension in User Experience that parallel the tensions in the larger field of HCI research, particularly between approaches that emphasize the need for representations and understandings of user experience that are precise, comparable, and generalizable, and third-wave approaches that emphasize the richness of situated actions, the inseparability of mind and body, and the contextual dependency of experiences. At the same time, there are tensions between the needs of industry for immediately useful and applicable techniques and methods, and academics' emphasis on verifiable, repeatable, and theoretically grounded work. In this panel, we bring together a number of these threads to discuss the necessity of designing for user experience. How can we connect the different threads of UX work, without erasing the differences between them? Is there any value in theory of UX, and if so, to whom? What actually works in designing for a user experience?},

abstract = {Design research is an emerging area in design that has increasing relevance to the field of HCI. While we have made advances in integrating design research methods, approaches, and outcomes in HCI, we still have a way to go. This is due to fundamental differences in the development of design knowledge as compared to scientific knowledge and knowledge about human theories of behavior. We call together this panel at CHI 2011, comprised of leading HCIdesign researchers, to explore ways to develop and refine critical discussions of design research within the HCI community.},

abstract = {With Google [9] having established itself as the de-facto standard for document search and retrieval, the focus has shifted recently to the domain of social search. Morris et al. [12] define social search as "the process of finding information online with the assistance of social resources such as friends or unknown persons". A number of online services [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] have been created to enable social search. But most of these are not useful when a person is mobile and offline and when the information need is highly context-specific. To enable social search in such situations, we introduce iConnect, the social advice application for mobile phones. iConnect is designed to enable a unique kind of social search, where an iConnect user is connected to other iConnect users in the same geographic region or locality. This would help people to solve their daily information needs. This paper illustrates the design process that we employed to conceptualize and prototype this application.},

Error rates were recorded on a routine toy task, with several carefully controlled device- and task-oriented steps. Results show that error rates are substantially higher on device-oriented steps, and step times are longer. The findings demonstrate that a step's relevance to the task goal plays an important role in the occurrence of slip errors. They further highlight the problems associated with device-oriented steps, and make a strong case for avoiding them as much as possible in interface design.},

abstract = {Programmers are often faced with the necessity to visualize source code and grasp its structure. In a survey we studied how developers deal with this task. Based on our findings, we present the software visualization tool Code Gestalt, which assists programmers in quickly creating class diagrams. We evaluated and refined our concept using two prototypes. As a result, Code Gestalt introduces the tag overlay and thematic relations. These augmentations to class diagrams display similarities in the vocabulary used in the underlying source code. This simple, yet effective toolset empowers the user to explore and visualize software systems. The preliminary results of a user study investigating Code Gestalt indicate good usability.},

abstract = {Previous studies suggested that people from Eastern and Western cultural origins tagged digital images in different ways due to cultural difference in attentional patterns [2]. This study was conducted to examine whether Easterners and Westerners also exhibited dif-ferent behavioral patterns when searching for digital images. European Americans (EA) and Chinese were asked to general search keywords and to draw ideal target images for image searching tasks. Consistent with previous studies, results showed that Chinese were more likely to generate search keywords describing the overall properties of the target images than EA. When drawing ideal target images, EA assigned more space to the main objects than Chinese. The findings provided significant implications for designing cultural-sensitive tools to facilitate image search.},

abstract = {Social media has facilitated coordination efforts to help save lives, but are people using social media after the emergency phase? To answer this question, the author conducted a study surveying the social media revival of 111 crisis events that occurred over the past 50 years to examine if social media is being used to commemorate historical crises. Quantitative and qualitative social media metrics on each event were collected to determine their social media presence. The findings show that people are using social media to sustain the living record of past crises as an attempt to prevent disasters and strengthen resilience to future crises. Technological and social hazards that occurred before the social media age tended to exhibit a higher social media presence than natural hazards. Also, the revival of past crises typically occurred when they were linked to recent crises that exhibited similar causes, effects, and vulnerabilities. Issues in the construction and implementation of the survey inform the development of sociotechnical systems designed to collect, manage, and analyze historical events through the cyberinfrastructure.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an experiment that aims at understanding the influence that (visual) grid-based structuring of user interfaces can have on spatial and content memory. By the term grid we refer to two different aspects. On the one hand, this relates to the structured alignment, the layout of objects on a canvas. On the other hand, a grid can also be indicated visually by inserting lines that form an array which divides a canvas into smaller fields. In both cases we detected a strong positive influence on spatial memory. On content memory, however, grids have a less beneficial influence. Only if grid lines are visible, the structured alignment has a positive effect. On the other hand, the visibility of grid lines always leads to worse results in content memory performance, independent of the spatial arrangement.},

abstract = {This SIG focuses on the engineering of automation in interactive critical systems. Automation has already been studied in a number of (sub-) disciplines and application fields: design, human factors, psychology, (software) engineering, aviation, health care, games. One distinguishing feature of the area we are focusing on is that in the field of interactive critical systems properties such as reliability, dependability and fault-tolerance are as important as usability or user experience. The SIG targets at two problem areas: first the engineering of the user interaction with (partly-) autonomous systems: how to design, build and assess autonomous behavior, especially in cases where there is a need to represent on the user interface both autonomous and interactive objects. An example of such integration is the representation of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (where no direct interaction is possible), together with aircrafts (that have to be instructed by an air traffic controller to avoid the UAV). Second the design and engineering of user interaction in general for autonomous objectssystems (for example a cruise control in a car or an autopilot in an aircraft). The goal of the SIG is to raise interest in the CHI community on these aspects and to identify a community of researchers and practitioners interested in those more and more prominent issues of interfaces for interactive critical systems. The expected audience should be interested in addressing the issues of integration of mainly unconnected research domains to formulate a new joint research agenda.},

abstract = {In recent years interactive visualization of 3D data has become increasingly important and widespread due to the requirements of several application areas. However, current user interfaces often lack adequate support for 3D interactions: 2D desktop systems are often limited in cases where natural interaction with 3D content is required, and sophisticated 3D user interfaces consisting of stereoscopic projections and tracked input devices are rarely adopted by ordinary users. Touch interaction has received considerable attention for 2D interfaces, and more recently for 3D interfaces. Many touch devices now support multiple degrees of freedom input by capturing multiple 2D contact positions on the surface as well as varying levels of pressure and even depth. There is, therefore, great potential for multi-touch interfaces to provide the traditionally difficult to achieve combination of natural 3D interaction without any instrumentation. When combined with a stereoscopic display of 3D data as well as 3D depth cameras, we believe that multi-touch technology can form the basis for a next generation of intuitive and expressive 3D user interfaces. Several research groups have begun to explore the potential, limitations, and challenges of this and other 3D touch environments, and first commercial systems are already available. The goal of the SIG "Touching the 3rd Dimension (T3D)" is to address the research and industrial challenges involved in exploring the space where the flat digital world of surface computing meets the physical, spatially complex, 3D space in which we live. The meeting will provide a common forum to attract groups of conference attendees who share their visions of the future and recent results in the area of improving 3D interaction and visualization by taking advantage of the strengths of advanced multi-touch computing.},

abstract = {This SIG proposal, sponsored by the CHI Design Community, looks at the intersection and cross-fertilization between HCI, and Digital and Performance Arts. We consider how the exploration of engaging and meaningful artistic experience can further push the boundaries of HCI research and practice and how tool use and models of evaluation can be explored to assist the development of creative enterprises. We consider how artists' early experiments with technology can inform mainstream design thinking, and how theories and practice in aesthetics can feed into User Experience.},

Visibility of national and international priorities such as public health, political unrest, disaster relief, and climate change has increased, yet we know little about the benefits - and possible costs - of engaging in social activism via social media. These powerful social issues introduce a need for scientific research into technology mediated social participation. What are the actual, tangible benefits of "greening" Twitter profile pictures in support of the Iranian elections? Does cartooning a Facebook profile picture really raise awareness of child abuse? Are there unintended negative effects through low-risk, low-cost technology-mediated participation? And, is there a difference - in both outcome and engagement level - between different types of online social activism? This SIG will investigate technology mediated social participation through a critical lens, discussing both the potential positive and negative outcomes of such participation. Approaches to designing for increased participation, evaluating effects of participation, and next steps in scientific research directions will be discussed.},

One cannot play a game solitarily in a meaningful sense without interacting with the other players. However, there are still no integrated ways of designing and evaluating the inherent sociability of MMOGs, nor are there methods or guidelines for evaluating social user experiences. Designers of MMOGs are often left to use their intuition and experience, many times leading to design failures. This SIG aims to further the understanding of the challenges relating to the design of the social interactions that users experience, and the way these manifest and are supported in Massively Multi-player Online Games (MMOGs). The goal is to examine the ways that sociability manifests in MMOGs and the way that design affects these manifestations.},

Yet with the growing importance and complexity of 3D technologies and virtual worlds, motion and gesture interfaces, more barriers are being raised that prevent people with disabilities from using or fully enjoying them. These new gaming experiences often require more control than current assistive technologies can support, even when the architectures themselves are designed to be accessible. The Accessible Games SIG will provide an opportunity for people working in the area of accessible games and entertainment or who can bring value to the area to meet and network, and to discuss future community building activities. A goal is to stimulate more collaboration in the accessible games area. In addition to sharing current work and identifying areas of common interest, a scenario focused exercise will be held that imagines a fully accessible networked virtual world game in order to uncover opportunities for research and innovation.},

Since the inception of elections and election technologies, all segments of the voting population have never been granted equal access, privacy and security when voting. Voting technology today has not addressed the issues that disabled voters are confronted with at the polls. Because approximately 17% of the voting population is disabled, their issues should be handled with a solution geared towards their needs. Disabled voters need to be able to cast their vote without the assistance of others. The Prime III multimodal voting system addresses these issues. The video illustrates the use of the Prime III system and how it allows disabled voters to use the same system as those without disabilities.},

The system's distinctive feature is that people can add information to the screen themselves, such as tweets, photos, local and cultural news announcements, so that the library and its visitors can inform and connect with each other. Over the course of almost one year, several studies were conducted, including focus group, interview- and observation-based studies that have motivated the functionality, and particularly the user-generated and localized content the system supports. Consequently, the services and functionality the system offers are aimed towards supporting Library 2.0, the next generation library.},

For both touchers and touchees, opt-outs occurred mostly in the upper chest. On the front, the upper chest and lower abdominal zones were the least comfortable. Findings suggest participants were less comfortable with touches on the upper chest, the lower abdomen, and the lower back. We conclude that the most appropriate areas for touch sensors on a shirt are on the arms, shoulders, and upper back.},

abstract = {This video features a scaled prototype of RWal (Reactive Wall) that was built based upon the floor plan of Hilton San Francisco Union Sq. Continental Ballroom. The RWal is a continuum surface intelligent system that is commissioned in a conference area. It can sense occupancy in different session areas and change its shape dynamically so that it provides more space for a session that is crowded at the expense of reducing the room space for a session that is sparsely populated. Temperature sensors are used to monitor occupancy and the walls are manipulated by tendons driven by servo motors and controlled by an Arduino ATMega328 microcontroller. The wall is actuated (actively and passively) at different points and is designed in such a way that it encloses a constant volume space. The key idea is to manage the available floor area to prevent congestion. This will be a practical option in any conference where there are typically boring as well as interesting speakers and an unavoidable movement of attendees from one session to another.},

abstract = {Within a frame of possible ubiquitous urban applications this research explores ways to support the mobility of senior citizens in vehicles by finding efficient routes to reach their destination and managing their time. Our solution is called SAMM and operates following a context-aware and crowdsourcing model where data used by the system to optimize routes is both, taken from user's agenda and received from other users in real time. This allows older adults to optimize their trips by doing several things without leaving a main route, and to be aware of traffic jams long before other media report it. It is expected that a ubiquitous urban application like SAMM will be of great benefit for elderly people by increasing trip efficiency and avoiding the problems associated with spending excessive time sitting in a vehicle as well as encouraging them to take an active and independent role in society.},

abstract = {Sand animation is a performance art technique in which an artist tells stories by creating animated images with sand. Inspired by this medium, we have developed a new multi-touch digital artistic medium named SandCanvas that simplifies the creation of sand animations. The elegance of sand animation lies in the seamless flow of expressive hand gestures that cause images to fluidly evolve, surprising and delighting audiences. While physical sand animation already possesses these properties, SandCanvas enhances them. SandCanvas's color and texture features enable faster, more dramatic transitions, while its mixed media and gesture recording features make it possible to create entirely new experiences. Session recording and frame capture complement these capabilities by simplifying post-production of sand animation performances.},

One key aspect that separates visual analytics from other related fields (InfoVis, SciVis, HCI) is the focus on analytical reasoning. While the final products generated at from an analytical process are of great value, research has shown that the processes of the analysis themselves are just as important if not more so. These processes not only contain information on individual insights discovered, but also how the users arrive at these insights. This area of research that focuses on understanding a user's reasoning process through the study of their interactions with a visualization is called Analytic Provenance, and has demonstrated great potential in becoming a foundation of the science of visual analytics. The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners from academia, national labs, and industry to share methods for capturing, storing, and reusing user interactions and insights. We aim to develop a research agenda for how to better study analytic provenance and utilize the results in assisting users in solving real world problems.},

abstract = {The growing body of sustainable HCI shows that new interfaces may increase awareness and motivate action for environmental impact. Most of this research has been aimed at consumer decision-making, leaving out many professional domains. This workshop broadens the scope of HCI research to consider new user groups including professional users, educators, designers and engineers, governments and NGO's. We propose a broad approach to sustainable HCI for emerging domains: visible - actionable - sustainable. In order to effect sustainable change, new interfaces need to make issues visible in order to promote actionable decisions towards socially and environmentally sustainable ends. These approaches can support sustainable decision-making in product design and a variety of sectors. This workshop will gather interdisciplinary case studies to help identify emerging domains of where sustainable interaction design could provide important social and environmental benefit. The expected outcome is the start of a pattern language for sustainability solutions to the most promising application domains. Patterns are named solutions to recurring problems with enough flexibility to be applied in new contexts. Pattern languages have been developed for architecture and urban planning, object-oriented programming, change management, HCI, and pedagogy. We choose to structure the workshop around the concepts and techniques of pattern languages because because they focus the attention of the community on creating and sharing expertise on what works in general and in a form and format that is useful to designers who are working on specific solutions for specific contexts. The workshop will consider submissions to inform a pattern language from a number of potential application domains for sustainable interaction design including professional users, education, food and drink, marketing and sales, governments, NGOs, designers and engineers.},

abstract = {Given the growth of Child Computer Interaction research, next generation HCI technologies play an important role in the future of education. Educators rely on technology to improve and adapt learning to the pedagogical needs of learners. Hence, this community needs to understand how current technology concepts match with current pedagogical paradigms. The classroom is a high stakes environment for experimentation, thus new interaction techniques need to be validated to prove their pedagogical value in the educational setting. This workshop provides a forum to discuss key HCI issues facing next generation education. With a particular focus on child computer interaction, these issues comprise inter alia the interaction with whole class interactive whiteboards, small group interactive multi-touch tables, and individual personal response systems (e.g. mobile devices) in the classroom.},

abstract = {User-Centered Design (UCD) under the umbrella of user experience (UX) has gained momentum as the de facto standard to produce successful products and services. Use of products is seen as a highly personal and context-sensitive balancing act that derives its uniqueness from the actions and emotions of the users. While the definition of UX is still in the making, it is hoped to extend the designing of products beyond functionality toward users' perceptions and emotions. As the practices for designing UX are emerging, we would like to address the UCD challenge from a different perspective. Therefore, in this paper we introduce designer experience (DX) as a means to design products at an experiential level, that of beyond contextual or empathic design. We welcome critical discussion on the existence and feasibility of DX, seek out available methodology to reliably invoke it, and collect practical future uses for DX.},

The focus of the workshop is exploring and investigating how descriptions and theories of everyday practice can be employed in order to critically and creatively rethink how HCI frames research and design issues of sustainability - both collectively as a field and individually in participants' own work.},

Although much isolated research takes place tackling particular aspects of this problem space (e.g. persuasion), this workshop will be the first venue to provide a forum that discusses meta-issues that apply to behaviour change and pervasive technology, irrespective of how it is achieved. These issues include: (a) What novel opportunities do pervasive technologies provide? (b) When is the appropriate time to begin, reduce or end intervention? (c) Are PINC methods ethical? and (d) How can we extend the scale of intervention?Participants are invited to contribute to the workshop with examples of PINC technologies, and the event will focus on mapping the conceptual space, creating novel ideas and interactive applications and discussing future opportunities. Ultimately, the workshop aspires to establish a community dedicated to this topic.},

Second, it hopes to explore key issues around current and potential uses of technology to support reminiscence, including 1) understanding people's current practices around reminiscing, 2) using empirical studies and theories of memory to inform technology designs, 3) evaluating existing technologies for reminiscence, 4) exploring ways that technology might support new reminiscing practices, and 5) supporting social aspects of reminiscence. We are particularly interested in bringing people from outside the CHI community into the workshop to add new perspectives and foster new collaborations around the work. A series of discussion-focused panels organized around the key topics identified by participants will lead to thoughtful examinations of these topics informed by multiple viewpoints.

Our approach is novel because it adopts a theoretical framework for effective critique and implements the framework on a popular crowdsourcing platform. Preliminary results show that our approach allows designers to acquire quality critiques in a timely manner that compare favorably with critiques produced from a well-known online community.},

In a usability test conducted to evaluate our prototype, users found the technique easy to learn, natural to use, and useful for navigation. Analysis of the patterns of interaction gestures helped identify human factors that should be considered when designing touch interfaces for e-books.

In this paper we report intermediate evaluation results of the AVN email program. We evaluated the email program in two ways: a. by analyzing the AVN email server logs and b. by collecting subjective responses through questionnaires. Our results indicate that both aphasics and therapists find the email program useful, despite the fact that they expressed several criticisms about its usability. Therefore, some changes are required to make the program better useable and more widely accessible for the target group.},

There appears to be a move toward larger screens, with recent launches of Apple's iPad and Samsung's Galaxy Tab, but do these devices undercut the perceived mobility and affect user attitudes toward the technology? To answer these and related questions, the present study examines the effects of screen-size and communication modality (text vs. video) on mobile device users' perception of mobility and content as well as attitudes toward technology acceptance. Preliminary data from a between-subjects experiment show that smaller screen-size elicited greater perceived mobility while larger screen-size was key to greater enjoyment. News story in video format played a crucial role in providing greater enjoyment and newsworthiness of the news story while news in text format was perceived to be easier to use on a mobile device. Design implications and limitations are discussed, as we prepare for a constructive replication.},

In this particular study, a series of experiments were conducted to investigate public interior spaces with embedded ambient displays. The findings are then presented showing how the presence of an ambient display through its visual depth affects and changes movement patterns. This study discusses the ability of an ambient display to refine navigation paths and suggests that its visual depth can enhance its effectiveness.},

abstract = {Visiting crowded places at night in a group of friends is a common leisure activity in many parts of the world. However, the chaotic nature of such place makes it difficult to keep the group together. Constantly watching out for the others or frequent use of technology (e.g. phone calls or Google Latitude) may be contradictory to the idea of having a jolly night out. We therefore designed FriendSense, a mobile application that acts as a pervasive anchor to one of the friends. Beyond existing solutions it allows to continuously sense the anchored friend's location through vibro-tactile feedback. In a preliminary field study we investigated how this added sense affects a night out at an Oktoberfest-like festival. We found evidence that FriendSense users were more confident and less stressed with keeping the group together.},

When designing systems depending upon providing feedback to users (e.g., navigation systems), it is a crucial prerequisite to minimize influence on and distraction from the driving task. This becomes even more important when designing systems for the use on motorbikes; space for output devices is scarce, as people are wearing helmets visual feedback is often difficult due to lighting conditions, and audio feedback is limited. In a first step we aimed at creating an understanding as to how information could be communicated in a meaningful way using vibrotactile signals. Therefore, we investigated suitable positions of actuators on the hand, appropriate length of the vibration stimulus, and different vibration patterns. We built a first prototype with 4 vibration actuators attached to the fingertips and asked 4 participants to test our prototype while driving. With this work we envision to lay the foundations for vibrotactile support in navigation systems.},

This is in contrast with probably the most cited paper on this topic from 2001, stating that point-and-click is the most appropriate interaction style for children between 6 and 12 years old. Instead of providing children with information on the interaction style expected we developed two point-and-click interfaces and let children explore those interfaces themselves. Children consistently tried to apply the drag-and-drop interaction style both initially and after having discovered the point-and-click style, resulting in problems in interacting with the interfaces. This was especially clear for the type of action having a natural mapping to holding down the mouse-button, such as cutting or drawing lines. In summary, it appears that children have begun to expect the drag-and-drop interaction style and that deviating from this standard may result in serious usability problems.},

abstract = {Tabletops are commonly used for collaboration but would benefit from features that help orient objects to individual users disposed around the display. We propose an approach of automatic orientation based on fingers and hand detection as a proxy to determine the position of the user. To contribute to the discussion of the relevance of automatic rotation, we present a comparison study of pairs of participants engaged in both loosely and tightly coupled tasks. We collected performance measures, questionnaires and analyze interactions from video recordings. The results show that automatic rotation is more suitable when the collaboration is loosely coupled. Conversely, in tightly coupled tasks performance are worse and user ratings low when automatic rotations are enabled. We conclude that features such as automatic orientation on tabletop are important and promising but that they need to be critically assessed with respect to their effects on collaboration in both tightly and loosely coupled tasks.},

An authentic green infrastructure urban planning problem was used as the task for a within-subjects with rotation experiment with 20 pairs of participants. Because no prior experimental study has isolated the influence of the embodied nature of the TUI on usability, problem solving, and collaboration, a control condition was designed to highlight the impact of embodiment. While this study did not establish the usability benefits suggested by prior research, certain problem solving and collaboration advantages were measured.},

The Interactivity Sketcher is composed of the IA application, input devices, output devices, and IA controllers. The Interactivity Sketcher can help to explore various qualities of interactivity by visualizing and manipulating the relationship between an input and an output through the IA controllers and the IA application. We expect that this tool will enable interaction designers to visualize their own thoughts of interactivity qualities so that they will be able to create their design as if they had 'sketched' it.},

In this work, we present a novel predictive error model which relates accuracy of an on-screen keyboard user to a given layout using the distance between keys. The model is developed from empirical data with the aim to predict the error rate of a user from the layout specification alone. Our proposed model can be combined with the existing quantitative design approaches for designing keyboards having high text-entry speed and accuracy.},

This is particularly true in the field of games research where no rigorous comparative validation has yet been published. In order to validate the available heuristics, a user test of a commercial game is conducted with 6 participants in which 88 issues are identified, against which 146 heuristics are rated for relevance by 3 evaluators. Weak inter-rater reliability is calculated with Krippendorff's Alpha of 0.343, refuting validation of any of the available heuristics. This weak reliability is due to the high complexity of video games, resulting in evaluators interpreting different reasonable causes and solutions for the issues, and hence the wide variance in their ratings of the heuristics.},

With the projector phone mounted at the headstock of the guitar, the fret board and the strings of the guitar are in the field of projection of the phone.

A field evaluation revealed that the children (7 boys and 4 girls) enjoyed playing the game and were able to match facial expression to emotions. Girls employed a different approach to game play than boys and achieved a higher success rate but made fewer overall attempts. Affective and co-operative activity was evident with the children showing joint attention and mirroring of emotions during play.},

There are pronounced differences in participant behaviour between the two video-conferencing designs, indicating higher mutual trust in one of the video-conferencing conditions. The decisive factor seems to be a discrepancy in the type of group identity that develops during the game. Moreover, our results suggest that a combination of personal displays and a unique video-stream of each participant present in the better video-conferencing condition contributed to this result.},

While the Diversity Donut did not establish a statistical advantage over other recommendation methods, participant self-reported data suggested that participants found the Diversity Donut to yield the most diverse set of comments. The second contribution is a new dimensionality reduction technique in Opinion Space: Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).

Data suggest that slide is better at aiding memory than the other modalities, whereas cover-flow and mouse-over generate more user actions. Mouse-over, click-to-download, and zoom-inout tend to foster more favorable attitudes among power users, whereas cover-flow and slide generate more positive attitudes among non-power users.

The travel technique uses a mobile phone with integrated sensors as a 3D spatial input device. We benefit from the touch capability to change the viewpoint translation in the VE, while the orientation of the viewpoint in the VE is controlled by the built-in sensors. The travel interaction clearly distinguishes between translation (touch based translation control) and rotation (steer based rotation control), putting each set of degrees of freedom to a separate interaction technique. This work examines how many degrees of freedom are needed to perform the travel task as easy as possible. It also investigates different mapping functions between the user's actions and the viewpoint reactions in the VR. For that purpose, four metaphors are developed for the steer based rotation control technique. The results of the user study indicate the trend that 4 DOF metaphors perform best, and that the usage of a mobile roll to control the viewpoint is the desired mapping.},

We develop its use in a digitally-projected finger painting application, placing the see-through multitouch sensor in direct line-of-sight between an artist and a remote canvas. This allows the artist to reach through the sensor and paint on the intangibleCanvas as if it were directly in front of them. An iPad is employed as a multimodal workspace for color selection. We evaluate the system through an informal walk-up-and-play installation and comparative study, developing implications for interaction design using this type of precision free-air interface.},

abstract = {As technology design spreads to less technologically developed countries, issues of cultural identity, language, and values manifest in the form of methodological and ethical challenges for HCI4D designers. We offer a new theoretical perspective, in the context of HCI4D design, to advance the HCI postcolonial critique and highlight fundamentally Western design practices. Application of Thiong'o's language and culture theory provides a tool for designers and researchers to face assumptions, cultural communication, and the potential repercussions in cross-cultural design. Upon future development, this postcolonial orientation could be used to create responsible, successful designs and create awareness of inadvertent Western language culture embedded in HCI4D design.},

abstract = {Event-Related Potential (ERP) techniques are commonly used by researchers from a range of disciplines including psychology and medicine to stimulate meaningful ERP signals from the brain and interpret them through Electroencephalography (EEG). ERP signals are in most cases able to reliably reflect cognitive processes, and are widely used in Brain Computer Interface (BCI) research. We present work in progress towards the application of these techniques to emerging consumer-grade BCI technology. Our approach has an impact on the reliability and usability of consumer Brain Computer Interfaces in commercial contexts, and is already being adopted by our industry partners in the games and entertainment sector. It could also significantly reduce the cost and complexity of certain types of large scale ERP research. This work is being undertaken by the Embodied AudioVisual Interaction (EAVI) group at Goldsmiths, University of London, and is supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council.},

abstract = {Digital Signage has become a common-place feature in many public spaces and retail establishments; yet, only limited research has been reported to date on these technologies. For example, questions such as their effect on decision-making, cognitive load, and purchase behavior have yet to be examined. In an effort to attract more attention and increase effectiveness, venders of digital signage are rapidly enhancing features and capabilities for these displays. For example, displays are moving from simple 2d screens to 3d auto-stereoscopic screens, screens featuring multimodal forms of interaction are replacing static displays, and display-only screens are being replaced by displays capable of recognizing user characteristics. An important "new" type of display is the dynamic digital menu board, which combines digital signage with the power of video. Surprisingly, despite its increasingly common use in areas as diverse as education and retail, only limited academic research on digital signage has been conducted in areas such as marketing with little attention coming from the HCI field. Our research is focused on addressing this shortcoming by applying theories from HCI, marketing, and information systems to investigate the role of video and dynamic digital menu board display characteristics on consumer decision-making. We hypothesize that each consumer decision-making stage will be affected by the "vividness" of video in dynamic digital menu boards.},

The amount of visual distraction is varied from none, medium to high by presenting irrelevant graphics beside the reading content in one of 3 conditions: no graphic, static or animated graphics. We find that under highly-distracting conditions, a struggling reader puts more effort into the text -- she takes a longer time to comprehend the text, performs more fixations on the text and frequently revisits previously read content. Furthermore, she reports an unpleasant reading experience. Interestingly, we find that whether the user is distracted and struggles or not can be predicted from gaze patterns alone with up to 80% accuracy and up to 15% better than with non-gaze based features. This suggests that gaze patterns can be used to detect key events such as user strugglefrustration while reading.},

In the other modality, the user captures the scene while pictures are processed, and the system alerts when enough data has been collected. The image that best aligns with our attention-getting composition model is then selected for documentation purposes. The specific design of these interactions is evolving to promote small motion behaviors by the user. Future work includes user studies.},

Participatory Design (PD) is a design method that could be used to better meet these needs, by giving this population an opportunity to directly contribute to software designed for their use. Researchers have begun to involve children with ASD in the design process, but there is not yet a design method specifically adapted to support the potential difficulties this group may experience during PD sessions. This paper presents a new design method, IDEAS, which attempts to fulfill this need. The development of this method is described along with an initial pilot undertaken to determine the feasibility of using this method with an ASD population. The results indicate that the majority of children with ASD were able to produce a successful final design using this method, and have the potential to be involved in PD sessions as part of a design team.},

Affixing sensors on the head of the user have been used previously by researchers to reintroduce head motion in virtual soundscape and study it. Modern smart phones with motion detecting sensors are becoming highly pervasive in today's society. Such smart phones open up possibilities for early prototyping and testing of ideas, that previously required high fi gadgetry. Wearing the phone on head can track the head movement using gyroscope and accelerometer.

abstract = {Many scientists and engineers have researched how to apply automation technology to intelligent products. Emotional experiences in products have been considered as important factors for users' satisfaction as well. With users' emotions in mind, it is necessary to consider whether automated products indeed provide humans with emotionally satisfying experiences. In this paper, we investigated how different levels of automations affect users' experiences from an emotional point of view. Through experiments, effects of cognitive automation and motor automation were explored. The paper concludes with recommendations for applying automation technologies to intelligent products.},

Specifically, we expand from a single game presented in [1] to an assortment of games that appeal to different tastes. These include a shooting game, a racket game, and two puzzle games. All games are designed in a way that attracts instead of detracting attention to the monitoring screens. In addition to the game set, we also include a web browser capability symbiotic to the monitoring task. All these applications are tested in a quite realistic pilot experiment, where subjects are monitoring live security feeds. This is in contrast to the experiment on a pre-recorded video feed reported in [1]. The results demonstrate that subject engagement and enjoyment is significantly higher when the monitoring task is multiplexed with imaginative interactive options. This improvement in job satisfaction is achieved without sacrificing performance, as measured by detection of suspicious activities.},

We describe a finite-state machine that models a variety of flicking interaction styles, with or without pressure control. We report the results of a preliminary user study that suggests that for medium to long distance scrolling the Flick-and-Brake techniques require less gestural activity than does standard flicking. One of the two variants of the technique is faster, but no less accurate, than state-of-the-art flicking. Users also reported they preferred Flick-and-Brake over the standard flick and judged it more efficient. We indicate some pending issues raised by the results of this preliminary investigation.},

The economic and social implications of living longer are vast, and include offering new prospects to make latent potential in old age accessible both to senior citizens and to society. Growing evidence suggests that the brain retains its capability to change from experience into old age, a finding that encourages targeting the elderly for interventions such as physical activity which is known to impact cognitive and neural decline. In this work we suggest intervening on the basis of these findings by means of intelligent assistive technology. Therefore, we propose a system architecture for a mobile context-aware cognitive assistant (CACA) to assess and enhance cognitive functioning of older individuals. In our view, tailored context-aware assistance can activate latent physical and cognitive potential through a combination of challenge and support, aimed at enhancing individual motivation to pursue a sustainable lifestyle.},

abstract = {Mental illness is one of the most undertreated health problems worldwide. Previous work has shown that there are remarkably strong cues to mental illness in short samples of the voice. These cues are evident in severe forms of illness, but it would be most valuable to make earlier diagnoses from a richer feature set. Furthermore there is an abstraction gap between these voice cues and the diagnostic cues used by practitioners. We believe that by closing this gap, we can build more effective early diagnostic systems for mental illness. In order to develop improved monitoring, we need to translate the high-level cues used by practitioners into features that can be analyzed using signal processing and machine learning techniques. In this paper we describe the elicitation process that we used to tap the practitioners' knowledge. We borrow from both AI (expert systems) and HCI (contextual inquiry) fields in order to perform this knowledge transfer. The paper highlights an unusual and promising role for HCI - the analysis of interaction data for health diagnosis.},

We evaluated three initial phrases that were used to search for sentences in a large social network using the cultural translation; we found that 81% of the retrieved sentences were judged to be related to the initial phrases. Thus, we have evidence that cultural normalization can support finding people talking about the same topic in a SNS even when they have different ways of saying the same thing.

abstract = {This paper explores potential uses of publicly created behavioral data for spatial (re)design. The widespread use of mobile devices and access to the Internet has made spontaneous sharing of information about one's life increasingly common. These emerging trends of pervasive life logging and sensing in communal space provoke new opportunities for designers and architects. This paper reports on work in progress, introducing a set of tools to support spatial design via the collection and analysis of human behavior using Twitter, and presents the result of a workshop using the tools in a university library in Japan. We offer ways to analyze and visualize the data and discuss what we can observe from the collected data that may be useful for designing such communal spaces.},

abstract = {This paper presents SketchSpace, a system that allows designers to interactively sketch [3] device's interactive behaviors by imbuing digital functionality to passive materials. SketchSpace requires no augmentation of the device itself, but instead it uses a depth-sensing Kinect camera to simulate the use of hardware sensors by using depth information to infer an object's three-dimensional position, motion, proximity, shape, deformations, and touch events on its surface. A designer can map these inputs to desktop applications in real-time and thus experiment with different interactions. We showcase how SketchSpace can be used to prototype two devices: from tilt sensitive mice to bendable displays. In general, we discuss how this simplifies the process of generating an interactive device sketch and supports rapid exploration of design solutions.},

The excessive search intervals identified by each algorithm were compared to those produced by manual classification. The results indicate that automated classification can be successfully employed to substantially reduce the amount of recorded data reviewed during usability testing, with relatively little loss in accuracy.},

However their uptake as a research tool within the HCI community is limited largely due to difficulties in buying or building such displays. The choice of commercially available systems is limited and constrains the flexibility of their use in terms of interaction capabilities, display features and integration with multi-display environments (MDEs). In this paper we describe the steps involved in creating custom volumetric display from easily available components. By building a touch-enabled volumetric display we walk-through the steps involved in the process. This will enable us to explore various interactive systems, associated techniques and challenges related to integration of the device into a MDE.},

abstract = {Blind people face a significant challenge navigating through the world, especially in novel environments. Maps, the most common of navigational aids, are of little use to the blind, who could benefit greatly from the information they contain. Recent work in auditory maps has shown the potential for delivering spatial information through sound. Users control their position and orientation on a digitally enhanced map and listen for the location of important landmarks. Orientation control is important because sound localization cues can sometimes be ambiguous, especially when in front of and behind a listener. Previous devices have used a tangible interface, in which users manipulate a small motion tracked object, to allow users to control their position and orientation on a map. Motivated by research that has identified the importance of body-based cues, from the joints, muscles and vestibular system in spatial perception, we expanded on previous interfaces by constructing an auditory map prototype that allows users to control their orientation through natural head movements. A pilot study was conducted to compare the head-movement-based interface to a tangible interface.},

Therefore, we focused on making a new way of commemoration, 'Mourning Tree'. Mourning Tree is a digital tree which is displayed by holographic technology, and the tree can receive messages from the cherisher in the many ways (SNS, SMS, e-mail). The message is displayed as a leaf of the tree, and the more messages this tree receives, the larger and more meaningful the tree becomes. Because of the exhibition of Mourning Tree in actual cherishing area, it can not only physically interact but virtually interact with the cherisher. We developed a prototype of the Mourning Tree and conducted an examination.},

With an annual estimate of 43,000 deaths from diarrheal diseases, 3 million cases of illness, and treatment costs of over half a billion US dollars, the impact is critical [4]. This research addresses the challenge of reporting complex and critical water quality information in a way that is accessible to all South Africans as required by law. In a country with high illiteracy rates, 11 official languages and limited-to-no access to technology in many areas, this is no easy feat. We describe the details of WATER Alert!, a prototype mobile phone application designed to alert and report critical water quality information to consumers who subscribe to it. Our initial evaluation of this design with users suggests that such an application would help to improve consumers' understanding of water quality information. The symbol-based messages make critical water quality information more accessible to illiterate or low-literate users, or non-native English or Afrikaans speakers. Additionally, the use of a tool and interface design most of our users are familiar with (the mobile phone) lowers the learning curve.},

abstract = {Crucial to the advancement of the User Experience field is the ability to understand product qualities as perceived by users. Therefore we would like to introduce VERO (Visual Experiential Requirements Organizer), an online tool for the structured elicitation of users' perceptions of a given stimulus such as a product, a system or a concept. Contrary to the existing elicitation methods, VERO aims to enable users to freely express opinions about qualities relevant for a given stimulus; to indicate the importance of each quality without imposing a hierarchical order and to cluster related qualities according to users' own perception regarding the strength of the link between them. In this paper we also motivate our approach in developing VERO and sketch our research agenda regarding its validation and application in the field of User Experience.},

Secondly: to compare among different tangible interfaces performing the same tasks. Thirdly: via integration into a structured design process. This paper focuses on this last topic and discusses how detailed data regarding object use the data could be integrated into classifications and frameworks such as the Shaer's et al's TAC paradigm.},

Moreover, it has been pointed out that when a wheelchair user is accompanied by a companion, the latter is inevitably seen by others as a caregiver rather than a friend. To address this situation, we devised a robotic wheelchair able to move alongside a caregiver or companion, and facilitate easy communication between them and the wheelchair user. To confirm the effectiveness of the wheelchair in real-world situations, we conducted experiments at an elderly care center in Japan.},

This paper discusses the development of mobile haptic TV systems. It describes the design constraints for these systems and presents one concept implementation, UltraTV. UltraTV is a mobile device that provides mid-air, multi-point, back-of-device ultrasonic haptic feedback to enhance the mobile TV experience (see Figure 1).

Therefore, understanding the structural strategies behind storytelling and learning how to incorporate them into a design process is relevant for designers when they want to envision, discuss and influence user experiences. In this paper we introduce STORIFY, a multi-modal tool to provide design teams with an experiential approach towards designing interactive products by incorporating dramaturgical techniques from film and sequential art.},

abstract = {Concordance analysis supports users in studying how terms are used in a document vs. another by investigating their usage contexts. As current approaches usually present a large set of contexts in their full text form or as a large frequency-based word cloud, they still require a lot of effort from users to make sense of the underlying complex and dynamic semantic dimensions of contexts. To address this limitation, we propose Context Stamp as a visual representation of the gist of a term's usage contexts. To abstract away the textual details and yet retain the core facets of a term's contexts for visualization, we blend a statistical topic modeling method with a combination of the treemaps and Seesoft visual metaphors. This paper provides a high level description of the text analysis method and outlines the visual design of Context Stamps.},

It supports creative and reflective drawing experiences using two layers: a transparent layer and a screen layer. The interface takes a user's drawing movements on the transparent display unobtrusively and then projects the movements on the screen display while presenting the user-selected multimedia components. Dual-Space Drawing lets users interact with motion graphics on a mirror-like display. In the process of designing the self-projected scenes and creating digital contents, children can express themselves and embody their ideas. While designing a digital object, a user's response to the object creates a new relationship to the object in connection with the user's self-reflectionprojection. In this way, Dual-Space Drawing integrates the user's drawing activity with expressive interaction.},

By treating the camera information as a continuous 3D digitizer, we are able to capture the details of the real world and re-project virtual objects side-by-side to real objects. The user is able to visualize such mixed reality model through stereoscopic projected imagery tightly aligned with the real world. In our system, it is literally possible to build the entire virtual castle, using only a single physical brick piece.

When the tongue is electrically stimulated, it senses a characteristic taste. We developed various apparatuses to change the taste of food and drinks based on this effect [1]. An apparatus for drinks, comprising two electrically conducting straws, is used to change the taste of the drink by the formation of an electrical circuit inside the mouth only when drinking by holding both straws in the mouth. In the case of two persons each having one straw in their mouths, shaking hands causes electricity to flow, resulting in the change in taste. With a chopsticksfork type of apparatus, the taste changes by the electric current that flows through the human body when one person helps the other to eat. In the case of both types of apparatuses, it is possible to control the voltage by a PWM(pulse width modulation) and the pattern by a relay, and a variety of tastes can be produced by a personal computer.},

We then designed an enhancement of the conventional Windows 7 screen magnification tool by providing line-level text highlighting. We conducted an experiment in which 21 participants, with normal vision, read text from a webpage using one of three conditions: no enhancement, highlighting, and highlighting + cursor routing. We recorded the eye-movement patterns, performance, cognitive workload, and user experience.

abstract = {This paper explores the formative user interface design of a socially-interactive dressing room. The socially-interactive dressing room allows shoppers to talk to their friends in real time for opinions on their garment purchasing decisions. Our work is motivated by the observation that shoppers who lack fashion sense often rely on their friends' opinions when making garment purchasing decisions. Using the iterative user interface design methodology, we conducted a mini focus group and interviews among male and female shoppers to refine the user interface design. Our findings suggest that an iterative approach proves to be useful in uncovering and addressing usability, aesthetics, and trust issues that arise from incorporating a socially-interactive system within a dressing room context.},

abstract = {Behavior change represents an important new approach to addressing the energy crisis. Utility companies and private companies are deploying sensor-based power meters and related residential electricity monitoring technologies with the view that monitoring energy use will eventually result in a reduction in energy consumption. The success of these technologies depends largely on homeowners responding to the data with appropriate changes in their consumption behavior. Most energy feedback interfaces, however, have not been designed through a human-centered process and display data in ways that are unlikely to change behavior. Our proposal is to design interactive interfaces that combine a deeply human-centered process with insights from behavioral economics to reduce residential energy consumption. This paper describes our current research to develop and evaluate interactive interfaces based on three motivational categories: cognitive, social, and affective.},

However, coupling this new approach to the already demanding design process that characterizes mobile devices, further extends challenges to designers and developers.

This paper explores how to augment traditional, collocated Brainstorming and make electronic brainstorming feasible and accessible with web-based technology. We introduce an electronic brainstorming application prototype and justify its design principles. Our system aimed at facilitating conceptual design and we present design insights from a pilot study with the prototype used by 27 design students. The paper argues that by structuring the generative group process with a low-cost tool, users can sprint through a creative process, from problem definition to defining a solution.},

This is of particular consequence for senior citizens who are at greater risk of social isolation after retirement, due to loss of spouse, mobility issues, and recent emphasis on aging in place, i.e., in smart homes. Can online social networking sites (SNSs) such as Facebook help alleviate social isolation of aging alone by enabling seniors to maintain high-quality social interactions? How can we make senior-friendly design improvements to SNSs? A preliminary national survey (N =168) of adults over 55 revealed that for those who had joined an SNS, the primary motivation cited for signing up was persuasion by a friend or family member, while non-users cited a strong lack of interest rather than a lack of knowledge or skill, with implications for theory and design of SNS technology for senior citizens.},

We present a viewport-based examination interface (ViewSer), which enables remotely tracking searcher examination behavior, without requiring eye tracking equipment. We show that ViewSer induces similar viewing and clickthrough behavior, compared to in-lab users monitored with eye tracking, in a study with over 100 remote participants. ViewSer is a first step towards large-scale behavioral evaluation of web search, which would help improve web search result presentation, result ranking, and ultimately improve the web search experience overall.},

Pressure input is well suited to mobile interaction as mobile devices almost universally adopt touch and gestural input. This paper presents the initial results of research looking into the effects of walking on the application of pressure during linear targeting. Positional and rate-based (velocity) control methods are compared in order to determine which allows for more stable and accurate selections. Results suggest that rate-based control is superior for both mobile (walking) and static (sitting) linear targeting and that mobility significantly increases errors, selection time and subjective workload. These results will influence the design of a second part of the study, which will evaluate user ability to control the same application using only audio feedback.},

This work evaluates whether punishment of non-desirable behaviour discourages users from engaging with a persuasive application. To this end we recruited 9 households to use the Power Ballads application over a period of 4 weeks.

abstract = {Previous research had shown that pictorial passwords, where users recognize their target images among distractors, have potential for improving the usability of authentication systems. A method using personal photos provided by the users as their targets, shown among highly similar distractors, showed the most promise for both accuracy and security. But the longest time period that had been tested between successive login attempts was only about one month. We wanted to see what happens when six years have elapsed. We recruited some of the same participants from the previous study and tested their ability to select their target photos six years later. We found that 12 of 13 participants successfully authenticated themselves. The overall accuracy rate was 95.6%, demonstrating that most users can remember these pictorial passwords even over long periods of time.},

abstract = {In the U.S., approximately 15,000 community senior centers provide a broad spectrum of programs for seniors to increase their overall health and wellness in their community. Although previous studies reported on the various benefits of participation in such programs, little research has been conducted to understand how technology can support this practice. We initiated a research study to understand the current practices of senior centers and their potential technology needs. In this article, we describe findings from our literature review as well as a field study with nine senior centers located in urban and suburban areas of Chicago, IL, and Tampa, FL. Based on the preliminary results, we share design implications for future technology development.},

abstract = {Parenting a Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) premature infant in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and transitioning this infant home can be very stressful for parents. Few studies, however, examined the needs of parents of VLBW infants during the transition to home; moreover, even less is known about information and communication technology strategies to support parents during the transition period. To address this knowledge gap, we are conducting a study that aims to develop a mobile applicationservice to support the parents of VLBW infants by enhancing communication with the NICU staff and access to information resources. We report findings from our preliminary study using contextual inquiry and phone interviews and discuss implications for system development.},
