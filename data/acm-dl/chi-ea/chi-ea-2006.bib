abstract = {There is significant frustration among business leaders and CIOs concerning the success of their systems in the field. There is an equal frustration among HCI professionals at the marginalized role that usability often plays in systems development efforts. These frustrations are, to a large extent, two sides of the same coin. This panel will consider how CIOs manage the apparently competing challenges of faster/better/cheaper systems and the time and money required for developing highly usable systems. They will discuss the strategies and techniques that they use to integrate usability into systems design and development.},

While the practice of international research has become common, approaches have been varied depending on the needs of the project as well as corporate constraints. Many corporate researchers spend a great deal of their time traveling the globe to meet and study consumers, while others look to partner with other researchers or outsource the work entirely. Each of these approaches has its own advantages and disadvantages. This panel will explore these diverse approaches, how and why choices are made, the issues and challenges faced, and lessons learned based on past experiences.},

These cases can benefit from taking an engineering approach and from using HCI as a part of that activity. Speakers will present cases that involve variations on this theme. Their presentations will provide a basis for a lively discussion of HCI's potential to make an impact on social problems in the future and the methods effective in realizing this potential.},

abstract = {In the past few decades there has been considerable work on empowering end users to be able to write their own programs, and as a result, users are indeed doing so. In fact, we estimate that over 12 million people in American workplaces would say that they "do programming" at work, and almost 50 million people use spreadsheets or databases (and therefore may potentially program), compared to only 3 million professional programmers. The "programming" systems used by these end users include spreadsheet systems, web authoring tools, business process authoring tools such as Visual Basic, graphical languages for demonstrating the desired behavior of educational simulations, and even professional languages such as Java. The motivation for end-user programming is to have the computer be useful for each person's specific individual needs. While the empirical study of programming has been an HCI topic since the beginning the field, it is only recently that there has been a focus on the End-User Programmer as a separate class from novices who are assumed to be studying to be professional programmers. Another recent focus is on making end-user programming more reliable, using "End-User Software Engineering."

abstract = {This paper discusses the use of instant messaging (IM) as a communication tool during usability studies - primarily between the interview and observation rooms. The benefits and challenges associated with providing an IM link are discussed, based on feedback from a survey of study moderators and observers. Observers were much more positive about the use of IM than the moderators. A key concern to moderators was the potential distraction to themselves, participants and observers. In contrast, observers greatly welcomed the opportunity to ask questions and help deal with buggy prototypes. Guidelines are outlined for the effective use of IM within a usability context, and contexts outlined when an IM link is most appropriate.},

abstract = {This study intended to demonstrate experimentally that user trust or affection for a brand affects the results of usability tests. For the experimental method, experimentees were exposed to products made by companies they preferred and did not preferred, and these products were then tested with a group of tasks for each product. For the test assessments, NASA-TLX was utilized to measure the mental and physical demands on the experimentees, along with the measure of error rate and time of product operation.The results were that, even though the experimentees performed the same tasks, they had decreased mental and physical demands operating products that they preferred. That is, it was shown that an individual's psychological state greatly influences the usability of a product and that, for a usability test, the user's image of the product's brand is also an important variable.},

A key issue in this design effort was to create a graphical topology viewer that would scale to the complexity of typical storage environments and support administrators effectively in various activities. Our approach to address these issues was to use semantic zooming and progressive information disclosure techniques extensively; thus essentially shifting the scalability challenge from purely visual design to mostly interaction design.},

Methods and techniques to study users, best practices for creating iterative designs, and tools to validate them are all very well documented. Unfortunately, in chaotic and complex ecosystems very few of the designs actually end up making it through the user-centered design (UCD) process. Interaction designers' input is either ignored or interpreted through a development/business lens and considerable fidelity is lost. As a result, designers too often throw up their hands and blame the technology or the organizations. These barriers can be overcome if designers broaden their roles and better understand other stakeholders' charters. Successful collaboration with other disciplines that make up the software development lifecycle is the key to success. Practical case studies will be discussed where usability, attractiveness, and good design were achieved through non-design means. Poor information architecture, screen layout, and task flows were not the barriers to usability. Design impact was made instead through overcoming barriers in technology, organizational structure, legal, marketing, documentation / quality assurance (QA), and development tools.},

abstract = {We explore the practical difficulties of adding service learning to a regularly taught undergraduate HCI course. We explore ways to minimize instructor workload, particularly with regard to recruiting partner organizations. None of these approaches we describe was entirely satisfactory, however overall, student recruitment of organizations seemed to proceed most smoothly and have more positive outcomes for students, and required the least instructor workload. We also address issues pertinent to managing partner expectations in the absence of fully working interfaces.},

We feel that knowledge of these constant drivers is beneficial in designing key features of mobile media devices. On the other hand, findings specific to a particular environment, variable design drivers, help to identify potential enablers and obstacles of product adoption.},

It is quite similar that conductor conducts an orchestra for the same music differently. We extract viewer's intension based on the emotional status or impression of the painting by using gaze tracker and the painting will be more dynamic and fun.

The system uses an audio time-stretching algorithm we developed that allows the playback speed of a digital audio recording to be arbitrarily adjusted without changing its pitch. iSymphony is an example of how computers can enable more people to experience an interaction style normally limited to a few people (conductors), and is installed as part of the It's Artastic! exhibit at the Betty Brinn Children's Museum in Milwaukee, USA.},

The tactile graphics are explored by moving the device within the workspace of a 2D planar carrier. Three tactile rendering methods were developed and used to create distinct tactile memory cards. The haptic memory game showcases the capabilities of this novel tactile display technology.},

We describe the design and implementation of TinyMotion and analyze the potential interactions that can leverage TinyMotion. Three applications and two games were created to test TinyMotion. Benchmarking results and usability study show that TinyMotion can detect camera movement reliably under most background and illumination conditions.},

Users constructed a complex, dynamically-changing understanding of the meaning of each interaction, based on an understanding of their and their partner's context of use. The results show that users had rich and complex interpretations of this seemingly simple communication, which suggests the necessity of exploring context of use to understand the situated nature of the interactions as an intrinsic part of an evaluation process for such technologies.},

The ComSlipper is a lightweight yet expressive sensible slipper that enhances the quality of computer-mediated relationships. The ComSlipper was developed using a human-centered design approach to better understand user behaviors and needs. The ComSlipper empowers the wearer to create a sense of connection to others. The wearer uses body gesture and tactile manipulation to feel and express emotions and availability to distant loved ones. The ComSlipper provides a natural and intimate way of communicating, and facilitates the development of intimate relationships.},

Based on listener data, a probabilistic state transition model was developed to infer the listener's current affective state. A second model was made that would select music segments and re-arrange ('re-mix') them to induce a target affective state. We propose that this approach provides a new perspective for characterizing musical preference.},

abstract = {When making the case for user-centered design (UCD), the HCI field tends to rely on an objective approach, such as cost justification, to speak for itself. However, this approach may not be enough to garner support for decisions ranging from implementing a certain design to adhering to a UCD process. Promising sources for enhancements to an objective approach are rhetoric and argumentation. One purpose of this SIG is to explore how rhetoric and argumentation can help advance the case for UCD on organizational and project levels in various contexts and organizations. As a catalyst for discussion among SIG attendees, this abstract describes examples of using rhetoric and argumentation in three contexts: boutique consultancy, in-house consultancy for large corporation, and research-oriented federal agencies. Another purpose of this SIG is to establish a community of people interested in using rhetoric and argumentation to augment their communication approach when making the case for UCD.},

abstract = {Recent years have seen an increase in the design of outdoor interactive environments. In this SIG we want to discuss the key points in the design of an outdoor interactive environment, including interaction techniques, appropriate technologies, usage patterns, robustness, and safety. The SIG organizer and presenters are researchers from four universities around the world, who are actively designing and building interactive environments. The three presenters represent state-of-the-art work in distinct areas of the field. The SIG will focus on design process, challenges, implementation, and real-world evaluation, to be followed by an open discussion about the state-of-the-art and critical design factors in the field. Since CHI is the premier conference on human-computer interaction, it is the most suitable venue to discuss these issues, the results achieved so far, compare with other groups around the world, and discuss potential collaboration. We hope that this SIG can serve as a starting point to form a community of researchers and practitioners interested in interactive environments for outdoor gaming and play.},

Existing pathway selection interfaces are frustratingly difficult to use, since they require the 3D placement of regions-of-interest within the brain data using only a mouse and keyboard. The proposed system addresses these usability problems by providing an interface that is potentially more intuitive and powerful: converting 2D mouse gestures into 3D path selections. The contributions of this work are twofold: 1) we introduce a participatory design process in which users invent and test their own gestural selection interfaces using a Wizard of Oz prototype, and 2) this process has helped to yield the design of an interface for 3D pathway selection, a problem that is known to be difficult. Aspects of both the design process and the interface may generalize to other interface design problems.},

Beyond target size, however, movement time also varies according to a subject controlled mental trade-off between speed and accuracy for a given task. To adjust for this trade-off, researchers often use the "effective target width", the target width normalized for variations in movement speed, as a predictor of movement time. In this paper, we describe on-going work on analyzing factors affecting the speed-accuracy tradeoff for Fitts' tasks in subjects, exploring both incentives and penalties to manipulate subject accuracy. We also describe our work on measurable parameters of motion that correlate with the speed-accuracy trade-off.},

Results revealed that participants reported more positive stereotypes of engineers after interacting with a female agent. In contrast, participants interacting with a male agent reported that engineering was more useful and engaging. An interaction of "coolness" and age indicated that agents who were young and "cool" (i.e., peer-like; similar to participants) and agents who were old and "uncool" (stereotypical engineers) were both most effective on enhancing self-efficacy toward engineering.},

To explore the impact of music on pace and motivation in exercise, we present our work so far on DJogger. DJogger builds a model of a runner's pace and uses this information along with a workout plan to dynamically adjust the musical soundtrack.

We also found that problems are often caused by broken expectations, a mismatch between what a person expects to be able to do and specific device capabilities. In this paper we explore broken expectations in the digital home with examples from our study. These observations suggest further research into the ways user expectations and activities shape the digital home experience.},

This paper reports a study investigating the use of Tactons (tactile icons), presented using a standard mobile phone vibration motor, to represent mobile phone alerts. The recognition rate of 72% achieved for Tactons encoding two pieces of information is comparable to results achieved in a previous experiment with a high specification transducer, indicating that it is possible to communicate multi-dimensional information in mobile phone alerts. These results will help designers to understand the possibilities offered by standard phone vibration motors for communicating complex information.},

This paper argues that a new perspective on the concept "community" can shed light on the subject. Ideas from cognitive science, particularly category theory, can help. I suggest that community can be viewed as a prototype-based category. Prototype-based categories are defined not by simple rules of inclusion and exclusion, but instead by their prototypical members--a robin is a better example of a bird than an emu or a penguin. Items in a category are better or worse examples of the category depending on their degree of similarity to the prototypical members. I will argue that these theoretical insights can help resolve debates about the nature of community, and also can help guide designers of computer-mediated communication (CMC) systems.},

abstract = {We are investigating a new gestural text entry method for mobile phones that uses an isometric joystick and therefore consumes very little physical space. We have created a high-fidelity mobile phone prototype with two embedded isometric joysticks, one on the front for use with the thumb, and another on the back for use with the index finger. The joysticks can be used to enter text using a special version of the EdgeWrite text entry method. In our proposed studies, we would like to investigate the performance of using the joysticks as text input devices in stationary and mobile situations. With our prototype, the authors were able to write at ~12 wpm with the front joystick, and ~7 wpm with the back joystick. These numbers are sure to improve as further refinements are made.},

abstract = {Digital libraries have great potential to improve the educational experience. As a result, there are a wide variety of such repositories, especially those that focus specifically on education. But relatively few focus on topics as specific as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) or Human-Centered Computing (HCC). In addition, support for browsing behavior, with a few exceptions, is both weak and not suitable for user needs. This paper presents our work to create a repository of educational materials for a relatively narrowly-targeted field (HCC/HCI), including our requirements gathering methods and results. Finally, we discuss the HCC Education Digital Library (HCC EDL) as a platform for investigating broader digital library research questions, such as exploring alternative designs for content browsing mechanisms.},

This indicates that readers struggle to focus on important information when skimming. Moreover, a response bias suggests skimmers are more likely to over-interpret complicated information as consistent with the text.

The context-aware mobile music player described here works with its owner's library to select music in real-time based on a taxonomy of attributes and contextual information derived from an accelerometer connected wirelessly to a laptop carried under the arm. We are in the process of evaluating this prototype with 25 users who will compare the system's context-sensitive playlist to random shuffle. On the basis of user feedback and analysis, a hand-held device will be implemented for testing in less constrained mobile scenarios. PersonalSoundtrack allows users to experience their music with both mind and body, providing a unique embodied experience of their personal music library. In mobile environments where attention is a limited resource, users can spend less time deciding what music to enjoy and more time enjoying it.},

Availability bars, embedded in calendar applications, can help users who manually schedule meetings. Availability bars can also mediate communication with calendar scheduling agents that gather availability constraints, search for times that satisfy the constraints, and negotiate with invitees when no satisfactory time is found for the constraints.},

abstract = {The effect of the decline in cognitive, perceptive, and motor abilities on older adults' performance with input devices has been well documented in several experiments. None of these experiments, however, have provided information on the challenges faced by older adults when using pens to interact with handheld computers. To address this need, we conducted a study to learn about the performance of older adults in simple pen-based tasks with handheld computers. The study compared the performance of twenty 18-22 year olds, twenty 50-64 year olds, and twenty 65-84 year olds. We found that for the most part, older adults were able to complete tasks accurately. An exception occurred with the low accuracy rates achieved by 65-84 year old participants when tapping on targets of the same size as the standard radio buttons, checkboxes, and icons on the PocketPC. An alternative selection technique we refer to as "touch" enabled 65-84 year olds to select targets more accurately. This technique did not negatively affect the performance of the other participants. If tapping to select, making standard-sized targets 50 percent larger provided 65-84 year olds with similar advantages to switching to "touch" interactions. The results suggest that "touch" interactions need to be further explored to understand whether they will work in more realistic situations.},

Through an ethnography of programmers who practice planning using both physical and digital artifacts, we discovered common actions performed by the programmers included card creation, card augmentation, card combining, and scheduling of card for completion. We designed interaction techniques to facilitate these actions and conducted a usability study (n=10) to evaluate the techniques. Through the study, we discovered that the initial prototype provided both positive and negative experiences for the user, providing insightful design implications for the future.},

abstract = {Video game players often learn to map their physical actions (e.g., pressing buttons) onto their on-screen avatars' actions (e.g., wielding swords) in order to play. We explored the experience resulted from eliminating this mapping by modeling the screen as a "window" through which virtual objects enter the player's physical space, and the player interacts with them directly without the mediation of an avatar. We define this interaction as "Blended Reality" (BR). We designed, developed, and evaluated a BR game prototype called "Apple Yard" in which the player was to use a wand to hit apples flying out of the screen. A camera was used to track the positions of the player's eyes and wand, and the 3D game scene was rendered accordingly to create the illusion of looking through a window. A user tests experiment conducted on this prototypes indicated BR's potential in camera-based entertainment.},

We investigated a localized, "detail on-demand" filtering strategy called semantic lensing that in certain situations provides a more efficient and desirable approach than global filtering for mitigating clutter and occlusion.An initial formal user study with these semantic lenses has shown their significant value, expediency, and desirability in aiding decision making during real-world tasks. Completion times of geospatial analyses are significantly faster when using lenses and workloads are significantly lower. The research suggests that using lenses may also improve analysts' accuracy when completing complex time-critical geospatial intelligence analyses. Continued work will evaluate additional features and task-specific applicability. Successful evaluation will propose the distribution of such a lens tool to geospatial intelligence analysts.},

Observed needs were used to generate concept scenarios that were validated with representative users during a concept validation session.

This data is fed to a text file that can be easily understood by humans and programs alike. A four day workshop demonstrated that some Flash-savvy architecture students could construct interactive spaces (e.g. TaiKer-KTV and ScreamMarket) based on body and head motions.},

PmEB allows users to track their caloric balance by recording food intake and physical activity on their mobile phones. Daily reminder messages are sent via SMS messages to encourage compliance. Collected data is sent automatically every 24 hours to a central server where it can be analyzed in detail. PmEB was designed as a tool for both users to self-monitor and manage their food consumption and physical activity and primary health care providers to study behavioral patterns in overweight patients. Formative evaluation with seven health-intervention experts and a week-long user study with six clinically overweight, non-expert participants have shown PmEB to have promising potential for improving self-efficacy in dietary and exercise behavior.},

A number of observations made by the participants were identified that have implications for design and for further work.

In re-readings, it also provides a resource for reflection, allowing us to re-experience, brood over or even shed the thoughts and feelings we've associated with events or people. To expand on the ways in which we creatively engage in diary-keeping, we have designed an affective diary that captures some of the physical, bodily aspects of experiences and emotions--what we refer to as "affective body memorabilia". The affective diary assembles sensor data, captured from the user and uploaded via their mobile phone, to form an ambiguous, abstract colourful body shape. With a range of other materials from the mobile phone, such as text and MMS messages, photographs, etc., these shapes are made available to the user. Combining these materials, the diary is designed to invite reflection and to allow the user to piece together their own stories.},

Groups are based on the shared characteristics that can be found for subsets of spectators. Communication between spectators is brought about at two levels: direct communication like instant messaging and indirect communication like cooperating in a team to win a quiz. Our system does not necessarily require a new television format, but is able to reuse existing television shows and to "socialize" them so they can be re-broadcasted with support for group interaction.},

abstract = {The study of users' emotional behavior in HCI has been receiving increasing attention for the last few years. This paper focuses on emotions as an important part of a user's overall experience when interacting with a system. Based on the multi-component approach to emotions proposed by Scherer [15], different aspects of emotions in an interactive context were investigated: subjective feelings, physiological activation, motor expression, cognitive appraisals, and behavioral tendencies. To induce different emotional states, two versions of an interactive system were employed which differed with respect to quality of use. The results suggest that systems of high usability lead to more positive emotions than systems with usability flaws. Differences were detected for a number of emotional components by using a variety of methods: rating scales for subjective feelings, EMG for facial muscles, heart rate, EDA, performance data and questionnaires on cognitive appraisals. We suggest that this combination provides a comprehensive basis for analyzing emotions in HCI.},

abstract = {In this paper, a rhythm instruction tool for school children using vibration devices is discussed. The proposed system called T-RHYTHM is for supporting individual children in playing musical instruments or singing, in solo or ensemble situations. T-RHYTHM provides each child with rhythm patterns of musical pieces through tactile senses, and supports her so that she can recognize her own rhythm without being confused by other children's performances or singing voices. The rhythm of the music given to individual children is determined based on a performance by an accompanist and transmitted to their own vibration devices via a wireless communication. We have evaluated T-RHYTHM in a music class in a Japanese elementary school and gained initial feedback from children and their teacher.},

abstract = {In modern society, people increasingly lack social interaction, although beneficial to work and personal life. Airhockey Over a Distance addresses this issue by recreating the social experience facilitated by physical game play in a distributed environment. We networked two airhockey tables and augmented them with a videoconference. Concealed mechanics on each table allow for a physical puck to be shot back and forth between the two locations. Supporting the hitting of a fast-moving, tangible puck between the two players creates a compelling social game experience which was confirmed by about 30 players. Our preliminary findings suggest that our casual physical game supports social interactions and contributes to an increased connectedness between people who are geographically apart.},

We are applying the concept of CI to AmI as we have found it works well in biological and social systems. Examples from nature demonstrate the power of CI stimulated by implicit cues in the environment. We use these examples to derive design principles for AmI environments. By applying these design principles to a concrete scenario, we are able to propose ways to help decrease environmental pollution within urban areas.},

Next, based on the estimates, the amount of influence is defined based on the amount of attention paid to speakers in monologues and to persons with whom the participants interact with during the dialogues. Experiments confirm that the proposed measures reveal some aspects of interpersonal influence in conversations.},

Part 2 measured participants' willingness to provide information using behavioral and dispositional measures of self-disclosure. Structural equation modeling identified two different types of privacy processes contributing to disclosure: a state process (trust and perceived privacy) and a trait process (privacy attitudes and behaviors), which were found to act independently on self disclosure. The results provide a valuable insight into people's privacy concerns and the disclosure of personal information to web sites.},

abstract = {Along with the change in tour paradigm, tourists are increasingly seeking for new and meaningful experiences. However, most cultural tour sites today still maintain a conventional form of tour that is static and information centered. To reflect the new needs of tourists, the concept of immersive tour experience has been investigated. Immersive tour experience refers to a type of tour where the tourist lively experiences the historical scenes that occurred at the tour site, as if the tourist had traveled to the past. A system named "Immersive Tour Post" was designed to realize this concept. This system is in a post form and uses of audio and video Augmented Reality to provide the immersive experience. Through an experiment conducted at an actual tour site, this application proved to increase the interest level as well as facilitate understanding of the content. Through this research, the potential of immersive tour experience in improving the quality of tour for cultural tour sites was verified. Moreover, a new user experience was developed by implementing HCI technology in a new context. With further development, the proposed system is expected to become a useful application that attracts tourists and create greater value for our cultural assets.},

A systematic review of the literature revealed a set of issues that informed the design of an ethnographic study of five households of differing type. The concerns identified were then further explored through sketch-based conceptual designs, four of which are reported here. They are: (i) putting the Electronic Program Guide (EPG) onto a mobile phone to facilitate personalisation and to allow one person to use it while another is watching a programme; (ii) family voting to make explicit certain power relationships in the family and perhaps democratise them; (iii) using the TV for other purposes when not watching programs (e.g., as a message board or electronic picture frame) to avoid the ugliness of a blank TV screen, and (iv) multi-channel hopping to facilitate idly flicking through the channels. These suggestions are not fully worked designs but provocative concepts to relate the concerns identified to design. In this sense they are "un-useless" and draw on the playful and provocative tradition of chindogu.},

These tests use our 3motion™ system, a wireless inertial motion tracking device and gesture SDK. This enables a range of gesture types from tight, precise movements to whole arm gestures, and from direct mapping of movement to recognition of 3D symbolic gestures. Four game scenarios using different spatial gesture characteristics were used to identify gameplay issues that have an impact on the design of 3D interaction.},

This input device acts as a normal touchpad, but also senses pressure for additional control. Tactile feedback is provided to indicate the state of the user interface to the user. By sensing the finger contact area, pressure can be treated in two ways. This combination enables various user interactions, including multiple hardware button emulation, map scrolling with continuous scale change, and list scrolling with pressure-based speed control.},

The HCB (History-Centric Browsing) system allows a user to browse a previously visited Web page stored in the history database in the same way as browsing a page on the Web. The system associates pages from the database to the currently displayed page through three types of relevancies: temporal sequence, URL/location-based proximity, and content similarity. The HCB-stat, HCB-vis, and HCB-tempo components use the associations to enrich the current page-viewing experience.},

A sheet of paper that has been placed on a slippery table is difficult to draw on. Therefore, in order to write or draw something on the sheet of paper, a person must secure the paper with his/her palm to avoid the paper from moving. This will be a good metaphor to design switching operation of scroll and editing modes.We have made a prototype system by placing a touch sensor under a PDA screen where user's palm will be hit.

abstract = {The effect of gender information on trust building in virtual settings is an important yet unexplored area in HCI. In this paper we empirically investigate gender differences in trust perception in two media, video and Instant Messaging (IM), while performing negotiation and brainstorming tasks. Participants who did not previously know each other were recruited to form homogeneous pairs, male-male and female-female. Each pair carried out a task via computer-mediated communication using either video or IM. Our preliminary results uncover a significant gender difference in trust perception, with female pairs perceiving higher levels of trust than male pairs when gender information about the partner is explicitly provided before using the IM channel. The results also show that both female and male pairs perceive higher levels of trust in the brainstorming task than in the negotiation task.},

Based on an extensive survey of system administrators, we provide insights regarding this preference, analyze why many of these power users perceive CLIs as more effective than GUIs, and discuss findings as supported by observations from our parallel field studies. Our analysis indicates that cognition-based trust and monitoring play major roles in the interface preference for CLIs vs. GUIs.

To make online remote communication smoother, determining if it is appropriate to interrupt the remote partner is critical. As a first step in achieving this goal, several audio-visual features, extracted from data streams provided by a camera and a microphone, are correlated to human interruptibility. Based on these features, the level of interruptibility is estimated using the trained Support Vector Regression (SVR) technique. Finally, we discuss the potential of our method based on the results of several experiments.},

New search results are inconsequential when a person wants to summarize a set of results or return to a previously viewed Web page. This paper presents a study of which aspects of a list are memorable and thus are likely to be noticed when they change, and which are not memorable and thus are unlikely to be missed if changed. The study shows that what people remember about a list item is a function of their interaction with the item and the item's location in the list.},

These observed passions then became the input for brainstorm sessions. Seniors and researchers generated game-ideas and, consequently, co-designed the selected ideas into game concepts.The results of this methodology are inspiring game concepts, directly grafted on the passions and desires of the senior. But more important than the actual game concepts, we conceived a model of passions in elderly life. This model provides game designers with an understanding of the ingredients that are fundamental to 'meaningful play' in elderly life.},

abstract = {Advances in Location-Based Services (LBS) are opening opportunities for using the location of people, places, and things to augment or streamline interaction. While computers work with physical locations like latitude and longitude directly, people usually think and speak in terms of places, which adds personal, environmental and social meaning to a location. To address this conceptual mismatch, location-aware applications must incorporate the notion of place to achieve their full potential. In this paper, we investigate four techniques for collecting end-user place annotations interactively using cell phones. The results from a usability study suggest that while all the four methods receive similar preference ratings in understandability, the "photo memo plus offline editing" method is the most favorite approach in ease of use. In addition, users indicated their desire to adopt more than one place annotation method in location-aware applications.},

abstract = {The Message Center is a home-based communication solution specifically designed for elders. Our research indicates that insufficient communication amongst elders causes several challenges in their daily activities such as loneliness, social isolation, and decreased appetite. The biggest cause of these challenges is that elders are increasingly removed from communication technology including email, text messaging, and mobile phones due to cognitive and physical difficulties. To overcome this problem, we incorporate a familiar pen and paper based interaction that allows instantaneous messaging via digital network. By designing the Message Center, we strive to create an easier venue for more active cross-generational communication between elders and younger family members who are often the caregivers. This paper demonstrates a User Sensitive Inclusive Design process from the generation of user needs to the evaluation of prototypes. A key theme of the Message Center project is to show how usable and emotional design derived from a user inclusive design process can encourage elders to adopt new communication technology.},

Unlike the classic human-versus-machine situation often established in computer-based board games, our test bed takes advantage of the rich interaction opportunities that arise when humans and robots play collaboratively as a team. To facilitate interaction within a shared physical environment, our game is played on a large checkerboard where human and robotic players can be situated and play as game pieces within the game. With meaningful interaction occurring within our confined setup, various aspects of human-robot interaction can be easily explored and evaluated such as interface methods. We also present the results of a user evaluation which shows the sensitivity of our system in assessing robotic behaviours.},

However, the manner in which these faces influence the mental process is as yet unknown. In this research, we conducted an experiment by using fMRI for the most abstract faces?emoticons. The experimental results show that emoticons convey emotions without the cognition of faces.

We believe there is a gap that needs to be filled in image-based face retrieval to further support the interpersonal search scenarios on Internet dating sites. Therefore, we are introducing a profile search prototype -- ImLooking - using an augmented image-based face retrieval filter. First, we present a prototype design and offer technical support.

The primary users were rural villagers of varying degrees of literacy from three districts of Tamil Nadu. Preliminary findings from a Wizard-of-Oz field study show that rural villagers are able to navigate through a dialog system using their voice, regardless of literacy level and previous experience with technology. Traditional user study techniques, however, favor literate users and are ill-suited to research in developing regions.},

abstract = {Consumer surveys show that online users value personalized content [5]. At the same time, providing personalization on websites seems quite profitable for web vendors [2, 6-8]. This win-win situation is however marred by privacy concerns since personalizing people's interaction entails gathering considerable amounts of data about them. As numerous recent surveys have consistently demonstrated, computer users are very concerned about their privacy on the Internet. Moreover, the collection of personal data is also subject to legal regulations in many countries and states. Both user concerns and privacy regulations impact frequently-used personalization methods. This workshop will explore the potential of research on "privacy-enhanced personalization," which aims at reconciling the goals and methods of user modeling and personalization with privacy constraints imposed by individual preferences, conventions and laws.},

In particular, we are interested in the phenomenon of human beings abusing computers. Such behavior can take many forms, ranging from the verbal abuse of conversational agents to physical attacks on the hardware. In some cases, particularly in the case of embodied conversational agents, there are questions about how the machine should respond to verbal assaults. This workshop is also interested in understanding the psychological underpinnings of negative behavior involving computers. In this regard, we are interested in exploring how HCI factors influence human-to-human abuse in computer-mediated communication. The overarching objective of this workshop is to sketch a research agenda on the topic of the misuse and abuse of interactive technologies that will lead to design solutions capable of protecting users and restraining disinhibited behaviors.},

This has been accompanied by the appropriation of a variety of disciplinary practices, concepts, and methodologies by HCI. In terms of the development and coherence of the discipline, it is timely to take a critical look at the assumptions, values, and traditions of each of these positions, their implications for HCI research agendas, and to try to understand the historical, cultural, and political emergence of HCI as a discipline itself.

Each of these disciplines has established ways to nurture a creative impulse through to a concrete result. This is done in part by fostering a continuing internal dialog between creative instinct and external representations. Sketching is an activity common to these practices that is exercised during such creative refinement. By sketching, we mean not only hand-drawing on paper using a pencil, but also rapid, undetailed, brief, light, informal representations that practitioners produce and interact with. By investigating the sketching process in each practice, we expect to find commonalities that will to point out essential elements for designing tools to support the creative process.},

There are two expected outcomes from this workshop. One is to define best practice, suggest answers to continuing areas of doubt and highlight unanswered questions about eyetracking in both the scientific and commercial environment. The other is to explore how best to measure the satisfaction element of the ISO 9241 definition of usability through eye movement analysis especially in the genre of display cited above.Please note interactive eyetracking such as eye typing is not within the focus of this workshop.},

abstract = {Videogames are not your typical software application. They are often designed to elicit a negative emotional response, such as frustration or fear, the antithesis of usability. However, this is not to suggest that HCI has little to offer the game design community. Indeed, the exact opposite appears to be true. A number of user-centred design techniques have evolved which can support each stage of the game design process, from concept through to post-production. However, there is currently no archive of appropriate techniques showing how they might be applied to videogame design. Given the differences in goals from these products to traditional software, this is clearly necessary. The purpose of this workshop is to identify those techniques appropriate to game design, and elicit practitioners' experience when applying such methodologies. The intended result is a prescriptive process which demonstrates how user-centred methodologies can best be applied to game design.},

Considering the large variety of visual layouts users can encounter, many visual search strategies can come into play during visual search.

In addition, the set of places a person frequents may reveal information such as: 1) when they are likely to go to a place, or 2) within close proximity, where they live. If a user considers this information private, they may still inadvertently disclose it: humans have difficulty comprehending aggregate effects of their actions [1].

abstract = {We present Fitster, a social visualization interface that supports fitness motivation among busy people struggling to exercise. Among our pilot group of busy graduate students, we found that a popular time-saving strategy is to recast exercise in terms of everyday, informal activities. Fitster employs pedometer data to support activity tracking, goal setting, and motivation through virtual competitions and teamwork. It contributes to the human-computer interaction (HCI) and health domains by identifying a new facet of exercise behavior and by offering a lightweight social interface to promote fitness motivation and enjoyment.},

Monitoring nutritional intake can provide the stimulus to change unhealthy patterns. To this end we introduce Health View, a web-based nutrition monitoring system that subtly integrates with the current habits of today's young adults. Health View leverages already-existing grocery store savings card accounts to pull the necessary data into the system automatically. By managing grocery lists and providing a repository for recipes, Health View enables the conditions for monitoring the nutrition of users while they go about their usual tasks. When the current nutrition status is known, Health View can then make simple suggestions for improving the consumption habits of the users.},

Additionally, children respond more to activities emphasizing recreation over education. This paper details the design and development process for children, highlighting design choices with research from industry, parents and children. The end product is a responsive and persuasive audio player that controls and varies music tempo based on measured activity level. This device makes use of music's natural ability to fuel activity, and it gives children a way to directly control some portion of their environment. Additionally, it delivers increased exercise under the disguise of fun and recreation. This paper contributes to the HCI design process for children by showing how to develop persuasive technologies to implicitly succeed a specific goal without explicitly addressing an existing problem.},

In Mexico around 50% of adult population is obese; this in turn situates people on risk of contracting other diseases such as diabetes, and hypertension. To address this problem, one of the main institutes of health in Mexico has implemented a program for preventing diseases related to bad feeding and physical activity habits. In our aim to provide a technological solution to help people with such problems, we conducted a field study around this program to envision and inform our design. We propose a Virtual Specialist (VS) that stays with the patient and advice him at all times on issues related to keeping diet and exercise programs. We argue that patients that use this solution would feel more motivated to keep working on their programs, since they get a feeling of being personally attended.},
