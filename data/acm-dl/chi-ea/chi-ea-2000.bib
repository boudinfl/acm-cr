abstract = {Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are mainly designed for a single computer and a set of single input devices. However, when we simultaneously use many and different types of computers and electronic devices, such interfaces would often fail to work. As we can combine several tools to perform a task in the real world, we consider that it should be possible to dynamically combine multiple digital devices. It should also be possible to use "direct manipulation" interfaces that work across the boundary of these devices. We call this concept "multiple-computer user interfaces". This video demonstrates several interaction techniques based on this concept, including Pick-and-Drop, a digital whiteboard system with palmtop computers, and a digital table that can recognize objects placed on it.},

It provides support for implicit structures, such as opening and closing spaces when lists are edited. It provides techniques for organizing materials on the board by grouping them into regions. Tivoli integrates domain objects, structured data that can be exchanged with external databases, into the freeform whiteboard environment. Tivoli's scripting language allows the structure, appearance, behavior, and dynamic computations of domain objects to be defined. Domain objects can be customized to create meeting tools that are finely tuned to particular meeting practices. Tivoli smoothly integrates both freeform and structured interaction techniques.},

This agent assists in the formation of teams of humans (via other MokSAF agents) and task agents that can autonomously perform team subtasks. It provides a suitable interaction mechanism to instruct the various task agents in the team; and, by monitoring the human's progress, reallocate or modify the sub-tasks if the human fails to achieve that subtask. A military domain has been used to investigate this interface agent. The task consists of three military (human) commanders that each assemble a platoon, and plan routes so that all three platoons arrive at a given rendezvous by a specified time. An experimental study has been conducted to evaluate MokSAF and the assistance provided by one of three different task agents, and the results summarized.},

Four military personnel designed and entered their own simulation scenarios via both interfaces. Analyses revealed that the multimodal interface led to a 3 to 4-fold speed improvement in the average entity creation time, including all error handling. Time to repair errors also was significantly faster when interacting multimodally. These results indicate a substantial efficiency advantage for multimodal over GUI-based interaction during map-based tasks.},

By including multimedia, video and VR in information systems, people can build upon the fundamentals for presenting content in an easy to comprehend and compelling way in the same way they use television and film technology.There is a need for new methods of development and for tools that support application building by non-programmers in a "storytelling" way, considering human-centered interaction techniques rather than known paradigms of the virtual desktop.In an example of a virtual trade show booth application, a user conversation with the information system has been conceived, and new concepts of user interface design by "Digital Storytelling" are evaluated.},

abstract = {The metaphor of a 'desktop' as a user interface was useful for the migration from mainframe applications to personal computers. But it must be re-evaluated when thinking about new concepts and implementations of user interfaces for modern working and home environments, especially mobile applications. The departure from tools that enable the user to directly manipulate content towards intelligent agent-based applications suggests a shift of paradigms. We propose a new generation of user interfaces extending the widely accepted WIMP metaphor by anthropomorphous user interface agents, conversational user interface elements, the inclusion of mobile information appliances, and appropriate multimodal interaction techniques. Initial prototype systems following this line have been successfully developed. In strategic projects with alliances of research and industry, these technologies will be further advanced into first products in the areas of mobile multimedia offices and electronic multimedia service and operation assistants.},

abstract = {Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have become the standard way in which we interact with our computers and over the years and have greatly improved our computers' usability. However, as computational power becomes increasingly ubiquitous and becomes part of the environment around us, we find ourselves reaching the useful limits of the GUI. These limits are even more pronounced in new environments like the home where many of the tasks we need to perform would be difficult, inefficient, and awkward using a GUI. In an effort to develop a natural, intuitive interface for the home, we are developing a project called HomeLab, which is an agent-based, adaptive, sensing and responding home environment. This project represents a new breed of interface called an "environmental interface." We feel environmental interfaces are more natural because they more closely resemble the physical, social "interface" humans interact with in their daily lives. Fundamentally, environmental interfaces abandon the idea of a single concentrated interface such as we might associate with a computer screen, and instead treat the whole environment (a home in our example) as the interface, seamless and immediate. Not only do appliances, screens, chairs, etc. all act as input and output devices but the house itself is a distributed system of agents responding to us. Our former notions of interfaces were narrow and centralized in space because our computers were. In the age of ubiquitous computing the interface should be distributed and ubiquitous.},

Better interfaces to recognition systems, which can help to reduce the burden of recognition errors, are difficult to build because of lack of knowledge about the ambiguity inherent in recognition. We have extended a user interface toolkit in order to model and to provide structured support for ambiguity at the input event level [7]. This makes it possible to build re-usable interface components for resolving ambiguity and dealing with recognition errors. These interfaces can help to reduce the negative effects of recognition errors. By providing these components at a toolkit level, we make it easier for application writers to provide good support for error handling. And we can explore new types of interfaces for resolving a more varied range of ambiguity.},

As a result, context-aware applications have been built in an ad hoc manner, making it difficult to build new applications or evolve existing ones. In this research, we are examining the requirements of context-aware applications, building a toolkit, which enables the use of context and fulfills these requirements, and testing the usability of this toolkit for application designers.},

In this study, I examine three distributed groups of technical support engineers at a large high technology company who have integrated a real-time text chat tool into their work practice. Effective use of the chat tools in these three groups interacts with group norms and group structure. Highly collaborative group norms mean that people receive responses to questions in the chat tool. This decreases the need to know 'who knows what,' because members do not need to target their questions to receive a response. Members also adapt their use of the tool to reflect the group structure, specifically the roles within the group and the range of problems the group solves. Active participation by experts across sites increases the likelihood an individual will receive a useful answer to a question. Groups solving a bounded range of problems tend to use the tool for technical problem solving more than for workflow coordination.},

The MP can exclude background part and capture only the object's shape, motion and depth information in real time. The ROI is a concept in order to distinguish objects in a captured image. For detecting the ROI, the proposed method used depth information of the captured image and offered a fast and robust searching method. It enables the MP to sense a variety of object's shapes, motions, positions and so on. Therefore, our vision-based interface using the MP with the ROI can easily recognize object's motions as effective computer eyes. The user can interact with the pet robot (constructed by LEGO MINDSTORMS™) using this vision-based interface.},

In general, they are cheaper and faster than the traditional ones due to the fact that neither users nor evaluators need to move to take part in the tests. However, they fail to provide more accurate data for usability analysis. This paper presents a faster and low cost method for WWW evaluation that provides better data for analysis. The novelty of this method is due to the merging of tracking of users' actions and subjective information provided through questionnaires in the same evaluation tool.},

We found that with sufficient rendering quality small text can be substantially rotated before reading performance suffers, and large text legibility is nearly unaffected by rotation.

Recent developments in software engineering link architectural styles to quality attribute analysis techniques to predict the effects of architectural design decisions on the eventual manifestation of quality. An Attribute-Based Architecture Style (ABAS) is a structured description of a particular software quality attribute, a particular architectural style, and the relevant qualitative and quantitative analysis techniques. Thus, it is a description that is meaningful to software engineers as they design or analyze proposed software architectures. We are producing a collection of ABASs that speak to the usability quality attribute. These ABASs will enable software engineers make early architectural design decisions that achieve specific usability functions.},

In this method, at each step of the operational procedure in the situation of the usability testing, the ratio of time required for a novice user to that of an expert user is used to generate an NE ratio. The time required by the expert user is thought to represent the minimum time to operate the system. Hence, regardless of the absolute amount of time required by the user, the magnitude of the ratio can be regarded as a measure to represent the difficulty in using that system for the novice user. By applying this method to the evaluation of the car navigation system, it was confirmed that this method is quite useful in identifying the procedural step that has a usability problem.},

The move from one-way TV viewing to interaction within a networked environment will require new ways of user system interaction.The paper will address the changes in merging the world of TV with multimedia content delivery:• The TV experience 'today'. 'Passive viewing' of broadcasters content. Consumers' expectations of the interface; reliable, simple to use, providing a social function.• Likely scenario's for further development; lean backward social interaction through the TV versus lean forward individual interaction with the PC,• The impact of digital technologies and IP becoming pervasive for transport, projections of how TV oriented services will grow, and the likely players in the change from traditional broadcasting to networked access for multimedia content delivery,• From 'just TV' to distributed home entertainment systems, to real two-way consumer communication and attractive e-commerce services,• Television viewing and accessibility of services becoming more personalized and pervasive through a variety of devices (TV, portable communication and entertainment devices like Personal Information Assistants).The paper will discuss the likely impact of these developments on the consumer experience and the issues and challenges facing the consumer-oriented industries in the move to convergence:• Providing a secure, private and pleasant ambience through networked devices and applications in the home,• Extending the ambience of the home to the experience on the move,• Maintaining simplicity for the consumer in a networked environment through interoperability, context awareness and familiar interfaces,• Coping with the daily flood of content, finding what you want anytime, anywhere through personalization and pre-emptive storage and archiving.Consumers need to be involved in the process. More in-depth global consumer studies on regional attitudes and perceptions need to be done. Co-development and evaluation of solutions need to be performed in feasibility and usability labs like the Philips Home Lab under construction.The paper will show examples of how consumer electronics companies are dealing with these challenges and provide some insights into the type of solutions we may expect to see in homes of the near future.},

The two concerns join in the topic of how to create storytelling spaces to support children's own storytelling voice. Until now, nevertheless, there has been no comprehensive discussion at CHI of what it means to design for children to produce narrative in the context of technology.

Users have demonstrated great difficulty with the common textual method for specifying these queries, which uses the boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT, partly because these words are used inconsistently in natural languages. This paper proposes a tabular boolean query language that avoids the need to use named operators, provides a concrete distinction between conjunction and disjunction, and makes grouping more explicit. A study comparing this tabular language with textual boolean expressions found that untrained users perform better when they express their queries in the tabular language, and about equally well when interpreting queries written in either language. We conclude that systems can benefit by adopting a tabular notation for query formulation.},

The combination of this light and easily physically manipulated instrument with a new, immersive approach to musical software allows players to expressively explore music with an immediacy not experienced in traditional instruments, which emphasize years of training to learn the precise control of pitches, timing, levels and various expression instructions. Instead, the musical ball lets players manipulate and explore a complete musical composition that has been mapped to different embroidered sensors. This allows players to immediately squeeze and mold the ball to perform the pre-composed music in an expressive manner.},

Presented with a series of social-dilemma situations, participants made a decision after listening to the computer's argument for one of the two choices in a 2 (TTS gender: male vs. female) by 2 (participant gender: male vs. female) experiment. Consistent with gender stereotypes, the male-voiced computer exerted greater influence on the user's decision than the female-voiced computer and was perceived to be more socially attractive and trustworthy. More strikingly, gendered synthesized speech triggered social identification processes, such that female subjects conformed more to the female-voiced computer, while males conformed more to the male-voiced computer (controlling for the main effect). Similar identification effects were found on social attractiveness and trustworthiness of the computer.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web (WWW) has recently become the main source of digital information accessible everywhere and by everyone. Nevertheless, the inherent visual nature of Internet browsers makes the Web inaccessible to the visually impaired. To solve this problem, non-visual browsers have been developed. One of the new problems, however, with those non-visual browsers is that they often transform the visual content of HTML documents into textual information only, that can be restituted by a text-to-speech converter or a Braille device. The loss of spatial layout, and textual attributes such as boldface, italic, underline, color or even size should be avoided since they often bear visually important information. Moreover, typical non-visual Internet browsers do not allow visually impaired and sighted individuals to easily work together using the same environment. These new problems have to be solved with new alternative non-visual display techniques. This paper presents WebSound, a new generic Web sonification tool and its application to a 3D audio augmented Internet browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) developed at the University of Geneva.},

For example, Web search interfaces, and online catalogs support individual searchers working on their own. In workplace and library settings, however, teamwork is becoming more and more prevalent. We use the term Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR) to describe any activity that collectively resolves an information problem. Information retrieval is construed in the broadest sense and includes processes such as: problem identification, analysis of information needs, query formulation, retrieval interactions, and the presentation and analysis of results. In this SIG, we will explore how to better understand and support information access in collaborative team settings. An understanding of the social and organizational contexts in which CIR occurs will lead to the design of more useful systems.Several researchers have addressed aspects of CIR. In previous CHI meetings, Kidd (CHI'94) described how different people make different sense of the same information, Maltz and Ehrlich (CHI'95) outlined the key role that information gate keepers play, and several groups studied collaborative filtering. Some products support workgroup scheduling, document workflow, etc. But, none has brought together the variety of perspectives we believe are critical in fully understanding the CIR design space.},

The growth of and consequent immediate international access to the Web demand a response by UI designers to the issues of when and how user interfaces can be designed for global access yet account for local differences. Attendees will discuss with mentors challenges of designing UIs for international and/or multi-cultural use, in which metaphors, mental models, navigation, interaction, and/or appearance must be significantly adjusted to account for global and/or local needs. Issues to be discussed include the following:• What are the dimensions of culture? What research exists?• What are the differences among cultures, e.g., North American, European, Asian? How do they affect UIs?• How does we account for different references of icons, metaphors, organization, and navigation strategies?• Can we design locale-neutral user interfaces? What can/must be standardized or localized?• How can/should cultural diversity issues impact professional education?• Why do/don't businesses design for global markets?• How can we handle legal issues across cultures in the borderless Internet?},

However, more applications, software, products and services that have typically been targeted at the general population now have requirements that they be equally usable by the "normal" healthy population of users and by users with various disabilities (e.g., physical, sensory, cognitive). For example, in the United States, the FCC has mandated that all telecommunication devices and services used by the general population be accessible by people with disabilities whenever it is readily achievable (i.e., without much difficulty or expense). To the extent it is not readily achievable for these devices to be accessible, then they must be made compatible with commonly used assistive devices [2][3]. There are other mandates and standards that are heading in the same direction [1]. For professionals working on products, services, and applications that are or will soon be impacted by these types of mandates, the typical methods used for design, data collection, and test will be fundamentally altered.},

abstract = {In October of 1997, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) initiated an effort to increase the visibility of software usability. Participants from major software suppliers and customer organizations attended the first three workshops of the Industry USability Reporting (IUSR) project. They set the goals of the initiative:• Encourage software supplier and customer organizations to communicate more effectively about user needs and tasks,• Develop a common reporting format for sharing usability data with customer organizations, and• Conduct a Pilot Study to determine how well the usability reporting format works and to determine the value of using this format in software procurement.These consensus-building meetings identified the requirements for the common format and resulted in the Common Industry Format (CIF) for Usability Test Reports. The CIF is intended to promote incorporation of usability as part of the procurement decision-making process for interactive products.Usability professionals within supplier organizations can use the CIF to generate reports, and customer organizations can use the reports as a basis for corporate decision-making. The report itself is intended for two types of readers: (1) human factors or other usability professionals in customer organizations who are evaluating both the technical merit of usability tests and the usability of products, and (2) other technical professionals and managers who are using the test results to make business decisions. The first draft of the CIF, developed through this consensus of the IUSR industry participants, is now ready. Trial use of the CIF report format is being encouraged via the IUSR Pilot Study. The CIF, as well as details of the IUSR project and the Pilot Study, can be found at http:/www.nist.gov/iusr},

abstract = {Many major U.S. corporations, such as Siemens, Honeywell, Kodak and Motorola, are seeking growth through expanding their international markets. Market research indicates that key discriminators will be ease of use, minimal required training, and user productivity enhancement. But can these usability goals be achieved without careful attention to adapting user interfaces to the cultures of end users? There seems to be an imperative here to develop products that account for cultural characteristics, expectations, mental models, and preferences of target user groups. This said, a number of lingering questions and issues remain and often represent impediments to progress in this area. This SIG focuses on the following issues:1. The homogenous global culture is taking over-- This argument suggests that we are all gradually moving toward one homogenous world culture in which characteristics of national culture will have little importance. McDonald's is viewed as the prototype of this trend. If this is the future, then why bother about cultural adaptation of products? The SIG discussion centers on evidence that "inner layer" cultural traits such as values and attitudes are rather deeply held and will persist over time even though more superficial and overt characteristics of culture may change.2. Everyone thinks the same way-- There is a common notion that cultural differences in product usability are largely aesthetic, matters of appearance. But people basically think and go about their work the same way. Make the product "pretty", use the local language, and the product will be fine. Language and aesthetics are extremely important to product design. But so are culturally dependent ways of thinking, communicating, and decisionmaking. These characteristics are discussed, together with their implications for HCI design.3. Developers cannot possibly understand the nuances of foreign cultures-- This argument holds that localization efforts are doomed because product developers can't possibly understand all the subtleties of foreign cultures. Practitioners from corporations who have addressed this issue discuss their experience with: regional development centers, local university partnerships, in-country focus groups and product testing conducted by HCI professionals from the target cultures.4. Culturally adapted products cost too much-- A common argument is that localization increases the cost of product development disproportionately to the market advantage obtained. But what happens to sales when a poorly conceived product is introduced into a target culture? How can cultural sensitivity be incorporated into standard development processes?},

We suspect that there is work going on in this area, and but we may not know how to search for it.We plan to conduct the SIG in three parts. The first part will be a plenary presentation of the topic, with a relatively formal, panel-like group discussion. In the second part of the session, we will change the "voice" in which we speak to a relatively quieter, contemplative mode, splitting into groups of fewer than ten people each. The groups may begin their discussions with ideas from the plenary part of the session, or they may immediately take up questions and experiences from their own membership. We will ask the small groups if they want to reconvene into a final plenary session to report back on their new understandings. Alternatively, we may ask people from each of the small groups to record their understandings or conclusions for us. If the outcomes appear to be of interest to the larger CHI community, we will write a report for SIGCHI Bulletin.},

This new step provided a means to prioritize the design suggestions, as well as a way to defend the potential commercial usefulness of the software.

abstract = {The potential of pattern languages as a vehicle for the dissemination of human-computer interaction design knowledge has been recognized within the CHI community (e.g. [4]), stemming from the ideas of the architect Christopher Alexander, for recording the designs of 'living buildings' [1-2]. Patterns record the invariant property that must exist in a design detail which resolves the conflicting social, cognitive, and technological forces which are ubiquitiously present in constructions of that type. Patterns are interlinked into a network (a pattern language) so that details that are required to complete a design may be identified, and the larger issues surrounding a particular design decision may be recognized.These ideas have been taken up by the object-oriented computing community [5], developments there being recorded in the series of Pattern Language of Programing (PLoP) conferences. In that community it is the usefulness of patterns as a way of recording reusable design that has dominated. However, as Alexander pointed out in an invited address to OOPSLA '96, there are other, deeper aspects to patterns. As he envisaged pattern language, it records an aesthetic of design which makes for liveness, that 'quality without a name' which supports human well-being. Alexander has challenged the computing community to explore this aspect, and clearly, there is most scope for this exploration within the CHI community. Thus this workshop will: promote the development of pattern languages for interaction design; refine and develop the application of pattern languages in this area; develop understanding of the relationship between interaction design and software engineering patterns; extend the community of pattern writers.},

There is no theory of continuous interaction that can guide designers in a systematic way in the development of interfaces employing continuous technologies.},

abstract = {E-commerce over the World-Wide Web has become a major application area for software development. The volume of goods and services transactions is rapidly growing. Economic theory and observations of the emerging markets suggest that e-commerce sellers will be driven towards offering personalized buying interactions and customized products to escape price wars, to create a distinguishable identity, and to establish longer lasting relationships with their customers.E-commerce applications providing personalized interaction is an interesting application area for a wide range of HCI research, including human searching and browsing in complex hypermedia spaces, information visualization, virtual reality, agent support for product selection, merchant selection, and negotiation, user modeling, and group-oriented work such as recommender systems. A large number of CHI professionals work actively on the design of commerce-oriented websites -- both for business-to-business as well as for business-to-consumer scenarios. Designers of e-commerce systems are in search for recommendations on what works or does not and are looking for new ideas, as the interest in previous activities on this topic (see below) has demonstrated. An indication for this are also the significant number of discussions on the CHI-WEB discussion group that center around HCI design issues for e-commerce applications. There is also an additional attractiveness to the domain as good design and good use of HCI principles can directly result in measurable outcomes showing that HCI can contribute to the bottom line; for example, if redesigns or new interactive features result in increases in sales, increases in eyeball share, reduction in aborted transactions, reduced return rates for ordered products and reduction in service calls.},

He claims that the HCI field, especially in real-world practice, could benefit a great deal more from theory. As the discipline whose aim is to investigate processes of communication and signification amongst agents in general, Semiotics is bound to contribute to the field of human-computer interaction with complementary perspectives, new methods and concepts, which can shed light on some of the major HCI challenges in design and evaluation. Viewing HCI as a complex human communication process, involving designers and users, and the mediation of communicative artifacts, Computer Semiotics and Semiotic Engineering, for instance, are some of the approaches in Applied Semiotics that directly address the issues bearing on human-computer interaction. The workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners of HCI and Semiotics and to give them the opportunity to discuss how the two fields can provide new knowledge and a new interdisciplinary research agenda in HCI.},

abstract = {HCI is a booming discipline. At CHI 99, the "jobs board" was overflowing with notices of available positions, while the "resume board" was nearly empty. Exhibitors who came to the conference to headhunt complained that nobody was looking for a job, because everybody already had one. The demand for HCI professionals is causing increased demand for undergraduate, graduate, certificate, and professional education programs. More programs mean more instructors, and more instructors mean more people trying to figure out how to teach in the ill-defined, multi-disciplinary field of HCI. There are textbooks and curriculum reports to help them decide what to teach. The results of this workshop will help them decide how to teach it.For curriculum ideas, instructors can consult the reports of the ACM SIGCHI Curriculum Development Group [1] and the NSF/DARPA workshop on New Directions in HCI [5]. For textbook suggestions, they can consult annotated reading lists by Gary Perlman [2], Andrew Sears [3], and others. For suggestions of instructional materials, they can see, for example, the website that accompanies the 3rd edition of Ben Shneiderman's textbook [4]. But there is nowhere they can turn where experienced HCI instructors say, "Here's my technique, here's some evidence that it's successful when I use it, and here's enough information about the materials and the methods that you can reproduce it in your own instructional setting."Like the "Famous CHI Educators Tell All" panel at CHI 98 [6], this workshop focuses on practical techniques for teaching HCI. The participants are accomplished HCI instructors from industry and academia, who offer techniques from their own instructional "toolkits" to be evaluated for practicality, reproducibility by other instructors, and success. Some of the techniques will end up in an anthology that will serve as a resource for HCI instructors.},

These include usability of hypertext [e.g., 2], spoken-dialogue systems as interfaces [e.g., 8, 6, 7, 4], and multi-modal interaction [e.g., 1, 5]. While there were few NL-related papers before 1993, the number of CHI papers relating to NL issues has been increasing since then, particularly in the last two years. Yet the CHI-NL community remains fragmented, with several micro-communities each contributing individual perspectives that do not often get tied together.This workshop grows out of interest expressed at the CHI 99 special interest group on Natural Language in Computer-Human Interaction in creating a community for researchers and practitioners in the area of natural language processing in CHI. This objective will be met by exchanging views on cross-cutting issues related to the workshop topic, and by jointly creating a plan for further development of the NL-CHI community.Associated objectives include:• Building communication between people who primarily self-identify as belonging to the CHI or NL communities• Identifying opportunities for NL practitioners to improve their practice and for NL researchers to develop new techniques• Stimulating research towards improved NL interaction techniques},
