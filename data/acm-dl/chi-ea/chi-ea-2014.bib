abstract = {We now have available huge amounts of data about our personal pasts in the form of photos, social media posts, communications, GPS locations, sensor data and so on. But what can we do with all this data? Is it useful to us or is it a problem? The Lifelogging vision argues that such data promotes 'total recall' addressing problems with everyday forgetting. I first show that Lifelogging doesn't live up to these claims, both overgenerating data and failing to focus on what is important. I then explore other problematic memory situations where people actively want to forget aspects of their past in the context of a relationship breakup, or when they have experienced other negative past events. Drawing on literature from psychological and social theories of memory, I describe how rich personal digital data about a breakup can prevent moving on, and present new designs that help people better deal with data relating to their breakup. Finally I explore new designs for technology mediated reflection; these designs promote demonstrable improvements in psychological well-being by helping us to actively process our pasts to understand our emotional patterns and habits.},

abstract = {Mark Rettig said interaction design is designing the right thing and designing the thing right. With the recent emphasis on design thinking-finding the right thing to design-design doing-designing the thing right-has rather dropped from view. As a graphic designer in the early 80s, I realised, starting to program, that simple artist-designer graphic skills and knowledge could make interfaces work better-easier to understand, quicker to use. But with affordable colour graphic screens, designers could really make interfaces sing. They could become a pleasure to use and express character-the difference, for instance, between the Star interface-serious, as befits an office-and the Apple Mac-jaunty, irreverent, appropriate for the Californian college audience it targeted. It is accepted that designers are concerned with form-the optional cost of making something a bit more elegant-but Apple's unbending commitment to good design is persuading people that design is not an optional extra. However they often do not understand that design is not just about appearance. Apple knows that design is also about the aesthetic of function: a system's behaviour, its interactivity, which, as well as satisfyingly usable, must be elegant, poetic, maybe witty. Design also concerns the implicit meanings that subtly speak to us, that make the difference between a product that works and one that sings. This presentation will discuss how design works, how it flourishes, and how to grow young designers. As the digital increasingly shapes our world it is not just the profitability of a company that rides on good design. It is the quality of our lives as we experience them.},

The song simply enumerates a series of reasons for being cheerful: Summer, Buddy Holly... 18-wheeler Scammels, Domenecker camels... The list includes sex, generosity and politeness, yellow socks, breakfast cereal, John Coltrane... and more.In 1979 when the song was released HCI was still in its infancy, starting its 'first wave'. Much focus was on efficiency and on communication as command. Satisfaction was noted, but not central. Frustration was acknowledged but not deeply theorized.Now, in 2014, in the third or perhaps even fourth wave of HCI, we talk about engagement, connection, emotion, enjoyment, delight and joy... Efficiency is still on the table but not dominant.In this talk, I reflect on cheer, on joy and the human capacity for optimism. I will update the Blockheads' list, to include some reasons I believe we should be cheerful about the emerging landscape of mediated interaction and social connection. My list will offer examples from my own collaborative work in the design and development of engaging Internet experiences.},

For the CHI 2014 conference I'm still the AV Chair (we call it "technology liaison" now). Along the way, I've co-chaired a CHI conference, served on the SIGCHI Conference Management Committee for many years, and I'm now the Vice President for Conferences for SIGCHI. What is it about CHI that would induce a bioinformatician and hard-core hacker to become passionate about HCI and devote a significant amount of time and energy to support the field of HCI through service to the CHI conference? In this brief talk, we'll look at the CHI conference through the eyes of a volunteer who has spent time in the lowest levels of conference operations, chaired the conference, and now is responsible for overseeing all of the SIGCHI conferences. I'll try to address some or all of the following questions:Where did we come from? What is CHI trying to achieve and have we been successful? If we have been successful, what are the key ingredients to that success? Where are going and how are we going to get there without losing what we currently have? And finally, why should you care? Oh, and along the way, it will probably become clear why I care?},

She has anticipated, satirized, and even changed the popular pre-conceptions of our time, and is the rare writer whose work is adored by the public, acclaimed by the critics, and read on university campuses. On stage, Atwood is both serious minded and wickedly funny. A winner of many international literary awards, including the prestigious Booker Prize, Margaret Atwood is the author of more than thirty volumes of poetry, children's literature, fiction, and non-fiction. She is perhaps best known for her novels, which include The Edible Woman, The Handmaid's Tale, The Robber Bride, Alias Grace, The Blind Assassin, Oryx and Crake, and The Year of the Flood. Her non-fiction book Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth, part of the Massey Lecture series, was recently made into a documentary. Her new book, Madaddam (the third novel in the Oryx and Crake trilogy), has received rave reviews: "An extraordinary achievement" (The Independent); "A fitting and joyous conclusion" (The New York Times). Atwood's work has been published in more than forty languages, including Farsi, Japanese, Turkish, Finnish, Korean, Icelandic and Estonian. In 2004, she co-invented the LongPen, a remote signing device that allows someone to write in ink anywhere in the world via tablet PC and the internet. She is also a popular personality on Twitter, with over 300,000 followers. Atwood was born in 1939 in Ottawa and grew up in northern Ontario, Quebec, and Toronto. She received her undergraduate degree from Victoria College at the University of Toronto and her master's degree from Radcliffe College.},

Often, "gender" is not a factor that is explicitly considered in the design of these technologies. When gender is considered, products are often designed with idealised models of gendered "users" -- designed for men, designed for women, designed for boys, designed for girls, or designed for the "average user" who could be male or female. However, the ways in which gender-bias or gender-neutrality are constructed in the design process and the resulting effect on the interactive artifacts that are produced is not well understood.

To achieve this, a dialogue will be facilitated among researchers in the cognitive science of gesture and gestural interaction within the HCI community. During the workshop we will discuss the different methodologies and results within the study of gestural interaction, with a focus on how the use of bodily movement in an interface affects the cognition of users, groups, communities and societies. We invite participants from cognitive science, HCI, user experience design, educational technology and interactive installation art to present their work on gestural interfaces and discuss how that work has been observed to impact user perceptual or cognitive faculties. The workshop's material outcomes include a book on gestural interaction and cognition, while the research outcomes include methodologies, heuristics, design principles and hypotheses for the further design and investigation of gestural and tangible technologies.},

abstract = {Speech and natural language remain our most natural forms of interaction; yet the HCI community have been very timid about focusing their attention on designing and developing spoken language interaction techniques. While significant efforts are spent and progress made in speech recognition, synthesis, and natural language processing, there is now sufficient evidence that many real-life applications using speech technologies do not require 100% accuracy to be useful. This is particularly true if such systems are designed with complementary modalities that better support their users or enhance the systems' usability. Engaging the CHI community now is timely -- many recent commercial applications, especially in the mobile space, are already tapping the increased interest in and need for natural user interfaces (NUIs) by enabling speech interaction in their products. This multidisciplinary, one-day workshop will bring together interaction designers, usability researchers, and general HCI practitioners to analyze the opportunities and directions to take in designing more natural interactions based on spoken language, and to look at how we can leverage recent advances in speech processing in order to gain widespread acceptance of speech and natural language interaction.},

However, for lifelong use, minimizing efforts for the user is crucial. Nowadays, few devices find a good balance between cost and value. In this interdisciplinary workshop we discuss how this trade-off can be approached by addressing three topics: understanding the user's information needs, exploring options for data acquisition, and discussing potential designs for life-long use.},

Internal rhythms, like body temperature and sleep-wake cycle, are driven by numerous biological processes and can be maintained even in the absence of external environmental cues. These rhythms affect how we feel, think, and act. They are profoundly important for our health, quality of sleep, and mood. Yet the digital devices we use are ignorant of our biology. They respond uniformly to our touch and click. Recently there has been a considerable increase of research within the HCI community to support behavior change, personal insight, and increase productivity. This workshop will bring together researchers in sleep, wellbeing, and circadian rhythms to discuss the possibility of rhythm systems: technologies that play to the strengths of our biology.

abstract = {The role of empathy has come to prominence in HCI as the community increasingly engages with issues in medical, health and emotionally charged contexts. In such settings empathizing with others is crucial in understanding the experience of living with specific conditions, or in being sensitive to the concerns and emotions of potentially vulnerable participants. Researchers in these areas become implicated in designing new tools and technologies that support empathic relations. This workshop therefore aims to build an interdisciplinary community of researchers, designers and practitioners to share and discuss their work and the challenges they encountered when establishing empathic relationships within health or care contexts. We will work towards developing a richer conceptual and practical understanding of empathic engagement and design methods in this context to support and shape an agenda for future research.},

We illustrate the potential of portable devices for expressive musical control as wind and percussive instruments, first individually, then in a collective performance. Most uses of computers in music follow the traditional view that built-in input devices are vectors for graphical interaction, and while several attempts have reminded us that portable devices could be hijacked for direct musical performance, none have led to the degree of expressivity that is demonstrated here. This is the result of a design approach emphasizing musician-instrument interaction as an embodied activity. Besides confirming the adequacy of standard personal computing equipment for musical performance, this video shows a successful example of repurposing existing technologies.},

We believe that having an empathetic robot companion during the procedure can help children cope with pain and improve their overall experience. The robot makes use of a set of behaviors derived from pain management literature and modeled on human behaviors and cognitive behavioral therapy. In order to investigate the role of the robot as social companion, we are currently performing a Wizard of Oz study at a children's hospital. Our results are preliminary, but so far we have observed - as illustrated in the video - that the robot can improve the experience for children as long as they are not highly agitated.},

To make this system easy for beginners, all wires have the appropriate resistors, and this is the default setting of the system. However, you can change this system in such a way that the elements in the system can be damaged by excessive voltage and current.  A tracing paper is placed on the touch panel display. A projector projects light onto the paper and a camera is used to detect motion. The tracing paper is used to balance the transmitted light from the touch panel and the projected light from the projector. By using the touch panel, you can drag wires to connect or disconnect them. The camera detects shielding of the switch, and AR markers are used for alignment of the optical system. The positions of the parts are not recognized by image recognition; rather, they are registered at the start of system.  Since no current is flowing, you can use damaged elements or unopened parts. We believe this system is superior to breadboards because accidents such as breakage of elements and poor connection can be avoided. We are sure you will have a better touch feeling in this system than in breadboards or circuit simulators. Other related studies include HMMBB, which automatically compensate open wires and performs project mapping, and Visible Breadboard, which makes current visible.},

abstract = {When a person interacts with a display in an open area, sensitive information becomes visible to shoulder-surfing passers-by. While a person's body shields small displays, shielding is less effective as display area increases. To mitigate this problem, we sense spatial relationships between the passerby, person and display. Awareness of onlookers is provided through visual cues: flashing screen borders, a 3D model mirroring the onlooker's position and gaze, and an indicator that illustrates their gaze direction. The person can react with a gesture that commands the display to black out personal windows, or to collect them on one side. Alternately, the display will automatically darken screen regions visible by the onlooker, but leaving the display area shielded by the person's body unaltered (thus allowing the person to continue their actions). The person can also invite the onlooker to collaborate with them via a gesture that reverses these protective mechanisms. This video illustrates these and other approaches to mitigate shoulder surfing.},

Results from two human-factor studies showed that users could tap a touchscreen with five or more distinct areas on their finger pads. Also, they were able to tap with more distinct areas closer to their fingertips. We developed a TouchSense prototype using a smart watch and IMU sensors, and developed two example applications: a calculator and a text editor.

abstract = {This project explores a method to incorporate computer programming into primary school education. Through researching into effective teaching methods and combining it with inspirations taken from existing educational computer programming projects, we developed Loopo. Loopo blends a specially designed tangible interface with a digital interface. The tangibility of Loopo encourages collaboration among the users and motivates them to learn together. To keep up with the increasingly earlier adoption of computer technology, Loopo's goal is to teach children the fundamentals of computer programming in a fun, relatable, and interesting way, while nurturing collaboration through an easily approachable system.},

abstract = {This work describes a novel building block system for tangible interaction design, GaussBricks, which enables real-time constructive tangible interactions on portable displays. Given its simplicity, the mechanical design of the magnetic building blocks facilitates the construction of configurable forms. The form constructed by the magnetic building blocks, which are connected by the magnetic joints, allows users to stably manipulate with various elastic force feedback mechanisms. With an analog Hall-sensor grid mounted to its back, a portable display determines the geometrical configuration and detects various user interactions in real time. This work also introduce several methods to enable shape changing, multi-touch input, and display capabilities in the construction. The proposed building block system enriches how individuals interact with the portable displays physically.},

Already existing solutions, such as multi-directional treadmills, are still expensive and need additional fixation of the body. Others, like using external tracking that are usually accomplished by using statically installed cameras in CAVE-like-installations, also have limitations in terms of occlusion.

abstract = {We present a new approach to rapid prototyping of functional objects, such as the body of a head-mounted display. The key idea is to save 3D printing time by automatically substituting sub-volumes with standard building blocks - in our case Lego bricks. When making the body for a head-mounted display, for example, getting the optical path right is paramount. Users thus mark the lens mounts as "high-resolution" to indicate that these should later be 3D printed. faBrickator then 3D prints these parts. It also generates instructions that show users how to create everything else from Lego bricks. If users iterate on the design later, faBrickator offers even greater benefit as it allows reprinting only the elements that changed. We validated our system at the example of three 3D models of functional objects. On average, our system fabricates objects 2.44 times faster than traditional 3D printing while requiring only 14 minutes of manual assembly.},

The result of our in-lab use observation with twelve couples showed that Wrigglo supported emotional and functional roles of body gestures and postures, creating vocabularies related to the motion of specific body parts and, to some extent, reflected the connected user's presence through the device's movement. Through its peripheral anthropomorphization, Wrigglo can deliver new forms of telepresence by embodied posturing and gesturing in mobile communication.},

abstract = {Paddle is a highly deformable mobile device that leverages engineering principles from the design of the Rubik's Magic, a folding plate puzzle. The various transformations supported by Paddle bridges the gap between differently sized mobile devices available nowadays, such as phones, armbands, tablets and game controllers. Besides this, Paddle can be transformed to different physical controls in only a few steps, such as peeking options, a ring to scroll through lists and a book-like form factor to leaf through pages. These special-purpose physical controls have the advantage of providing clear physical affordances and exploiting people's innate abilities for manipulating objects in the real world. We investigated the benefits of these interaction techniques in detail in [1]. In contrast to traditional touch screens, physical controls are usually less flexible and therefore less suitable for mobile settings. Paddle, shows how mobile devices can be designed to bring physical controls to mobile devices and thus combine the flexibility of touch screens with the physical qualities that real world controls provide. Our current prototype is tracked with an optical tracking system and uses a projector to provide visual output. In the future, we envision devices similar to Paddle that are entirely self-contained, using tiny integrated displays.},

abstract = {Pregnancy is a complicated and special process with many bodily changes, discomforts, and possibilities of complications. Partners of expectant mothers share a close relationship and often play an important role during pregnancy. To support a better pregnancy experience, we present Nuwa, a system that enhances self-awareness of health condition and also facilitates the communication between expectant mothers and their partners. The system is based on expectant mothers' health conditions. It provides a way for expectant parents to track and understand the maternal health, and encourages the partners to provide better support. Our study results support our design ideas and argue for the feasibility and expandability of Nuwa in helping expectant parents to have better experiences during pregnancy.},

We call this "innominate movement representation" and explore this opportunity through our game "i-dentity". The game's setup has each player in a group hold Sony Move controllers, with one of the players' movements controlling all of the Move controller lights. Gameplay involves the group of players with Move controllers trying to perform movements together at the same time in order to conceal from other players whose movements are represented. With i-dentity, we aim to extend the range of multiplayer games with a novel and engaging approach to digital representation of player movement.},

We show that this casual game is well suited for public context and that camera based body tracking offers convenient interaction techniques for large screen displays. The game setting with its drunken protagonist Ed was well received by the players. This single player game uses the angle of the player's torso in relation to the ground to help Ed keep balance in a wobbling world. Ed's body pose reflects the player's pose, creating a very direct form of control. Results of our evaluation show that this form of control mapping is very easy to learn and the short play sessions meet the requirements of a casual game in public environment. Furthermore, we have designed our level selection menu to fulfill the double purpose of a gameplay tutorial, which was found to be well suited for games on public displays.},

The current dissertation work focuses on developing intelligent sketching user interfaces for enabling richer mid-air drawing interaction spaces.

abstract = {Small aerial robots represent a novel platform that appears uniquely suited to assist humans in exploratory, surveillance, inspection, and telepresence tasks across a variety of domains. Such tasks will require "assistive free-flyers" (AFFs) to effectively interact and collaborate with humans in close proximity. For AFFs to successfully work and collaborate with colocated humans, designers must account for human perceptions of AFFs acting within human environments. Humans, who do not generally interact with free-flying physical embodiments, may not feel safe or may have trouble working near AFFs given their functional morphology and unconstrained, three-dimensional flight capabilities. The goal of my dissertation is to investigate the design space of proximal AFF interactions, specifically by examining how AFFs might effectively communicate with colocated humans as well as gain an understanding regarding the ecological fit of AFFs within human workspaces. This research takes a two-phase approach towards examining proximal AFF interactions: (1) examining AFF communication mechanisms including motion, body language, and electronic signals, and (2) developing an understanding of user mental models and social expectations for flying robots, including an examination of spontaneous AFF interactions. My work will inform the design of future AFF systems and aid in understandings regarding how AFFs can reach their potential as collaborators within human environments.},

abstract = {This case study outlines a methodology for adapting digital games from literature. The process maps key narrative events to human computer interactions via game verbs. Game verbs are distinct player actions that help the player accomplish their in-game goal. Through the use of tightly coupled narrative events and game verbs, the game engenders the spirit of Edgar Allen Poe's short story The Tell Tale Heart. Like the story's protagonist, players move from controlled actions to erratic behavior as they manipulate their device. Players are required to propel the narrative through accelerometer and touch-based actions. The resulting game's physicality is designed to match the narrative's drive toward madness.},

abstract = {In recent years, gesture-based interaction methods are supported by a wide variety of devices, such as capacitive trackpads and capacitive 3D gesture recognition systems. Capacitive interaction systems are often integrated into laptops, but can also be installed ubiquitously under any kind of non-conductive surface - for example under a table. When interacting with such proximity-sensing surfaces, users often face the challenge that the affordances are often not directly apparent. Moreover, most devices have no ability to provide feedback, which is often only displayed on a complementary screen, not in the area in which the interaction takes place. In order to solve these problems, we present an approach which combines a semi-transparent capacitive proximity-sensing surface with an LED array. The LEDs are used to visually indicate possible gestural movements and provide feedback on the current interaction status.},

By focusing on the tool compass, we developed a novel drawing interface that can draw not only circles but also other kinds of figures under physical environment. In concrete, the radius of the interface is regulated according to the rotation of the device therefore the user only needs to twist the interface to draw a specific figure. The interface is composed of a rotary encoder which detects the rotation angle, and a servomotor which regulates the radius of the drawing. In this paper, we discuss the system of the interface and an evaluation.},

Our method tracks multiple distinct points on the user's hand simultaneously that act as a biometric to further enhance security. We describe the details of our mobile demonstrator that will give Interactivity attendees an opportunity to enroll and verify our system's authentication method. We also wish to encourage users to design their own gestures for use with the system. Apart from engaging with the CHI community, a demonstration of AirAuth would also yield useful gesture data input by the attendees which we intend to use to further improve the prototype and, more importantly, make available publicly as a resource for further research into gesture-based user interfaces.},

abstract = {Proper emotional development is important for young children, especially those with psychological disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), whereby early intervention becomes crucial. However, traditional paper-based interventions are mostly laborious and difficult to employ for carers and parents, whilst current computer-aided interventions feel too much like obvious assistive tools and lack timely feedback to inform and aid progress. CopyMe is an iPad game we developed that allows children to learn emotions with instant feedback on performance. A pilot study revealed children with ASDs were able to enjoy and perform well in the game. CopyMe also demonstrates a novel affective game interface that incorporates state-of-the-art facial expression tracking and classification. This will be particularly interesting for CHI attendees working in the domain of affective interfaces and serious games, especially those that target children.},

Since computer vision cannot yet reliably interpret human actions and emotions, video coding remains a time-consuming manual process done by a small team of researchers. We present Glance, a tool that allows researchers to rapidly analyze video datasets for behavioral events that are difficult to detect automatically. Glance uses the crowd to interpret natural language queries, and then aggregates and summarizes the content of the video. We show that Glance can accurately code events in video in a fraction of the time it would take a single person. We also investigate speed improvements made possible by recruiting large crowds, showing that Glance is able to code 80% of an hour-long video in just 5 minutes. Rapid coding allows participants to have a "conversation with their data" to rapidly develop and refine research hypotheses in ways not previously possible.},

For this purpose, we implemented two carefully optimized prototypes using popular consumer hardware (iPhone and iPad).

abstract = {We present a new approach to rapid prototyping of functional objects, such as the body of a head-mounted display. The key idea is to save 3D printing time by automatically substituting sub-volumes with standard building blocks -- in our case Lego bricks. When making the body for a head-mounted display, for example, getting the optical path right is paramount. Users thus mark the lens mounts as "high-resolution" to indicate that these should be 3D printed. faBrickator then 3D-prints only these parts. It also generates instructions that show users how to create everything else from Lego bricks. If users iterate on the design later, fa-Brickator offers even greater benefit as it allows re-printing only the elements that changed. We validated our system at the example of three 3D models of functional objects. On average, our system fabricates objects 2.44 times faster than traditional 3d printing while requiring only 14 minutes of manual assembly.},

abstract = {We present imaginary reality basketball, i.e., a ball game that mimics the respective real world sport, i.e., basketball, except that there is no visible ball. The ball is virtual and players learn about its position only from watching each other act and a small amount of occasional auditory feedback, e.g., when a person is receiving the ball. Imaginary reality games maintain many of the properties of physical sports, such as unencumbered play, physical exertion, and immediate social interaction between players. At the same time, they allow introducing game elements from video games, such as power-ups, non-realistic physics, and player balancing. Most importantly, they create a new game dynamic around the notion of the invisible ball.},

While previous systems have introduced sketch-based animations for individual objects, our contribution is a unified framework of motion controls that allows users to seamlessly add coordinated motions to object collections. We propose a framework built around kinetic textures, which provide continuous animation effects while preserving the unique timeless nature of still illustrations. This enables many dynamic effects difficult or not possible with previous sketch-based tools, such as a school of fish swimming, tree leaves blowing in the wind, or water rippling in a pond. A user study with professional animators and casual users demonstrates the variety of animations, applications and creative possibilities our tool provides.},

With an analog Hall-sensor grid mounted to its back, a portable display determines the geometrical configuration and detects various user interactions in real time.

However, existing works on sitting posture recognition either use intrusive wearable/visual sensors or rely on expensive high-resolution pressure sensor array, and thus hindering the widespread adoption. In this work, we introduce Cushionware, a practical sitting posture recognition system that is based on sparse pressure sensor array. Pressure sensor array is placed within the chair cushion to collect pressure data while user is sitting. After collecting the data, we first model sitting posture by extracting a set of user-invariant features and then identify the sitting posture using machine learning method. To demonstrate the utility of Cushionware, we develop two applications including video game playing and wheelchair motion control.},

Initially Brainput was found to improve performance on a human-robot team task by adapting a robot's autonomy using NIRS-based classifications of the user's multitasking states [15, 16]. However, the failure to find any performance improvements in a follow-up study prompted reinvestigation of the original system via a reanalysis of Brainput's signal processing on a larger NIRS dataset and a placebo-controlled replication using random (instead of NIRS-based) state classifications. This reinvestigation revealed confounds in the original study responsible for the initial performance improvements, thus indicating that further work in signal processing is necessary to achieve reliable NIRS-based BCIs.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) offers fertile ground to consider the nature of electronic prototyping, especially in building systems from the lowest level. While constructing artifacts to interact directly with everyday materials and contexts, we've found it important to approach the IoT from the very lowest levels of hardware to avoid both abstracting away from real knowledge of the platform itself as well as to reduce implementation cost for massive deployment.Building new, inexpensive platforms that augment everyday objects in minimal ways is our proposal for an alternative to top-down control of IoT devices. We intend to move towards interactions among and between things as a bottom-up design study into ubiquitous small-scale computing and its potential aesthetic applications.},

It is quite arduous, if not impossible, to read all of these papers. One approach to deal with this information deluge is to focus on skimming through lots of papers in a short period of time, so that one can more wisely choose what to read before investing time in them. In order to teach such a skimming technique, I have taught a technique, called "Quick and Dirty Review (QnDReview)," in a graduate-level HCI course. The method has been employed in the course for five semesters, and students' responses were collected and analyzed. Results showed that students spent, on average, 4.3 minutes per paper and believed that they got the gist of each paper. However, the largest benefit I noticed is that students get the overall pictures of the fields while exposing themselves to various new ideas through this approach.},

However, the HCI community has still not adopted concordance as a design ideal. This paper revisits four old design-cases to explore the role of concordance in out-of-clinic healthcare.

The study employs an eclectic set of qualitative and quantitative methodologies including a literature review for secondary data on the history of Auto-GCAS, field observations, surveys, and interviews for primary data. This paper also discusses how our methodologies and methods were adapted to the limited access, and uniqueness of, the participant groups while taking advantage of emerging opportunities. We also discuss lessons learned about the required qualities of the research team, particularly those related to cultural and technical competence, political sensitivity, and trust relationship with participants.},

abstract = {Cool products provide a leap in value and they increase a company's market share. The widespread adoption of iOS and Android devices resulted in a radical change in the role of technology in people's lives. And anecdotally people exclaimed about how "cool" their devices were; "I can't go back" to what I had before and "I can't stop talking about it--it's so cool!".In 2010 InContext Design launched The Cool Project to understand the underlying principles which make a product "cool." The research goal was to discover the core drivers of the cool user experience. This consumer research used qualitative research to identify seven core constructs associated with "coolness" that appeared independently of device or software or even technology product. In 2011 SAP became interested in developing a metric to measure "coolness" and in a joint research effort with InContext Design validated the constructs with business users and co-designed a cool metric. The final result is a repeatable process for measuring cool through a quick survey, the results of which provide implications to product teams on how to improve their products to increase "coolness".This case study outlines the process of using qualitative data to design a valid quantitative measure.},

In this paper, we address this issue and propose a crowdsourced testbed that allows a social media user to get an evaluation of his/her proposed post before broadcasting it in actual social media, based on the feedback of specialists associated with the topics of the post. This assessment of a proposed post includes a positive/negative recommendation indicating whether or not the post should be broadcasted in social media.},

Consistent with prior work, this research finds large differences in the representations of Okinawa in the content of the two editions. The number of users crossing the language boundary to edit both editions is also extremely small. When users do edit in a non-primary language, they most frequently edit articles that have cross-language (interwiki) links, articles that are edited more by other users, and articles that have more images. Finally, the possible value of edits from foreign-language users and design possibilities to motivate wider contributions from foreign-language users are discussed.},

We intend to create an alternative video viewer where the steps and subgoals are displayed alongside the video. In order to generate this information we propose a learnersourcing approach where we gather useful information from people trying to actively learn from a video. We believe learnersourcing is a sustainable and constructive method for enhancing educational material. To demonstrate this method, we created a workflow that encourages users to contribute and refine subgoals for a given how-to video. Users in our pilot study of three videos were able to generate subgoals comparable to those created by the author, which suggests that learnersourcing may be a viable approach.},

In this study, 27 pairs of apprentices in logistics (N=54) interacted with an interactive simulation of a warehouse. Their task was to memorize, analyze and optimize several warehouses' layouts. In one condition, half of the participants used physical, 3D shelves; in another condition, shelves were represented by 2D paper rectangles. This manipulation allowed me to control for the "representational effect" of 3D tangibles: the first group saw the warehouse as a small-scale model with realistic shelves, while the second group had access to a more abstract view with rectangular pieces of paper. I found that participants who used 3D shelves better memorized a warehouse layout, built a more efficient model, and scored higher on a learning test. Interestingly, these effects decreased with students' expertise: third-year students (compared to first-years and second-years) performed as well and learnt as much in both conditions.},

In this paper, we explore touch input using the thumb of the holding hand, and compare it for different tapping tasks, between a flexible and a rigid tablet. We present initial design guidelines to use touch input with thumb in flexible devices. Our result suggests that users can perform tapping interaction using thumb input in both rigid and flexible devices with similar accuracy, and they prefer holding the display on the side or the bottom corner over the bottom center.},

abstract = {To promote the practice of sound statistical analysis in HCI, we introduce VisiStat, a tool that allows users to perform statistical analysis by interacting with visualizations. It guides users to select the appropriate statistical analysis tasks based on the research questions they want to answer. By collocating statistical analysis results with appropriate visualizations, users are made aware of data-specific knowledge, which consequently improves their understanding of data and reduces common statistical analysis mistakes. In our user study, VisiStat helped users to answer 90% of the research questions they posed. On average, the users performed four statistical analysis tasks beyond their prior experience.},

abstract = {User-centered design research activities produce an enormous quantity of raw data, which must be systematically and rigorously synthesized in order to extract meaning and insight. Unfortunately, these methods of synthesis are poorly documented and rarely taught, and because of the pragmatic time constraints associated with working with clients, there is often no time dedicated in a statement of work to a practice of formal synthesis. As a result, raw design research data is inappropriately positioned as insight, and the value of user-centered research activities is marginalized -- in fact, stakeholders may lose faith in the entire research practice, as they don't see direct return on the investment of research activities.Design synthesis methods can be taught, and when selectively applied, visual, diagrammatic synthesis techniques can be completed relatively quickly. During synthesis, Designers visually explore large quantities of data in an effort to find and understand hidden relationships, to extract insight, and to look at complexity in new ways. These visualizations can then be used to communicate to other members of a design team, or can be used as platforms for the creation of generative sketching or model making. The action of diagramming is a way to actively produce knowledge and meaning, and a way to provoke a process known as sensemaking.This skills-based course will introduce various methods of synthesis as ways to translate research into meaningful insights. Course participants will learn about how to manage the complexity of gathered data, and through hands-on exercises, they will apply various synthesis methods to elicit hidden meaning in gathered data. This hands-on approach is critical for building both confidence and ability with the various synthesis methods that are discussed.},

Attendees will discover that the wide spectrum of available UIs makes it possible for almost anyone to use information technology. However, they will also experience examples of how this UI model breaks down when the software, document, form or website users are trying to access is designed in a way that fails to support user diversity. Current models are dependent on designers, developers, and authors to create products that are accessible, and these models are largely failing. Despite laws that require accessible design, and standards and guidelines that define it, people with disabilities still face daunting barriers that prevent them from accessing technology. This course will explore this problem in some depth, and participants will brainstorm possible solutions. This course is intended for all audiences. Everyone who designs or develops interfaces, and everyone who authors content, should be aware of how the interface or content they create affects individuals with disabilities.

abstract = {HCI research has for long been dedicated to better and more naturally facilitating information transfer between humans and machines. Unfortunately, humans' most natural form of communication, speech, is also one of the most difficult modalities to be understood by machines -- despite, and perhaps, because it is the highest-bandwidth communication channel we possess. While significant research efforts, from engineering, to linguistic, and to cognitive sciences, have been spent on improving machines' ability to understand speech, the CHI community has been relatively timid in embracing this modality as a central focus of research. This can be attributed in part to the relatively discouraging levels of accuracy in understanding speech, in contrast with often-unfounded claims of success from industry, but also to the intrinsic difficulty of designing and especially evaluating speech and natural language interfaces. As such, the development of interactive speech-based systems is mostly driven by engineering efforts to improve such systems with respect to largely arbitrary performance metrics, often void of any user-centered design principles or consideration for usability or usefulness.The goal of this course is to inform the CHI community of the current state of speech and natural language research, to dispel some of the myths surrounding speech-based interaction, as well as to provide an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to learn more about how speech recognition and speech synthesis work, what are their limitations, and how they could be used to enhance current interaction paradigms. Through this, we hope that HCI researchers and practitioners will learn how to combine recent advances in speech processing with user-centered principles in designing more usable and useful speech-based interactive systems.},

abstract = {This two-part course takes a practical approach to introduce you to the principles, tools and pitfalls in big data analytics. Part 1: A non-technical introduction illustrating where HCI and data mining as fields of research and practice can benefit from each other with illustrative case studies, followed by a review of tools for analyzing datasets from small to huge. Part 2: A more technical discussion of how to "do it right", such as: How to choose a "big data" platform for your work (or do you need one at all)? How to find an algorithm that is right for your data? How to evaluate your approach appropriately? And more... Audience: HCI researchers, practitioners, and students. No prior knowledge of data mining or machine learning is required. Teaching Methods: Lecture and videos. Instructor Background: Prof. Polo Chau has been working at the intersection of HCI and data mining for over 9 years, to create scalable, interactive tools for big data analytics. Now a professor at Georgia Tech's College of Computing, Polo holds a Ph.D. in Machine Learning and a Masters in HCI, both from Carnegie Mellon. His thesis on bridging HCI and data mining for making sense of large network data won received Carnegie Mellon's Distinguished Computer Science Dissertation Award, Honorable Mention. He teaches the "Data and Visual Analytics" course at Georgia Tech. Polo is the only two-time Symantec fellow. He contributes to the PEGASUS peta-scale graph mining that won an Open Source Software World Challenge Silver Award. Polo's NetProbe auction fraud detection research appeared on The Wall Street Journal, CNN, TV and radio. His Polonium malware detection technology protects 120 million people worldwide.},

abstract = {We as researchers and User Experience (UX) designers want to identify and create products that change the world and therefore, we choose to engage in strategic research and design. In the real world though, coming up with a breakthrough idea or transformative design doesn't mean it will automatically be accepted in the research community or get to market. By definition, innovative ideas represent new ways of thinking. Organizations by nature seem to have anti-innovation antibodies that often kill new ideas - even disruptive innovations that could help companies differentiate themselves from their competition. As difficult as coming up with a game-changing idea can be, getting an organization to act on the idea often seems impossible. Perhaps we find ourselves in work routines that do not provide space to think differently. Our experience is that practitioners and academics alike need new tools to meet this challenge - tools that empower UX teams in both business and universities to identify transformative new ideas, and then to get these big ideas and designs accepted. This course proposes rapid design labs - a design-led, facilitative, cross-functional, iterative approach to innovation that aligns organizations and generates value at each step. It provides tools and methods that turn attendees into catalysts, who systemically identify new ideas, and align multidisciplinary teams around their ideas. Attendees learn how to lead workshops that foster ideation, collaboration, trust, and free expression. These workshops enable intensive brainstorming, purposeful play, design, user testing, and rapid prototyping. Learn how innovative companies, design firms, and universities identify, design, and bring great products to market.},

abstract = {The Design of Everyday Things [1](DOET) was first published 25 years ago, in 1988. Even though the fundamental principles of human interaction introduced in that book are still true, a lot has changed since then. The examples in the book reveal its age but more importantly, the technology of interaction has changed.The new DOET maintains the same basic structure with the same fundamental design principles. But new material has been added. First, I added the role of emotion, beauty and pleasure to the original DOET's emphasis on utility and understanding. Second, I added two chapters about the role of Design Thinking and how these principles work in the world of business. What are the constraints of the installed base, legacy products, and consumer readiness' What about time and budget? Among other things, I introduce Norman's Law: The day the product team is assembled, it is behind schedule and over its budget. Technologies disappear, but the needs they satisfied often remain. Phonographs, slide projectors, and film have disappeared, but music, illustrated talks, and photographs still exist. Doors, water taps, and light switches may remain the same, but automobiles will drive themselves, machines are becoming more intelligent, more fully autonomous, taking over many tasks we do ourselves, anticipating our desires. And often they will get it wrong. What design rules must change? How shall we design in the 21st century?},

abstract = {With the emergence of social media and the availability of big data, there has been much interest in mining the digital footprints left by users to predict personality traits (e.g., introvert and idealistic) and gain a deeper understanding of individuals. While such understanding will enable hyper-personalized computing, such as personality-based marketing, the use of this technology will have far-reaching social implications that could affect almost every aspect of our lives. For example, personality traits mined from social media could be used to guide hiring and promotion decisions or decide who is admitted into top academic programs. The risks of using derived personality traits are potentially high, particular due to factors such as the veracity of data collected from social media, imperfections in prediction algorithms, and a lack of control over how, when, and to whom anyone's personality traits might be exposed. We will use this panel to bring together experts from the fields of Psychology, Social Science, Computer Science, along with the CHI community, to discuss and debate the opportunities and risks of personality discovery from social media and the implications on technical communities and our society at large.},

abstract = {International development and initiatives towards societal impact have been slowly gaining momentum in the HCI forums over the last few years. A subset of HCI researchers and practitioners worldwide have been working to design, build, evaluate and deploy solutions for the 80% of the world which lives on less than $10 a day[2] and broadly for humanitarian efforts that improves people's lives at large. However, a large section of the HCI community is still not directly involved in this space even if they are interested, because of concerns like job uncertainty, lack of awareness of avenues to help, time availability and perhaps some delusions about the space. This panel brings together panelists who are HCI professionals trying to produce social impact from four different domains (non-profit, for-profit social enterprise, academic research and corporate research) and are from different geographies and stages in their careers. The panel explores how HCI researchers and practitioners can consider HCI-related careers in international development and other societal impact initiatives, introduce the CHI community to different means through which they could make meaningful contributions, discuss why it may be imminent for HCI specialists to apply their expertise to this space, cite and discuss some real world stories and try to answer as many queries from people who would like to get involved either as volunteers or for full-time careers.},

abstract = {Food is essential to the survival of the world population. There are several processes in order to make food available to consumers: for example, production, transportation, and consumption. Since the global demand of food is always on the rise, there is a need to improve the efficiency in all the processes in food industries. For example, the food production industries are often not equipped with the right decision-making tools to allow farmers to properly deal with important factors such as environmental changes. On the other hand, tools are not difficult to create but can be very challenging to be successfully adopted by the professionals, especially when the tools require them to change their normal work practices. In this SIG, we will discuss how HCI can improve food product industries with suitable information for each food process. },

This paper presents SpeakUp, a mobile temporary social media app, confined in time and space that aims to improve interactions in classrooms. In SpeakUp, teachers can create temporary chat rooms accessible to students located nearby. Students can then anonymously post messages, which can be rated up or down by others. Our evaluation results (with a class of 300 students over the course of a semester) show that temporary social media can be used as an effective tool to improve classroom interactions by providing: (i) confined classroom-like here &amp; now interactions to foster adoption, (ii) anonymity to increase participation and (iii) social media rating for highlighting interesting content. Students appear to use SpeakUp not solely for asking questions but also as a general backchannel, which can result in spam.},

However, designing intuitive informational vibrotactile messages for and with the older adults has seldom been investigated. This paper describes an initial study involving older adults in the design of vibrotactile messages for a pedestrian navigation application. The design is based on metaphors or everyday analogies in an attempt to strengthen the link between the pattern and its associated meaning. The study presents the method to collect these metaphors, focusing on the difficulties encountered with such an abstract task and the steps taken to adapt it to the audience. As a result, a number of metaphors were collected, in line with what matters for older adults (e.g. kids, health).},

In many cases early intervention is crucial to ease the struggle to identify key facial expressions and the emotions they are used to convey. Combining automatic facial expression recognition technology with real-time feedback on player performance, CopyMe is an iPad game that aims to provide a means for children to learn expressions to demonstrate emotions. In this paper, we discuss findings from a pilot study conducted at a childcare centre to evaluate the feasibility of CopyMe's use as a serious game for children to learn emotions through observation and mimicry. Based on observational and interview data, we found that the children, especially the ones affected by ASDs, were able to perform well in the game and generally expressed enjoyment during play. The design of CopyMe as well as our current findings will be most interesting for CHI attendees working in the domain of affective interfaces and serious games, especially those that target children.},

As a first step, we use expression cues of the parenting styles; we implemented behaviours of different styles played out by two robots, Nao and Reeti, with body and facial channels respectively for communication. 88 parents watched videos of the robots and replied to a questionnaire about the authoritativeness of the robots. The results showed that the styles were perceptible through the non-verbal behaviours of the robots. The dominant condition was perceived to be more authoritative than the less dominant condition, which validates the hypothesis. We also notice an effect of the robot's modality of expressions; further work should confirm hypotheses on the modality's effects of the perception on authoritativeness of the robot.},

abstract = {The rapid spread of smartphones based on touch interfaces is now playing a serious role in the digital divide to the physically disabled, especially to people with motor impairments. Motor impairments often result in muscle weakness, poor stamina, lack of muscle control, or total paralysis making it hard to fine- control fingers, which is essential to touch interactions. Through observation and in-depth interviews, we reached a design decision that an electric wheelchair joystick is a very viable interface device for users with motor impairments. Based on the findings, we developed Octopus Launcher, which is a solution to help motor impaired users to utilize smartphones by controlling the cursor on the smartphone screen using the joystick. Octopus Launcher takes advantage of the eight directional controls of a joystick readily equipped in electric wheelchairs. The launcher is designed to control various touch interactions as well as hardware buttons by use of a joystick on a wheelchair. Octopus Launcher is an interaction framework that enables many disabled people who can use the eight-direction joystick to control a smartphone.},

How do these routes change when different assistive tools, such as the traditional White-Cane or new devices such as the EyeCane, are used? These questions have significant repercussions as independent Mobility poses one of the main challenges facing the blind. Here, we use a series of virtual environments and non-visual interfaces to comparatively explore the differences in intuitive navigation: when using the virtual-EyeCane, when using a virtual White-Cane, when navigating without using a device at all and finally when navigating visually. We show that using the virtual-EyeCane as a non-visual interface to virtual environments increases their accessibility, that characteristics of navigating with it are different from those of White-Cane users and from those of navigation without an assistive device, and that users of the virtual-EyeCane complete more levels successfully, taking a shorter path and with less collisions than users of the white cane or no device. Finally, we demonstrate that navigation with the virtual-EyeCane takes on patterns relatively similar to those of navigating visually.},

These challenges include: the need to constantly talk to signify location and detecting the positions of silent objects on the field. Our work aims to discover methods to help persons with visual impairments play soccer more efficiently and safely. The proposed system uses headphone-rendered spatial audio, an on-person computer, and sensors to create 3D sound that represents the objects on the field in real-time. This depiction of the field will help players to more accurately detect the locations of objects and people on the field. The present work describes the design of such a system and discusses perceptual challenges. Broadly, our work aims to discover ways to enable people with visual impairments to detect the position of moving objects, which will allow them to feel empowered in their personal lives and give them the confidence to navigate more independently.},

In particular, users may lose the ability to form mental maps, which may result in an undesired dependency on navigation tools. It has been proposed that better spatial awareness may be achieved by forcing users to expend greater effort in the navigation process. However, this runs against the general concepts of usability which seek to increase ease-of-use. Prior studies have either been inconclusive or profess to have created effort-inducing features that may not appeal to users. Practical usability is one focus of our research and we present an interface that addresses this focus while balancing navigation efficiency with acquisition of spatial knowledge.

abstract = {Though we live in the era of the touchscreen (tablet PCs and smart phones providing a rigid and flat interface) people and the industry are getting excited about the world of tangible 3D interfaces. This may be explained for two reasons: first, the emergence of cheap vision-based gestural interfaces conquering the space above and below the screen (but without haptic feedback), and second - and perhaps more important for the present discussion - the explosion of the 3D printing industry and the possibility for the end user to not only customise the layout of icons on a screen, but also of designing their own physical, deformable interface from scratch. Mass-produced smartphones could then be seen as bare-bone electronics devices whose shape can be physically augmented, personalised and crafted.Now, in order to introduce DIY techniques in the world of deformable input-output interfaces, it is necessary to provide a generic manufacturing/sensing method for such arbitrarily designed shapes. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate a minimally invasive method (i.e. no wiring) to physically augment rigid tablet PCs or smartphones. By putting a deformable object over the front or rear camera - this 'object' can be part of the smartphone case itself - and by making the inside of the object partially transparent, the complex light reflections can be used to recognise patterns of deformation/grasping and map them to different UI actions. A machine learning algorithm allows object shape and deformation to be designed arbitrarily, bringing the device physical personalisation at a level never reached before, with minimal interference with its original hardware.},

abstract = {This paper describes a tangible 3D user interface called CAPTIVE, a Cube with Augmented Physical Tools, for exploration of 3D information. The design of CAPTIVE is founded on the concept of tool use, in which handheld tool objects are used to modify the properties or appearance of target objects. The user of CAPTIVE holds a physical wireframe cube that contains virtual objects in one hand, in the other a pointing device, its tip visually augmented to reflect its function as a tool. On the display the user watches the immediate, direct effects of actions with the tool. In the current prototype, routines for handling cube manipulation and an augmented haptic pointing device have been separately implemented, but integration and refinement remain to be done. In this paper we describe our vision of the system and preliminary testing carried out to date.},

In this paper we report on a prototype interface that supports natural 3D free-hand gestures on wearable computers. In addition to using hand gestures for AR interaction, we also look into allowing users to combine low resolution hand gestures in 3D with high resolution touch input. We show how this could be used in a wearable AR interface and present early pilot study results.},

We develop a classification scheme for external and internal search queries using the referral query as the starting point. Using an n-gram approach, we identify query patterns for 295,271 searching episodes. We aggregate and identify six searching patterns. The three major searching strategies are Explorers (47%, a broad query for external search and then multiple broad queries during internal search), Navigators (16%, a navigational query for external search and then specific queries during internal search), and Acquirers (15%, transaction queries for both external and internal search). The remaining three patterns are Shifters (12%), Persisters (7%), and Orienteers (3%). Identification of searching patterns and related content can be a competitive advantage for websites dependent on providing relevant, fresh, and locatable information.},

We collected 2010 posts on campus information board of an active university forum in four weeks and extracted 413 location-based questions. Then we proposed a reliable taxonomy of location-based questions in four dimensions (purpose, level of urgency, reusability, and location range). In purpose dimension, we found (factual and opinion) knowledge seeking questions (69%) and help seeking and offering questions (26%) are most frequently asked. A further correlation analysis revealed the relations between these four dimensions and gave design implications.},

Visualization techniques can facilitate the understanding of relationships among these data sets. Although various visualization techniques have already been introduced in GUR, most of these techniques only focus on displaying large amounts of data captured directly via telemetry without integrating qualitative or contextual data on players' emotional experience. Hence, here we propose a novel visualization approach to triangulate the above mentioned mixed data sources.},

This automatic annotation allows us to keep the information about AOIs when the layout of a visualization is changed. To evaluate our concept, we have implemented a prototype with the visualization framework D3. The paper concludes with a discussion of the concept's limitations, its application on graphical user interfaces, and a future perspective on this approach.},

A simple graphical user interface is then used to configure the system to interpret the movements of these accelerometers as if they were common physical controls such as buttons or dials. The designer can then associate events generated by these controls with a range of interactive behavior, including web browser and media player control.},

abstract = {While physical prototyping and personal fabrication is currently getting increasingly popular, many of the tools used to design 3D objects are still complex and cumbersome to use. In this paper, we address this issue and present a novel tabletop-based tangible editor, called NatCut, that allows the quick and easy design of physical enclosures for interactive prototypes. To generate an enclosure with NatCut, the user first chooses a basic geometric shape for it on the tabletop surface. By simply placing electronic components on the displayed 2D layout for the enclosure, respective cut-outs and holes are generated. Further, a number of user interactions on the tabletop screen are supported to modify, personalize, and enrich the casing. The resulting 2D layout contains all joints needed to assemble the parts after laser cutting. We discuss the results of a user study in which we tested the approach.},

abstract = {Hand gesture feedback systems using tactile or visual information can only be used in given situations because of the limitations of the device features such as the need for a battery. In this paper, we propose a half-implant device located on the fingernail. The half-implant device consists of a radio frequency (RF) receiving antenna, small electronic parts, and UV gel. The UV gel is used to glue the parts onto the user's nail and cover the parts meant to be waterproof. The device receives power from the RF antenna; therefore, it does not require a battery to function. It notifies whether the finger is in a target site by lighting an LED or activating a vibration motor. The primary benefit of this device is that the user can feel hand gesture feedback, anytime and anywhere. The device can be placed on the users' fingernail for approximately three weeks. To verify the devices' influence on the users' pointing task, we conducted a preliminary user study. The task success rate was 100% over the sessions with tactile and visual feedback and 97% without feedback. The experiment revealed that the tactile notification reduced the task time by 12.3 % compared to that of the test with no feedback.},

However, when they design the look-and-feel of a game application such as an image of a game character and an arrangement of a button, it would be more intuitive to edit the application by directly interacting with these objects on a game window. Although modern game engines realize this facility, they use a highly structured framework and limit what the programmer can edit. In this paper, we present CapStudio, a development environment for a visual application with an interactive screencast. A screencast is a movie player-like output window with code editing functionality. The screencast works with a traditional text editor. Modifications of source code in the text editor and visual elements on the screencast will be immediately reflected on each other. We created an example application and confirmed the feasibility of our approach.},

To enhance traditional m-participation approaches and encourage continuous engagement, we investigate their fusion with location-based games in a user-centered research process. In this paper, we present the results of a web survey among 33 gamers which uncover the main motivators for playing location-based games. Based upon these findings, we derive a new long-term m-participation concept named Community Circles and introduce a first functional prototype to be used in future focus group studies.},

Additionally, movement is a core interaction of these games. This makes the distances between players a key element of the game dynamics. Annotating recorded movements requires video annotation which is time-consuming and prone to mistakes. To tackle this problem we introduce geo-sociograms as a method to visualize distances between players over time at a glance. We apply this method to existing data, showing that it leads to many of the same insights as traditional video analysis while being less time-consuming. A study indicates that geo-sociograms have the potential to help characterize types of location-based games. Ultimately, we hope that geo-sociograms will help predict movement patterns when using particular game design elements.},

The idea is to "feel" the weight and push of the jellyfish as it moves along and interact with it to change its direction. The subsequent work will focus on augmenting the bell of the jellyfish to 3D and more realistic tentacles. All are done in affordable Falcon and OpenGL.

By adding context sensitivity, these buttons can also be repurposed to fit other functions. By linking multiple buttons, it is possible to create workflows for specific tasks. We provide a description of an initial iButton design space and highlight some scenarios to illustrate the envisioned usage of interactive buttons.},

By utilizing an eye tracking device, we have enhanced an IDE prototype with gaze-controlled interaction methods for source code navigation. A qualitative evaluation shows that users welcome the ability to quickly look up documentation or to jump to method declarations just by looking at triggers placed in the code. Although inaccuracies inherent in eye tracking technology and discomforting sitting positions for users impede successful implementation of more advanced IDE features, the interaction paradigm appears to be acceptable within the software development context and seems promising as eye tracking technology is being further improved.},

Multilevel auditory displays enable user interaction with concentrated areas of information. However, it is necessary to consider how to present the auditory streams without overloading the user. We present an initial study in which a top-level exocentric sonification layer was used to advertise information present in a gallery-like space. Then, in a secondary interactive layer, three different conditions were evaluated that varied in the presentation (sequential versus simultaneous) and spatialisation (non-spatialised versus egocentric spatialisation) of multiple auditory sources. Results show that 1) participants spent significantly more time interacting with spatialised displays, 2) there was no evidence that a switch from an exocentric to an egocentric display increased workload or lowered satisfaction, and 3) there was no evidence that simultaneous presentation of spatialised Earcons in the secondary display increased workload.},

However, the persistent presence of a few physical buttons forces most users to look for them by rotating the device before using it. We propose that tangible but virtual controls could appear where the user expects them to be, when the device is picked up. This would support the intended industrial design. In a user study, we evaluate two methods for synthesizing such controls (continuous and discrete), implemented in a functional prototype. While both were found to be highly usable, an optimum implementation should be a hybrid of both, where continuous feedback supports locating the exact position of the control. Then, either model could be used to obtain the best UX in button pressing, depending on the use case.},

abstract = {Various home appliances and electronic devices require remote control in homes, such as air conditioners and televisions, and the number of household remote control devices is increasing. However, the users of remote control devices sometimes experience stress because they might forget where they left a device, or they might have problems selecting the correct control from an array of confusing devices. Thus, we propose an innovative control method for home electronics that detects user gestures, where the prompts for gestures are projected onto the user's body. We also designed gestures and a GUI, which are highly intuitive and easy to understand. We refer to this system as "U-Remo" (ubiquitous + you are the remote control). As an example of this method, we applied the U-Remo system to an air conditioner. We developed a prototype system that comprised an air conditioner embedded device, a depth sensor camera, and a projector, which allowed the detection of user actions and the provision of graphical feedback based on the user's actions.},

abstract = {Reality-Based Interaction (RBI) [14] theorizes that realistic user interactions(UIs)are effective because they exploit users' pre-existing knowledge about their bodies and objects in the world. Gesture based interaction allows users to relay information to a computer through body movement without physical contact with additional hardware such as a mouse or trackball. However, this interaction style requires the users to interact in a manner that is tailored for the system to recognize with very strict rules for bodily interaction, not toward a gesture space that is more natural for the user. In this paper we propose a natural method of gestural input through a user-defined 3-dimensional space. We conducted two pilot studies to assess the performance and usability of these augmented gestural pointing methods for cursor manipulation as compared to a standard mouse interaction as well as the current standard approach used in gestural input.},

We modified the game of Fruit Ninja to use Leap Motion controller's hand tracking data for stroke patients with arm and hand weakness to practice their finger individuation. In a pilot study, we recruited 14 patients with chronic stroke to play the game using natural interaction. Their Fruit Ninja (FN) scores show high correlation with the standard clinical assessment scores such as Fugl-Meyer (FMA) and Box-and-Blocks Test (BBT) scores. This finding suggests that our free-hand Fruit Ninja's score is a good indicator of the patient's hand function and therefore will be informative if used in their rehabilitation.},

However, tracking individuals' heart rate faces two major challenges, namely equipment availability and user motivation. In this paper, we present a novel technique, LivePulse Games (LPG), to measure users' heart rate in real time by having them play casual games on unmodified mobile phones. With LPG, heart rate is calculated by detecting changes in transparency of users' fingertips via a mobile device's built-in camera. More importantly, LPG integrate users' camera lens covering actions as an essential control mechanism for game play, and detect heart rate implicitly from intermittent lens covering actions. We explore the design space and trade-offs of LPG through three rounds of interactive design and report the preliminary results from a 12-subject user study.},

Lack of large scale studies enabling statistically significant re-sults is due to high costs of manual penetration in eye tracking analysis. With high quality wearable cameras for eye-tracking and Google glasses, video analysis for visual attention analysis will become ubiquitous for automated large scale annotation. We describe for the first time precise gaze estimation on mobile displays and surrounding, its performance and without markers. We demonstrate accurate POR (point of regard) re-covery on the mobile device and enable heat mapping of visual tasks. In a benchmark test we achieve a mean accuracy in the POR localization on the display by 1.5 mm, and the method is very robust to illumination changes. We conclude from these results that this sys-tem may open new avenues in eye tracking research for behavior analysis in mobile applications.},

Spatial working memory is particularly important to spatial cognition, including mental rotation and spatial visualization. It is also important to understanding navigation in complex game worlds.

This paper presents a preliminary study aiming to correlate high levels of frustration with posture information collected from the driver's seat. Using a driving simulator, participants had to drive under normal and frustrating conditions, for example parking in a tight spot with some time constraint. Binary classification using a range of machine learning algorithms provided encouraging results, showing that posture features could help reflect frustration and possibly other drivers' mental states.},

abstract = {This paper compares the user experience of three novel concept designs for 3D-based car dashboards. Our work is motivated by the fact that analogue dashboards are currently being replaced by their digital counterparts. At the same time, auto-stereoscopic displays enter the market, allowing the quality of novel dashboards to be increased, both with regard to the perceived quality and in supporting the driving task. Since no guidelines or principles exist for the design of digital 3D dashboards, we take an initial step in designing and evaluating such interfaces. In a study with 12 participants we were able to show that stereoscopic 3D increases the perceived quality of the display while motion parallax leads to a rather disturbing experience.},

Many drivers use their smartphone while driving, though it is legally restricted due to safety issues. This research intends to (1) observe the information behaviors of drivers (2) classify their information activities (3) and finally induce design implications. For this purpose, we conducted user research using an in-car monitoring system observing drivers in situ (Figure 1) and a smartphone application usage tracker. After gathering and integrating the data through a multi-coding process, we were able to introduce special categories, "five sessions," explaining a smartphone usage pattern in cars particularly. Moreover, using the drivers' voice recordings, we found out drivers' specific informational needs. The results informed us of four implications that could be used in smart cars or car-related services in the future.},

Participants were required to complete a stressful mental arithmetic task, designed to simulate a demanding work-related activity, while watching a segment of a television documentary. To reflect the different ways that people can media multitask, participants were asked either to perform the work task continuously (concurrent multitasking), or during bursts (sequential multitasking). Results show that working on the stressful task was stressful ' it did not matter whether the television was on or not, nor did it matter how the tasks were interleaved. There was some evidence that sequentially interleaving tasks allowed participants to maintain their engagement with the television show. Overall though the results of this preliminary study suggest that if people want to relax and become engrossed in a television show they should avoid working on a secondary device at the same time.},

It is difficult for a user to hold a large touch-screen mobile device and reach a distant target on the screen with one hand. We propose ExtendedThumb, a virtual thumb proxy of the real thumb, to address this problem in single-handed interaction. ExtendedThumb reaches out to a distant target on a touch screen in the dragging direction of the real thumb but at a faster speed than the latter. Users can adjust the position of the virtual thumb by changing the dragging direction and distance of the real thumb. Results of an empirical evaluation show that ExtendedThumb significantly outperforms MagStick in speed and user satisfaction while achieving a similar accuracy. ExtendedThumb is also significantly better than the direct touch method in accuracy and user satisfaction. The findings provide insights into motion-based one-handed interaction with mobile devices.},

However, it is currently challenging to understand the real benefits and advantages of tangible systems. To address this problem, this paper argues that we need new evaluation techniques capable of meaningfully assessing how users perform with tangible, physical objects. Working towards this aim, it presents a video-coding framework that supports the granular identification of epistemic actions (physical actions that are made to simplify cognitive work) during tangible tasks. The framework includes 20 epistemic actions, identified through a systematic literature review of 77 sources. We argue that data generated by applying this process will help us better understand epistemic behavior and, ultimately, lead to the generation of novel, grounded design insights to support physically-grounded cognitive strategies in tangible tasks.},

Unfortunately, a small touch screen's usability is limited when it can be easily occluded, such as by a finger. In this paper, we look at extending the interactive surface for a smart watch to the back of the hand. Our approach reduces screen occlusion by enabling off-device gestural interaction. We define a range of supported bimanual gestures and present a prototype device.},

The video chat is composed of physiological sensors and multimodal displays. In our first prototype, we employed a Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor and a Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) sensor as they were crucial indications to human emotions. A vibrotactile motor and a RGB LED were also used in order to convey and display the other's emotion on one's wrist. Along with the hardware part, we implemented intuitive software for processing, transmitting, and displaying bio feedback data.},

abstract = {Distance perception by hitting with a holding stick is quite important for the people with visual impairments who daily use white cane. If the mechanism of this perception is well understood, it can be applied for the development of more intuitive and simple electric white cane consisting of a range sensor and a haptic display. A hypothetical mechanical model of a stick and a holding palm told us that hitting at a closer point should induce a stronger vibration at thumb side of the palm, and percussing a farther point should induce equally distributed vibrations in the palm. To verify if this vibration distribution plays role in the distance perception, we conducted an experiment that superimpose vibration to the real vibration while percussing, to change the center of gravity of vibration. The experimental results showed that adding vibration to the thumb side shortened the perceived collision distance than adding vibration to the little-finger side, which partly agrees with our hypothetical model.},

In the current investigation, we were interested in evaluating product performance using a less conventional methodological approach in order to explore specific product attributes and their predictive influence on satisfaction in the communications market. Customers completed an online survey regarding their experience with the iPad, and then provided emotion-based satisfaction ratings, as well as open- and closed-ended performance feedback. Several converging analyses reveal that negative product feedback predicted lower satisfaction scores, and furthermore, only the product attributes of reliability and navigation negatively predicted satisfaction.},

Local currency initiatives are increasingly popular, though due to certain practicalities are rarely successful in fostering long term and widespread change in spending behaviors.

In addition, the tools and technologies afforded to and used by more affluent individuals fail to meet the needs of this population.

abstract = {Fashion and beauty videos, particularly haul videos- those that summarize a recent shopping trip- have quickly grown into a YouTube phenomenon. Creators share the fashion and beauty products they buy and detail how they use them to create a look. Today, over 50 million people devote more than 1.6 billion minutes watching these videos. Despite the size of this online practice, little research exists investigating how this new content fits within the world of fashion media.This paper offers initial insights into the complex network of stakeholders and explores opportunity areas to develop products, services, or systems that support YouTube creators and consumers, retailers, and other media channels involved.},

abstract = {This work addresses the problem of reviewing complex access policies in an organizational context using two studies. In the first study, we explored the access review activity and identified its challenges using semi-structured interviews. Interviews revealed that access review involves challenges such as scale, technical complexity, the frequency of reviews, human errors, and exceptional cases. We also modeled access review in the activity theory framework. The model shows that access review requires an understanding of the activity context including information about the users, their job, and their access rights, and the history of them. We then used activity theory guidelines to design a new user interface named AuthzMap. We conducted a user study with 340 participants to compare the use of AuthzMap with two of the existing commercial systems for access review. The results show that AuthzMap improved the efficiency of access review in 5 of the 7 tested scenarios compared to the existing systems.},

We hypothesize that the more popular artists provide context for introducing new music by more obscure local artists. We also suggest that both the easy-to-use and serendipitous nature of the radio model are advantageous when designing a system to help individuals discover new music. Finally, we describe an interactive map that features personalized event recommendations based on the user's listening history. Results from a small-scale user study indicate that users are more aware of the local music scene after using it, discover relevant local music events, and would recommend the experience to others.},

It could cause important stress outside the "zone of comfort", when stereoscopic effect is too strong. This conflict has already been studied using questionnaires, during viewing sessions of several minutes. The present pilot study describes an experimental protocol which compares two different comfort conditions using electroencephalography (EEG) over short viewing sequences. Analyses showed significant differences both in event-related potentials (ERP) and in frequency bands power. An uncomfortable stereoscopy correlates with a weaker negative component and a delayed positive component in ERP. It also induces a power decrease in the alpha band and increases in theta and beta bands. With fast responses to stimuli, EEG is likely to enable the conception of adaptive systems, which could tune the stereoscopic experience according to each viewer.},

Second, how do Facebook and Twitter differ in their tendencies to promote unfavorable social comparisons? And third, what structural factors in each platform might explain differences? We find substantial evidence that, indeed, low well-being individuals are more vulnerable to unfavorable social comparisons in social media and that across the board, users are more prone to envy on Facebook than Twitter. Finally, we find suggestive evidence that greater references to the self on Facebook and a larger presence of public figures and organizations on Twitter help account for the difference.},

We anticipated that use of Facebook would be driven by desires to expand bridging social capital, whereas use of the home country site would be driven primarily by the desire to maintain existing bonds. A survey of 335 Chinese and Korean students in the U.S. showed that contrary to our expectations, desires to develop both bridging and bonding social ties were associated with greater intensity of activity on Facebook and the home country site. Greater intentions to interact with people from their own home country were associated with greater interaction on the home country site. Both intensity of site use and number of friends were higher for Korean than Chinese respondents. We conclude with some thoughts as to how our findings might be used to help people manage social relationships across two different sites in different countries.},

We have made novel design decisions involving persuasion and motivation due to our focus on previously established strong social ties. Pact allows individuals to set personally achievable goals, yet encourages both collaboration and competition by allowing friends to compare measurable progress and hold each other accountable.},

abstract = {Given the recent advancement of online social networking technologies, social question and answering has become an important venue for individuals to seek and share information. While studies have suggested the possibilities of routing questions to potential answerers for their help and the information provided, there is little analysis proposed to identify the characteristics that differentiate the possible responders from the nonresponders. In order to address such gap, in this work we present a model to predict potential responders in social Q&amp;A using only non-QA-based attributes. We build the classifier using features from two different aspects, including: features extracted from one's social profile and style of posting. To evaluate our model, we collect over 20,000 questions posted on Wenwo, a social Q&amp;A application based on Weibo, along with all their responders. Our experimental results over the collected dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of responder prediction based on non-QA features and proposed potential implications for system design.},

In particular, we investigated the attitude toward mobile services exploiting location sharing to promote offline social gatherings. We made in-depth interviews with nine working parents (five fathers and four mothers) with children aged 0-8. From a qualitative analysis, five themes emerged: the tension between extending and maintaining the social network; the importance of catching opportunities over planning; the difference between parents' and children's needs; the dynamicity of parents' needs; the different attitudes of mothers and fathers. Although preliminary, we believe that the findings presented here may contribute to the ongoing discussion about how technology may support family wellbeing.},

abstract = {Many of today's persuasive systems are designed taking into account cognitive biases to foster positive changes in people's behavior (e.g. adopt greener attitudes). However, these biases are also exploited to shape the users' behavior in a way that not necessarily benefit them (e.g. user retention in a website). Scholars addressed this problem by developing design guidelines and methods for ethics in persuasive computing, but these approaches alone have proved to be inefficient since they require every designer to be aware, understand, and comply with the recommended ethical practices. We propose preventive approaches that shall support higher compliance, as well as a remediation-based approach that does not require compliance from every designer. These approaches aim to help users understand persuasive elements embedded in systems, as well as to take more rational decisions when interacting with them. We expect that using preventive and remediation-based approaches will more effectively implement ethics in behavior design.},

To provide these inhabitants with better means to understand their home, as well as to increase their motivation to actively engage with its configuration, we propose Casalendar, a visualization that integrates the status of smart home technologies into the familiar interface of a calendar.

abstract = {Speech from intelligent "cognitive agents" can vary along a machine-to-human spectrum, from very machine-like to very human-like [3,4]. Effective interaction with such agents may depend on whether they are trusted by human users. This study investigated properties of machine-like speech along a machine-to-human spectrum in order to identify those associated with higher trust. We first examined whether flanging (time delay) and pitch contour could be used to map a machine-to-human speech spectrum. We found that lower pitch range and greater time delay generated more machine-like speech. Subsequently we examined perceived trust levels for different sounds along the spectrum. We found that human-speech had higher ratings of trust than machine-like speech. Finally, we used the behavioral TNO Trust Task (T3) to examine trust and compliance levels with cognitive agents speaking in different voices. The results confirmed that participants complied with and trusted agents with human speech more than agents with machine-like speech.},

abstract = {This work in progress describes AerialAR, a global positioning system (GPS) augmented reality (AR) application for mobile devices that automatically labels points of interest (POI) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery. This has important implications for assisting emergency responders. Existing AR applications for UAVs provide the pilot with navigational situational awareness such as terrain features; AerialAR locates and labels mission-relevant points such as schools that may need to be evacuated or hospitals to transport victims to. Locating POI in UAV imagery poses more challenges than those addressed by typical AR browsers on smartphones. The UAV operates at different altitudes as opposed to handheld devices and the UAV camera can tilt over a wide range of angles rather than simply facing forward. AerialAR overcomes these issues by developing a set of equations that translate UAV telemetry and field of view (fov) into a projection onto a Google Map. The map can then be queried for categories of POI. The current version calculates the POI distance and angles with an average error of 0.04% as compared to the Haversine and Rhumb line equations for the distance between the UAV location projected on the ground and the POI on the Google Map. Future work will complete AerialAR by processing UAV video in real-time on mobile devices.},

In order to understand user perceptions on this topic, we performed a preliminary survey, which found that users desired the ability to annotate, retroactively repair, and compare their data. Based on insights from this survey, we designed a direct-manipulation interface permitting the consolidated annotation and revision of activity data from multiple devices. A pilot study of this interface found that users understood readily how to use the features offered, and valued the ability to edit, yet preserve the provenance of their data.},

abstract = {Second-language learners are often unable to find time for language practice due to constraints in their daily lives. In this paper, we examine how brief moments of waiting during a person's existing social conversations can be leveraged for second language practice, even if the conversation is exchanged in the first language. We present an instant messaging (IM) prototype, WaitChatter, that supports the notion of wait-learning by displaying contextually relevant foreign language vocabulary and micro-quizzes while the user awaits a response from her conversant. The foreign translations are displayed just-in-time in the context of the conversation to promote incidental learning. In a preliminary study of WaitChatter, we found that participants were able to integrate second language learning into their existing instant messaging activities, and that a particularly opportune time to embed foreign language elements may be immediately after the learner sends a chat message.},

Teachers virtually communicate their assessment about the presented performance using a smart phone; students adapt the structure of their debate according to the visual feedback that is presented on a tablet. We tested our prototype in the field and applied it to two debates.

Additionally, users who first worked with the physical manipulatives and then the virtual environment scored higher on the final post-test compared to participants who completed the same activities in the reverse order.

In particular, entering text is often needed when interacting with computers but the watches' small size excludes common input techniques. In this paper we propose a text entry technique using a touch sensitive wristband. Using the wristband requires no screen space besides displaying the current character and might enable cheaper devices. In an experiment we compare a linear keyboard and a multitap keyboard layout. We show that users type faster and make fewer errors using multitap. We argue that the inexpensive sensors enable the integration in low cost wearable watches that require text entry occasionally.},

A target selection game was used in an empirical study to evaluate users' performance of direction-oriented movements by a thumb on a touch-screen mobile phone in single-handed interaction. The results revealed that single-handed swipe outperformed double tap in terms of speed and accuracy. In addition, angle intervals of thumb moving directions influenced thumb movement accuracy, although there was no significant difference in speed among targets presented with three intervals. Particularly, directions with a 36o interval resulted in the most error-prone task selection for swipe and double tap, and directions with a 45o interval were more error-prone than directions with a 60o interval. Finally, directions of thumb movement did not influence how quickly users could perform double tap or swipe in the areas that were comfortable for the thumb, but they had impact on the accuracy of the two operations. The findings of this study provide new insights for research on single-handed interaction and can be used as guidelines to optimize the design of direction-based applications and interfaces for touch-screen mobile phones.},

Users may become confused or surprised if there are inconsistencies between (a) the public information and UI, (b) the UI and the actual behavior, or (c) the public information and the actual behavior. For example, turning on the camera (actual behavior) when there is no button that says SNAP (UI) is a potentially confusing inconsistency. We present work-in-progress toward a methodology for automatically detecting inconsistencies in Android apps with respect to permissions and similarity. We report our preliminary results on a large corpus of 178,765 apps.},

abstract = {Many capacitive touch panels detect the position and contact area of the user finger, and can estimate the vertical force from the change in the contact area. However, they cannot detect and measure the tangential force. This research aims to enable the measurement of tangential force using a gel layer, which deforms when a tangential force is applied. By measuring the finger motion of the user, we can estimate tangential force from the gel spring ratio. Using this input method, any part of the touch panel surface becomes a joystick, or virtual objects can be modeled by deforming them with the fingers.},

A disparity exists between exercise accuracy and perceived ease of understanding when comparing the video with the interactive modality.

We propose two forms of acoustic degradation, one that adds white noise to the recording if the user's breathing deviates from the target rate, and another that reduces the number of channels in a multi-track recording. Validation on a small user study indicates that both techniques are equally effective at reducing respiration rates while performing a secondary task, though user feedback indicates that additive noise is a more intuitive form of sonification.},

To address this problem, we investigated the exercise needs of seniors and developed a prototype remote exercise system. Our system uses haptic feedback to simulate assistive pushing and pulling of limbs when exercising with a partner. We developed three distinct vibration metaphors -- constant push/pull, corrective feedback, and notification -- to convey engagement and connection between exercise partners. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of our system and our vibration metaphors to determine the validity of our design concepts. We contribute a set of lessons on the use of haptic feedback for remote group exercise.},

The workplace is a challenging scenario since the economic incentives are not present to increase energy awareness. To tackle some of these issues we have augmented a shared coffee-maker with eco-feedback to turn it into a green ally of the workers. Its design rationale is twofold: Firstly, to make the coffee-maker able to learn its own usage pattern. Secondly, to communicate persuasively and in real-time to users whether it is more efficient to leave the appliance on or off during certain periods of time along the workday. The goal is to explore a human-machine team towards energy efficiency and awareness, i.e. whether giving the initiative to users to decide how to operate the common appliances, but being assisted by them, is a better choice than automation or mere informative eco-feedback.},

The common method of inferring the underlying context is data collection through extensive sensor deployments and then deriving contextual ties between factors like occupancy and energy consumption. There is, therefore, a lack of studies that use first principle approaches like interviewing households to understand the major factors that influence energy consumption. In this work-in-progress paper, we present preliminary results from an interview-based study on households in low-income neighborhoods in Baltimore City. We show that there are several factors like house insulation, use of old appliances, and specific activities that influence energy consumption. Moreover, we have found that households in these neighborhoods are willing to volunteer their homes as testbeds for collecting contextual data and are primarily incentivized by reduction in their electricity bill.},

We believe that this design secures PIN entry, and allows users to easily remember and recognize the patterns. Moreover, it can be implemented on current off-the-shelf mobile devices. We designed two kinds of prototypes of VibraInput. The experiment shows that the mean failure rate is 4.0%; moreover, the system shows good security properties.},

We compared two in-person survey techniques, one in which the question about snooping behavior is posed directly, and one in which strong anonymity controls are employed. Results (n=90) reveal that, while in the first case 10% of respondents admitted to snooping, in the second the estimate was 60%. This shows that, although there is a potent social desirability bias at play, strong anonymity controls do improve estimates. Furthermore, it suggests an alarming prevalence of snooping behavior among the target population.},

Deletion criteria fell into six main categories that mostly involved subjective assessments such as whether a photo was sufficiently characteristic. We conclude that automatic tagging of photos for deletion is problematic; interfaces should instead make it easy for users to find and compare similar photos.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an aesthetic perspective to decompose interaction for its aesthetic components. Our approach is to collect both dancers' subjective descriptions and objective analysis on the same interactivity built under the guidance of an aesthetic experience of everyday lives. In order to get the descriptions, dancers' professional skills were utilized to create interactivity. Existed theories of aesthetic attributes and movement analysis method were utilized to analyze. Based on these works, we generated four aesthetic components that can impact the aesthetic experience. The research contribution is to get further understanding of the essence of aesthetic interaction and to offer interaction designers a reference to build aesthetic experience.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the primary decision problem in the smart TV UI design -- features selection. The conventional feature selection methods were not able to render what features are to be included in the new TV design, and this position paper introduced the "False Belief technique" to extract a users' schema of the novel features from smart TVs. We found that this technique could effectively examine the users' mental model of the smart TV services, in a rather unconscious way at the expense of extra training time. Also, it can quantify utility values of the features so that the designer can prioritize what features should be firstly considered in a novel product development.},

abstract = {Rating is a simple and easy way for people to explicitly express their preferences and opinions. This study investigated whether and how personality characteristics affect people's rating behaviors. We conducted a large-scale online survey and collected 1020 reliable users' responses on both a personality assessment inventory and their ratings for retail products. Our empirical results show that the traits of agreeableness, conscientiousness and neuroticism positively relate to the percentage of users' positive ratings. Emotionally stable individuals are likely to rate items from more categories than neurotics. The ratings from introverts and individuals who are high in emotional stability tend to have more diverse and evenly distributed ratings. The findings contribute to the HCI community by providing a new perspective of understanding human interaction behaviors, in particular to researchers and practitioners interested in user modeling and evaluation.},

abstract = {While we can rely on a wide variety of techniques and methods from human and social sciences to collect narratives within human-computer interaction, the knowledge about the specific characteristics of this source and their systematic use for user experience (UX) research is limited. In this paper we argue that it is crucial to pay more attention to the specifics of narrative textual data. Building on the approaches developed by the sociologists Sch\"{u}tze and Flick, we emphasize the need for developing a classification of textual data, in order to provide a theoretical foundation for narrative practices in UX research. In the following, we present four different text types for structuring textual data and their relevance regarding user experiences. This paper represents an initial step towards a more systematic and theory driven perspective on narratives, supporting a structured collection and analysis of textual data in UX research.},

abstract = {In this work, we address the question of how older adults may integrate information about the reliability of website information in their health-related searches. In two experiments, we compared three visual reliability indicator designs; an icon set, a simple graph and a textual list combined with website preview. Our results suggest that older adults can incorporate reliability indicators into their website judgments without significantly increasing decision time. The design of the visual indicators, however, significantly affects such ability.},
