abstract = {High performance concrete (HPC) is a mixture of cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, water and other ingredients. Modeling the compressive strength of HPC (or concrete strength) is a difficult task in building materials because it is influenced by the proportions of various ingredients within the HPC. Researchers have tried to confront this difficulty by modeling the strength of concrete using artificial neural networks (ANN). The influence of ingredients on concrete strength still remains unknown due to the "black box" nature of ANN. This paper investigates the influence of ingredients on concrete strength modeling using feature selection. A robust ANN-model using the knowledge from feature selection has been developed to predict the strength effectively. Experimental results have shown that the proposed model is efficient with respect to runtime and prediction.},

Lock-free FIFO queues are one of the most highly studied concurrent data structures. Elimination techniques have been used to improve the scalability of FIFO queues. In this paper, we study scalable lock-free FIFO queues using newer and more efficient elimination techniques. We propose four new heuristics to improves the scalability of the Lock-Free FIFO queues: Range Variation, Fixed Location, Load Adaptation and Double Array. Our empirical results shows these four heuristics perform better than existing algorithms in the literature.},

abstract = {Research abstracts are the 'information scents' which attract a novice researcher. To read through the entire research paper and to decide the suitability of the paper to one's research problem is a tough and abstract task. Many times, researchers do not know whether they are citing the relevant (but original?) research articles. It has been only a trial and error approach so far. To enable researchers to correctly target at the relevant and yet quality research literature, mechanisms to organise collections of research papers are essential. Though a considerable effort has been attempted earlier in this context, establishing research communities concentrated on citation based recommendations only. However, the quality and originality of research articles have not been taken into account until now. In this paper, we propose the evolution of research communities by analysing the research abstracts. We utilise Fuzzy Concept Map based approach in detecting the originality of scientific abstracts. By K-means clustering, we establish a research article hyper graph from the qualified abstracts. Later, we evolve the author clusters for every topic cluster and analyse them for redundancy. Further study on relevant bibliometrics helps us to identify a 'nucleus author' for every topic cluster.},

This work follows vision based techniques for recognition and identification of a vast range of non-overlapping body poses. The problem in body-posture identification is the inherent complexity of poses, like same pose can be present in a number of different scenarios or situations. Therefore it is inappropriate to guess the exact pose without identifying facial gestures, hand gestures and speech. Hence our approach is to identify the exact position of arms, head, shoulders and torso, so that, we can estimate the intensity of any pose and also identify possible emotion(s) under which this pose is expressed. The accuracy of this system is as good as 92%.},

abstract = {CellDesigner and Cytoscape are popularly used tools in systems biology studies for biological network construction. Plug-ins for these tools are also available which enable visualization of the microarray data in the context to the constructed biological networks. However, a major limitation for these tools is that they accept inputs only in a specified format and not in the format generated routinely by secondary data analysis pipeline for microarray data. Generating an input file in the format acceptable to CellDesigner and/or Cytoscape is a non-trivial task for biologists with very limited computation experience. Hence, we developed an easy to use tool, RobExT (Robust Expression parsing Tool), that empowers biologists with capabilities to select, cleanse and filter microarray data relevant to their biological networks constructed using CellDesigner/Cytoscape.Using RobExT, we extracted gene expression profile data for 100 genes constituting our biological network (could be used for any number of genes) from a normalized microarray dataset with more than 45000 gene probes. Input for RobExT was normalized microarray dataset, a text file listing 100 genes of our interest and appropriate p-value cut off (≤0.05). On processing, RobExT generated output files with expression profiles only for our genes of interest based on p-value cut off and in the format acceptable to CellDesigner and Cytoscape. Further, this data was overlaid on the biological network of 100 genes under consideration for easy visualization and analysis.We have developed an easy to use tool RobExT that takes normalized microarray data, and, based on user inputs, generates output files that can be easily imported into CellDesigner and Cytoscape for easy visualization and further biological interpretation.},

abstract = {With processor speeds stagnating, most organizations are investing in multi-cores processors and clusters, in order to scale out to meet the growing computing and data demands. Traditional applications are unable to utilize the full power of this infrastructure due to their sequential design and organizations are compelled to add more and more computing infrastructure to scale out the applications. The multiplying infrastructure comes with a heavy price tag and rising space, power and infrastructure management costs. This white paper demonstrates an approach using Microsoft High Performance Computing (HPC) Server to transparently help applications utilize the full capacity of its hardware resources. The main focus of this approach is to accelerate application throughput by enabling sequential applications to exploit the maximum performance that the underlying hardware can deliver. Simplicity and minimal changes are the key objectives of our solution and we call this a HPC Black-box approach. We also show how this can help lower infrastructure investments. We believe that this approach can be used to enable HPC for existing sequential applications using Microsoft Windows HPC Server.},

This hybrid system uses XSB Prolog for rule reasoning and Pellet for ontology reasoning.

abstract = {CPU Micro-architecture has a significant impact on performance and hence benchmarking micro-architectural performance is of utility to the High-Performance Computing industry. In lieu of conventional benchmarks, benchmarks that reflect the performance of micro-architectural features, independent of the application profile, are required. Memory hierarchy is an important part of the micro-architecture, having a major impact on performance. In order to make an application independent characterisation of the memory hierarchy, it is necessary to measure its important performance parameters, namely the penalty for a cache miss in different cache levels. The conventional program used for analysing the memory system does not provide direct and cycle-accurate measurements for all levels of the hierarchy. This work presents a novel method of benchmarking the cache. It uses a unique access pattern to generate a deterministic number of cache misses in every level and measures the access time. Using this method the access time for each cache level can be directly obtained. We describe the method in detail herein and discuss the results obtained for different micro-architecture variants. We check the results for consistency using statistics from numerous runs. We also check the results against those provided by the traditional method. Finally, we compare the estimated number of cache misses caused by our deterministic method with the actual number of misses, as measured by hardware performance counters.},

Thus, the experimenter needs to be able to redo the experiment. Several tools are dedicated to the control of the experiment input parameters and the experiment replay. In parallel concurrent and distributed systems, experiment conditions are not only restricted to the input parameters, but also to the software environment in which the experiment was carried out. It is therefore essential to be able to reconstruct this type of environment. The task can quickly become complex for experimenters, particularly on research platforms dedicated to scientific experimentation, where both hardware and software are in constant rapid evolution.

abstract = {A multi-tenant software as a service (SaaS) system has to meet the needs of several tenant organizations, which connect to the system to utilize its services. To leverage economies of scale through re-use, a SaaS vendor would, in general, like to drive commonality amongst the requirements across tenants. However, many tenants will also come with some custom requirements that may be a pre-requisite for them to adopt the SaaS system. These requirements then need to be addressed by evolving the SaaS system in a controlled manner, while still supporting the requirements of existing tenants. In this paper, we study the challenges associated with engineering multi-tenant SaaS systems and develop a framework to help evolve and validate such systems in a systematic manner. We adopt an intuitive formal model of services. We show that the proposed formalism is easily amenable to tenant requirement analysis and provides a systematic way to support multiple tenant on-boarding and diverse service management.},

abstract = {Batch jobs are the back bone of IT functionality in all industries. Typically these jobs are executed overnight, after "End of Day/Week/Month/Year" and perform business critical processing of huge amounts of data, to bring software systems up-to-date for the next day's business. Due to the huge processing requirements, batch systems have been traditionally implemented in legacy Mainframe environments. These systems are costly to develop and maintain, and require manpower skilled in what is fast becoming an obsolete platform. In this paper, I propose HiPERS Batch- a simple multi-server batch framework which: (i) is High in Performance -- can match the processing power of legacy batch systems, (ii) is Extensible - accommodates new batch business functionalities without code change, (iii) is Reliable -- recovers from failures and resumes processing from the correct point, and (iv) is Scalable -- easily handles growing volumes of business data by accommodating increasing number of servers in its configuration without performance degradation. HiPERS Batch exploits the data and task level parallelism inherent in batch functionality. A salient feature of HiPERS multi server batch framework is that the communication between the servers takes place solely through the database -- this does not impact performance as is commonly believed. As part of work done for a large Insurer, HiPERS Batch was implemented using Microsoft"s.NET framework 2.0 (HiPERS Batch.NET) with virtual servers of modest specifications (no more powerful than a modern day laptop) to replace a powerful legacy mainframe batch system; the results of this implementation, as shown in this paper, prove that HiPERS Batch is a viable framework for a modern batch system.},

abstract = {In Organization the data is very important that increase the volume of information that is available on the web and that leads to the design of efficient and accurate web data classification systems. In this paper, we define a framework to improve the performance of a base classifier, by clustering the unlabeled data with labeled data using clustering algorithm (training of samples) labeling of clusters (majority voting for each Hyperspheres) and final generated classified data. We have used construction of BNN based semi-supervised classifier while training and testing of the classifier is performed. We have studied and customized a supervised classification algorithm to form out semi-supervised classification that leads to design a multiclass semi-supervised classifier using geometrical expansion. The experimental result shows provision for the classifier designer followed by training and testing medical disease dataset using pre-decided samples. Our classification model consists of training phase that covers two process clustering and labeling to perform classification task of medical data and the binary neural network is trained. In this we used two techniques normalization and quantization for pre-processing the datasets. Pre-processing impart various outcomes after applying the classification model like number of hypersphere, confusing samples that cannot be learned, training time and label of hypersphere. Comparison has been done for implementation and design of Binary Neural Network Classifier Algorithm with the other existing traditional algorithms. Our classifier evaluates performance in terms of generalization, number of hidden neuron and accuracy etc. The BNN-CA construct three-layered binary neural network (BNN) and can solve any semi-labeled multi-class problem.},
