abstract = {In this paper, we propose the development of entity retrieval models that are temporally-aware. Using a classification scheme of entity-oriented information needs proposed in prior work, we discuss how the addition of temporal expressions would affect retrieval results for each of these query types. We describe the design of a retrieval framework that is capable of catering for a range of these information needs and identify main challenges at the component level.},

abstract = {A system performing sentiment analysis needs some prior knowledge which can be acquired, for example, by manual annotation only or by expanding a human-annotated sentiment lexicon by automatic means. However, users are seldom interested in all sentimental aspects at once, but rather look for opinion changes of some person ("Who") during some time period ("When") and depending upon "What", "Where" or "Why" something happened. The paper describes the work necessary to obtain and utilize such 5W annotations.},

abstract = {The mobility era has highlighted the importance of information providers to better understand the needs of the information seekers, even when the user interaction becomes less verbose. This is even more important in contexts like health care, where an understanding of the users' language and intentions is critical to provide accurate health information. To study the used language we utilize an annotation-based method to analyze if the seekers' language deviates from the health care professionals', and the one found in medical terminologies and information sources. By an analysis of the use of a major public Swedish health information portal we present, in our opinion, a surprising overlap in the language used by laymen and professionals, thereby supporting the use of terminology-based annotation to facilitate improved information retrieval in this setting.},

abstract = {Examining past query reformulations of users in the logs of a search engine shows that not only query rewriting that precises the focus of a query but also queries expressing some topical shift from the original query can help users in their search activities. We examine three methods to explore query rewriting patterns, namely co-click based, co-topic based and co-session based methods. Each method has its own semantic characteristic: the co-click based and the co-topic based methods typically exploit specialization patterns with different granularity whereas the co-session based method is able to extract topic shift patterns. We show the different semantic relations of extracted query pairs by using large scale web annotations for Japanese web pages.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe our goals in introducing a new, annotated benchmark collection, with which we aim to bridge the gap between the fundamentally different aspects that are involved in querying both structured and unstructured data. This semantically rich collection, captured in a unified XML format, combines components (unstructured text, semistructured infoboxes, and category structure) from 3.1 Million Wikipedia articles with highly structured RDF properties from both DBpedia and YAGO2. The new collection serves as the basis of the INEX 2012 Ad-hoc, Faceted Search, and Jeopardy retrieval tasks. With a focus on the new Jeopardy task, we particularly motivate the usage of the collection for question-answering (QA) style retrieval settings, which we also exemplify by introducing a set of 90 QA-style benchmark queries which come shipped in a SPARQL-based query format that has been extended by fulltext filter conditions.},

abstract = {This paper describes exploitation of semantic annotations in the design and architecture of MIaS (Math Indexer and Searcher) system for mathematics retrieval. Basing on the claim that navigational and research search are `killer' applications for digital library such as the European Digital Mathematics Library, EuDML, we argue for an approach based on Natural Language Processing techniques as used in corpus management systems such as the Sketch Engine, that will reach web scalability and avoid inference problems. The main ideas are 1) to augment surface texts (including math formulae) with additional linked representations bearing semantic information (expanded formulae as text, canonicalized text and subformulae) for indexing, including support for indexing structural information (expressed as Content MathML or other tree structures) and 2) use semantic user preferences to order found documents.The semantic enhancements of the MIaS system are being implemented as a math-aware search engine based on the state-of-the-art system Apache Lucene, with support for [MathML] tree indexing. Scalability issues have been checked against more than 400,000 arXiv documents.},
