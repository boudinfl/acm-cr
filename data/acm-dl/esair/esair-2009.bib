abstract = {Within most domains of discourse, there exists different terminology used by distinct sub-groups. Often the terms used can be, or have already been, organised into controlled vocabularies which can be encoded into SKOS, a W3C standard for representing vocabularies. This terminology can then be used to help users to search for and discover resources. This requires a search mechanism to go from a user-supplied string to a vocabulary concept.In this paper, we discuss the issues encountered in developing a web service for searching and exploring the concepts in SKOS encoded astronomical vocabularies. Our prototype service takes in a query and responds with the concepts which are the "best match". It then supports the user in exploring the concepts' formal definition and alternative forms, as well as their relationship to other concepts. When we add mappings between the concepts in different vocabularies (where available), these further enrich the explorations of vocabulary concepts.},

abstract = {Ontologies are frequently used in information retrieval being their main applications the expansion of queries, semantic indexing of documents and the organization of search results. However, the optimization of an ontology to perform information retrieval tasks is still unclear. In this paper, we propose an ontology query model to analyze the usefulness of ontologies in effectively performing document searches. Moreover, we propose a series of heuristic techniques that optimize ontologies for information retrieval tasks. Preliminary results demonstrate that current domain ontologies provide enough information to support user requests and that ontologies might be improved with simple methods.},

abstract = {With the advent of various services and applications of Semantic Web, semantic annotation had emerged as an important research area. The use of semantically annotated ontology had been evident in numerous information processing and retrieval tasks. One of such tasks is utilizing the semantically annotated ontology in product design which is able to suggest many important applications that are critical to aid various design related tasks. However, ontology development in design engineering remains a time consuming and tedious task that demands tremendous human efforts. In the context of product family design, management of different product information that features efficient indexing, update, navigation, search and retrieval across product families is both desirable and challenging. This paper attempts to address this issue by proposing an information management and retrieval framework based on the semantically annotated product family ontology. Particularly, we propose a document profile (DP) model to suggest semantic tags for annotation purpose. Using a case study of digital camera families, we illustrate how the faceted search and retrieval of product information can be accomplished based on the semantically annotated camera family ontology. Lastly, we briefly discuss some further research and application in design decision support, e.g. commonality and variety, based on the semantically annotated product family ontology.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider the problem of item recommendation in collaborative tagging communities, so called folksonomies, where users annotate interesting items with tags. Rather than following a collaborative filtering or annotation-based approach to recommendation, we extend the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) approach and present a unified recommendation model which evolves from item user and item tag co-occurrences in parallel. The inclusion of tags reduces known collaborative filtering problems related to overfitting and allows for higher quality recommendations. Experimental results on a large snapshot of the delicious bookmarking service show the scalability of our approach and an improved recommendation quality compared to two-mode collaborative or annotation based methods.},

Experimental results of different approaches on TREC'04 Novelty Track show that our new combined method outperforms some other novelty detection methods in terms of precision and recall.

Annotations can be used for query-independent ranking of both the annotations and the original recorded video footage (or documents) which has been annotated, based on the social interactions of a community of users. We present two algorithms, AuthorRank and MessageRank, designed to take advantage of these interactions so as to provide a means of ranking documents by their social impact.},

abstract = {Meeting notes are documents which contain lots of structure. This structure is often implicit in layout and reserved words. On the other hand, since meetings tend to occur regularly and are repeated for long periods of time, this structure is often (semi-)formalized. This makes these documents suitable for automatic semantic annotation efforts.We describe the annotation we performed on the notes of more than 20 years of Dutch parliamentary debates. We annotated every word spoken in parliament with 1) the speaker, 2) her party at the time of speaking, 3) her role/function in parliament and 4) the iso-date. These annotations yield numerous new ways of searching, browsing, mining and summarizing these documents.Meetings are always too long, whence so are their verbatim notes. But of course they contain valuable information and notes have to be consulted from time to time. In this paper we show that semantic annotation can make finding things easier, and more fun.},
