abstract = {Semantic search refers to a broad array of methods that aim to improve retrieval by interpreting queries beyond the traditional weighted bag of words model of document retrieval. In this talk, we will focus on the subset of these methods that rely on explicit semantic annotations, i.e. linking queries and text to items in a Knowledge Base. We will discuss techniques of entity linking on queries and documents, and the potential impact of these methods on improving performance on the classical ad-hoc document retrieval task. We will also discuss some novel tasks, including entity retrieval and related entity recommendations, and their implementation in Yahoo Search. We will close by considering some of the challenges that are specific to developing search services in a mobile context.},

abstract = {Current Information Retrieval systems generally search documents using a keywords model, which is often not expressive enough for the user. In this paper we describe some directions for improving an Information Retrieval system by letting the user specify different semantics constraints in her query, using a language based on a simplified version of first-order logic. The user can write queries that express the association between objects and attributes, temporal constraints and negation of attributes, and also perform synonyms expansion of queries. In order to evaluate the relevance of a candidate document with respect to the query, the dependency parse tree of the document is used, as well as other linguistic resources. The system was evaluated using a set of queries and a corpus extracted from the British newspaper The Times. The results are compared against the newspaper's own search engine and they look promising, showing an important improvement in precision in the first documents returned by the query.},

abstract = {The use of external means to annotate corpora to assist in retrieval is gaining research attention. These external means include user provided annotations, use of linkages between documents (eg. the web), use of knowledge bases such as wikipedia, etc. However, for corpora that are internally generated within an enterprise, most of these methods are not readily applicable.In this work, we ask the question whether we can extract important terms from the corpora (without recourse to any external assistance), and then use these terms as a form of "self-annotation" to assist retrieval?Our approach is as follows: we extract "important terms" from the corpora using clustering and information-theoretic means. We then use these terms as "self-annotation" of the corpus. Specifically, we augment BM25 with two scores that measure the information-gain of important terms with respect to their corresponding cluster. The first score uses all the important terms in the cluster, regardless of whether they appear in the query or not. The second score uses only those terms that appear in the query.We experiment extensively with convex combinations of these two scores with BM25 on TREC corpora. To reflect other literature in clustering in IR, we benchmark both static clustering and query-specific clustering. Our results establish a clear pattern on the effect of including information gain upon precision of retrieved lists. Our conclusions are that while neither information-gain based score improves the retrieval precision over baseline BM25, the precision is better when all terms (not just query terms) are considered.},

abstract = {Ticket annotation and search has become an important research subject in the IT service desk delivery. Millions of tickets are created yearly to address business users' IT related problems. In IT service desk management, it is critical to first capture the pain points for a group of tickets to determine root cause; secondly, to obtain the respective distributions in order to layout the priority of addressing these pain points. An advanced ticket analytics system utilizes a combination of topic modeling and clustering to address the above issues and the integration of these features into information architecture will allow for a wider distribution of this technology and progress to a remarkable financial impact for IT industry. Topic modeling has been used to extract topics from given documents; each topic is represented by unigram distributions. However, it is not clear how to interpret the results. Due to the inadequacy to render top concepts, in this paper, we propose a probabilistic framework, which integrates topic models, POS tags, query expansion and so on, for the practical challenge. The rigorously empirical experiments demonstrate the consistent and utility performance of the proposed method on real datasets.},

abstract = {Concepts have been used extensively in semantic annotating. Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA) is a concept feature generator, which represents text by a concept-level vector, such as a vector of Wikipedia concepts. It is also considered a human-friendly way to annotate text - it generates concept vector that can be easily interpreted by human. We propose an approach, RescoredESA, based on ESA, according to aspects upon which ESA can enhance: 1) sometimes the output vectors do not assign high scores to concepts relevant to the text; 2) it considers words in the text when representing the text to concept-level vector while not considering the concepts explicitly occurring in the text, which can be an important source for assigning scores to ESA vector dimensions. We evaluate it against the 20 newsgroup classification task, and the result shows a slight enhancement when combining vectors from RescoredESA and bag-of-words.},

abstract = {Most question answering systems feature a step to predict an expected answer type given a question. Li and Roth cite{li2002learning} proposed an oft-cited taxonomy to the categorize the answer types as well as an annotated data set. While offering a framework compatible with supervised learning, this method builds on a fixed and rigid model that has to be updated when the question-answering domain changes. More recently, Pinchak and Lin cite{pinchak2006} designed a dynamic method using a syntactic model of the answers that proved more versatile. They used syntactic dependencies to model the question context and evaluated the performance on an English corpus. However, syntactic properties may vary across languages and techniques applicable to English may fail with other languages. In this paper, we present a method for constructing a probability-based answer type model for each different question. We adapted and reproduced the original experiment of Pinchak and Lin cite{pinchak2006} on a Chinese corpus and we extended their model to semantic dependencies. Our model evaluates the probability that a candidate answer fits into the semantic context of a given question. We carried out an evaluation on a set of questions either drawn from NTCIR corpus cite{ntcir2005} or that we created manually.},

abstract = {Literatures in medical domain are often annotated with subject headings by professionals to help information seeking via manifesting the subjects of documents, where subject headings serve as the pivot language between documents and users. Current information retrieval methods using subject headings have not fully exploited the potential of subject headings yet. Both positive and negative results have been reported. In this paper, we explored the three-layer structure of documents annotated with subject headings, including document layer, concept layer (i.e. subject headings) and term layer, and then we proposed a concept-enhanced relevance model. The document-concept associations are mined to generate conceptual representations for documents and the concept-term associations are quantified and used to represent concepts as language models. By embedding these associations, subject headings are applied to enrich the document models in the estimation process of relevance model. The experiments carried out on two medical collections showed the improvements of our model by comparing with three state-of-the-art baselines. Therefore, if exploited appropriately, such manually curated annotations as subject headings can become an effective tool to enhance information retrieval.},

In this work we especially look at the impact of entity linking on search logs. Search queries follow a Zipfian distribution wherein other than few popular queries (head queries), a significant percentage of queries (tail queries) occur rarely. Given a search log, there is sufficient data to analyze head queries but insufficient data (low frequency, limited clicks) to draw any conclusions about tail queries. In this work we focus on quantifying the extent of overlap between long tail and head queries by means of entity linking. We specifically analyze the frequency distribution of entities in head and tail queries. Our analysis shows that by means of entity linking, we can indeed bridge the gap between the head and tail.},

In this position paper, we reflect on the need to incorporate semantic inference into retrieval (in particular for medical information retrieval) as well as previous attempts that have been made so far with mixed success. Medical information retrieval is a fertile ground for testing inference mechanisms to augment retrieval. The medical domain offers a plethora of carefully curated, structured, semantic resources, along with well established entity extraction and linking tools, and search topics that intuitively require a number of different inferential processes (e.g., conceptual similarity, conceptual implication, etc.). We argue that integrating semantic inference in information retrieval has the potential to uncover a large amount of information that otherwise would be inaccessible; but inference is also risky and, if not used cautiously, can harm retrieval.},
