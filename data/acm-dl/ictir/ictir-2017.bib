abstract = {In competitive search settings such as the Web, authors of documents may have an incentive to have their documents highly ranked for certain queries. This can drive corpus dynamics as documents may be manipulated in response to induced rankings (e.g., by applying search engine optimization). Such post-ranking corpus effects are not directly modeled in ad hoc retrieval models and, more generally, are not accounted for by the formal foundations of retrieval paradigms. In this talk I will discuss how (algorithmic) game theory can be used to analyze some aspects of the competitive search setting. I will first discuss the probability ranking principle (PRP) [3] which is the theoretical underpinning of most ad hoc retrieval methods. As it turns out, the PRP is sub-optimal in competitive settings [1]. In addition, I will discuss some initial theoretical and empirical results regarding the strategic behavior of document authors in competitive retrieval settings, specifically with respect to the foundations of classical ad hoc retrieval models [2]. I will then discuss future directions.},

abstract = {Entity retrieval is the task of finding entities such as people or products in response to a query, based solely on the textual documents they are associated with. Recent semantic entity retrieval algorithms represent queries and experts in finite-dimensional vector spaces, where both are constructed from text sequences. We investigate entity vector spaces and the degree to which they capture structural regularities. Such vector spaces are constructed in an unsupervised manner without explicit information about structural aspects. For concreteness, we address these questions for a specific type of entity: experts in the context of expert finding. We discover how clusterings of experts correspond to committees in organizations, the ability of expert representations to encode the co-author graph, and the degree to which they encode academic rank. We compare latent, continuous representations created using methods based on distributional semantics (LSI), topic models (LDA) and neural networks (word2vec, doc2vec, SERT). Vector spaces created using neural methods, such as doc2vec and SERT, systematically perform better at clustering than LSI, LDA and word2vec. When it comes to encoding entity relations, SERT performs best.},

Questions of this kind have ample applications, for instance, to educate users about or to evaluate their knowledge in a specific domain. To solve the problem, we propose a novel end-to-end approach. The approach first selects a named entity from the knowledge graph as an answer. It then generates a structured triple-pattern query, which yields the answer as its sole result. If a multiple-choice question is desired, the approach selects alternative answer options as distractors. Finally, our approach uses a template-based method to verbalize the structured query and yield a natural language question. A key challenge is estimating how difficult the generated question is to human users. To do this, we make use of historical data from the Jeopardy! quiz show and a semantically annotated Web-scale document collection, engineer suitable features, and train a logistic regression classifier to predict question difficulty. Experiments demonstrate the viability of our overall approach.},

The experimental evaluation carried out on two TREC datasets from TREC Terabyte and TREC CDS tracks relying respectively on WordNet and MeSH resources, indicates that our model outperforms state-of-the-art semantic and deep neural IR models.},

abstract = {Today, the practice of returning entities from a knowledge base in response to search queries has become widespread. One of the distinctive characteristics of entities is that they are typed, i.e., assigned to some hierarchically organized type system (type taxonomy). The primary objective of this paper is to gain a better understanding of how entity type information can be utilized in entity retrieval. We perform this investigation in an idealized "oracle" setting, assuming that we know the distribution of target types of the relevant entities for a given query. We perform a thorough analysis of three main aspects: (i) the choice of type taxonomy, (ii) the representation of hierarchical type information, and (iii) the combination of type-based and term-based similarity in the retrieval model. Using a standard entity search test collection based on DBpedia, we find that type information proves most useful when using large type taxonomies that provide very specific types. We provide further insights on the extensional coverage of entities and on the utility of target types.},

abstract = {It is well known that query formulation could affect retrieval performance. Empirical observations suggested that a query may contain extraneous terms that could harm the retrieval effectiveness. This is true for both verbose and title queries. Given a query, it is possible that using its subqueries can generate more satisfying search results than using the original query. Although previous studies proposed method to reduce verbose queries, it remains unclear how we could reduce title queries given the short length of the title queries. In this paper, we focus on identifying the best performed subqueries for a given query. In particular, we formulate this problem as a ranking problem, where the goal is to rank subqueries of the query based on its predicted retrieval performance. To tackle this problem, we propose a set of novel post-retrieval features that can better capture relationships among query terms, and apply a learning-to-rank algorithm based on these features. Empirical results over TREC collections show that these new features are indeed useful in identifying the best subqueries.},

abstract = {Query logs are valuable resources for Information Retrieval (IR) research. However, the huge concern about user privacy has become an obstacle preventing data from being released and interfering with the advance of IR. It is understandable but still quite disappointing. Recent privacy research has begun to address the problem by anonymizing queries in query logs. In that, each query and its associated user actions are treated as one block for anonymization; each block is independent from each other. It might be sufficient to support ad-hoc retrieval that handles queries independently but will be not adequate for more complex IR tasks that require the knowledge of query sequences. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by keeping session information in differentially privately anonymized logs so that an anonymized log is able to support IR tasks, such as query suggestion and session search, that need query sequence information as well. We also provide analysis on how to achieve a proper balance between privacy and search utility.},

We find that graph-based semi-supervised learning outperforms bag-of-words semi-supervised learning but not bag-of-words supervised learning in 20-class text categorization. A large asset of graph-based representations is that they are flexible in the types of nodes and relations that are included.},

We found that the most popular set-based measures, i.e. precision, recall, and F-measure are interval-based. In the case of rank-based measures, using a strongly top-heavy ordering, we found that only RBP with p = 1/2 is on an interval scale while RBP for other p values, AP, DCG, and ERR are not. Moreover, using a weakly top-heavy ordering, we found that none of RBP, AP, DCG, and ERR is on an interval scale.},

This issue has gained even more importance recently in light of crowdsourced relevance judgments, where it is customary to gather many relevance labels for each topic-document pair. In a crowdsourcing setting, agreement is often even used as a proxy for quality, although without any systematic verification of the conjecture that higher agreement corresponds to higher quality. In this paper we address this issue and we study in particular: the effect of topic on assessor agreement; the relationship between assessor agreement and judgment quality; the effect of agreement on ranking systems according to their effectiveness; and the definition of an agreement-aware effectiveness metric that does not discard information about multiple judgments for the same document as it typically happens in a crowdsourcing setting.},

abstract = {Cascade measures like alpha-nDCG, ERR-IA, and NRBP take into account novelty and diversity of query results and are computed using judgments provided by humans, which are costly to collect. These measures expect that all documents in the result list of a query are judged and cannot make use of judgments beyond the assigned labels. Existing work has demonstrated that condensing the query results by taking out documents without judgment can address this problem to some extent. However, how highly incomplete judgments can affect cascade measures and how to cope with such incompleteness have not been addressed yet. In this paper, we propose an approach which mitigates incomplete judgments by leveraging the content of documents relevant to the query's subtopics. These language models are estimated at each rank taking into account the document and the upper ranked ones. Then, our method determines gain values based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the language models. Experiments on the diversity tasks of the TREC Web Track 2009--2012 show that with only 15% of the judgments our method accurately reconstructs the original rankings determined by the established cascade measures.},

Whereas technology is in place for filtering information according to relevance and/or credibility, no single measure currently exists for evaluating the accuracy or precision (and more generally effectiveness) of both the relevance and the credibility of retrieved results. One obvious way of doing so is to measure relevance and credibility effectiveness separately, and then consolidate the two measures into one. There at least two problems with such an approach: (I) it is not certain that the same criteria are applied to the evaluation of both relevance and credibility (and applying different criteria introduces bias to the evaluation); (II) many more and richer measures exist for assessing relevance effectiveness than for assessing credibility effectiveness (hence risking further bias). Motivated by the above, we present two novel types of evaluation measures that are designed to measure the effectiveness of both relevance and credibility in ranked lists of retrieval results. Experimental evaluation on a small human-annotated dataset (that we make freely available to the research community) shows that our measures are expressive and intuitive in their interpretation.},

Due to the importance of the issue in shaping future research directions and evaluation strategies in search results diversification, in this work, we first aim to reproduce the findings reported in the previous study, and then investigate its possible limitations. Our extensive experiments first reveal that under the same experimental setting with that previous study, we can reach similar results. Next, we hypothesize that for stronger baselines, tuning the parameters of some methods (i.e., the trade-off parameter between the relevance and diversity of the results in this particular scenario) should be done in a more fine-grained manner. With trade-off parameters that are specifically determined for each baseline run, we show that the percentage of significant improvements even over the strong baselines can be doubled. As a further issue, we discuss the possible impact of using the same strong baseline retrieval function for the diversity computations of the methods. Our takeaway message is that in the case of a strong baseline, it is more crucial to tune the parameters of the diversification methods to be evaluated; but once this is done, additivity is achievable.},

Experiments on four benchmark TREC collections for ad hoc retrieval showed that LIT-based methods achieved superior performances compared to classic TF*IDF and BM25, especially for verbose queries and hard search topics. The least information theory is a method for entropy-based information measurement and offers a novel approach for IR modeling.},

abstract = {There is an emerging consensus that time is an important indicator of relevance for searching streams of social media posts. In a process similar to pseudo-relevance feedback, the distribution of document timestamps from the results of an initial query can be leveraged to infer the distribution of relevant documents, for example, using kernel density estimation. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to mining relevance signals directly from the temporal statistics of query terms in the collection, without the need to perform an initial retrieval. We propose two approaches: a linear ranking model that combines features derived from temporal collection statistics of query terms and a regression-based method that attempts to directly predict the distribution of relevant documents from query term statistics. Experiments on standard tweet test collections show that our proposed methods significantly outperform competitive baselines. Furthermore, studies of different feature combinations show the extent to which different types of temporal signals impact retrieval effectiveness.},

abstract = {A growing body of research focuses on computationally detecting controversial topics and understanding the stances people hold on them. Yet gaps remain in our theoretical and practical understanding of how to define controversy, how it manifests, and how to measure it. Since controversy is a complicated social phenomenon, it is difficult to understand what elements make up the controversy. Previous work has attempted to capture controversy algorithmically by studying cues for disagreement and polarity between different stance groups. However, we still lack a systematic understanding of how controversy should be defined and measured. In this paper, we propose a multi-dimensional model of controversy. Specifically, we introduce a model with two minimal dimensions: contention and importance. Our model departs from existing work by viewing controversy as a trait rooted in population. It suggests that controversy should be separately observed in a given population, rather than held as a fixed universal quantity. We model contention and importance within a population from a mathematical standpoint. To validate and evaluate the soundness of our theoretical model, we instantiate the model to algorithms for a diverse set of sources: polling, Twitter, and Wikipedia. We demonstrate that our controversy model holds an explanatory power for observed phenomena but also a predictive power for tasks, such as identifying controversial Wikipedia articles.},

We define a joint objective function to enforce the latent representation of social relationships in the Autoencoder's hidden layer to be as close as possible to the users' latent representation when factorizing the user-item matrix. We formulate a joint objective function as a minimization problem to learn both user preferences and friends' social influence and we present an optimization algorithm to solve the joint minimization problem.

abstract = {Video sharing platforms are one of the most popular and engaging platforms on the Internet today. Despite the increasing levels of user activity on these video platforms, current research on digital platforms have largely focused on social media and networking websites like Facebook and Twitter. We depart from previous work that have focused primarily on user demands (i.e. activity of viewers), and instead focus our attention to the supply-side activities on the platform (i.e. activity of video uploaders). We perform a large-scale empirical study by leveraging longitudinal video upload data from a major online video platform, demonstrating (i) heterogeneity of video types (e.g. presence of popular vs. niche genres), and (ii) inherent seasonality effects associated with video uploads. Through our analyses, we uncover a set of informative genre-clusters and estimate a self-exciting Hawkes point-process model on each of these clusters, to fully specify and estimate the video upload process. Additionally, we disentangle potential factors that govern user engagement and determine the video upload rates, which help supplement our analysis with additional explanatory power. Our results emphasize that using a parsimonious and relatively simple point-process model, we were able to obtain a high model fit, as well as perform prediction of video upload volumes with a higher accuracy than a number of competing models. The findings from this study can benefit platform owners in better understanding how their supply-side users engage with their site over time. We also offer a robust method for performing media upload prediction that is likely to be generalizable across media platforms which demonstrate similar temporal and genre-level heterogeneity.},

Because of the ubiquitous nature of mobile personal assistants, they have a broad range of potential capabilities. One of these potential capabilities is to carry out sophisticated tasks for supporting failing memories. Such support of human memory has been thus far limited, merely to setting reminders and calendar events.In this paper, we present our work on developing a cutting-edge personal assistant for supporting failing memories in every day social interactions. Specifically, we envision a personal assistant that can anticipate the parts of a past conversation that you are likely to forget, hence remind you about them.

In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the impact of several components of a prototypical dynamic search system on the effectiveness of the entire system. Through a series of simulations, we discuss the impact of: producing an initial ranking of candidate documents, modeling the possible aspects underlying the user's query given his or her feedback, leveraging the modeled aspects to improve the initial ranking, and deciding when to stop the interactive process. Our results using data from the TREC 2015-2016 Dynamic Domain track shed light on these components and provide directions for the design of effective dynamic search systems for specialized domains.},

abstract = {Session search is a complex Information Retrieval (IR) task. As a result, its evaluation is also complex. A great number of factors need to be considered in the evaluation of session search. They include document relevance, document novelty, aspect-related novelty discounting, and user's efforts in examining the documents. Due to increased complexity, most existing session search evaluation metrics are NP-hard. Consequently, the optimal value, i.e. the upper bound, of a metric highly varies with the actual search topics. In Cranfield-like settings such as the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC), scores for systems are usually averaged across all search topics. With undetermined upper bound values, however, it could be unfair to compare IR systems across different topics. This paper addresses the problem by investigating the actual per topic upper bounds of existing session search metrics. Through decomposing the metrics, we derive the upper bounds via mathematical optimization. We show that after being normalized by the bounds, the NP-hard session search metrics are then able to provide robust comparison across various search topics. The new normalized metrics are experimented on official runs submitted to the TREC 2016 Dynamic Domain (DD) Track.},

In this paper, we propose a general formal framework for evaluating IR systems based on search session simulation that can be used to perform reproducible experiments for evaluating any IR system, including interactive systems and systems with sophisticated interfaces. We show that the traditional Cranfield evaluation method can be regarded as a special instantiation of the proposed framework where the simulated search session is a user sequentially browsing the presented search results. By examining a number of existing evaluation metrics in the proposed framework, we reveal the exact assumptions they have made implicitly about the simulated users and discuss possible ways to improve these metrics. We further show that the proposed framework enables us to evaluate a set of tag-based search interfaces, a generalization of faceted browsing interfaces, producing results consistent with real user experiments and revealing interesting findings about effectiveness of the interfaces for different types of users.},

If people are influenced by the incorrect information found in search results, they can make harmful decisions about the appropriate treatment. To determine the extent to which people can be influenced by search engine results, we conducted a controlled laboratory study that biased search results towards correct or incorrect information for 10 different medical treatments. We found that search engine results can significantly influence people both positively and negatively. Importantly, study participants made more incorrect decisions when they interacted with search results biased towards incorrect information than when they had no interaction with search results at all. For search domains such as health information, search engine designers and researchers must recognize that not all non-relevant information is the same. Some non-relevant information is incorrect and potentially harmful when people use it to make decisions that may negatively impact their lives.},

abstract = {As data in many disciplines continues to grow at a frantic pace, a more heterogeneous set of information sources both can and need to be connected in innovative ways to improve information search and recommendation systems. Using information retrieval (IR) as an example, classical search techniques are based on limited information, including query terms, the content of documents, and basic user characteristics. However, recent studies have started to investigate additional information resources, including semantic web data, knowledge graphs, linguistic features, user email account content, social networks, user behavior, the search context, and other sources. Intuitively, a heterogeneous graph integrating all these information sources could enhance search performance. However, the complexity of such graphs challenge most existing graph mining algorithms. In this study, we propose a novel approach for a personalized random walk over a complex heterogeneous graph; which we refer to as Personalized Graph Navigation (PGN). Unlike earlier expert-guided random walk approaches, by using an EM framework, PGN estimates the personalized usefulness probability distribution for each edge type (the latent variable), which can be used as a random walk navigation profile for a user on a heterogeneous graph. While PGN can cope with information retrieval/recommendation problems at a low cost, this method also transforms a complex heterogeneous graph into a homogeneous graph, allowing existing homogeneous graph mining algorithms to be applied to a heterogeneous graph.},

In this work, we propose an extension of the Word Mover's Distance for compositional documents consisting of ranked sub-documents. In particular, we derive a Position-sensitive Word Mover's Distance, which allows to retrieve compositional documents based on the semantic properties of their sub-documents. Additionally, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for this task, to facilitate other researchers to work on this relevant problem. The results obtained on the novel dataset and on the well-known MovieLense dataset indicate that our approach is well suited for retrieving compositional documents. We conclude that incorporating semantic relations between words and sensitivity to the position and presentation bias is crucial for effective retrieval of such documents.},

The result is a search engine that scales elastically with a pay-per-request model, in contrast to a server-based model that requires paying for running instances even if there are no requests. We empirically assess the performance and economics of our serverless architecture. While our implementation is currently too slow for interactive searching, analysis shows that the pay-per-request model is economically compelling, and future infrastructure improvements will increase the attractiveness of serverless designs over time.},

abstract = {Models in Interactive Information Retrieval (IIR) are grounded very much on the user's task in order to give system support based on different task types and topics. However, the automatic recognition of user interests from log data in search systems is not trivial. Search queries entered by users a surely one such source. However, queries may be short, or users are only browsing. In this paper, we propose a method of term-mouse-fixations which takes the fixations on terms users are hovering over with the mouse into consideration to estimate topical user interests. We analyzed 22,259 search sessions of a domain-specific digital library over a period of about four months. We compared these mouse fixations to user-entered search terms and to titles and keywords from documents the user showed an interest in. These terms were found in 87.12% of all analyzed sessions; in this subset of sessions, per session on average 11.46 term-mouse-fixations from queries and viewed documents were found. These terms were fixated significantly longer with about 7 seconds than other terms with about 4.4 seconds. This means, term-mouse-fixations provide indicators for topical user interests and it is possible to extract them based on fixation time.},

Our starting point is that users derive either positive utility (i.e., "gain") or negative utility (i.e., "pain") from consuming system updates. By separately keeping track of these quantities, we can measure system effectiveness in a gain vs. pain tradeoff space. The Pareto Frontier of evaluated systems represents the state of the art: for each system on the frontier, no other system can offer more gain without more pain. Our framework has several advantages: it unifies three previous TREC evaluations, subsumes existing metrics, and provides more insightful analyses. Furthermore, our approach can easily accommodate more refined user models and is extensible to different information-seeking modalities.},

Such a requirement can be disadvantageous in situations such as when an index must be updated. In this work, we examine the appropriateness of upper-bound approximation -- which have previously been shown suitable for Wand -- in providing efficient retrieval for BMW. Experiments on the ClueWeb12 category B13 corpus using 5000 queries from a real search engine's query log demonstrate that BMW still provides bene ts w.r.t. Wand when approximate upper bounds are used, and that, if approximations on upper bounds are tight, BMW with approximate upper bounds can provide efficiency gains w.r.t.

Prior research, by exploiting the transitivity of preferences, successfully reduced the overall number of preference judgments required to O(N log(N)) for N documents, which is still prohibitive in practice. In this work, we reduce the overall number of preference judgments required by allowing for ties and exploiting that ties naturally cluster documents. Our novel judgment mechanism Merge-Tie-Judge exploits this ``clustering effect'' by automatically inferring preferences between documents from different clusters. Experiments on relevance judgments from the TREC Web Track show that the proposed mechanism requires fewer judgments},

abstract = {In the physical world, people have dynamic preferences, e.g., the same situation can lead to satisfaction for some humans and to frustration for others. Personalization is called for. The same observation holds for online behavior with interactive systems. It is natural to represent the behavior of users who are engaging with interactive systems such as a search engine or a recommender system, as a sequence of actions where each next action depends on the current situation and the user reward of taking a particular action. By and large, current online evaluation metrics for interactive systems such as search engines or recommender systems, are static and do not reflect differences in user behavior. They rarely capture or model the reward experienced by a user while interacting with an interactive system. We argue that knowing a user's reward function is essential for an interactive system as both for learning and evaluation. We propose to learn users' reward functions directly from observed interaction traces. In particular, we present how users' reward functions can be uncovered directly using inverse reinforcement learning techniques. We also show how to incorporate user features into the learning process. Our main contribution is a novel and dynamic approach to restore a user's reward function. We present an analytic approach to this problem and complement it with initial experiments using the interaction logs of a cultural heritage institution that demonstrate the feasibility of the approach by uncovering different reward functions for different user groups.},

abstract = {Many user information needs are strongly influenced by time. Some of these intents are expressed by users in queries issued indistinctively over time. Others follow a seasonal pattern. Examples of the latter are the queries "Golden Globe Award", "September 11th" or "Halloween", which refer to seasonal events that occur or have occurred at a specific occasion and for which, people often search in a planned and cyclic manner. Understanding this seasonal behavior, may help search engines to provide better ranking approaches and to respond with temporally relevant results leading into user's satisfaction. Detecting the diverse types of seasonal queries is therefore a key step for any search engine looking to present accurate results. In this paper, we categorize web search queries by their seasonality into 4 different categories: Non-Seasonal (NS, e.g., "Secure passwords"), Seasonal-related to ongoing events (SOE, "Golden Globe Award"), Seasonal-related to historical events (SHE, e.g., "September 11th") and Seasonal-related to special days and traditions (SSD, e.g., "Halloween"). To classify a given query we extract both time series (using the document publish date) and content features from its relevant documents. A Random Forest classifier is then used to classify web queries by their seasonality. Our experimental results show that they can be categorized with high accuracy.},

abstract = {User interaction with a dynamic information retrieval (DIR) system can be seen as a cooperative effort towards finding relevant information. In this cooperation, the user provides the system with evidence of his or her information need (e.g., in the form of queries, query reformulations, relevance judgments, or clicks). In turn, the system provides the user with evidence of the available information (e.g., in the form of a set of candidate results). Throughout this conversational process, both user and system may reduce their uncertainty with respect to each other, which may ultimately help in finding the desired information. In this paper, we present an information-theoretic model to quantify the flow of information from users to DIR systems and vice versa. By employing channels with memory and feedback, we decouple the mutual information among the behavior of the user and that of the system into directed components. As a result, we are able to measure: (i) by how much the DIR system is capable of adapting to the user; and (ii) by how much the user is influenced by the results returned by the DIR system. We discuss implications of the proposed framework for the evaluation and optimization of DIR systems.},

However, the number of relevant geo-tagged tweets available remains insufficient to reliably perform such tasks. Thus, predicting the location of non-geotagged tweets is an important yet challenging task, which can increase the sample of geo-tagged data and help to a wide range of tasks. In this paper, we propose a location inference method that utilises a ranking approach combined with a majority voting of tweets weighted based on the credibility of its source (Twitter user). Using geo-tagged tweets from two cities, Chicago and New York (USA), our experimental results demonstrate that our method (statistically) significantly outperforms our baselines in terms of accuracy, and error distance, in both cities, with the cost of decrease in recall.},

abstract = {main components of exploratory search. Search lets users dig in deep by controlling their actions to focus on and find just the information they need, whereas navigation helps them to get an overview to decide which content is most important. In this paper, we introduce the concept of search powered navigation and investigate the effect of empowering navigation with search functionality on information seeking behavior of users and their experience by conducting a user study on exploratory search tasks, differentiated by different types of information needs. Our main findings are as follows: First, we observe radically different search tactics. Using search, users are able to control and augment their search focus, hence they explore the data in a depth-first, bottom-up manner. Conversely, using pure navigation they tend to check different options to be able to decide on their path into the data, which corresponds to a breadth-first, top-down exploration. Second, we observe a general natural tendency to combine aspects of search and navigation, however, our experiments show that the search functionality is essential to solve exploratory search tasks that require finding documents related to a narrowdomain. Third, we observe a natural need for search powered navigation: users using a system without search functionality find creative ways to mimic searching using navigation.},

abstract = {The Kendall tau and AP correlation coefficients are very commonly use to compare two rankings over the same set of items. Even though Kendall tau was originally defined assuming that there are no ties in the rankings, two alternative versions were soon developed to account for ties in two different scenarios: measure the accuracy of an observer with respect to a true and objective ranking, and measure the agreement between two observers in the absence of a true ranking. These two variants prove useful in cases where ties are possible in either ranking, and may indeed result in very different scores. AP correlation was devised to incorporate a top-heaviness component into Kendall tau, penalizing more heavily if differences occur between items at the top of the rankings, making it a very compelling coefficient in Information Retrieval settings. However, the treatment of ties in AP correlation remains an open problem. In this paper we fill this gap, providing closed analytical formulations of AP correlation under the two scenarios of ties contemplated in Kendall tau. In addition, we developed an R package that implements these coefficients.},

abstract = {Information Retrieval (IR) research has extensively utilized personalization to advance its state-of-the-art. In this process, many IR algorithms and applications require the use of users' personal information, contextual information and other sensitive and private information. However, while IR researchers are making progress, there is always a concern over violations to the users' privacy. Sometimes, the concern becomes so overwhelming that IR research has to stop to avoid leaking users' privacy. The good news is that there have been increasing attentions paid on the joint field of privacy and IR -- privacy-preserving IR. As part of the effort, this tutorial offers an introduction to differential privacy (DP), one of the most advanced techniques in privacy research, and provides necessary set of theoretical knowledge for applying privacy techniques in IR. Differential privacy is a technique that provides strong privacy guarantees for data protection. Theoretically, it aims to maximize the data utility in statistical datasets while minimizing the risk of exposing individual data entries to any adversary. Differential privacy has been applied across a wide range of applications in database, data mining, and IR. This tutorial aims to lay a theoretical foundation of DP and how it can be applied to IR. We hope the attendees of this tutorial will have a good understanding of DP and the necessary knowledge to work on this newly minted joint research field of privacy and IR.},

abstract = {The multi-armed bandit problem models an agent that simultaneously attempts to acquire new knowledge (exploration) and optimize his decisions based on existing knowledge (exploitation). The agent attempts to balance these competing tasks in order to maximize his total value over the period of time considered. There are many practical applications of the bandit model, such as clinical trials, adaptive routing or portfolio design. Over the last decade there has been an increased interest in developing bandit algorithms for specific problems in information, such as diverse document ranking, news recommendation or ranker evaluation. The aim of this tutorial is to provide an overview of the various applications of bandit algorithms in information retrieval as well as issues related to their practical deployment and performance in real-life systems/applications.},

Indeed, efficiency requirements must be fulfilled in order to make an effective research product deployable within an industrial environment. The evaluation of a model can be too expensive due to its size, the features used and several other factors. This tutorial discusses the recent solutions that allow to build an effective ranking model that satisfies temporal budget constrains at evaluation time.},
