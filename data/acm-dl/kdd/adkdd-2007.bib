abstract = {The online advertising industry is currently based on two dominant business models: the pay-per-impression model and the pay-per-click model. With the growth of sponsored search during the last few years, there has been a move toward the pay-per-click model as it decreases the risk to small advertisers. An alternative model, discussed but not widely used in the advertising industry, is pay-per-conversion, or more generally, pay-per-action. In this paper, we discuss mechanisms for the pay-per-action model and various challenges involved in designing such mechanisms.},

abstract = {Online search systems that display ads continually offer new features that advertisers can use to fine-tune and enhance their ad campaigns. An important question is whether a new feature actually helps advertisers. In an ideal world for statisticians, we would answer this question by running a statistically designed experiment. But that would require randomly choosing a set of advertisers and forcing them to use the feature, which is not realistic. Accordingly, in the real world, new features for advertisers are seldom evaluated with a traditional experimental protocol. Instead, customer service representatives select advertisers who are invited to be among the first to test a new feature (i.e., white-listed), and then each white-listed advertiser chooses whether or not to use the new feature. Neither the customer service representative nor the advertiser chooses at random.This paper addresses the problem of drawing valid inferences from whitelist trials about the effects of new features on advertiser happiness. We are guided by three principles. First, statistical procedures for whitelist trials are likely to be applied in an automated way, so they should be robust to violations of modeling assumptions. Second, standard analysis tools should be preferred over custom-built ones, both for clarity and for robustness. Standard tools have withstood the test of time and have been thoroughly debugged. Finally, it should be easy to compute reliable confidence intervals for the estimator. We review an estimator that has all these attributes, allowing us to make valid inferences about the effects of a new feature on advertiser happiness. In the example in this paper, the new feature was introduced during the holiday shopping season, thereby further complicating the analysis.},

We present a system that is language independent and knowledge free based on SVM ranking. We evaluate it on a large number of advertisements appearing on real Web pages. Our contribution is two new classes of features of similarity between ads and Web pages based on machine translation technologies. We show that our features significantly improve performance over baseline techniques.},

abstract = {Online advertising has been a popular topic in recent years. In this paper, we address one of the important problems in online advertising, i.e., how to detect whether a publisher webpage contains sensitive content and is appropriate for showing advertisement(s) on it.We take a webpage classification approach to solve this problem. First we design a unique sensitive content taxonomy. Then we adopt an iterative training data collection and classifier building approach, to build a hierarchical classifier which can classify webpages into one of the nodes in the sensitive content taxonomy. The experimental result show that using this approach, we are able to build a unique sensitive content classifier with decent accuracy while only requiring limited amount of human labeling effort.},

abstract = {Previous work on opinion/sentiment mining focuses only on sentiment classification with the postulation that topics are identified a prior. However, this assumption often fails in reality. In advertising, topics on which users are commenting are crucial as corresponding advertisements can only be promoted when advertisers have the idea of what users are referring to. In this paper, we propose a rule-based approach to extracting topics from opinion sentences given these sentences identified from texts in advance. We build up a sentiment dictionary and define several rules based on the syntactic roles of words using the Dependence Grammar which is considered to be more suitable for Chinese natural language parsing. The experiments show encouraging results.},

abstract = {Allowing global distribution of information to large audiences at very low cost, the Internet has emerged as a vital medium for marketing and advertising. Weblogs, a new form of self publication on the Internet, have attracted online advertisers because of their incredible growth-rate in recent years. In this paper, we propose to discover information diffusion paths from the blogosphere to track how information frequently flows from blog to blog. This knowledge can be used in various applications of online campaign. Our approach is based on analyzing the content of blogs. After detecting trackable topics of blogs, we model a blog community as a blog sequence database. Then, the discovery of information diffusion paths is formalized as a problem of frequent pattern mining. We develop a new data mining algorithm to discover information diffusion paths. Experiments conducted on real life dataset show that our algorithm discovers information diffusion paths efficiently. The discovered information diffusion paths are accurate in predicting the future information flow in the blog community.},

abstract = {Content targeted advertising has been a successful way of delivering ads, as effective technologies were developed to find keywords from the webpage a user is browsing. However, existing technologies cannot be easily applied to find keywords from online broadcasting content, which usually contain more specific phrases and wordings in certain communities than in general webpage content. In this paper, motivated by some existing research works on information extraction field, we suggest a sequential pattern mining-based method to discover language patterns from online broadcasting content. With selected keyword seeds, iteratively applying the language pattern mining and keyword extraction, the proposed technique avoids any tedious labeling work for this task. Our experiments on real-world data show that the proposed keyword extraction algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline method.},
