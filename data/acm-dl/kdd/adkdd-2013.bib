abstract = {Today, billions of display ad impressions are purchased on a daily basis through a public auction hosted by real time bidding (RTB) exchanges. A decision has to be made for advertisers to submit a bid for each selected RTB ad request in milliseconds. Restricted by the budget, the goal is to buy a set of ad impressions to reach as many targeted users as possible. A desired action (conversion), advertiser specific, includes purchasing a product, filling out a form, signing up for emails, etc. In addition, advertisers typically prefer to spend their budget smoothly over the time in order to reach a wider range of audience accessible throughout a day and have a sustainable impact. However, since the conversions occur rarely and the occurrence feedback is normally delayed, it is very challenging to achieve both budget and performance goals at the same time. In this paper, we present an online approach to the smooth budget delivery while optimizing for the conversion performance. Our algorithm tries to select high quality impressions and adjust the bid price based on the prior performance distribution in an adaptive manner by distributing the budget optimally across time. Our experimental results from real advertising campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.},

abstract = {Given a table where rows correspond to records and columns correspond to attributes, we want to find a small number of patterns that succinctly summarize the dataset. For example, given a set of patient records with several attributes each, how can we find (a) that the "most representative" pattern is, say, (male, adult, *), followed by (*, child, low-cholesterol), etc? We propose TSum, a method that provides a sequence of patterns ordered by their "representativeness." It can decide both which these patterns are, as well as how many are necessary to properly summarize the data. Our main contribution is formulating a general framework, TSum, using compression principles. TSum can easily accommodate different optimization strategies for selecting and refining patterns. The discovered patterns can be used to both represent the data efficiently, as well as interpret it quickly. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and intuitiveness of our discovered patterns.},

abstract = {The real-time bidding (RTB), aka programmatic buying, has recently become the fastest growing area in online advertising. Instead of bulking buying and inventory-centric buying, RTB mimics stock exchanges and utilises computer algorithms to automatically buy and sell ads in real-time; It uses per impression context and targets the ads to specific people based on data about them, and hence dramatically increases the effectiveness of display advertising. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis and measurement of a production ad exchange. Using the data sampled from both demand and supply side, we aim to provide first-hand insights into the emerging new impression selling infrastructure and its bidding behaviours, and help identifying research and design issues in such systems. From our study, we observed that periodic patterns occur in various statistics including impressions, clicks, bids, and conversion rates (both post-view and post-click), which suggest time-dependent models would be appropriate for capturing the repeated patterns in RTB. We also found that despite the claimed second price auction, the first price payment in fact is accounted for 55.4% of total cost due to the arrangement of the soft floor price. As such, we argue that the setting of soft floor price in the current RTB systems puts advertisers in a less favourable position. Furthermore, our analysis on the conversation rates shows that the current bidding strategy is far less optimal, indicating the significant needs for optimisation algorithms incorporating the facts such as the temporal behaviours, the frequency and recency of the ad displays, which have not been well considered in the past.},

abstract = {Contextual advertising is a textual advertising displayed within the content of a generic web page. Predicting the probability that users will click on ads plays a crucial role in contextual advertising because it influences ranking, filtering, placement, and pricing of ads. In this paper, we introduce a click-through rate prediction algorithm based on the learning-to-rank approach. Focusing on the fact that some of the past click data are noisy and ads are ranked as lists, we build a ranking model by using partial click logs and then a regression model on it. We evaluated this approach offline on a data set based on logs from an ad network. Our method is observed to achieve better results than other baselines in our three metrics.},

abstract = {Online display advertisers extensively use the concept of a user segment to cluster users into targetable groups. When the sizes of such segments are less than the desired value for campaign budgets, there is a need to use probabilistic modeling to expand the size. This process is termed look-alike modeling. Given the multitude of data providers and on-line data sources, there are thousands of segments for each targetable consumer extracted from billions of online (even offline) actions performed by millions of users. The majority of advertisers, marketers and publishers have to use large scale distributed infrastructures to create thousands of user segments on a daily basis. Developing accurate data mining models efficiently within such platforms is a challenging task. The volume and variety of data can be a significant bottleneck for non-disk resident algorithms, since operating time for training and scoring hundreds of segments with millions of targetable users is non-trivial.In this paper, we present a novel k-means based distributed in-database algorithm for look-alike modeling implemented within the nPario database system. We demonstrate the utility of the algorithm: accurate, invariant of size and skew of the targetable audience(very few positive examples), and dependent linearly on the capacity and number of nodes in the distributed environment. To the best of our knowledge this is the first ever commercially deployed distributed look-alike modeling implementation to solve this problem. We compare the performance of our algorithm with other distributed and non-distributed look-alike modeling techniques, and report the results over a multi-core environment.},
