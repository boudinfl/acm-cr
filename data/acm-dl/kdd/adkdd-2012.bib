abstract = {The explosive growth of microblogs has attracted many corporations and organizations. Microblogging has been considered as a high-quality advertising platform. In this study, we attempt to reveal the patterns of advertisement propagation in Sina-Microblog through analyzing a selected set of message cascades. Each message cascade is represented by a propagation tree and 33 features were extracted, which cover mainly three aspects of a cascade: the volume of the participants, the topology of the propagation paths, and the promptness of the propagation in term of time. To reveal the propagation patterns, We then group these message cascades using K-means clustering algorithm. Analysis of the resulted clusters reveals the patterns of advertisement propagation, based on which we further propose several metrics to measure the effectiveness of advertisement in microblogs.},

abstract = {We describe a new approach to solving the click-through rate (CTR) prediction problem in sponsored search by means of MatrixNet, the proprietary implementation of boosted trees. This problem is of special importance for the search engine, because choosing the ads to display substantially depends on the predicted CTR and greatly affects the revenue of the search engine and user experience. We discuss different issues such as evaluating and tuning MatrixNet algorithm, feature importance, performance, accuracy and training data set size. Finally, we compare MatrixNet with several other methods and present experimental results from the production system.},

abstract = {Sponsored search has been recognized as one of the major internet monetization solutions for commercial search engines. There are generally three types of participants in this online advertising problem, who are search users, advertisers and publishers. Though previous studies have proposed to optimize for different participants independently, it is underexplored how to optimize for all participants in a unified framework and in a systematic way. In this paper, we propose to model the ad ranking problem in sponsored search as a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problem for all participants. We show that many previous studies are special cases of the MOO framework. Taking advantage from the Pareto solution set of MOO, we can easily find more optimized solutions with significant improvement in one objective and minor sacrifice in others. This enables a more flexible way for us to tradeoff among different participants, i.e. objective functions, in sponsored search. Besides the empirical studies for comparing MOO with related previous sponsored search studies, we provide the insightful applications of MOO framework, which is a prediction model to help users determine the tradeoff parameters among different objective functions. Experimental results show the outstanding performance of the proposed prediction model for parameter selection in ad ranking optimization.},

abstract = {We link the content of real-time social media response to characteristics of the Super Bowl 2012 TV advertisements, including their advertisers' social media strategies and the categories of the products being advertised. We analyze millions of social media posts about approximately forty-five advertisements during the 2012 Super Bowl. While there are many studies that focus on the popularity of and sentiment of response to Super Bowl ads, we believe ours is the first to go deeper and analyze the textual "content" to understand better the factors contributing to specific types of social media responses among a number of TV advertising dimensions. In this study, we show that the level of online consumer engagement, measured by attracting new followers on Twitter during the Superbowl, can be linked to whether the brand that advertised had a social media strategy or not. In addition, we show that sentiment response, a measure often use to quantify the effectiveness of TV ads, varies by demographic category.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop an experimental analysis to estimate the causal effect of online marketing campaigns as a whole, and not just the media ad design. We analyze the causal effects on user conversion probability. We run experiments based on A/B testing to perform this evaluation. We also estimate the causal effect of the media ad design given this randomization approach. We discuss the framework of a marketing campaign in the context of targeted display advertising, and incorporate the main elements of this framework in the evaluation. We consider budget constraints, the auction process, and the targeting engine in the analysis and the experimental set up. For the effects of this evaluation, we assume the targeting engine to be a black box that incorporates the impression delivery policy, the budget constraints, and the bidding process. Our method to disaggregate the campaign causal analysis is inspired on randomized experiments with imperfect compliance and the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. In this framework, individuals assigned randomly to the study group might refuse to take the treatment. For estimation, we present a Bayesian approach and provide credible intervals for the causal estimates. We analyze the effects of 2 independent campaigns for different products from the Advertising.com ad network for 20M+ users each campaign.},

abstract = {Privacy is a major concern for Internet users and Internet policy regulators. Privacy violations usually entail either sharing Personally Identifying Information (PII) or non-PII information such as a site visitor's behavior on a website. On the other hand, Internet advertising through behavioral targeting is an important part of the Internet ecosystem, as it provides users more relevant information and enables content/data providers to provide free services to end users. In order to achieve effective behavioral targeting, it is desirable for the advertisers to access a set of users with the targeted behaviors. A key question is how should data flow from a provider (e.g. publisher) to a third party advertiser to achieve effective behavioral targeting, all while without directly sharing exact user behavior data. This paper attempts to answer this question and proposes a privacy preserving technique for behavioral targeting that does not entail a drastic reduction in advertising effectiveness. When behavioral targeting data is transferred to an advertiser, we use a smart, data mining-based noise injection method that perturbs the results (a set of users meeting specified criteria) by carefully adding noisy data points that maintain a high level of performance. Upon receiving the data, the advertiser cannot distinguish accurate data points adhering to specifications, versus noisy data, which does not meet the specifications. Using data from a major US top Online Travel Agent (OTA), we evaluated the proposed technique for location-based behavioral targeting, whereby advertisers run data campaigns targeting travelers for specific destinations. Our experimental results demonstrate that such data campaigns obtain results that enhance or preserve user privacy while maintaining a high level of targeting performance.},

abstract = {In many online advertising campaigns, multiple vendors, publishers or search engines (herein called channels) are contracted to serve advertisements to internet users on behalf of a client seeking specific types of conversion. In such campaigns, individual users are often served advertisements by more than one channel. The process of assigning conversion credit to the various channels is called "attribution," and is a subject of intense interest in the industry. This paper presents a causally motivated methodology for conversion attribution in online advertising campaigns. We discuss the need for the standardization of attribution measurement and offer three guiding principles to contribute to this standardization. Stemming from these principles, we position attribution as a causal estimation problem and then propose two approximation methods as alternatives for when the full causal estimation can not be done. These approximate methods derive from our causal approach and incorporate prior attribution work in cooperative game theory. We argue that in cases where causal assumptions are violated, these approximate methods can be interpreted as variable importance measures. Finally, we show examples of attribution measurement on several online advertising campaign data sets.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a time series approach, based on Dynamic Linear Models (DLM), to estimate the impact of ad impressions on the daily number of commercial actions when no user tracking is possible. The proposed method uses aggregate data, and hence it is simple to implement without expensive infrastructure. Specifically, we model the impact of daily number of ad impressions on daily number of commercial actions. We incorporate persistence of campaign effects on actions assuming a decay factor. We relax the assumption of a linear impact of ads on actions using the logtransformation. We also account for outliers with long-tailed distributions fitted and estimated automatically without a pre-defined threshold. This is applied to observational data post-campaign and does not require an experimental set-up. We apply the method to data from the Advertising.com ad network on 2,885 campaigns for 1,251 products during six months, to calibrate and perform model selection. We set up a randomized experiment for two campaigns where user tracking is feasible. We find that the output of the proposed method is consistent with the results of A/B testing with similar confidence intervals. Finally, we validate our model with a synthetic public data set, PROMO, and identify 84% of effective campaigns correctly.},

abstract = {Display advertising has been growing rapidly in recent years, with revenue generated from display ads placed on spaces allocated on publisher's web pages. Traditionally, the design and layout of ad spaces on a web page are predetermined and fixed for the publisher. The objective of this work is to investigate the revenue opportunities of changing the ad layout dynamically for the publisher. A dynamic ad layout revenue optimization framework is developed for display advertising, in terms of both guaranteed and non-guaranteed advertising. The system automatically selects the ad layout template with the highest potential revenue yield for each single web page presented to the user. Forecasting algorithms are developed to predict the revenue of each ad opportunity. Two objectives are explored for the forecasting algorithms of ad layout optimization, the expected revenue and actual revenue. Promising results are obtained in offline simulation on real data collected from a Yahoo! property. The dynamic ad layout optimization system is further tested on real-time traffic and a significant revenue gain is observed compared with a static ad layout serving method.},
