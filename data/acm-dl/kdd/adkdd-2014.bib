abstract = {There are two major ways of selling impressions in display advertising. They are either sold in spot through auction mechanisms or in advance via guaranteed contracts. The former has achieved a significant automation via real-time bidding (RTB); however, the latter is still mainly done over the counter through direct sales. This paper proposes a mathematical model that allocates and prices the future impressions between real-time auctions and guaranteed contracts. Under conventional economic assumptions, our model shows that the two ways can be seamless combined programmatically and the publisher's revenue can be maximized via price discrimination and optimal allocation. We consider advertisers are risk-averse, and they would be willing to purchase guaranteed impressions if the total costs are less than their private values. We also consider that an advertiser's purchase behavior can be affected by both the guaranteed price and the time interval between the purchase time and the impression delivery date. Our solution suggests an optimal percentage of future impressions to sell in advance and provides an explicit formula to calculate at what prices to sell. We find that the optimal guaranteed prices are dynamic and are non-decreasing over time. We evaluate our method with RTB datasets and find that the model adopts different strategies in allocation and pricing according to the level of competition. From the experiments we find that, in a less competitive market, lower prices of the guaranteed contracts will encourage the purchase in advance and the revenue gain is mainly contributed by the increased competition in future RTB. In a highly competitive market, advertisers are more willing to purchase the guaranteed contracts and thus higher prices are expected. The revenue gain is largely contributed by the guaranteed selling.},

abstract = {Budget allocation in online advertising deals with distributing the campaign (insertion order) level budgets to different sub-campaigns which employ different targeting criteria and may perform differently in terms of return-on-investment (ROI). In this paper, we present the efforts at Turn on how to best allocate campaign budget so that the advertiser or campaign-level ROI is maximized. To do this, it is crucial to be able to correctly determine the performance of sub-campaigns. This determination is highly related to the action-attribution problem, i.e. to be able to find out the set of ads, and hence the sub-campaigns that provided them to a user, that an action should be attributed to. For this purpose, we employ both last-touch (last ad gets all credit) and multi-touch (many ads share the credit) attribution methodologies. We present the algorithms deployed at Turn for the attribution problem, as well as their parallel implementation on the large advertiser performance datasets. We conclude the paper with our empirical comparison of last-touch and multi-touch attribution-based budget allocation in a real online advertising setting.},

abstract = {Most video advertising campaigns today are still evaluated based on aggregate demographic audience metrics, rather than measures of individual impact or even individual demographic reach. To fit in with advertisers' evaluations, campaigns must be optimized toward validation by third-party measurement companies, which act as "oracles" in assessing ground truth. However, information is only available from such oracles in aggregate, leading to a setting with incomplete ground truth. We explore methods for building probabilistic classification models using these aggregate data. If they perform well, such models can be used to create new "engineered" segments that perform better than existing segments, in terms of lift and/or reach. We focus on the setting where companies already have machinery in place for high-performance predictive modeling from traditional, individual-level data. We show that model building, evaluation, and selection can be reliably carried out even with access only to aggregate ground truth data. We show various concrete results, highlighting confounding aspects of the problem, such as the tendency for pre-existing "in-target" segments actually to comprise biased subpopulations, which has implications both for campaign performance and modeling performance. The paper's main results show that these methods lead to engineered segments that can substantially improve lift and/or reach---as verified by a leading third-party oracle. For example, for lifts of 2-3X, segment reach can be increased to 57 times that of comparable, pre-existing segments.},

This paper is a system overview where we provide an description of the nature of the data sources, frame of reference, abstractions, algorithmic approaches, as well as the main design tradeoffs of this system. We also provide a list of some of the lessons we learned after deploying and using this platform for numerous actual mobile advertisement campaigns. Additionally, we describe the Place Visit Rate, which is a location-based criterion for quantifying campaign response. We believe that the lift we see in Place Visit Rate in actual mobile campaigns using PIQ's audiences is a form of validation of our overall approach and provides us with guidance and feedback regarding the quality of the algorithms and audiences we create.},

abstract = {Online advertising allows advertisers to only bid and pay for measurable user responses, such as clicks on ads. As a consequence, click prediction systems are central to most online advertising systems. With over 750 million daily active users and over 1 million active advertisers, predicting clicks on Facebook ads is a challenging machine learning task. In this paper we introduce a model which combines decision trees with logistic regression, outperforming either of these methods on its own by over 3%, an improvement with significant impact to the overall system performance. We then explore how a number of fundamental parameters impact the final prediction performance of our system. Not surprisingly, the most important thing is to have the right features: those capturing historical information about the user or ad dominate other types of features. Once we have the right features and the right model (decisions trees plus logistic regression), other factors play small roles (though even small improvements are important at scale). Picking the optimal handling for data freshness, learning rate schema and data sampling improve the model slightly, though much less than adding a high-value feature, or picking the right model to begin with.},

abstract = {RTB (Real Time Bidding) is one of the most exciting developments in computational advertising in recent years. It drives transparency and efficiency in the display advertising ecosystem and facilitates the healthy growth of the display advertising industry. It enables advertisers to deliver the right message to the right person at the right time, publishers to better monetize their content by leveraging their website audience, and consumers to view relevant information through personalized ads. However, researchers in computational advertising area have been suffering from lack of publicly available datasets. iPinYou organizes a three-season global RTB algorithm competition in 2013. For each season, there is offline stage and online stage. On the offline stage, iPinYou releases a dataset for model training and reserves a dataset for testing. The dataset includes logs of ad biddings, impressions, clicks, and final conversions. After the whole competition ends, iPinYou organizes and releases all these three datasets for public use. These datasets can support experiments of some important research problems such as bid optimization and CTR estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset on RTB display advertising. In this paper, we give descriptions of these datasets to further boost the interests of computational advertising research community using this dataset.},
