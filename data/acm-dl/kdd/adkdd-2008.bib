abstract = {We empirically investigate whether advertisers are maximizing their return on investment (ROI) across multiple keywords in sponsored search auctions. Because testing for ROI maximization relies on knowledge of advertisers' private true values per click, we instead use necessary (although not sufficient) conditions for ROI maximizing behavior that rely only on advertisers' bids. We classify advertisers based on the extent to which they satisfy the test conditions. Our results indicate that a large fraction of advertisers in the Yahoo Webscope first price data set may be following ROI-based strategies.},

abstract = {We propose a methodology for assessing how ad campaigns in offline media such as print, audio and TV affect online interest in the advertiser's brand. Online interest can be measured by daily counts of the number of search queries that contain brand related keywords, by the number of visitors to the advertiser's web pages, by the number of pageviews at the advertiser's websites, or by the total duration of visits to the advertiser's website. An increase in outcomes like these in designated market areas (DMAs) where the offline ad appeared suggests heightened interest in the advertised product, as long as there would have been no such increase if the ad had not appeared. We propose a regression analysis to estimate the incremental value of the ad campaign beyond the baseline interest that would have been seen if the campaign had not been shown. A small print ad campaign illustrates the method.},

abstract = {With the rapid growth of search advertising, there has been an increased interest amongst both practitioners and academics in enhancing our understanding of how consumers respond to contextual and sponsored search advertising on the Internet. An emerging stream of work has begun to explore these issues. In this paper, we focus on a previously unexplored question: How does sponsored search advertising compare to organic listings with respect to predicting conversion rates, order values and profits from a keyword ad? We use a Hierarchical Bayesian modeling framework and estimate the model using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Our analysis suggests that on an average while the conversion rates, order values and profits from paid search advertisements were much higher than those from natural search, most of the keyword-level characteristics have a statistically significant and stronger impact on these three performance metrics for organic search than paid search. This could shed light on understanding what the most "attractive" keywords are from advertisers' perspective, and how advertisers should invest in search engine advertising campaigns relative to search engine optimization.},

abstract = {With more and more commercial activities moving onto the Internet, people tend to purchase what they need through Internet or conduct some online research before the actual deals happen. For many Web users, their online commercial activities start from submitting a search query to search engines. Just like the common Web search queries, the queries with commercial intention are usually very short. Recognizing the queries with commercial intention against the common queries will help search engines provide proper search results and advertisements; help Web users obtain the right information they desire and help the advertisers benefit from the potential transactions. The only existing research work, as far as we know, has been done to automatically detect online commercial intention purely based on the issued queries, without considering the Web user's information. However, the intentions behind a query vary a lot for users with different background and interest. The intentions can even be different for the same user, when the query is issued in different contexts. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, which we name as POINT, for the Personalized Online-commercial INTention detection based on a skip-chain conditional random field model. To accurately detect the commercial intentions of a query, our method comprehensively considers the evidences from the target query, the profile of the user issuing the query, which is inferred from his search history, as well as the similarity of different queries in a personal query log. Our proposed method is validated through extensive experiments on a real search engine query log data set. The experimental results show that our algorithm can clearly improve the performance by more than 10% of personalized online-commercial intention detection.},

abstract = {Measuring the relevance between a document and a phrase is fundamental to many information retrieval and matching tasks including on-line advertising. In this paper, we explore two approaches for measuring the relevance between a document and a phrase aiming to provide consistent relevance scores for both in and out-of document phrases. The first approach is a similarity-based method which represents both the document and phrase as term vectors to derive a real-valued relevance score. The second approach takes as input the relevance estimates of some in-document phrases and uses Gaussian Process Regression to predict the score of a target out-of-document phrase. While both of these two approaches work well, the best result is given by a Gaussian Process Regression model, which is significantly better than the similarity-based approach and 10% better than a baseline similarity method using bag-of-word vectors.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of predicting the probability of a click for an advertisement when the outcome of a click or no-click is expressed by means of a set of a large number of variables. Many, if not most, of these variables are very weakly related to the clicking of the ad. Thus, a traditional approach to address this problem that treats each variable on an equal and blind footing takes away the interpretability in explaining the underlying process of the outcome. Such an approach would be computationally expensive and, further, may suffer from poor generalization.We investigate the forward selection method for variable subset selection in the domain of advertisement click-through-rate prediction. The forward selection method proceeds sequentially in a way that rewards a set of variables by how much information it provides regarding the outcome, but penalizes the set based on the number of variables in it. Concretely, we propose a logistic regression model for estimating the conditional expectation between the outcome and the ensemble of variables.The model obtained compares favorably with that obtained via an exhaustive search through the model space. We also observe that the set of variables selected by the forward selection procedure has better predictive power than that selected by considering their individual statistical significance. Thus we show that the forward-selection method for subset selection serves to produce a good model for predicting ad click-through-rates.},
