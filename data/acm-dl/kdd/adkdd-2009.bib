abstract = {This talk will discuss the issues and techniques at the intersection of data science, advertising technology, and the business of brand advertising on-line. For better or worse, on-line advertising has been viewed by many advertisers as a direct marketing channel, with sponsored search advertising being the shining star. However, a very large proportion of advertising budgets is dedicated to brand advertising, for which clicks and short-horizon on-line purchases may not be the primary goal. Instead or in addition, brand advertisers want to get an advertising message to a chosen audience, for example to build or to reinforce brand affinity. This talk will argue that social media may be particularly valuable for on-line brand advertising, and discuss technology for selecting, evaluating, and targeting audiences, plus important issues such as privacy and maintaining brand image.},

abstract = {Both Contextual Advertising (CA) and Behavioral Targeting (BT) are playing important roles in online advertising market. Recently, the problem of how to integrate BT strategies into CA has attracted much attention from both industry and academia. However, to our best knowledge, few research works have been published to provide BT solutions in CA. In this paper, we propose a new notion of relevance between webpages and ads based on users' online click-through behaviors from BT's perspective. Compared with the classical behavior targeting method where only users' history interests are considered, we pay more attention to the click probability of ads from a webpage where the relevance between them is evaluated. Moreover, a combination model integrating behavioral relevance and contextual relevance for matching ads and webpags is presented. The model parameters are learnt from a dataset consisting of 200 webpages and 35,880 ads. Experimental results show that our integrated strategy indeed outperforms the strategies that only consider either behavioral relevance or contextual relevance. The best model achieves a 18.1% improvement in precision over single strategies.},

abstract = {Behavioral Targeting (BT), which aims to deliver the most appropriate advertisements to the most appropriate users, is attracting much attention in online advertising market. A key challenge of BT is how to automatically segment users for ads delivery, and good user segmentation may significantly improve the ad click-through rate (CTR). Different from classical user segmentation strategies, which rarely take the semantics of user behaviors into consideration, we propose in this paper a novel user segmentation algorithm named Probabilistic Latent Semantic User Segmentation (PLSUS). PLSUS adopts the probabilistic latent semantic analysis to mine the relationship between users and their behaviors so as to segment users in a semantic manner. We perform experiments on the real world ad click through log of a commercial search engine. Comparing with the other two classical clustering algorithms, K-Means and CLUTO, PLSUS can further improve the ads CTR up to 100%. To our best knowledge, this work is an early semantic user segmentation study for BT in academia.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a system named Argo which provides intelligent advertising made possible from users' photo collections. Based on the intuition that user-generated photos imply user interests which are the key for profitable targeted ads, the Argo system attempts to learn a user's profile from his shared photos and suggests relevant ads accordingly. To learn a user interest, in an offline step, a hierarchical and efficient topic space is constructed based on the ODP ontology, which is used later on for bridging the vocabulary gap between ads and photos as well as reducing the effect of noisy photo tags. In the online stage, the process of Argo contains three steps: 1) understanding the content and semantics of a user's photos and auto-tagging each photo to supplement user-submitted tags (such tags may not be available); 2) learning the user interest given a set of photos based on the learnt hierarchical topic space; and 3) representing ads in the topic space and matching their topic distributions with the target user interest; the top ranked ads are output as the suggested ads. Two key challenges are tackled during the process: 1) the semantic gap between the low-level image visual features and the high-level user semantics; and 2) the vocabulary impedance between photos and ads. We conducted a series of experiments based on real Flickr users and Amazon.com products (as candidate ads), which show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {We present an efficient Bayesian online learning algorithm for clustering vectors of binary values based on a well known model, the mixture of Bernoulli profiles. The model includes conjugate Beta priors over the success probabilities and maintains discrete probability distributions for cluster assignments. Clustering is then formulated as inference in a factor graph which is solved efficiently using online approximate message passing. The resulting algorithm has three key features: a) it requires only a single pass across the data and can hence be used on data streams, b) it maintains the uncertainty of parameters and cluster assignments, and c) it implements an automatic step size adaptation based on the current model uncertainty. The model is tested on an artificially generated toy dataset and applied to a large scale real-world data set from online advertising, the data being online ads characterized by the set of keywords to which they have been subscribed. The proposed approach scales well for large datasets, and compares favorably to other clustering algorithms on the ads dataset. As a concrete application to online advertising we show how the learnt model can be used to recommend new keywords for given ads.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a keyword suggestion mechanism for supporting advertisers wishing to publish ads in content-targeted advertisement systems. The method infers "synonymy" between keywords by mining a database of previously submitted ads, and uses such information for suggesting relevant and non-obvious keywords to advertisers. Automatic word-sense disambiguation is provided implicitly by our keyword ranking procedure. We perform on-line comparison of our method with another keyword suggestion system being currently used in the largest Portuguese web advertisement broker with presence in four different countries, by redirecting 50% of keyword suggestion requests to each of the two systems. We propose a novel set of evaluation measures to compare the performance of keyword suggestion systems in such experimental setting. Results show that ads containing keywords suggested by the method we propose are selected for being printed more frequently at similar, or often superior, click-through rates. This results in a potential global revenue increase for the ad broker.},

abstract = {Much search engine revenue comes from sponsored search ads displayed with algorithmic search results. To maximize revenue, it is essential to choose a good slate of ads for each query, requiring accurate prediction of whether or not users will click on an ad. Click prediction is relatively easy for the ads that have been displayed many times, and have significant click history, but in the long tail with minimal or no click history, other features are needed to predict user response. In this work, we investigate the use of novel text features for this problem, within the context of a state-of-the-art sponsored search system. In particular, we propose the use of detailed word-pair indicator features between the query and ad. We compare the new features to the traditional vector-space and language modeling features extracted in a typical information-retrieval style. We evaluate these approaches in a maximum-entropy ranking model using the click-view data from a commercial search-engine traffic. We show that the word-pair features are highly helpful for sponsored search click prediction, not only improving over the sophisticated click-history feedback based systems, but also compensating for the lack of click history to some extent. In contrast, we find that the language and vector-space modeling approaches are significantly less effective.},

abstract = {Displaying sponsored ads alongside the search results is a key monetization strategy for search engine companies. Since users are more likely to click ads that are relevant to their query, it is crucial for search engine to deliver the right ads for the query and the order in which they are displayed. There are several works investigating on how to learn a ranking function to maximize the number of ad clicks. However, this ranking optimization problem is different from algorithmic search results ranking in that the ranking scheme must take received revenue into account in order to make more profit for the search engines. In this paper, we address a new optimization problem and aim to answer the question: how to construct a ranking model that can deliver high quality ads to the user as well as maximize search engine revenue? We introduce a novel tradeoff method from machine learning perspective, and through this method we have the privilege of choosing a tradeoff parameter to achieve highest relevance ranking or highest revenue ranking or the tradeoff between them. The algorithms are built upon the click-through log data with real ad clicks and impressions. The extensively experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm has the property that the search engine could choose a proper parameter to achieve high revenue(income) without losing to much relevance.},

Motivated by Google's online PrintAds system which is such a marketplace, we focus on the role of the market runner in improving market efficiency. We abstract the problem of pricing guidance where the market runner provides an initial price-point for negotiations based on data analysis. The problem is nuanced because the market runner can not fully reveal the price data for any of the publishers. We introduce two solutions for pricing guidance, the first using clustering and the second using support vector machines, and present experimental evaluation of our methods. Pricing guidance by the market runner is a novel direction, and we expect more research in the future.},

abstract = {GPS technology has made it possible to evaluate the performance of outdoor advertising campaigns in an objective manner. Given the GPS trajectories of a sample of test persons over several days, their passages with arbitrary poster campaigns can be calculated. However, inference is complicated by the early dropout of persons. Other than in most demonstrations of spatial data mining algorithms where the structure of the data sample is usually disregarded, poster performance measures such as reach and gross impressions evolve continuously over time and require non-intermittent observations. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of survival analysis to compensate for missing measurement days. We formalize the task of modeling the visit potential of geographic locations based on trajectory data as our variable of interest results from dispersed events in space-time. We perform experiments on the cities of Zurich and Bern simulating different dropout mechanisms and dropout rates and show the adequacy of the applied method. Our modeling technique is at present part of a business solution for the Swiss outdoor advertising branch and serves as pricing basis for the majority of Swiss poster locations.},

In particular, we discuss how the accuracy of the retention score, a measure of ad quality, is improved by using the recent "click history" of the STBs tuned to the ad. These retention scores are related to -- and are a natural extension of -- other measures of ad quality that have been used in online advertising since at least 2005 [2]. Like their online counterparts, TV retention scores could be used to determine if an ad should be eligible to enter the inventory auction and, if it is, how highly the ad should be ranked [1]. A retention score (RS) could also be used by the auction system for pricing, or by the advertiser to compare different creatives for the same product.},
