abstract = {Every day, billions of online advertising slots are bought and sold through real time bidding (RTB). In RTB, publishers sometimes reject bids to deliver ads (impressions) for some brands, due to, for example, direct deals with other brands. Publishers rarely disclose which brands they blacklist to ad buyers. Buyers bidding for a blacklisted brand waste computing resources in a low latency environment and lose an opportunity to show a good ad for a different brand. Here we describe a dynamic system developed at Dstillery that detects these (publisher, brand) combinations based on ad auction win rates and limits bidding for them to the minimum. This system demonstrates 1) a significant increase in the win rates of our bids, 2) a sizable reduction of system load, and 3) effectiveness in finding qualified non-blacklisted brands to replace blacklisted brands to show ads for. The system allows us to deliver more ad impressions while making fewer bids. In addition, we develop and demonstrate a methodology of choosing the optimal exploration-exploitation balance of the problem.},

abstract = {Predicting click and conversion probabilities when bidding on ad exchanges is at the core of the programmatic advertising industry. Two separated lines of previous works respectively address i) the prediction of user conversion probability and ii) the attribution of these conversions to advertising events (such as clicks) after the fact. We argue that attribution modeling improves the efficiency of the bidding policy in the context of performance advertising.Firstly we explain the inefficiency of the standard bidding policy with respect to attribution. Secondly we learn and utilize an attribution model in the bidder itself and show how it modifies the average bid after a click. Finally we produce evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed method on both offline and online experiments with data spanning several weeks of real traffic from Criteo, a leader in performance advertising.},

abstract = {The increasing use of ad blocking software poses a major threat for publishers in loss of online ad revenue, and for advertisers in the loss of audience. Major publishers have adopted various anti-ad blocking strategies such as denial of access to website content and asking users to subscribe to paid ad-free versions. However, publishers are unsure about the true impact of these strategies [2, 3]. We posit that the real problem lies in the measurement of effectiveness because the existing methods compare metrics after implementation of such strategies with that of metrics just before implementation, making them error prone due to sampling bias. The errors arise due to differences in group compositions across before and after periods, as well as differences in time-period selection for the before measurement. We propose a novel algorithmic method which modifies the difference-in-differences approach to address the sampling bias due to differences in time-period selection. Unlike difference-in-differences, we choose the time-period for comparison in an endogenous manner, as well as, exploit differences in ad blocking tendencies among visitors' arriving on the publisher's site to allow cluster specific choice of the control time-period. We evaluate the method on both synthetic data (which we make available) and proprietary real data from an online publisher and find good support.},

abstract = {In display advertising, users' online ad experiences are important for the advertising effectiveness. However, users have not been well accommodated in real-time bidding (RTB). This further influences their site visits and perception of the displayed banner ads. In this paper, we propose a novel computational framework which brings multimedia metrics, like the contextual relevance, the visual saliency and the ad memorability into RTB to improve the users' ad experiences as well as maintain the benefits of the publisher and the advertiser. We aim at developing a vigorous ecosystem by optimizing the trade-offs among all stakeholders. The framework considers the scenario of a webpage with multiple ad slots. Our experimental results show that the benefits of the advertiser and the user can be significantly improved if the publisher would slightly sacrifice his short-term revenue. The improved benefits will increase the advertising requests (demand) and the site visits (supply), which can further boost the publisher's revenue in the long run.},

We study the problem of setting the optimal reserve price in a Generalized Second Price auction, guided by auction theory with suitable adaptations to social advertising at LinkedIn. Two types of reserve prices are deployed: one at the user level, which is kept private by the publisher, and the other at the audience segment level, which is made public to advertisers. We demonstrate through field experiments the effectiveness of this reserve price mechanism to promote demand growth, increase ads revenue, and improve advertiser experience.},

abstract = {The online ads trading platform plays a crucial role in connecting publishers and advertisers and generates tremendous value in facilitating the convenience of our lives. It has been evolving into a more and more complicated structure. In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the revenue for the seller side via utilizing proper reserve price for the auctions in a dynamical way.Predicting the optimal reserve price for each auction in the repeated auction marketplaces is a non-trivial problem. However, we were able to come up with an efficient method of improving the seller revenue by mainly focusing on adjusting the reserve price for those high-value inventories. Previously, no dedicated work has been performed from this perspective. Inspired by Paul and Michael [16], our model first identifies the value of the inventory by predicting the top bid price bucket using a cascade of classifiers. The cascade is essential in significantly reducing the false positive rate of a single classifier. Based on the output of the first step, we build another cluster of classifiers to predict the price separations between the top two bids. We showed that although the high-value auctions are only a small portion of all the traffic, successfully identifying them and setting correct reserve price would result in a significant revenue lift. Moreover, our optimization is compatible with all other reserve price models in the system and does not impact their performance. In other words, when combined with other models, the enhancement on exchange revenue will be aggregated. Simulations on randomly sampled Yahoo ads exchange (YAXR) data showed stable and expected lift after applying our model.},

abstract = {In performance display advertising, bidders compete on behalf of advertisers for ad impressions, that is, the opportunity to display relevant ads on a publisher website. We consider bidding on behalf of online retailers who buy ad impressions hoping to realize value only from purchases attributed from clicks. The bidder has a two stage problem. In the first stage, the bidder has to select a small subset from a large selection of ads, with the selected ads most likely to lead to purchases. In the second stage, the bidder has to estimate the purchase probability of the selected ads, which can then be used to create bid values. The challenge in the first stage is that a model optimized for purchases also needs to be (near) optimal for clicks, due to the click attribution constraint. The challenge in the second stage is that true probability of purchases is extremely small, and is difficult to accurately model. We propose a ranking model, followed by a calibration method, to sequentially address the two stage problem. We describe how ordinal ranking is a natural fit for the ad selection problem and how to learn a single model by optimizing for purchases, while being (near) optimal for clicks. We then propose a calibration method, which comprises of a novel non-uniform binning technique for empirical probability estimation, in conjunction with calibration functions such as isotonic and polynomial regression and Platt scaling. We provide empirical results on logged events from a major ad network, that demonstrate the superiority of ordinal model over binary classifiers for ranking ads and the superiority of our proposed calibration technique over traditional uniform binning based calibration technique.},

abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in computational advertising is the prediction of click-through and conversion rates for bidding in online advertising auctions. An unaddressed problem in previous approaches is the existence of highly non-uniform misprediction costs. While for model evaluation these costs have been taken into account through recently proposed business-aware offline metrics -- such as the Utility metric which measures the impact on advertiser profit -- this is not the case when training the models themselves. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we formally analyze the relationship between optimizing the Utility metric and the log loss, which is considered as one of the state-of-the-art approaches in conversion modeling. Our analysis motivates the idea of weighting the log loss with the business value of the predicted outcome. We present and analyze a new cost weighting scheme and show that significant gains in offline and online performance can be achieved.},

abstract = {Cost-per-action (CPA), or cost-per-acquisition, has become the primary campaign performance objective in online advertising industry. As a result, accurate conversion rate (CVR) prediction is crucial for any real-time bidding (RTB) platform. However, CVR prediction is quite challenging due to several factors, including extremely sparse conversions, delayed feedback, attribution gaps between the platform and the third party, etc. In order to tackle these challenges, we proposed a practical framework that has been successfully deployed on Yahoo! BrightRoll, one of the largest RTB ad buying platforms. In this paper, we first show that over-prediction and the resulted over-bidding are fundamental challenges for CPA campaigns in a real RTB environment. We then propose a safe prediction framework with conversion attribution adjustment to handle over-predictions and to further alleviate over-bidding at different levels. At last, we illustrate both offline and online experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.},

abstract = {Etsy1 is a global marketplace where people across the world connect to make, buy and sell unique goods. Sellers at Etsy can promote their product listings via advertising campaigns similar to traditional sponsored search ads. Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction is an integral part of online search advertising systems where it is utilized as an input to auctions which determine the final ranking of promoted listings to a particular user for each query. In this paper, we provide a holistic view of Etsy's promoted listings' CTR prediction system and propose an ensemble learning approach which is based on historical or behavioral signals for older listings as well as content-based features for new listings. We obtain representations from texts and images by utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques and employ multimodal learning to combine these different signals. We compare the system to non-trivial baselines on a large-scale real world dataset from Etsy, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model and strong correlations between offline experiments and online performance.

abstract = {We develop an optimization model and corresponding algorithm for the management of a demand-side platform (DSP), whereby the DSP aims to maximize its own profit while acquiring valuable impressions for its advertiser clients. We formulate the problem of profit maximization for a DSP interacting with ad exchanges in a real-time bidding environment in a cost-per-click/cost-per-action pricing model. Our proposed formulation leads to a nonconvex optimization problem due to the joint optimization over both impression allocation and bid price decisions. We use Lagrangian relaxation to develop a tractable convex dual problem, which, due to the properties of second-price auctions, may be solved efficiently with subgradient methods. We propose a two-phase solution procedure, whereby in the first phase we solve the convex dual problem using a subgradient algorithm, and in the second phase we use the previously computed dual solution to set bid prices and then solve a linear optimization problem to obtain the allocation probability variables. On several synthetic examples, we demonstrate that our proposed solution approach leads to superior performance over a baseline method that is used in practice.},

DNNs are able to automatically learn feature interactions; however, they generate all the interactions implicitly, and are not necessarily efficient in learning all types of cross features. In this paper, we propose the Deep &amp; Cross Network (DCN) which keeps the benefits of a DNN model, and beyond that, it introduces a novel cross network that is more efficient in learning certain bounded-degree feature interactions. In particular, DCN explicitly applies feature crossing at each layer, requires no manual feature engineering, and adds negligible extra complexity to the DNN model.
