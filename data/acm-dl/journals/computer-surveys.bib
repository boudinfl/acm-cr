abstract = {This is a survey of a data structures and their use in computer graphics systems. First, the reasons for using data structures are given. Then the sequential, random, and list organizations are discussed, and it is shown how they may be used to build complex data structures. Representative samples of languages specifically designed for creating and manipulating data structures are described next. Finally some typical computer graphics systems and their data structures are described. It is also pointed out that much work remains to be done to develop a satisfactory theoretical foundation for designing data structures.},

abstract = {This paper describes the internal structure of a time-sharing system in some detail. This system is dedicated to providing remote access, and has a simple file structure. It is intended for use in a university type environment where there are many short jobs that will profit from one- or two-second turnaround. Despite its simplicity, this system can serve as a useful introduction to the problems encountered by the designers of any time-sharing system. Included are a discussion of the command language, the hardware organization toward which the design is oriented, the general internal organization, the command sequences, the CPU scheduler, handling of interrupts, the assignment of core space, execution and control of the user's program, backup storage management, and the handling of errors.},

This paper presents a series of ten mini-languages, each of which exposes salient features found in existing programming languages. The value of the mini-languages lies in their brevity of description and the isolation of important linguistic features: in particular, the notions of assignment, transfer of control, functions, parameter passing, type checking, data structures, string manipulation, and input/output. The mini-languages may serve a variety of uses: notably, as a pedagogical tool for teaching programming languages, as a subject of study for the design of programming languages, and as a set of test cases for methods of language implementation or formal definition.},

abstract = {Pipelined computer architecture has received considerable attention since the 1960s when the need for faster and more cost-effective systems became critical. The merit of pipelining is that it can help to match the speeds of various subsystems without duplicating the cost of the entire system involved. As technology evolves, faster and cheaper LSI circuits become available, and the future of pipelining, either in a simple or complex form, becomes more promising.This paper reviews the many theoretical considerations and problems behind pipelining, surveying and comparing various representative pipeline machines that operate in either sequential or vector pipeline mode, the practical solutions adopted, and the tradeoffs involved. The performance of a simple pipe, the physical speed limitation, and the control structures for penalty-incurring events are analyzed separately. The problems faced by the system designers are tackled, including buffering, busing structur, branching, and interrupt handling. Aspects of sequential and vector processing are studied. Fundamental advantages of vector processing are unveiled, and additional requirements (costs) are discussed to establish a criterion for the tradeoff between sequential and vector pipeline processing. Finally, two recent machines (the CRAY-1 and the Amdahl 470 V/6 systems) are presented to demonstrate how complex pipeline techniques can be used and how simple but advantageous pipeline concepts can be exploited.},

abstract = {The rising abuse of computers and increasing threat to personal privacy through data banks have stimulated much interest in the technical safeguards for data. There are four kinds of safeguards, each related to but distinct from the others. Access controls regulate which users may enter the system and subsequently which data sets an active user may read or write. Flow controls regulate the dissemination of values among the data sets accessible to a user. Inference controls protect statistical databases by preventing questioners from deducing confidential information by posing carefully designed sequences of statistical queries and correlating the responses. Statistical data banks are much less secure than most people believe. Data encryption attempts to prevent unauthorized disclosure of confidential information in transit or in storage. This paper describes the general nature of controls of each type, the kinds of problems they can and cannot solve, and their inherent limitations and weaknesses. The paper is intended for a general audience with little background in the area.},

abstract = {During the past ten years, the field of multiple-access
communication has developed into a major area of both practical and
theoretical interest within the field of computer communications.
The multiple-access problem arises from the necessity of sharing a
single communication channel among a community of distributed
users. The distributed algorithm used by the stations to share the
channel is known as the multiple-access protocol. In this paper we
examine the multiple-access problem and various approaches to its
resolution.In this survey we first define the multiple-access problem and
then present the underlying issues and difficulties in achieving
multiple-access communication. A taxonomy for multiple-access
protocols is then developed in order to characterize common
approaches and to provide a framework within which these protocols
can be compared and contrasted. Different proposed protocols are
then described and discussed, and aspects of their performance are
examined. The use of multiple-access protocols for "real- time" or
"time-constrained" communication applications, such as voice
transmission, is examined next. Issues in time-constrained
communication are identified, and recent work in the design of
time-constrained multiple-access protocols is surveyed.},

abstract = {The rapidly evolving field of local network technology has
produced a steady stream of local network products in recent years.
The IEEE 802 standards that are now taking shape, because of their
complexity, do little to narrow the range of alternative technical
approaches and at the same time encourage more vendors into the
field. The purpose of this paper is to present a systematic,
organized overview of the alternative architectures for and design
approaches to local networks.The key elements that determine the cost and performance of a
local network are its topology, transmission medium, and medium
access control protocol. Transmission media include twisted pair,
baseband and broadband coaxial cable, and optical fiber. Topologies
include bus, tree, and ring. Medium access control protocols
include CSMA/CD, token bus, token ring, register insertion, and
slotted ring. Each of these areas is examined in detail,
comparisons are drawn between competing technologies, and the
current status of standards is reported.},

abstract = {Mathematical models when simulating the behavior of physical, chemical, and biological systems often include one or more ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To study the system behavior predicted by a model, these equations are usually solved numerically.Although many of the current methods for solving ODEs were developed around the turn of the century, the past 15 years or so has been a period of intensive research. The emphasis of this survey is on the methods and techniques used in software for solving ODEs.ODEs can be classified as stiff or nonstiff, and may be stiff for some parts of an interval and nonstiff for others. We discuss stiff equations, why they are difficult to solve, and methods and software for solving both nonstiff and stiff equations. We conclude this review by looking at techniques for dealing with special problems that may arise in some ODEs, for example, discontinuities.Although important theoretical developments have also taken place, we report only those developments which have directly affected the software and provide a review of this research. We present the basic concepts involved but assume that the reader has some background in numerical computing, such as a first course in numerical methods.},

Fundamental design principles are exposed through an examination of several early computer music systems, especially the Structured Sound Synthesis Project. A survey of numerous systems, based on the following categories, is presented: compositions and synthesis languages, graphics score editing, performance instruments, digital audio processing tools, and computer-aided instruction in music systems.

Music combines the real-time demands of performance with the intellectual demands of highly developed symbolic systems that are quite different from natural language. The richness and variety of these demands makes the programming language paradigm a natural one in the musical application of computers. This paradigm provides musicians with a fresh perspective on their work. At the same time, music is a very advanced form of human endeavor, making computer music applications a worthy challenge for computer scientists. In this paper we outline the traditional tasks and forms of representation in music, then proceed with a survey of languages that deal with music programming.},

abstract = {Computer music is a relatively new field. While a large proportion of the public is aware of computer music in one form or another, there seems to be a need for a better understanding of its capabilities and limitations in terms of synthesis, performance, and recording hardware. This article addresses that need by surveying and discussing the architecture of existing computer music systems.System requirements vary according to what the system will be used for. Common uses for computer music systems include composition, performance, research, home entertainment, and studio recording/mixing. This paper outlines system components with this wide diversity of possible uses in mind.Current synthesis and analysis techniques, and the different way in which these  techniques can be implemented in special-purpose hardware, are comprehensively reviewed. Design specifications are given for certain digital-to-analog (and analog-to-digital) converters, disk interfaces, system organization, control hardware and software, and numerical precision.Several synthesis systems are described in detail, with an emphasis on theoretical developments and innovative design. Commercial synthesizers and other architectures are also briefly mentioned.},

Current and expected developments are exemplified by the description of "new generation" database query languages. In a practical query language selection problem, the results of this paper can be used for preselecting suitable query language types; the final selection decision will also depend on organization-specific factors, such as the available database management system, hardware and software strategies, and financial system costs.},

abstract = {Our objective is to understand the notion of type in programming languages, present a model of typed, polymorphic programming languages that reflects recent research in type theory, and examine the relevance of recent research to the design of practical programming languages.Object-oriented languages provide both a framework and a motivation for exploring the interaction among the concepts of type, data abstraction, and polymorphism, since they extend the notion of type to data abstraction and since type inheritance is an important form of polymorphism. We develop a λ-calculus-based model for type systems that allows us to explore these interactions in a simple setting, unencumbered by complexities of production programming languages.The evolution of languages from untyped universes to monomorphic and then polymorphic type systems is reviewed. Mechanisms for polymorphism such as overloading, coercion, subtyping, and parameterization are examined. A unifying framework for polymorphic type systems is developed in terms of the typed λ-calculus augmented to include binding of types by quantification as well as binding of values by abstraction.The typed λ-calculus is augmented by universal quantification to model generic functions with type parameters, existential quantification and packaging (information hiding) to model abstract data types, and bounded quantification to model subtypes and type inheritance. In this way we obtain a simple and precise characterization of a powerful type system that includes abstract data types, parametric polymorphism, and multiple inheritance in a single consistent framework. The mechanisms for type checking for the augmented λ-calculus are discussed.The augmented typed λ-calculus is used as a programming language for a variety of illustrative examples. We christen this language Fun because fun instead of λ is the functional abstraction keyword and because it is pleasant to deal with.Fun is mathematically simple and can serve as a basis for the design and implementation of real programming languages with type facilities that are more powerful and expressive than those of existing programming languages. In particular, it provides a basis for the design of strongly typed object-oriented languages.},

Several techniques for deadlock avoidance and deadlock detection are suggested. The focus of this work is on the theory of distributed discrete-event simulation.},

abstract = {A database design methodology is defined for the design of large relational databases. First, the data requirements are conceptualized using an extended entity-relationship model, with the extensions being additional semantics such as ternary relationships, optional relationships, and the generalization abstraction. The extended entity-relationship model is then decomposed according to a set of basic entity-relationship constructs, and these are transformed into candidate relations. A set of basic transformations has been developed for the three types of relations: entity relations, extended entity relations, and relationship relations. Candidate relations are further analyzed and modified to attain the highest degree of normalization desired.The methodology produces database designs that are not only accurate representations of reality, but flexible enough to accommodate future processing requirements. It also reduces the number of data dependencies that must be analyzed, using the extended ER model conceptualization, and maintains data integrity through normalization. This approach can be implemented manually or in a simple software package as long as a "good" solution is acceptable and absolute optimality is not required.},

abstract = {Dataflow machines are programmable computers of which the hardware is optimized for fine-grain data-driven parallel computation. The principles and complications of data-driven execution are explained, as well as the advantages and costs of fine-grain parallelism. A general model for a dataflow machine is presented and the major design options are discussed.Most dataflow machines described in the literature are surveyed on the basis of this model and its associated technology. For general-purpose computing the most promising dataflow machines are those that employ packet-switching communication and support general recursion. Such a recursion mechanism requires an extremely fast mechanism to map a sparsely occupied virtual space to a physical space of realistic size. No solution has yet proved fully satisfactory.A working prototype of one processing element is described in detail. On the basis of experience with this prototype, some of the objections raised against the dataflow approach are discussed. It appears that the overhead due to fine-grain parallelism can be made acceptable by sophisticated compiling and employing special hardware for the storage of data structures. Many computing-intensive programs show sufficient parallelism. In fact, a major problem is to restrain parallelism when machine resources tend to get overloaded. Another issue that requires further investigation is the distribution of computation and data structures over the processing elements.},

abstract = {One of the fundamental principles of the database approach is that a database allows a nonredundant, unified representation of all data managed in an organization. This is achieved only when methodologies are available to support integration across organizational and application boundaries.Methodologies for database design usually perform the design activity by separately producing several schemas, representing parts of the application, which are subsequently merged. Database schema integration is the activity of integrating the schemas of existing or proposed databases into a global, unified schema.The aim of the paper is to provide first a unifying framework for the problem of schema integration, then a comparative review of the work done thus far in this area. Such a framework, with the associated analysis of the existing approaches, provides a basis for identifying strengths and weaknesses of individual methodologies, as well as general guidelines for future improvements and extensions.},

The primitive instancing model, the boundary representation, and the constructive solid geometry model are presented from the viewpoint of database representation. Depending on the representation scheme, one can apply geometric transformations to the stored geometric objects. The standard transformations, scaling, translation, and rotation, are outlined with respect to the data structure aspects. Some of the more recent developments in the area of engineering databases with regard to supporting these representation schemes are then explored, and a classification scheme for technical database management systems is presented that distinguishes the systems according to their level of object orientation: structural or behavioral object orientation. First, several systems that are extensions to the relational model are surveyed, then the functional data model DAPLEX, the nonnormalized relational model NF2, and the database system R2D2 that provides abstract data types in the NF2 model are described.},

abstract = {Traditionally, the interface between a programming language and a database has either been through a set of relatively low-level subroutine calls, or it has required some form of embedding of one language in another. Recently, the necessity of integrating database and programming language techniques has received some long-overdue recognition. In response, a number of attempts have been made to construct programming languages with completely integrated database management systems. These languages, which we term database programming languages, are the subject of this review.The design of these languages is still in its infancy, and the purpose of writing this review is to identify the areas in which further research is required. In particular, we focus on the problems of providing a uniform type system and mechanisms for data to persist. Of particular importance in solving these problems are issues of polymorphism, type inheritance, object identity, and the choice of structures to represent sets of similar values. Our conclusion is that there are areas of programming language research—modules, polymorphism, persistence, and inheritance—that must be developed and applied to achieve the goal of a useful and consistent database programming language. Other research areas of equal importance, such as implementation, transaction handling, and concurrency, are not examined here in any detail.},

abstract = {Most common database management systems represent information in a simple record-based format. Semantic modeling provides richer data structuring capabilities for database applications. In particular, research in this area has articulated a number of constructs that provide mechanisms for representing structurally complex interrelations among data typically arising in commercial applications. In general terms, semantic modeling complements work on knowledge representation (in artificial intelligence) and on the new generation of database models based on the object-oriented paradigm of programming languages.This paper presents an in-depth discussion of semantic data modeling. It reviews the philosophical motivations of semantic models, including the need for high-level modeling abstractions and the reduction of semantic overloading of data type constructors. It then provides a tutorial introduction to the primary components of semantic models, which are the explicit representation of objects, attributes of and relationships among objects, type constructors for building complex types, ISA relationships, and derived schema components. Next, a survey of the prominent semantic models in the literature is presented. Further, since a broad area of research has developed around semantic modeling, a number of related topics based on these models are discussed, including data languages, graphical interfaces, theoretical investigations, and physical implementation strategies.},

A uniform model in which published algorithms can be cast is given, and the fundamental principles on which distributed deadlock detection schemes are based are presented. These principles represent mechanisms for developing distributed algorithms in general and deadlock detection schemes in particular. In addition, a hierarchy of deadlock models is presented; each model is characterized by the restrictions that are imposed upon the form resource requests can assume. The hierarchy includes the well-known models of resource and communication deadlock. Algorithms are classified according to both the underlying principles and the generality of resource requests they permit. A number of algorithms are discussed in detail, and their complexity in terms of the number of messages employed is compared. The point is made that correctness proofs for such algorithms using operational arguments are cumbersome and error prone and, therefore, that only completely formal proofs are sufficient for demonstrating correctness.},

Benefits of object orientation include support for modular design, code sharing, and extensibility. In order to make the most of these advantages, a type theory for objects and their interactions should be developed to aid checking and controlled derivation of programs and to support early binding of code bodies for efficiency. As a step in this direction, this paper surveys a number of existing type theories and examines the manner and extent to which these theories are able to represent the ideas found in object-oriented programming. Of primary interest are the models provided by type theories for abstract data types and inheritance, and the major portion of this paper is devoted to these topics. Code fragments illustrative of the various approaches are provided and discussed. The introduction provides an overview of object-oriented programming and types in programming languages; the summary provides a comparative evaluation of the reviewed typing systems, along with suggestions for future work.},

The different data structures are discussed in terms of how they support the execution of queries involving proximity relations. The focus is on intersection and subset queries. Several types of representations are described. Some are designed for use with the plane-sweep paradigm, which works well for static collections of rectangles. Others are oriented toward dynamic collections. In this case, one representation reduces each rectangle to a point in a higher multidimensional space and treats the problem as one involving point data. The other representation is area based—that is, it depends on the physical extent of each rectangle.},

abstract = {Human-computer interface management, from a computer science viewpoint, focuses on the process of developing quality human-computer interfaces, including their representation, design, implementation, execution, evaluation, and maintenance. This survey presents important concepts of interface management: dialogue independence, structural modeling, representation, interactive tools, rapid prototyping, development methodologies, and control structures. Dialogue independence is the keystone concept upon which all the other concepts depend. It is a characteristic that separates design of the interface from design of the computational component of an application system so that modifications in either tend not to cause changes in the other. The role of a dialogue developer, whose main purpose is to create quality interfaces, is a direct result of the dialogue independence concept. Structural models of the human-computer interface serve as frameworks for understanding the elements of interfaces and for guiding the dialogue developer in their construction. Representation of the human-computer interface is accomplished by a variety of notational schemes for describing the interface. Numerous kinds of interactive tools for human-computer interface development free the dialogue developer from much of the tedium of "coding" dialogue. The early ability to observe behavior of the interface—and indeed that of the whole application system—provided by rapid prototyping increases communication among system designers, implementers, evaluators, and end-users. Methodologies for interactive system development consider interface management to be an integral part of the overall development process and give emphasis to evaluation in the development life cycle. Finally, several types of control structures govern how sequencing among dialogue and computational components is designed and executed. Numerous systems for human-computer interface management are presented t

abstract = {Explanation-based learning (EBL) is a technique by which an intelligent system can learn by observing examples. EBL systems are characterized by the ability to create justified generalizations from single training instances. They are also distinguished by their reliance on background knowledge of the domain under study. Although EBL is usually viewed as a method for performing generalization, it can be viewed in other ways as well. In particular, EBL can be seen as a method that performs four different learning tasks: generalization, chunking, operationalization, and analogy.This paper provides a general introduction to the field of explanation-based learning. Considerable emphasis is placed on showing how EBL combines the four learning tasks mentioned above. The paper begins with a presentation of an intuitive example of the EBL technique. Subsequently EBL is placed in its historical context and the relation between EBL and other areas of machine learning is described. The major part of this paper is a survey of selected EBL programs, which have been chosen to show how EBL manifests each of the four learning tasks.

abstract = {The theory of combinatorial designs has been used in widely different areas of computation concerned with the design and analysis of both algorithms and hardware. Combinatorial designs capture a subtle balancing property that is inherent in many difficult problems and hence can provide a sophisticated tool for addressing these problems. The role of combinatorial designs in solving many problems that are basic to the field of computing is explored in this paper. Case studies of many applications of designs to computation are given; these constitute a first survey, which provides a representative sample of uses of designs. More importantly, they suggest paradigms in which designs can be used profitably in algorithm design and analysis.},

abstract = {Computer games have been around for almost as long as computers. Most of these games, however, have been designed in a rather ad hoc manner because many of their basic components have never been adequately defined. In this paper some deficiencies in the standard model of computer games, the minimax model, are pointed out and the issues that a general theory must address are outlined. Most of the discussion is done in the context of control strategies, or sets of criteria for move selection. A survey of control strategies brings together results from two fields: implementations of real games and theoretical predictions derived on simplified game-trees. The interplay between these results suggests a series of open problems that have arisen during the course of both analytic experimentation and practical experience as the basis for a formal theory.},

abstract = {When distributed systems first appeared, they were programmed in traditional sequential languages, usually with the addition of a few library procedures for sending and receiving messages. As distributed applications became more commonplace and more sophisticated, this ad hoc approach became less satisfactory. Researchers all over the world began designing new programming languages specifically for implementing distributed applications. These languages and their history, their underlying principles, their design, and their use are the subject of this paper.We begin by giving our view of what a distributed system is, illustrating with examples to avoid confusion on this important and controversial point. We then describe the three main characteristics that distinguish distributed programming languages from traditional sequential languages, namely, how they deal with parallelism, communication, and partial failures. Finally, we discuss 15 representative distributed languages to give the flavor of each. These examples include languages based on message passing, rendezvous, remote procedure call, objects, and atomic transactions, as well as functional languages, logic languages, and distributed data structure languages. The paper concludes with a comprehensive bibliography listing over 200 papers on nearly 100 distributed programming languages.},

abstract = {Concurrent logic languages are high-level programming languages for parallel and distributed systems that offer a wide range of both known and novel concurrent programming techniques. Being logic programming languages, they preserve many advantages of the abstract logic programming model, including the logical reading of programs and computations, the convenience of representing data structures with logical terms and manipulating them using unification, and the amenability to metaprogramming. Operationally, their model of computation consists of a dynamic set of concurrent processes, communicating by instantiating shared logical variables, synchronizing by waiting for variables to be instantiated, and making nondeterministic choices, possibly based on the availability of values of variables.This paper surveys the family of concurrent logic programming languages within a uniform operational framework. It demonstrates the expressive power of even the simplest language in the family and investigates how varying the basic synchronization and control constructs affect the expressiveness and efficiency of the resulting languages.In addition, the paper reports on techniques for sequential and parallel implementation of languages in this family, mentions their applications to date, and relates these languages to the abstract logic programming model, to the programming language PROLOG, and to other concurrent computational models and programming languages.},

abstract = {We present a framework for parallel programming, based on three conceptual classes for understanding parallelism and three programming paradigms for implementing parallel programs. The conceptual classes are result parallelism, which centers on parallel computation of all elements in a data structure; agenda parallelism, which specifies an agenda of tasks for parallel execution; and specialist parallelism, in which specialist agents solve problems cooperatively. The programming paradigms center on live data structures that transform themselves into result data structures; distributed data structures that are accessible to many processes simultaneously; and message passing, in which all data objects are encapsulated within explicitly communicating processes. There is a rough correspondence between the conceptual classes and the programming methods, as we discuss. We begin by outlining the basic conceptual classes and programming paradigms, and by sketching an example solution under each of the three paradigms. The final section develops a simple example in greater detail, presenting and explaining code and discussing its performance on two commercial parallel computers, an 18-node shared-memory multiprocessor, and a 64-node distributed-memory hypercube. The middle section bridges the gap between the abstract and the practical by giving an overview of how the basic paradigms are implemented.We focus on the paradigms, not on machine architecture or programming languages: The programming methods we discuss are useful on many kinds of parallel machine, and each can be expressed in several different parallel programming languages. Our programming discussion and the examples use the parallel language C-Linda for several reasons: The main paradigms are all simple to express in Linda; efficient Linda implementations exist on a wide variety of parallel machines; and a wide variety of parallel programs have been written in Linda.},

The fundamental premises on which the functional programming methodology stands are critically analyzed with respect to philosophical, theoretical, and pragmatic concerns. Particular attention is paid to the main features that characterize modern functional languages: higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, equations and pattern matching, strong static typing and type inference, and data abstraction. In addition, current research areas—such as parallelism, nondeterminism, input/output, and state-oriented computations—are examined with the goal of predicting the future development and application of functional languages.},

abstract = {The main problems associated with debugging concurrent programs are increased complexity, the "probe effect," nonrepeatability, and the lack of a synchronized global clock. The probe effect refers to the fact that any attempt to observe the behavior of a distributed system may change the behavior of that system. For some parallel programs, different executions with the same data will result in different results even without any attempt to observe the behavior. Even when the behavior can be observed, in many systems the lack of a synchronized global clock makes the results of the observation difficult to interpret. This paper discusses these and other problems related to debugging concurrent programs and presents a survey of current techniques used in debugging concurrent programs. Systems using three general techniques are described: traditional or breakpoint style debuggers, event monitoring systems, and static analysis systems. In addition, techniques for limiting, organizing, and displaying a large amount of data produced by the debugging systems are discussed.},

A comparison of different methods on the same sample texts is included, along with an analysis of future research directions.},

Security-control methods suggested in the literature are classified into four general approaches: conceptual, query restriction, data perturbation, and output perturbation.Criteria for evaluating the performance of the various security-control methods are identified. Security-control methods that are based on each of the four approaches are discussed, together with their performance with respect to the identified evaluation criteria. A detailed comparative analysis of the most promising methods for protecting dynamic-online statistical databases is also presented.To date no single security-control method prevents both exact and partial disclosures. There are, however, a few perturbation-based methods that prevent exact disclosure and enable the database administrator to exercise "statistical disclosure control." Some of these methods, however introduce bias into query responses or suffer from the 0/1 query-set-size problem (i.e., partial disclosure is possible in case of null query set or a query set of size 1).We recommend directing future research efforts toward developing new methods that prevent exact disclosure and provide statistical-disclosure control, while at the same time do not suffer from the bias problem and the 0/1 query-set-size problem. Furthermore, efforts directed toward developing a bias-correction mechanism and solving the general problem of small query-set-size would help salvage a few of the current perturbation-based methods.},

The emphasis is on the contribution of software to these areas. Section 2 reviews current approaches to software fault tolerance. It discusses why some of the assumptions underlying hardware fault tolerance do not hold for software. It argues that the current software fault tolerance techniques are more accurately thought of as delayed debugging than as fault tolerance. It goes on to show that in providing both backtracking and executable specifications, logic programming offers most of the tools currently used in software fault tolerance. Section 3 presents a generalization of the recovery block approach to software fault tolerance, called resourceful systems. Systems are resourceful if they are able to determine whether they have achieved their goals or, if not, to develop and carry out alternate plans. Section 3 develops an approach to designing resourceful systems based upon a functionally rich architecture and an explicit goal orientation.},

The problems of correctly starting and stopping such simulation experiments to obtain the required statistical accuracy of the results are addressed. In this survey of possible solutions, the emphasis is put on possible applications in the sequential analysis of output data, which adaptively decides about continuing a simulation experiment until the required accuracy of results is reached.

abstract = {Database systems were a solution to the problem of shared access to heterogeneous files created by multiple autonomous applications in a centralized environment. To make data usage easier, the files were replaced by a globally integrated database. To a large extent, the idea was successful, and many databases are now accessible through local and long-haul networks. Unavoidably, users now need shared access to multiple autonomous databases. The question is what the corresponding methodology should be. Should one reapply the database approach to create globally integrated distributed database systems or should a new approach be introduced?We argue for a new approach to solving such data management system problems, called multidatabase or   federated systems. These systems make databases interoperable, that is, usable without a globally integrated schema. They preserve the autonomy of each database yet support shared access.Systems of this type will be of major importance in the future. This paper first discusses why this is the case. Then, it presents methodologies for their design. It further shows that major commerical relational database systems are evolving toward multidatabase systems. The paper discusses their capabilities and limitations, presents and discusses a set of prototypes, and, finally, presents some current research issues.},

We do not propose yet another model but provide a common terminology and collection   of mechanisms that underlie any approach for representing engineering design information in a database.

A typical configuration for a DFS is a collection of workstations and mainframes connected by a local area network (LAN). A DFS is implemented as part of the operating system of each of the connected computers. This paper establishes a viewpoint that emphasizes the dispersed structure and decentralization of both data and control in the design of such systems. It defines the concepts of transparency, fault tolerance, and scalability and discusses them in the context of DFSs. The paper claims that the principle of distributed operation is fundamental for a fault tolerant and scalable DFS design. It also presents   alternatives for the semantics of sharing and methods for providing access to remote files. A survey of contemporary UNIX-based systems, namely, UNIX United, Locus, Sprite, Sun's Network File System, and ITC's Andrew, illustrates the concepts and demonstrates various implementations and design alternatives. Based on the assessment of these systems, the paper makes the point that a departure from the extending centralized file systems over a communication network is necessary to accomplish sound distributed file system design.},

abstract = {Floating-point arithmetic is considered as esoteric subject by many people. This is rather surprising, because floating-point is ubiquitous in computer systems: Almost every language has a floating-point datatype; computers from PCs to supercomputers have floating-point accelerators; most compilers will be called upon to compile floating-point algorithms from time to time; and virtually every operating system must respond to floating-point exceptions such as overflow. This paper presents a tutorial on the aspects of floating-point that have a direct impact on designers of computer systems. It begins with background on floating-point representation and rounding error, continues with a discussion of the IEEE floating point standard, and concludes with examples of how computer system builders can better support floating point.},

Such programs typically execute on network architectures such as networks of workstations or distributed memory parallel machines (i.e., multicomputers such as hypercubes). Several paradigms—examples or models—for process interaction in distributed computations are described. These include networks of filters, clients, and servers, heartbeat algorithms, probe/echo algorithms, broadcast algorithms, token-passing algorithms, decentralized servers, and bags of tasks. These paradigms are appliable to numerous practical problems. They are illustrated by solving problems, including parallel sorting, file servers, computing the topology of a network, distributed termination  detection, replicated databases, and parallel adaptive quadrature. Solutions to all problems are derived in a step-wise fashion from a general specification of the problem to a concrete solution. The derivations illustrate techniques for developing distributed algorithms.},

Five major algorithms for placement are discussed: simulated annealing, force-directed placement, min-cut placement, placement by numerical optimization, and evolution-based placement. The first two classes of algorithms owe their origin to physical laws, the third and fourth are analytical techniques, and the fifth class of algorithms is derived from biological phenomena.

It facilitates the retrieval of information from two different relations based on a Cartesian product of the two relations. The join is one of the most diffidult operations to implement efficiently, as no predefined links between relations are required to exist (as they are with network and hierarchical systems). The join is the only relational algebra operation that allows the combining of related tuples from relations on different attribute schemes. Since it is executed frequently and is expensive, much research effort has been applied to the optimization of join processing. In this paper, the different kinds of joins and the various implementation techniques are surveyed. These different methods are classified based on how they partition tuples from different relations. Some require that all tuples from one be compared to all tuples from another; other algorithms only compare some tuples from each. In addition, some techniques perform an explicit partitioning, whereas others are implicit.},

abstract = {Software reuse is the process of creating software systems from existing software rather than building software systems from scratch. This simple yet powerful vision was introduced in 1968. Software reuse has, however, failed to become a standard software engineering practice. In an attempt to understand why, researchers have renewed their interest in software reuse and in the obstacles to implementing it.This paper surveys the different approaches to software reuse found in the research literature. It uses a taxonomy to describe and compare the different approaches and make generalizations about the field of software reuse. The taxonomy characterizes each reuse approach in terms of its reusable artifacts and the way these artifacts are abstracted, selected, specialized, and integrated.Abstraction plays a central role in software reuse. Concise and expressive abstractions are essential if software artifacts are to be effectively reused. The effectiveness of a reuse technique can be evaluated in terms of cognitive distance—an intuitive gauge of the intellectual effort required to use the technique. Cognitive distance is reduced in two ways: (1) Higher level abstractions in a reuse technique reduce the effort required to go from the initial concept of a software system to representations in the reuse technique, and (2) automation reduces the effort required to go from abstractions in a reuse technique to an executable implementation.This survey will help answer the following questions: What is software reuse? Why reuse software? What are the different approaches to reusing software? How effective are the different approaches? What is required to implement a software reuse technology? Why is software reuse difficult? What are the open areas for research in software reuse?},

Furthermore, the complexity of the simulation program is improved from Θmn/Hn) to Θ(m + n log n) (where m is typically much larger than n), giving a much faster simulation program and therefore more data per unit of computation time.

A number of operations on Boolean functions can be implemented as graph algorithms on OBDD data structures. Using OBDDs, a wide variety of problems can be solved through symbolic analysis. First, the possible variations in system parameters and operating conditions are encoded with Boolean variables. Then the system is evaluated for all variations by a sequence of OBDD operations. Researchers have thus solved a number of problems in digital-system design, finite-state system analysis, artificial intelligence, and mathematical logic. This paper describes the OBDD data structure and surveys a number of applications that have been solved by OBDD-based symbolic analysis.},

abstract = {Registration is a fundamental task in image processing used to match two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Virtually all large systems which evaluate images require the registration of images, or a closely related operation, as an intermediate step. Specific examples of systems where image registration is a significant component include matching a target with a real-time image of a scene for target recognition, monitoring global land usage using satellite images, matching stereo images to recover shape for autonomous navigation, and aligning images from different medical modalities for diagnosis.Over the years, a broad range of techniques has been developed for various types of data and problems.  These techniques have been independently studied for several different applications, resulting in a large body of research. This paper organizes this material by establishing the relationship between the variations in the images and the type of registration techniques which can most appropriately be applied. Three major types of variations are distinguished. The first type are the variations due to the differences in acquisition which cause the images to be misaligned. To register images, a spatial transformation is found which will remove these variations. The class of transformations which must be searched to find the optimal transformation is determined by knowledge about the variations of this type. The transformation class in turn influences the general technique that should be taken. The second type of variations are those which are also due to differences in acquisition, but cannot be modeled easily such as lighting and atmospheric conditions. This type usually effects intensity values, but they may also be spatial, such as perspective distortions. The third type of variations are differences in the images that are of interest such as object movements, growths, or other scene changes. Variations of the second and third type are not directly removed by registration, but they make registration more difficult since an exact match is no longer possible. In particular, it is critical that variations of the third type are not removed. Knowledge about the characteristics of each type of variation effect the choice of feature space, similarity measure, search space,  and search strategy which will make up the final technique. All registration techniques can be viewed as different combinations of these choices. This framework is useful for understanding the merits and relationships between the wide variety of existing techniques and for assisting in the selection of the most suitable technique for a specific problem.},

abstract = {Research aimed at correcting words in text has focused on three progressively more difficult problems:(1) nonword error detection; (2) isolated-word error correction; and (3) context-dependent work correction. In response to the first problem, efficient pattern-matching and n-gram analysis techniques have been developed for detecting strings that do not appear in a given word list. In response to the second problem, a variety of general and application-specific spelling correction techniques have been developed. Some of them were based on detailed studies of spelling error patterns. In response to the third problem, a few experiments using natural-language-processing tools or statistical-language models have been carried out. This article surveys documented findings on spelling error patterns, provides descriptions of various nonword detection and isolated-word error correction techniques, reviews the state of the art of context-dependent word correction techniques, and discusses research issues related to all three areas of automatic error correction in text.},

abstract = {In 1973 Dijkstra introduced to computer science the notion of self-stabilization in the context of distributed systems. He defined a system as self-stabilizing when “regardless of its initial state, it is guaranteed to arrive at a legitimate state in a finite number of steps.” A system which is not self-stabilizing may stay in an illegitimate state forever. Dijkstra's notion of self-stabilization, which originally had a very narrow scope of application, is proving to encompass a formal and unified approach to fault tolerance under a model of transient failures for distributed systems. In this paper we define self-stabilization, examine its significance in the context of fault tolerance, define the important research themes that have arisen from it, and discuss the relevant results. In addition to the issues arising from Dijkstra's original presentation as well as several related issues, we discuss methodologies for designing self-stabilizing systems, the role of compilers with respect to self-stabilization, and some of the factors that prevent self-stabilization.},

Thus, efficient algorithms for accessing and manipulating large sets and sequences will be required to provide acceptable performance. The advent of object-oriented and extensible database systems will not solve this problem. On the contrary, modern data models exacerbate the problem: In order to manipulate large sets of complex objects as efficiently as today's database systems manipulate simple records, query-processing algorithms and software will become more complex, and a solid understanding of algorithm and architectural issues is essential for the designer of database management software.This survey provides a foundation for the design and implementation of query execution facilities in new database management systems. It describes a wide array of practical query evaluation techniques for both relational and postrelational database systems, including iterative execution of complex query evaluation plans, the duality of sort- and hash-based set-matching algorithms, types of parallel query execution and their implementation, and special operators for emerging database application domains.},

abstract = {The development of computing applications by the people who have direct need for them in their work has become commonplace. During the 1980s, development of applications by “end users” accelerated and became a key management and research concern. Known as “end-user computing,” the phenomena and research associated with this trend cross a variety of disciplines. This article critically surveys the published literature on end-user computing (EUC) management according to a comprehensive research model. The article introduces the EUC management research model, identifies prior research contributions, and offers guideline for the future. The focal points of the model are two EUC management components which represent two different levels of theorizing found in the literature. The first level focuses on the organization factors of strategy, technology, and management action. The second level focuses on the individual factors of end user, task, tool, and end-user action. The remainder of the model includes factors typically investigated as the antecedents (context) and consequences (outcomes) of EUC. More than 90 English-language articles published from 1983-1990 are mapped into the model. Specific variables for each factor are identified; research streams are interpreted; findings are synthesized; and gaps in our knowledge are highlighted. We then raise a number of substantive and methodological issues that need to be addressed and suggest two themes we envision as important for EUC management research in the 1990s: EUC as an extension of organizational computing and EUC as a social learning phenomenon. Guidance is offered for using these theme to inform future research.},

Research in this area uses and extends ideas about coordination from disciplines such as computer science, organization theory, operations research, economics, linguistics, and psychology.A key insight of the framework presented here is that coordination can be seen as the process of managing dependencies among activities. Further progress, therefore, should be possible by characterizing different kinds of dependencies and identifying the coordination processes that can be used to manage them. A variety of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and commonalities across disciplines  are identified. Processes analyzed include those for managing shared resources, producer/consumer relationships, simultaneity constraints, and task/subtask dependencies.Section 3 summarizes ways of applying a coordination perspective in three different domains:(1) understanding the effects of information technology on human organizations and markets, (2) designing cooperative work tools, and (3) designing distributed and parallel computer systems. In the final section, elements of a research agenda in this new area are briefly outlined.},

The PRAM has long been acknowledged to be a useful tool for the study of parallel computing, but unfortunately it is not physically implementable in hardware. In order to take advantage of the broad base of algorithms and results regarding this high-level abstraction one needs general methods for allowing the execution of PRAM algorithms on more realistic machines. In the following we survey these methods, which we refer to as PRAM simulation techniques. The general issues of memory management and routing are discussed, and both randomized and deterministic solutions are considered. We show that good theoretical solutions to many of the subproblems in PRAM simulation have been developed, though questions still exist as to their practical utility. This article should allow those performing research in this field to become well acquainted with the current state of the art, while allowing the novice to get an intuitive feeling for the fundamental questions being considered. The introduction should provide a concise tutorial for those unfamiliar with the problem of PRAM simulation.},

Next, the article describes seven disk array architectures, called RAID (Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks) levels 0–6 and compares their  performance, cost, and reliability. It goes on to discuss advanced research and implementation topics such as refining the basic RAID levels to improve performance and designing algorithms to maintain data consistency.

One approach to this problem is to utilize parallel processing, taking advantage of the concurrency available in the VLSI system to accelerate the logic simulation task.Parallel logic simulation has received a great deal of attention over the past several years, but this work has not yet resulted in effective, high-performance simulators being available to VLSI designers. A number of techniques have been developed to investigate performance issues: formal models, performance modeling, empirical studies, and prototype implementations. Analyzing reported results of these techniques, we conclude that five major factors affect performance: synchronization algorithm, circuit structure, timing granularity, target architecture, and partitioning. After reviewing techniques for parallel simulation, we consider each of these factors using results reported in the literature. Finally we synthesize the results and present directions for future research in the field.},

abstract = {In the last three decades a large number of compiler transformations for optimizing programs have been implemented. Most optimizations for uniprocessors reduce the number of instructions executed by the program using transformations based on the analysis of scalar quantities and data-flow techniques. In contrast, optimizations for high-performance superscalar, vector, and parallel processors maximize parallelism and memory locality with transformations that rely on tracking the properties of arrays using loop dependence analysis.This survey is a comprehensive overview of the important high-level program restructuring techniques for imperative languages, such as C and Fortran. Transformations for both sequential and various types of parallel architectures are covered in depth. We describe the purpose of each transformation, explain how to determine if it is legal, and give an example of its application.Programmers wishing to enhance the performance of their code can use this survey to improve their understanding of the optimizations that compilers can perform, or as a reference for techniques to be applied manually. Students can obtain an overview of optimizing compiler technology. Compiler writers can use this survey as a reference for most of the important optimizations developed to date, and as bibliographic reference for the details of each optimization. Readers are expected to be familiar with modern computer architecture and basic program compilation techniques.},

Given an n-point set P in the plane, build a data structure so that, given a query triangle R, the number of points of P lying in R can be determined quickly. Similar questions can be asked for point sets in higher dimensions, with triangles replaced by simplices or by more complicated shapes. Algorithms of this type are of crucial importance in computational geometry, as they can be used as subroutines in solutions to many seemingly unrelated problems, which are often motivated by practical applications, for instance in computer graphics (ray tracing, hidden-surface removal etc.).

There has been a recent proliferation of research suggesting the application of object-oriented techniques to facilitate the complex task of designing and implementing MDBSs. Although this approach seems promising, the lack of a general framework impedes any further development. The goal of this paper is to provide a concrete analysis and categorization of the various ways in which object orientation has affected the task of designing and implementing MDBSs.We identify three dimensions in which the object-oriented paradigm has influenced this task: the general system architecture, the schema architecture, and the heterogeneous transaction management. Then we provide a classification and a comprehensive analysis of the issues related to each of the above dimensions. To demonstrate the applicability of this analysis, we conclude with a comparative review of existing multidatabase systems.},

They have been applied to a great number of systems automatically producing language implementations from their specifications. The systems and their specification languages can be evaluated and classified according to their level of application support, linguistic characteristics, and degree of automation.A survey of attribute grammar-based specification languages is given. The modern advanced specification languages extend the core attribute grammar model with concepts and primitives from established programming paradigms. The main ideas behind the developed attribute grammar paradigms are discussed, and representative specification languages are presented with a common example grammar. The presentation is founded on mapping elements of attribute grammars to their counterparts in programming languages. This methodology of integrating two problem-solving disciplines together is explored with a classification of the paradigms into structured, modular, object-oriented, logic, and functional attribute grammars. The taxonomy is complemented by introducing approaches based on an implicit parallel or incremental attribute evaluation paradigm.},

abstract = {Two-dimensional image motion is the projection of the three-dimensional motion of objects, relative to a visual sensor, onto its image plane. Sequences of time-orderedimages allow the estimation of projected two-dimensional image motion as either instantaneous image velocities or discrete image displacements. These are usually called the optical flow field or the image velocity field. Provided that optical flow is a reliable approximation to two-dimensional image motion, it may then be used to recover the three-dimensional motion of the visual sensor (to within a scale factor) and the three-dimensional surface structure (shape or relative depth) through assumptions concerning the structure of the optical flow field, the three-dimensional environment, and the motion of the sensor. Optical flow may also be used to perform motion detection, object segmentation, time-to-collision and focus of expansion calculations, motion compensated encoding, and stereo disparity measurement. We investigate the computation of optical flow in this survey: widely known methods for estimating optical flow are classified and examined by scrutinizing the hypothesis and assumptions they use. The survey concludes with a discussion of current research issues.},

abstract = {Utilizing parallelism at the instruction level is an important way to improve performance. Because the time spent in loop execution dominates total execution time, a large body of optimizations focuses on decreasing the time to execute each iteration. Software pipelining is a technique that reforms the loop so that a faster execution rate is realized. Iterations are executed in overlapped fashion to increase parallelism.Let {ABC}n represent a loop containing operations A, B, C that is executed n times. Although the operations of a single iteration can be parallelized, more parallelism may be achieved if the entire loop is considered rather than a single iteration. The software pipelining transformation utilizes the fact that a loop {ABC}n is equivalent to A{BCA}n−1BC. Although the operations contained in the loop do not change, the operations are from different iterations of the original loop.Various algorithms for software pipelining exist. A comparison of the alternative methods for software pipelining is presented. The relationships between the methods are explored and possibilities for improvement highlighted.},

Yet inheritance of often hailed as a solution to many problems hampering software development, and many of the alleged benefits of object-oriented programming, such as improved conceptual modeling and reusability, are largely credited to it. This article aims at a comprehensive understanding of inheritance, examining its usage, surveying its varieties, and presenting a simple taxonomy of mechanisms that can be seen as underlying different inheritance models.},

abstract = {Floating-point divide and square-root operations are essential to many scientific and engineering applications, and are required in all computer systems that support the IEEE floating-point standard. Yet many current microprocessors provide only weak support for these operations. The latency and throughput of division are typically far inferior to those of floating-point addition and multiplication, and square-root performance is often even lower. This article argues the case for high-performance division and square root. It also explains the algorithms and implementations of the primary techniques, subtractive and multiplicative methods, employed in microprocessor floating-point units with their associated area/performance tradeoffs. Case studies of representative floating-point unit configurations are presented, supported by simulation results using a carefully selected benchmark, Givens rotation, to show the dynamic performance impact of the various implementation alternatives. The topology of the implementation is found to be an important performance factor. Multiplicative algorithms, such as the Newton-Raphson method and Goldschmidt's algorithm, can achieve low latencies. However, these implementations serialize multiply, divide, and square root operations through a single pipeline, which can lead to low throughput. While this hardware sharing yields low size requirements for baseline implementations, lower-latency versions require many times more area. For these reasons, multiplicative implementations are best suited to cases where subtractive methods are precluded by area constraints, and modest performance on divide and square root operations is tolerable. Subtractive algorithms, exemplified by radix-4 SRT and radix-16 SRT, can be made to execute in parallel with other floating-point operations.},

abstract = {Partial evaluation provides a unifying paradigm for a broad spectrum of work in program optimization compiling interpretation and the generation of automatic program generators [Bj\o{}rner et al. 1987; Ershov 1992; and Jones et al. 1993]. It is a program optimization technique, perhaps better called program specialization, closely related to but different from J\o{}rring and Scherlis' staging transformations [1986]. It emphasizes, in comparison with Burstall and Darlington [1977] and J\o{}rring and Scherlis [1986] and other program transformation work, full automation and the generation of program generators as well as transforming single programs. Much partial evaluation work to date has concerned automatic compiler generation from an interpretive definition of programming language, but it also has important applications to scientific computing, logic programming, metaprogramming, and expert systems; some pointers are given later.},

Since these techniques search the state space of the protocol exhaustively, the amount of memory required to manipulate that state information and the verification time grow very fast with the number of processors and the complexity of the protocol mechanisms. To be successful for systems of arbitrary complexity, a verification technique must solve this so-called state space explosion problem. The emphasis of our discussion is onthe underlying theory in each method of handling the state space exposion problem, and formulationg and checking the safety properties (e.g., data consistency) and the liveness properties (absence of deadlock and livelock). We compare the efficiency and discuss the limitations of each technique in terms of memory and computation time. Also, we discuss issues of generality, applicability, automaticity, and amenity for existing tools in each class of methods. No method is truly superior because each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. Finally, refinements that can further reduce the verification time and/or the memory requirement are also discussed.},

One such method, trace-driven memory simulation, has been the subject of intense interest among researchers and has, as a result, enjoyed rapid development and substantial improvements during the past decade. This article surveys and analyzes these developments by establishing criteria for evaluating trace-driven methods, and then applies these criteria to describe, categorize, and compare over 50 trace-driven simulation tools. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches and show that no single method is best when all criteria, including accuracy, speed,  memory, flexibility, portability, expense, and ease of use are considered. In a concluding section, we examine fundamental limitations to trace-driven simulation, and survey some recent developments in memory simulation that may overcome these bottlenecks.},

abstract = {Machine interpretation of the shape of a component for CAD databases is an important problem in CAD/CAM, computer vision, and intelligent manufacturing. It can be used in CAD/CAM for evaluation of designs, in computer vision for machine recognition and machine inspection of objects, and in intelligent manufacturing for automating and integrating the link between design and manufacturing. This topic has been an active area of research since the late '70s, and a significant number of computational methods have been proposed to identify portions of the geometry of a part having engineering significance (here called “features”). However, each proposed mechanism has been able to solve the problem only for components within a restricted geometric domain (such as polyhedral   components), or only for components whose features interact with each other in a restricted manner. The purposes of this article are to review and summarize the development of research on machine recognition of features from CAD data, to discuss the advantages and potential problems of each approach, and to point out some of the promising directions future investigations may take. Since most work in this field has focused on machining features, the article primarily covers those features associated with the manufacturing domain. In order to better understand the state of the art, methods of automated feature recognition are divided into the following categories of methods based on their approach: graph-based, syntactic pattern recognition, rule-based, and volumetric. Within each category  we have studied issues such as the definition of features, mechanisms developed for recognition of features, the application scope, and the assumptions made. In addition, the problem is addressed from the perspective of information input requirements and the advantages and disadvantages of boundary representation, constructive solid geometry (CSG), and 2D drawings with respect to machine recognition of features are examined. Emphasis is placed on the mechanisms for attacking problems associated with interacting features.},

abstract = {Texture mapping has become a popular tool in the computer graphics industry in the last few years because it is an easy way to achieve a high degree of realism in computer-generated imagery with very little effort. Over the last decade, texture-mapping techniques have advanced to the point where it is possible to generate real-time perspective simulations of real-world areas by texture mapping every object surface with texture from photographic images of these real-world areas. The techniques for generating such perspective transformations are variations on traditional texture mapping that in some circles have become known as the Image Perspective Transformation or IPT technology. This article first presents a background survey of traditional texture mapping. It then  continues with a description of the texture-mapping variations that achieve these perspective transformations of photographic images of real-world scenes. The style of the presentation is that of a resource survey rather thatn an in-depth analysis.},

abstract = {We survey parallel programming models and languages using six criteria to assess their suitability for realistic portable parallel programming. We argue that an ideal model should by easy to program, should have a software development methodology, should be architecture-independent, should be easy to understand, should guarantee performance, and should provide accurate information about the cost of programs. These criteria reflect our belief that developments in parallelism must be driven by a parallel software industry based on portability and efficiency. We consider programming models in six categories, depending on the level of abstraction they provide. Those that are very abstract conceal even the presence of parallelism at the software level. Such models make software easy to  build and port, but efficient and predictable performance is usually hard to achieve. At the other end of the spectrum, low-level models make all of the messy issues of parallel programming explicit (how many threads, how to place them, how to express communication, and how to schedule communication), so that software is hard to build and not very portable, but is usually efficient. Most recent models are near the center of this spectrum, exploring the best tradeoffs between expressiveness and performance. A few models have achieved both abstractness and efficiency. Both kinds of models raise the possibility of parallelism as part of the mainstream of computing.},

abstract = {Search operations in databases require special support at the physical level. This is true for conventional databases as well as spatial databases, where typical search operations include the point query (find all objects that contain a given search point) and the region query (find all objects that overlap a given search region). More than ten years of spatial database research have resulted in a great variety of multidimensional access methods to support such operations. We give an overview of that work. After a brief survey of spatial data management in general, we first present the class of point access methods, which are used to search sets of points in two or more dimensions. The second part of the paper is devoted to  spatial access methods to handle extended objects, such as rectangles or polyhedra. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and experimental results concerning the relative performance of various approaches.},

We distinguish among the library approach, the integrative approach, and the reflective approach. The library approach applies object-oriented concepts, as they are, to structure concurrent and distributed systems through class libraries. The integrative approach consists of merging concepts such as object and activity, message passing, and transaction, etc. The reflective approach integrates class libraries intimately within an object-based programming language. We discuss and illustrate each of these and point out their complementary levels and goals.},

abstract = {Wormhole routing has emerged as the most widely used switching technique in massively parallel computers. We present a detailed survey of various techniques for enhancing the performance and reliability of wormhole-routing schemes in directly connected networks. We start with an overview of the direct network topologies and a comparison of various switching techniques. Next, the characteristics of the wormhole routing mechanism are described in detail along with the theory behind deadlock-free routing. The performance of routing algorithms depends on the selection of the path between the source and the destination, the network traffic, and the router design. The routing algorithms are implemented in the router chips. We outline the router characteristics and describe the  functionality of various elements of the router. Depending on the usage of paths between the source and the destination, routing algorithms are classified as deterministic, fully adaptive, and partially adaptive. We discuss several representative algorithms for all these categories. The algorithms within each category vary in terms of resource requirements and performance under various traffic conditions. The main difference among various adaptive routing schemes is the technique used to avoid deadlocks. We also discuss a few algorithms based on deadlock recovery techniques. Along with performance, fault tolerance is essential for message routing in multicomputers, and we thus discuss several fault-tolerant wormhole routing algorithms along with their fault-handling capabilities. These  routing schemes enable a message to reach its destination even in the presence of faults in the network. The implementation details of wormhole routing algorithms in contemporary commercial systems are also discussed. We conclude by itemizing several future directions and open issues.},

This paper aims at structuring the area and thus guiding readers into this interesting field. We use a formal approach to define important terms like fault, fault tolerance, and redundancy. This leads to four distinct forms of fault tolerance and to two main phases in achieving them: detection and correction. We show that this can help to reveal inherently fundamental structures that contribute to understanding and unifying methods and terminology. By doing this, we survey many existing methodologies and discuss their relations. The underlying system model is the   close-to-reality asynchronous message-passing model of distributed computing.},

The comparison is based on a collection of important performance criteria, including the space consumed, update processing, and query time for representative queries. The comparison is based on worst-case analysis, hence no assumptions on data distribution or query frequencies are made. When a number of methods have the same asymptotic worst-case behavior, features in the methods that affect average case behavior are discussed. Additional criteria examined are the pagination of an index, the ability to cluster related data together, and the ability to efficiently separate old from current data (so that larger archival storage media such as write-once optical disks can be  used). The purpose of the paper is to identify the difficult problems in accessing temporal data and describe how the different methods aim to solve them. A general lower bound for answering basic temporal queries is also introduced.},

This infrastructure captures the interactions between users (as video, text, audio and other data streams) and promotes a philosophy of filtering, archiving, and correlating collaborative sessions in user and context sensitive groupings. The semantic multicast service efficiently disseminates relevant information to every user engaged in the collaborative session, making the aggregated streams of the collaborative session available to the correct users at the right amount of detail. This contextual focus is accomplished by introducing proxy servers to gather,  annotate, and filter the streams appropriate for specific interest groups. Users are subscribed to appropriate proxies, based on their profiles, and the collaborative session becomes a multi-level multicast of data from sources through proxies and to user interest groups.},

abstract = {In distributed collaborative virtual environments, participants are often embodied or represented in some form within a virtual world. The representations take many different forms and are often driven by limitations in the available technology. Desktop Web based environments typically use textual or two dimensional representations, while high end environments use motion trackers to embody a participant and their actions in an avatar or human form. This paper describes this wide range of virtual user representations and their creation and performance issues investigated as part of the Human-Computer Symbiotes project within DARPA's Intelligent Collaboration and Visualization (IC&amp;V) program.},

abstract = {Effective collaboration in fast-changing environment can put great dem ands on a collaborator's time. Therefore, information retrieval and filtering tools for these environments should impose as little on that time as possible. Not only should they exclude as many irrelevant documents as possible from those presented to the user (to avoid the time wasted sorting through and reading those documents), they should also minimize the user's effort in characterizing his or her information needs. The goal of the Task-based Information Distribution Environment (TIDE) system is to achieve these objectives by explicitly representing each collaborator's current task and using those representations to deliver documents that meet the information needs implied by those tasks. It does this by treating  information gathering as a diagnosis problem, in which the situation (i.e., the current state of beliefs about various questions related to a task) leads probabilistically to test that will provide the most evidence toward reaching a diagnosis (i.e., a description of the documents most likely to be useful to that task). It encodes tasks as nodes in a Bayesian network, and computes document descriptions based on the probabilistic relationship among tasks and their corresponding information requirements.},

abstract = {Clustering is the unsupervised classification of patterns (observations, data items, or feature vectors) into groups (clusters). The clustering problem has been addressed in many contexts and by researchers in many disciplines; this reflects its broad appeal and usefulness as one of the steps in exploratory data analysis. However, clustering is a difficult problem combinatorially, and differences in assumptions and contexts in different communities has made the transfer of useful generic concepts and methodologies slow to occur. This paper presents an overview
of pattern clustering methods from a statistical pattern recognition perspective, with a goal of providing useful advice and references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of clustering practitioners. We present a taxonomy of clustering techniques, and identify
 cross-cutting themes and recent advances. We also describe some important applications of clustering algorithms such as image segmentation, object recognition, and information retrieval.},

This paper presents a tutorial on transport layer concepts and terminology, and a survey of transport layer services and protocols. The transport layer protocol TCP is used as a reference point, and compared and contrasted with nineteen other protocols designed over the past two decades. The service and protocol features of twelve of the most important protocols are summarized in both text and tables.},

abstract = {Static scheduling of a program represented by a directed task graph on a multiprocessor system to minimize the program completion time is a well-known problem in parallel processing. Since finding an optimal schedule is an NP-complete problem in general, researchers have resorted to devising efficient heuristics. A plethora of heuristics have been proposed based on a wide spectrum of techniques, including branch-and-bound, integer-programming, searching, graph-theory, randomization, genetic algorithms, and evolutionary methods. The objective of this survey is to describe various scheduling algorithms and their functionalities in a contrasting fashion as well as examine their relative merits in terms of performance and time-complexity. Since these algorithms are based on diverse   assumptions, they differ in their functionalities, and hence are difficult to describe in a unified context. We propose a taxonomy that classifies these algorithms into different categories. We consider 27 scheduling algorithms, with each algorithm explained through an easy-to-understand description followed by an illustrative example to demonstrate its operation. We also outline some of the novel and promising optimization approaches and current research trends in the area. Finally, we give an overview of the software tools that provide scheduling/mapping functionalities.},

Default rules prevail in many application domains such as medical and legal reasoning.Several variants have been developed over the past year, either to overcome some perceived deficiencies of the original presentation, or to realize somewhat different intuitions. This paper provides a tutorial-style introduction to some important approaches of Default Logic. The presentation is based on operational models for these approaches, thus making them easily accessible to a broader audience, and more easily usable in practical applications.},

abstract = {Concurrent programming is conceptually harder to undertake and to 
understand than sequential programming, because a programmer has to manage the coexistence and coordination of multiple concurrent activities. To alleviate this task several high-level approaches to concurrent programming have been developed. For some high-level programming approaches, prototyping for facilitating early evaluation of new ideas is a central goal.Prototyping is used to explore the essential features of a proposed 
system through practical experimentation before its actual implementation to make the correct design choices early in the process of software development. Approaches to prototyping concurrent applications with very high-level programming systems  intend to alleviate the development in different ways. Early experimentation with alternate design choices or problem decompositions for concurrent applications is suggested to make concurrent programming easier.This paper presents a survey of programming languages and systems for prototyping concurrent applications to review the state of the art in this area. The surveyed approaches are classified with respect to the prototyping process.},

abstract = {The specification of reactive and real-time systems must be supported  by formal, mathematically-founded methods in order to be satisfactory and reliable. Temporal logics have been used to this end for several years. Temporal logics allow the specification of system behavior in terms of logical formulas, including temporal constraints, events, and the relationships between the two. In the last ten years, temporal logics have reached a high degree of expressiveness. Most of the temporal logics proposed in the last few years can be used for specifying reactive systems, although not all are suitable for specifying real-time systems. In this paper we present a series of criteria for assessing the capabilities of temporal logics for the specification, validation, and verification of real-time systems. Among the criteria are the logic's expressiveness, the logic's order, presence of a metric for time, the type of temporal operators, the fundamental time entity, and the structure of time. We examine a selection of temporal logics proposed in the literature. To make the comparison clearer, a set of typical specifications is identified and used with most of the temporal logics considered, thus presenting the reader with a number of real examples.},

As a consequence, many new evolutionary-based approaches and variations of existing techniques have recently been published in the technical literature. The purpose of this paper is to summarize and organize the information on these current approaches, emphasizing the importance of analyzing the operations research techniques in which most of them are based, in an attempt to motivate researchers to look into these mathematical programming approaches for new ways of exploiting the search capabilities of evolutionary algorithms. Furthermore, a summary of the main algorithms behind these approaches is provided, together with a brief criticism that includes their advantages and disadvantages, degree of applicability, and some known applications. Finally, further trends in this area and some possible paths for further research are also addressed.},

We present data on the Internet from several different sources, e.g., current as well as projected number of users, hosts, and Web sites. Although numerical figures vary, overall trends cited by the sources are consistent and point to exponential growth in the past and in the coming decade. Hence it is not surprising that about 85% of Internet users surveyed claim using search engines and search services to find specific information. The same surveys show, however, that users are not satisfied with the performance of the current generation of search engines; the slow retrieval speed, communication delays, and poor quality of retrieved  results (e.g., noise and broken links) are commonly cited problems. We discuss the development of new techniques targeted to resolve some of the problems associated with Web-based information retrieval and speculate on future trends.},

abstract = {The expanding gap between microprocessor and DRAM performance has 
necessitated the use of increasingly aggressive techniques designed to reduce or hide the latency of main memory access. Although large cache hierarchies have proven to be effective in reducing this latency for the most frequently used data, it is still not uncommon for many programs to spend more than half their run times stalled on memory requests. Data prefetching has been proposed as a technique for hiding the access latency of data referencing patterns that defeat caching strategies. Rather than waiting for a cache miss to initiate a memory fetch, data prefetching anticipates such misses and issues a fetch to the memory system in advance of the actual memory reference. To be effective, prefetching must be  implemented in such a way that prefetches are timely, useful, and introduce little overhead. Secondary effects such as cache pollution and increased memory bandwidth requirements must also be taken into consideration. Despite these obstacles, prefetching has the potential to significantly improve overall program execution time by overlapping computation with memory accesses. Prefetching strategies are diverse, and no single strategy has yet been proposed that provides optimal performance. The following survey examines several alternative approaches, and discusses the design tradeoffs involved when implementing a data prefetch strategy.},

abstract = {Richard Feynman's observation that certain quantum mechanical effects cannot be simulated efficiently on a computer led to speculation that computation in general could be done more efficiently if it used these quantum effects. This speculation proved justified when Peter Shor described a polynomial time quantum algorithm for factoring intergers.In quantum systems, the computational space increases exponentially with the size of the system, which enables exponential parallelism. This parallelism could lead to exponentially faster quantum algorithms than possible classically. The catch is that accessing the results, which requires measurement, proves tricky and requires new nontraditional programming techniques.The aim of this paper is to guide computer  scientists through the barriers that separate quantum computing from conventional computing. We introduce basic principles of quantum mechanics to explain where the power of quantum computers comes from and why it is difficult to harness. We describe quantum cryptography, teleportation, and dense coding. Various approaches to exploiting the power of quantum parallelism are explained. We conclude with a discussion of quantum error correction.},

abstract = {The management of electronic document collections is fundamentally different from the management of paper documents. The ephemeral nature of some electronic documents means that the document address (i.e., reference details of the document) can become incorrect some time after coming into use, resulting in references, such as index entries and hypertext links, failing to correctly address the document they describe. A classic case of invalidated references is on the World Wide Web—links that point to a named resource fail when the domain name, file name, or any other aspect of the addressed resource is changed, resulting in the well-known Error 404. Additionally, there are other errors which arise from changes to document collections.This paper surveys the strategies used both in World Wide Web software and other hypertext systems for managing the integrity of references and hence the integrity of links. Some strategies are preventative, not permitting errors to occur; others are corrective, discovering references errors and sometimes attempting to correct them; while the last strategy is adaptive, because references are calculated on a just-in-time basis, according the current state of the document collection.},

abstract = {Process migration is the act of transferring a process between two machines. It enables dynamic load distribution, fault resilience, eased system administration, and data access locality. Despite these goals and ongoing research efforts, migration has not achieved widespread use. With the increasing deployment of distributed systems in general, and distributed operating systems in particular, process migration is again receiving more attention in both research and product development. As high-performance facilities shift from supercomputers to networks of workstations, and with the ever-increasing role of the World Wide Web, we expect migration to play a more important role and eventually to be widely adopted.This survey reviews the field of process migration by summarizing the key concepts and giving an overview of the most important implementations. Design and implementation issues of process migration are analyzed in general, and then revisited for each of the case studies described: MOSIX, Sprite, Mach, and Load Sharing Facility. The benefits and drawbacks of process migration depend on the details of implementation and, therefore, this paper focuses on practical matters. This survey will help in understanding the potentials of process migration and why it has not caught on.},

Execution time performance of Java programs can be improved through compilation, possibly at the expense of portability. Various types of Java compilers have been proposed, including Just-In-Time (JIT) compilers that compile bytecode into native processor instructions on the fly; direct compilers that directly translate the Java source code into the target processor's native language; and bytecode-to-source translators that generate either native code or an intermediate language, such as C, from the bytecodes. Additional techniques, including bytecode optimization, dynamic compilation, and executing Java programs in parallel, attempt to improve Java run-time performance while maintaining Java's portability. Another alternative for executing Java programs is a Java processor that implements the JVM directly in hardware. In this survey, we discuss the basis features, and the advantages and disadvantages, of the various Java execution techniques. We also discuss the various Java benchmarks that are being used by the Java community for performance evaluation of the different techniques. Finally, we conclude with a comparison of the performance of the alternative Java execution techniques based on reported results.},

abstract = {Modern window-based user interface systems generate user interface events as natural products of their normal operation.  Because such events can be automatically captured and because they indicate user behavior with respect to an application's user interface, they have long been regarded as a potentially fruitful source of information regarding application usage and usability.  However, because user interface events are typically voluminos and rich in detail, automated support is generally required to extract information at a level of abstraction that is useful to investigators interested in analyzing application usage or evaluating usability. This survey examines computer-aided techniques used by HCI practitioners and researchers to extract usability-related information from user interface events. A framework is presented to help HCI practitioners and researchers categorize and compare the approaches that have been, or might fruitfully be, applied to this problem. Because many of the techniques in the research literature have not been evaluated in practice, this survey provides a conceptual evaluation to help identify some of the relative merits and drawbacks of the various classes of approaches. Ideas for future research in this area are also presented. This survey addresses the following questions: How might user interface events be used in evaluating usability? How are user interface events related to other forms of usability data? What are the key challenges faced by investigators wishing to exploit this data? What approaches have been brought to bear on this problem and how do they compare to one another? What are some of the important open research questions in this area?},

abstract = {Distributed data processing is becoming a reality. Businesses want to do it for many reasons, and they often must do it in order to stay competitive. While much of the infrastructure for distributed data processing is already there (e.g., modern network technology), a number of issues make distributed data processing still a complex undertaking: (1) distributed systems can become very large, involving thousands of heterogeneous sites including PCs and mainframe server machines; (2) the state of a distributed system changes rapidly because the load of sites varies over time and new sites are added to the system; (3) legacy systems need to be integrated—such legacy systems usually have not been designed for distributed data processing and now need to interact with other (modern) systems in a distributed environment. This paper presents the state of the art of query processing for distributed database and information systems.  The paper presents the “textbook” architecture for distributed query processing and a series of techniques that are particularly useful for distributed database systems. These techniques include special join techniques, techniques to exploit intraquery paralleli sm, techniques to reduce communication costs, and techniques to exploit caching and replication of data. Furthermore, the paper discusses different kinds of distributed systems such as client-server, middleware (multitier), and heterogeneous database systems, and shows how query processing works in these systems.},

abstract = {An algorithm component is an implementation of an algorithm which is not intended to be a stand-alone module, but to perform a specific task within a large software package or even within several distinct software packages. Therefore, the design of algorithm components must also incorporate software-engineering aspects. A key design goal is adaptability. This goal is important for maintenance throughout a project, prototypical development, and reuse in new, unforseen contexts. From a theoretical viewpoint most algorithms apply  to a range of possible use scenarios. Ideally, each algorithm is implemented by one algorithm component, which is easily, safely, and efficiently adaptable to all of these contexts.Various techniques have been developed for the design and implementation of algorithm components. However, a common basis for systematic, detailed evaluations and comparisons in view of the real practical needs is still missing. Basically, this means a set of concrete criteria, which specify what sort of adaptability is really required in practice, and which are well-justified by convincing, representative use scenarios.This paper is intended to be a first “milestone” on the way towards such a system of criteria. We will present a set of concrete goals, which are general and problem-independent and might appear ubiquitously in the algorithmic realm. These goals are illustrated, motivated, and justified by an extensive requirements analysis for a particular algorithm from a     particular algorithmic domain: Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths in networks.Clearly, the field of algorithmics might be too versatile to allow a comprehensive, yet concise set of precise, justified criteria. Even a domain as restricted as graph and network algorithms includes aspects that are not fully understood. The analysis will include a discussion of the limits of the case study and the scope of the goals. The case study was chosen because it seems to be close to the “boderline” between the aspects that are well understood and the aspects that are not. Hence, this example may well serve as an“acid test” for programming techniques in view of the state of the art.},

abstract = {Data sets in large applications are often too massive to fit completely inside the computers internal memory. The resulting input/output communication (or I/O) between fast internal memory and slower external memory (such as disks) can be a major performance bottleneck. In this article we survey the state of the art in the design and analysis of external memory (or EM) algorithms and data structures, where the goal is to exploit locality in order to reduce the I/O costs. We consider a variety of EM paradigms for solving batched and online problems efficiently in external memory. For the batched problem of sorting and related problems such as permuting and fast Fourier transform, the key paradigms include distribution and merging. The paradigm of disk striping offers an elegant way to use multiple disks in parallel. For sorting, however,  disk striping can be nonoptimal with respect to I/O, so to gain further improvements we discuss distribution and merging techniques for using the disks independently. We also consider useful techniques for batched EM problems involving matrices (such as matrix multiplication and transposition), geometric data (such as finding intersections and constructing convex hulls), and graphs (such as list ranking, connected components, topological sorting, and shortest paths). In the online domain, canonical EM applications include dictionary lookup and range searching. The two important classes of indexed data structures are based upon extendible hashing and B-trees. The paradigms of filtering and bootstrapping provide a convenient means in online data structures to make effective use of the data accessed from disk. We also reexamine some of the above EM problems in slightly different settings, such as when the data items are moving, when the data items are variable-length (e.g., text strings), or when the allocated amount of internal memory can change dynamically. Programming tools and environments are available for simplifying the EM programming task. During the course of the survey, we report on some experiments in the domain of spatial databases using the TPIE system (transparent parallel I/O programming environment). The newly developed EM algorithms and data structures that incorporate the paradigms we discuss are significantly faster than methods currently used in practice.},

While there is clear evidence that the approach can be expected to deliver some increase in reliability compared to a single version, there is no agreement about the extent of this. More importantly, it remains difficult to evaluate exactly how reliable a particular diverse fault-tolerant system is. This difficulty arises because assumptions of independence of failures between different versions have been shown to be untenable: assessment of the actual level of dependence present is therefore needed, and this is difficult. In this tutorial, we survey the modeling issues here, with an emphasis upon the impact these have upon the problem of assessing the reliability of fault-tolerant systems. The intended audience is one of designers, assessors, and project managers with only a basic knowledge of probabilities, as well as reliability experts without detailed knowledge of software, who seek an introduction to the probabilistic issues in decisions about design diversity.},

abstract = {During the last decade, multimedia databases have become increasingly important in many application areas such as medicine, CAD, geography, and molecular biology. An important research issue in the field of multimedia databases is the content-based retrieval of similar multimedia objects such as images, text, and videos. However, in contrast to searching data in a relational database, a content-based retrieval requires the search of similar objects as a basic functionality of the database system. Most of the approaches addressing similarity search use a so-called feature transformation that transforms important properties of the multimedia objects into high-dimensional points (feature vectors). Thus, the similarity search is transformed into a search of points in the feature space that are close to a given query point in the high-dimensional feature space. Query processing in high-dimensional spaces has therefore been a very active research area over the last few years. A number of new index structures and algorithms have been proposed. It has been shown that the new index structures considerably improve the performance in querying large multimedia databases. Based on recent tutorials [Berchtold and Keim 1998], in this survey we provide an overview of the current state of the art in querying multimedia databases, describing the index structures and algorithms for an efficient query processing in high-dimensional spaces. We identify the problems of processing queries in high-dimensional space, and we provide an overview of the proposed approaches to overcome these problems.},

Many solutions have been proposed in different areas, in many cases without cross-knowledge. Because of this, the same ideas have been reconceived several times, and very different presentations have been given for the same approaches. We present some basic results that explain the intrinsic difficulty of the search problem. This includes a quantitative definition of the elusive concept of "intrinsic dimensionality." We also present a unified view of all the known proposals to organize metric spaces, so as to be able to understand them under a common framework. Most approaches turn out to be variations on a few different concepts. We organize those works in a taxonomy that allows us to devise new algorithms from combinations of concepts not noticed before because of the lack of communication between different communities. We present experiments validating our results and comparing the existing approaches. We finish with recommendations for practitioners and open questions for future development.},

building block for many distributed applications. Much current
research has been dedicated to specifying the semantics and
services of view-oriented group communication systems (GCSs).
However, the guarantees of different GCSs are formulated using
varying terminologies and modeling techniques, and the
specifications vary in their rigor. This makes it difficult to
analyze and compare the different systems. This survey provides a
comprehensive set of clear and rigorous specifications, which may
be combined to represent the guarantees of most existing GCSs. In
the light of these specifications, over 30 published GCS
specifications are surveyed. Thus, the specifications serve as a
unifying framework for the classification, analysis, and comparison
of group communication systems. The survey also discusses over a
dozen different applications of group communication systems,
shedding light on the usefulness of the presented specifications.
This survey is aimed at both system builders and theoretical
researchers. The specification framework presented in this article
will help builders of group communication systems understand and
specify their service semantics; the extensive survey will allow
them to compare their service to others. Application builders will
find a guide here to the services provided by a large variety of
GCSs, which could help them choose the GCS appropriate for their
needs. The formal framework may provide a basis for interesting
theoretical work, for example, analyzing relative strengths of
different properties and the costs of implementing them.},

The origins of spoken dialogue systems can be traced back to Artificial Intelligence research in the 1950s concerned with developing conversational interfaces. However, it is only within the last decade or so, with major advances in speech technology, that large-scale working systems have been developed and, in some cases, introduced into commercial environments. As a result many major telecommunications and software companies have become aware of the potential for spoken dialogue technology to provide solutions in newly developing areas such as computer-telephony integration. Voice portals, which provide a speech-based interface between a telephone user and Web-based services, are the most recent application of spoken dialogue technology.

abstract = {Frequently a user's information needs are stored in the databases of multiple search engines. It is inconvenient and inefficient for an ordinary user to invoke multiple search engines and identify useful documents from the returned results. To support unified access to multiple search engines, a metasearch engine can be constructed. When a metasearch engine receives a query from a user, it invokes the underlying search engines to retrieve useful information for the user. Metasearch engines have other benefits as a search tool such as increasing the search coverage of the Web and improving the scalability of the search. In this article, we survey techniques that have been proposed to tackle several underlying challenges for building a good metasearch engine. Among the main challenges, the database selection problem is to identify search engines that are likely to return useful documents to a given query. The document selection problem is to determine what documents to retrieve from each identified search engine. The result merging problem is to combine the documents returned from multiple search engines. We will also point out some problems that need to be further researched.},

abstract = {The automated categorization (or classification) of texts into predefined categories has witnessed a booming interest in the last 10 years, due to the increased availability of documents in digital form and the ensuing need to organize them. In the research community the dominant approach to this problem is based on machine learning techniques: a general inductive process automatically builds a classifier by learning, from a set of preclassified documents, the characteristics of the categories. The advantages of this approach over the knowledge engineering approach (consisting in the manual definition of a classifier by domain experts) are a very good effectiveness, considerable savings in terms of expert labor power, and straightforward portability to different domains. This survey discusses the main approaches to text categorization that fall within the machine learning paradigm. We will discuss in detail issues pertaining to three different problems, namely, document representation, classifier construction, and classifier evaluation.},

abstract = {The overall increase in traffic on the World Wide Web is augmenting user-perceived response times from popular Web sites, especially in conjunction with special events. System platforms that do not replicate information content cannot provide the needed scalability to handle large traffic volumes and to match rapid and dramatic changes in the number of clients. The need to improve the performance of Web-based services has produced a variety of novel content delivery architectures. This article will focus on Web system architectures that consist of multiple server nodes distributed on a local area, with one or more mechanisms to spread client requests among the nodes. After years of continual proposals of new system solutions, routing mechanisms, and policies (the first dated back to 1994 when the NCSA Web site had to face the first million of requests per day), many problems concerning multiple server architectures for Web sites have been solved. Other issues remain to be addressed, especially at the network application layer, but the main techniques and methodologies for building scalable Web content delivery architectures placed in a single location are settled now. This article classifies and describes main mechanisms to split the traffic load among the server nodes, discussing both the alternative architectures and the load sharing policies. To this purpose, it focuses on architectures, internal routing mechanisms, and dispatching request algorithms for designing and implementing scalable Web-server systems under the control of one content provider. It identifies also some of the open research issues associated with the use of distributed systems for highly accessed Web sites.},

Checkpointing can be coordinated, uncoordinated, or communication-induced. Log-based protocols combine checkpointing with logging of nondeterministic events, encoded in tuples called determinants. Depending on how determinants are logged, log-based protocols can be pessimistic, optimistic, or causal. Throughout the survey, we highlight the research issues that are at the core of rollback-recovery and present the solutions that currently address them.

But at the heart of these efforts lie implicit assumptions about "quality" and "usefulness" of Web resources and services. This observation points towards measurements and models that quantify various attributes of web sites. The science of measuring all aspects of information, especially its storage and retrieval or informetrics has interested information scientists for decades before the existence of the Web. Is Web informetrics any different, or is it just an application of classical informetrics to a new medium? In this article, we examine this issue by classifying and discussing a wide ranging set of Web metrics. We present the origins, measurement functions, formulations and comparisons of well-known Web metrics for quantifying Web graph properties, Web page significance, Web page similarity, search and retrieval, usage characterization and information theoretic properties.

To achieve this result, the operating system implements a number of policies for allocating resources to, and sharing resources among applications, and it implements safety mechanisms to guard against misbehaving applications. However, for most of these allocation and sharing tasks, no single optimal policy exists. Different applications may prefer different operating system policies to achieve their goals in the best possible way. A customizable or adaptable operating system is an operating system that allows for flexible modification of important system policies. Over the past decade, a wide range of approaches for achieving customizability has been explored in the operating systems research community.

abstract = {The concept of an object-oriented database programming language (OODBPL) is appealing because it has the potential of combining the advantages of object orientation and database programming to yield a powerful and universal programming language design. A uniform and consistent combination of object orientation and database programming, however, is not straightforward. Since one of the main components of an object-oriented programming language is its type system, one of the first problems that arises during an OODBPL design is related to the development of a uniform, consistent, and theoretically sound type system that is sufficiently expressive to satisfy the combined needs of object orientation and database programming.The purpose of this article is to answer two questions: "What are the requirements that a modern type system for an object-oriented database programming language should satisfy?" and "Are there any type systems developed to-date that satisfy these requirements?". In order to answer the first question, we compile the set of requirements that an OODBPL type system should satisfy. We then use this set of requirements to evaluate more than 30 existing type systems. The result of this extensive analysis shows that while each of the requirements is satisfied by at least one type system, no type system satisfies all of them. It also enables identification of the mechanisms that lie behind the strengths and weaknesses of the current type systems.},

abstract = {Hardware multithreading is becoming a generally applied technique in the next generation of microprocessors. Several multithreaded processors are announced by industry or already into production in the areas of high-performance microprocessors, media, and network processors.A multithreaded processor is able to pursue two or more threads of control in parallel within the processor pipeline. The contexts of two or more threads of control are often stored in separate on-chip register sets. Unused instruction slots, which arise from latencies during the pipelined execution of single-threaded programs by a contemporary microprocessor, are filled by instructions of other threads within a multithreaded processor. The execution units are multiplexed between the thread contexts that are loaded in the register sets.Underutilization of a superscalar processor due to missing instruction-level parallelism can be overcome by simultaneous multithreading, where a processor can issue multiple instructions from multiple threads each cycle. Simultaneous multithreaded processors combine the multithreading technique with a wide-issue superscalar processor to utilize a larger part of the issue bandwidth by issuing instructions from different threads simultaneously.Explicit multithreaded processors are multithreaded processors that apply processes or operating system threads in their hardware thread slots. These processors optimize the throughput of multiprogramming workloads rather than single-thread performance. We distinguish these processors from implicit multithreaded processors that utilize thread-level speculation by speculatively executing compiler- or machine-generated threads of control that are part of a single sequential program.This survey paper explains and classifies the explicit multithreading techniques in research and in commercial microprocessors.},

abstract = {For many years, there has been considerable debate about whether the IT revolution was paying off in higher productivity. Studies in the 1980s found no connection between IT investment and productivity in the U.S. economy, a situation referred to as the productivity paradox. Since then, a decade of studies at the firm and country level has consistently shown that the impact of IT investment on labor productivity and economic growth is significant and positive. This article critically reviews the published research, more than 50 articles, on computers and productivity. It develops a general framework for classifying the research, which facilitates identifying what we know, how well we know it, and what we do not know. The framework enables us to systematically organize, synthesize, and evaluate the empirical evidence and to identify both limitations in existing research and data and substantive areas for future research.The review concludes that the productivity paradox as first formulated has been effectively refuted. At both the firm and the country level, greater investment in IT is associated with greater productivity growth. At the firm level, the review further concludes that the wide range of performance of IT investments among different organizations can be explained by complementary investments in organizational capital such as decentralized decision-making systems, job training, and business process redesign. IT is not simply a tool for automating existing processes, but is more importantly an enabler of organizational changes that can lead to additional productivity gains.In mid-2000, IT capital investment began to fall sharply due to slowing economic growth, the collapse of many Internet-related firms, and reductions in IT spending by other firms facing fewer competitive pressures from Internet firms. This reduction in IT investment has had devastating effects on the IT-producing sector, and may lead to slower economic and productivity growth in the U.S. economy. While the turmoil in the technology sector has been unsettling to investors and executives alike, this review shows that it should not overshadow the fundamental changes that have occurred as a result of firms' investments in IT. Notwithstanding the demise of many Internet-related companies, the returns to IT investment are real, and innovative companies continue to lead the way.},

The process typically involves planning a set of views, physically altering the relative object-sensor pose, taking scans, registering the acquired geometric data in a common coordinate frame of reference, and finally integrating range images into a nonredundant model. Efficiencies could be achieved by automating or semiautomating this process. While challenges remain, there are adequate solutions to semiautomate the scan-register-integrate tasks. On the other hand, view planning remains an open problem---that is, the task of finding a suitably small set of sensor poses and configurations for specified reconstruction or inspection goals. This paper surveys and compares view planning techniques for automated 3D object reconstruction and inspection by means of active, triangulation-based range sensors.},

abstract = {We survey metrics proposed for object-oriented systems, focusing on product metrics. The survey is intended for the purposes of understanding, classifying, and analyzing ongoing research in object-oriented metrics. The survey applies fundamental measurement theory to artifacts created by development activities. We develop a mathematical formalism that captures this perspective clearly, giving appropriate attention to the peculiarities of the object-oriented system developmenr process. Consistent representation of the available metrics, following this mathematical formalism, shows that current research in this area contains varying coverage of different products and their properties at different development stages. The consistent representation also facilitates several analyses including aggregation across metrics, usage across metrics, equivalent formulation of metrics by multiple researchers, and exploitation of traditional metrics for object-oriented metrics. We also trace the chronological development of research in this area, and uncover gaps that suggest opportunities for future research.},

abstract = {Well adapted to the loosely coupled nature of distributed interaction in large-scale applications, the publish/subscribe communication paradigm has recently received increasing attention. With systems based on the publish/subscribe interaction scheme, subscribers register their interest in an event, or a pattern of events, and are subsequently asynchronously notified of events generated by publishers. Many variants of the paradigm have recently been proposed, each variant being specifically adapted to some given application or network model. This paper factors out the common denominator underlying these variants: full decoupling of the communicating entities in time, space, and synchronization. We use these three decoupling dimensions to better identify commonalities and divergences with traditional interaction paradigms. The many variations on the theme of publish/subscribe are classified and synthesized. In particular, their respective benefits and shortcomings are discussed both in terms of interfaces and implementations.},

IP multicast by itself does not provide any mechanisms for preventing nongroup members to have access to the group communication. Although encryption can be used to protect messages exchanged among group members, distributing the cryptographic keys becomes an issue. Researchers have proposed several different approaches to group key management. These approaches can be divided into three main classes: centralized group key management protocols, decentralized architectures and distributed key management protocols. The three classes are described here and an insight given to their features and goals. The area of group key management is then surveyed and proposed solutions are classified according to those characteristics.},

This article surveys twelve methods and several related works appearing in some 50 papers published up to now.

Two very important concepts in metaheuristics are intensification and diversification. These are the two forces that largely determine the behavior of a metaheuristic. They are in some way contrary but also complementary to each other. We introduce a framework, that we call the I&amp;D frame, in order to put different intensification and diversification components into relation with each other. Outlining the advantages and disadvantages of different metaheuristic approaches we conclude by pointing out the importance of hybridization of metaheuristics as well as the integration of metaheuristics and other methods for optimization.},

abstract = {As one of the most successful applications of image analysis and understanding, face recognition has recently received significant attention, especially during the past several years. At least two reasons account for this trend: the first is the wide range of commercial and law enforcement applications, and the second is the availability of feasible technologies after 30 years of research. Even though current machine recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited by the conditions imposed by many real applications. For example, recognition of face images acquired in an outdoor environment with changes in illumination and/or pose remains a largely unsolved problem. In other words, current systems are still far away from the capability of the human perception system.This paper provides an up-to-date critical survey of still- and video-based face recognition research. There are two underlying motivations for us to write this survey paper: the first is to provide an up-to-date review of the existing literature, and the second is to offer some insights into the studies of machine recognition of faces. To provide a comprehensive survey, we not only categorize existing recognition techniques but also present detailed descriptions of representative methods within each category. In addition, relevant topics such as psychophysical studies, system evaluation, and issues of illumination and pose variation are covered.},

It can be expected that a lot of applications based on MPEG-7 media descriptions will be set up in the near future. Therefore, means for the adequate management of large amounts of MPEG-7-compliant media descriptions are certainly desirable. Essentially, MPEG-7 media descriptions are XML documents following media description schemes defined with a variant of XML Schema. Thus, it is reasonable to investigate current database solutions for XML documents regarding their suitability for the management of these descriptions. In this paper, we motivate and present critical requirements for the management of MPEG-7 media descriptions and the resulting consequences for XML database solutions. Along these requirements, we discuss current state-of-the-art database solutions for XML documents. The analysis and comparison unveil the limitations of current database solutions with respect to the management of MPEG-7 media descriptions and point the way to the need for a new generation of XML database solutions.},

Text search engines have existed for some years now and have achieved a certain degree of success. However, despite the large number of images available on the Web, image search engines are still rare.

The article surveys the main characteristics of the existing systems most often cited in the literature, such as ImageRover, WebSeek, Diogenes, and Atlas WISE. It then examines the various issues related to the design and implementation of a Web image search engine, such as data gathering and digestion, indexing, query specification, retrieval and similarity, Web coverage, and performance evaluation.

abstract = {An overview is presented of object-based and image-based representations of objects by their interiors. The representations are distinguished by the manner in which they can be used to answer two fundamental queries in database applications: (1) Feature query: given an object, determine its constituent cells (i.e., their locations in space). (2) Location query: given a cell (i.e., a location in space), determine the identity of the object (or objects) of which it is a member as well as the remaining constituent cells of the object (or objects). Regardless of the representation that is used, the generation of responses to the feature and location queries is facilitated by building an index (i.e., the result of a sort) either on the objects or on their locations in space, and implementing it using an access structure that correlates the objects with the locations. Assuming the presence of an access structure, implicit (i.e., image-based) representations are described that are good for finding the objects associated with a particular location or cell (i.e., the location query), while requiring that all cells be examined when determining the locations associated with a particular object (i.e., the feature query). In contrast, explicit (i.e., object-based) representations are good for the feature query, while requiring that all objects be examined when trying to respond to the location query. The goal is to be able to answer both types of queries with one representation and without possibly having to examine every cell. Representations are presented that achieve this goal by imposing containment hierarchies on either space (i.e., the cells in the space in which the objects are found), or objects. In the former case, space is aggregated into successively larger-sized chunks (i.e., blocks), while in the latter, objects are aggregated into successively larger groups (in terms of the number of objects that they contain). The former is applicable to image-based interior-based representations of which the space pyramid is an example. The latter is applicable to object-based interior-based representations of which the R-tree is an example. The actual mechanics of many of these representations are demonstrated in the VASCO JAVA applets found at http://www.cs.umd.edu/˜hjs/quadtree/index.html.},

To further develop mobile agent technology, reliability mechanisms such as fault tolerance and transaction support are required. This article aims at structuring the field of fault-tolerant and transactional mobile agent execution and thus at guiding the reader to understand the basic strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches. It starts with a discussion on providing fault tolerance in a system in which processes simply fail. For this purpose, we first identify two basic requirements for fault-tolerant mobile agent execution: (1) non-blocking (i.e., a single failure does not prevent progress of the mobile agent execution) and (2) exactly-once (i.e., multiple executions of the agent are prevented). This leads us to introduce the notion of a <i>local transaction</i> as the basic building block for fault-tolerant mobile agent execution and to classify existing approaches according to when and by whom the local transactions are committed. In a second part, we show that transactional mobile agent execution additionally ensures execution atomicity and present a survey of existing approaches. In the last part of the survey, we extend the notion of fault tolerance to arbitrary Byzantine failures and security-related issues of the mobile agent execution.},

abstract = {Replication is a well-known technique to improve the accessibility of Web sites. It generally offers reduced client latencies and increases a site's availability. However, applying replication techniques is not trivial, and various Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) have been created to facilitate replication for digital content providers. The success of these CDNs has triggered further research efforts into developing advanced <i>Web replica hosting systems</i>. These are systems that host the documents of a website and manage replication automatically. To identify the key issues in designing a wide-area replica hosting system, we present an architectural framework. The framework assists in characterizing different systems in a systematic manner. We categorize different research efforts and review their relative merits and demerits. As an important side-effect, this review and characterization shows that there a number of interesting research questions that have not received much attention yet, but which deserve exploration by the research community.},

abstract = {Distributed computer architectures labeled "peer-to-peer" are designed for the sharing of computer resources (content, storage, CPU cycles) by direct exchange, rather than requiring the intermediation or support of a centralized server or authority. Peer-to-peer architectures are characterized by their ability to adapt to failures and accommodate transient populations of nodes while maintaining acceptable connectivity and performance.Content distribution is an important peer-to-peer application on the Internet that has received considerable research attention. Content distribution applications typically allow personal computers to function in a coordinated manner as a distributed storage medium by contributing, searching, and obtaining digital content.In this survey, we propose a framework for analyzing peer-to-peer content distribution technologies. Our approach focuses on nonfunctional characteristics such as security, scalability, performance, fairness, and resource management potential, and examines the way in which these characteristics are reflected in---and affected by---the architectural design decisions adopted by current peer-to-peer systems.We study current peer-to-peer systems and infrastructure technologies in terms of their distributed object location and routing mechanisms, their approach to content replication, caching and migration, their support for encryption, access control, authentication and identity, anonymity, deniability, accountability and reputation, and their use of resource trading and management schemes.},

abstract = {The local ratio technique is a methodology for the design and analysis of algorithms for a broad range of optimization problems. The technique is remarkably simple and elegant, and yet can be applied to several classical and fundamental problems (including covering problems, packing problems, and scheduling problems). The local ratio technique uses elementary math and requires combinatorial insight into the structure and properties of the problem at hand. Typically, when using the technique, one has to invent a weight function for a problem instance under which every "reasonable" solution is "good." The local ratio technique is closely related to the primal-dual schema, though it is not based on weak LP duality (which is the basis of the primal-dual approach) since it is not based on linear programming.In this survey we, introduce the local ratio technique and demonstrate its use in the design and analysis of algorithms for various problems. We trace the evolution path of the technique since its inception in the 1980's, culminating with the most recent development, namely, fractional local ratio, which can be viewed as a new LP rounding technique.},

The importance of such techniques is increasing as collaboration through wide-area and mobile networks becomes popular.Optimistic replication deploys algorithms not seen in traditional “pessimistic” systems. Instead of synchronous replica coordination, an optimistic algorithm propagates changes in the background, discovers conflicts after they happen, and reaches agreement on the final contents incrementally.We explore the solution space for optimistic replication algorithms. This article identifies key challenges facing optimistic replication systems---ordering operations, detecting and resolving conflicts, propagating changes efficiently, and bounding replica divergence---and provides a comprehensive survey of techniques developed for addressing these challenges.},

Because flash memories are nonvolatile and relatively dense, they are now used to store files and other persistent objects in handheld computers, mobile phones, digital cameras, portable music players, and many other computer systems in which magnetic disks are inappropriate. Flash, like earlier EEPROM devices, suffers from two limitations. First, bits can only be cleared by erasing a large block of memory. Second, each block can only sustain a limited number of erasures, after which it can no longer reliably store data. Due to these limitations, sophisticated data structures and algorithms are required to effectively use flash memories. These algorithms and data structures support efficient not-in-place updates of data, reduce the number of erasures, and level the wear of the blocks in the device. This survey presents these algorithms and data structures, many of which have only been described in patents until now.},

In this article, we state several problems related to topology control in wireless ad hoc and sensor networks, and we survey state-of-the-art solutions which have been proposed to tackle them.

abstract = {Packet classification is an enabling function for a variety of Internet applications including quality of service, security, monitoring, and multimedia communications. In order to classify a packet as belonging to a particular flow or set of flows, network nodes must perform a search over a set of filters using multiple fields of the packet as the search key. In general, there have been two major threads of research addressing packet classification, algorithmic and architectural. A few pioneering groups of researchers posed the problem, provided complexity bounds, and offered a collection of algorithmic solutions. Subsequently, the design space has been vigorously explored by many offering new algorithms and improvements on existing algorithms. Given the inability of early algorithms to meet performance constraints imposed by high speed links, researchers in industry and academia devised architectural solutions to the problem. This thread of research produced the most widely-used packet classification device technology, Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM). New architectural research combines intelligent algorithms and novel architectures to eliminate many of the unfavorable characteristics of current TCAMs. We observe that the community appears to be converging on a combined algorithmic and architectural approach to the problem. Using a taxonomy based on the high-level approach to the problem and a minimal set of running examples, we provide a survey of the seminal and recent solutions to the problem. It is our hope to foster a deeper understanding of the various packet classification techniques while providing a useful framework for discerning relationships and distinctions.},

The development of a family of new index representations has led to a wide range of innovations in index storage, index construction, and query evaluation. While some of these developments have been consolidated in textbooks, many specific techniques are not widely known or the textbook descriptions are out of date. In this tutorial, we introduce the key techniques in the area, describing both a core implementation and how the core can be enhanced through a range of extensions.

Some examples of these applications are the generation of data bases from documents, as well as the acquisition of knowledge useful for emerging technologies like question answering, information integration, and others related to text mining. However, one of the main drawbacks of the application of IE refers to its intrinsic domain dependence. For the sake of reducing the high cost of manually adapting IE applications to new domains, experiments with different Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been carried out by the research community.

abstract = {The goal of this article is to review the state-of-the-art tracking methods, classify them into different categories, and identify new trends. Object tracking, in general, is a challenging problem. Difficulties in tracking objects can arise due to abrupt object motion, changing appearance patterns of both the object and the scene, nonrigid object structures, object-to-object and object-to-scene occlusions, and camera motion. Tracking is usually performed in the context of higher-level applications that require the location and/or shape of the object in every frame. Typically, assumptions are made to constrain the tracking problem in the context of a particular application. In this survey, we categorize the tracking methods on the basis of the object and motion representations used, provide detailed descriptions of representative methods in each category, and examine their pros and cons. Moreover, we discuss the important issues related to tracking including the use of appropriate image features, selection of motion models, and detection of objects.},

Much of the research related to the design and implementation of natural language interfaces has involved the use of high-level declarative programming languages. This is to be expected as the task is extremely difficult, involving syntactic and semantic analysis of potentially ambiguous input. The use of LISP and Prolog in this area is well documented.

abstract = {Full-text indexes provide fast substring search over large text collections. A serious problem of these indexes has traditionally been their space consumption. A recent trend is to develop indexes that exploit the compressibility of the text, so that their size is a function of the compressed text length. This concept has evolved into self-indexes, which in addition contain enough information to reproduce any text portion, so they replace the text. The exciting possibility of an index that takes space close to that of the compressed text, replaces it, and in addition provides fast search over it, has triggered a wealth of activity and produced surprising results in a very short time, which radically changed the status of this area in less than 5 years. The most successful indexes nowadays are able to obtain almost optimal space and search time simultaneously.In this article we present the main concepts underlying (compressed) self-indexes. We explain the relationship between text entropy and regularities that show up in index structures and permit compressing them. Then we cover the most relevant self-indexes, focusing on how they exploit text compressibility to achieve compact structures that can efficiently solve various search problems. Our aim is to give the background to understand and follow the developments in this area.},

Naive implementation methods that compute each node separately and store the result are impractical, since they have exponential time and space complexity with respect to the cube dimensionality. To overcome this drawback, a wide range of methods that provide efficient cube implementation (with respect to both computation and storage) have been proposed, which make use of relational, multidimensional, or graph-based data structures. Furthermore, there are several other methods that compute and store approximate descriptions of data cubes, sacrificing accuracy for condensation. In this article, we focus on Relational-OLAP (ROLAP), following the majority of the efforts so far. We review existing ROLAP methods that implement the data cube and identify six orthogonal parameters/dimensions that characterize them. We place the existing techniques at the appropriate points within the problem space defined by these parameters and identify several clusters that the techniques form with various interesting properties. A careful study of these properties leads to the identification of particularly effective values for the space parameters and indicates the potential for devising new algorithms with better overall performance.},

This fact and the ever-increasing complexity of today's distributed software justify the need for simple, coherent, and effective structures for the expression of fault-tolerance in the application software. In this text we first define a “base” of structural attributes with which application-level fault-tolerance structures can be qualitatively assessed and compared with each other and with respect to the aforementioned needs. This result is then used to provide an elaborated survey of the state-of-the-art of application-level fault-tolerance structures.},

In this survey, we hope to show that this was not indeed ‘hype’ and that, though it draws on much work already carried out by the Computer Science and Control communities, its innovation is strong and lies in its robust application to the specific self-management of computing systems. To this end, we first provide an introduction to the motivation and concepts of autonomic computing and describe some research that has been seen as seminal in influencing a large proportion of early work. Taking the components of an established reference model in turn, we discuss the works that have provided significant contributions to that area. We then look at larger scaled systems that compose autonomic systems illustrating the hierarchical nature of their architectures. Autonomicity is not a well defined subject and as such different systems adhere to different degrees of Autonomicity, therefore we cross-slice the body of work in terms of these degrees. From this we list the key applications of autonomic computing and discuss the research work that is missing and what we believe the community should be considering.},

abstract = {Differential topology, and specifically Morse theory, provide a suitable setting for formalizing and solving several problems related to shape analysis. The fundamental idea behind Morse theory is that of combining the topological exploration of a shape with quantitative measurement of geometrical properties provided by a real function defined on the shape. The added value of approaches based on Morse theory is in the possibility of adopting different functions as shape descriptors according to the properties and invariants that one wishes to analyze. In this sense, Morse theory allows one to construct a general framework for shape characterization, parametrized with respect to the mapping function used, and possibly the space associated with the shape. The mapping function plays the role of a lens through which we look at the properties of the shape, and different functions provide different insights.In the last decade, an increasing number of methods that are rooted in Morse theory and make use of properties of real-valued functions for describing shapes have been proposed in the literature. The methods proposed range from approaches which use the configuration of contours for encoding topographic surfaces to more recent work on size theory and persistent homology. All these have been developed over the years with a specific target domain and it is not trivial to systematize this work and understand the links, similarities, and differences among the different methods. Moreover, different terms have been used to denote the same mathematical constructs, which often overwhelm the understanding of the underlying common framework.The aim of this survey is to provide a clear vision of what has been developed so far, focusing on methods that make use of theoretical frameworks that are developed for classes of real functions rather than for a single function, even if they are applied in a restricted manner. The term geometrical-topological used in the title is meant to underline that both levels of information content are relevant for the applications of shape descriptions: geometrical, or metrical, properties and attributes are crucial for characterizing specific instances of features, while topological properties are necessary to abstract and classify shapes according to invariant aspects of their geometry. The approaches surveyed will be discussed in detail, with respect to theory, computation, and application. Several properties of the shape descriptors will be analyzed and compared. We believe this is a crucial step to exploit fully the potential of such approaches in many applications, as well as to identify important areas of future research.},

The prominent research problems associated with multisensor integration for wide-area surveillance are modality selection, sensor planning, data fusion, and data exchange (communication) among multiple sensors. Thus, the requirements and constraints to be addressed include far-field view, wide coverage, high resolution, cooperative sensors, adaptive sensing modalities, dynamic objects, and uncontrolled environments. This article summarizes a new survey and analysis conducted in light of these challenging requirements and constraints. It involves techniques and strategies from work done in the areas of sensor fusion, sensor networks, smart sensing, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), photogrammetry, and other intelligent systems where finding optimal solutions to the placement and deployment of multimodal sensors covering a wide area is important. While techniques covered in this survey are applicable to many wide-area environments such as traffic monitoring, airport terminal surveillance, parking lot surveillance, etc., our examples will be drawn mainly from such applications as harbor security and long-range face recognition.},

Then it describes the general multiparty nonrepudiation problem, and analyzes state-of-the-art mechanisms. After this, it presents in more detail the 1-N multiparty nonrepudiation solutions for distribution of different messages to multiple recipients. Finally, it discusses advanced solutions for two typical multiparty nonrepudiation applications, namely, multiparty certified email and multiparty contract signing.},

We give an overview and classification of different ways of fusing data and present several techniques based on standard and advanced operators of the relational algebra and SQL.

abstract = {The algorithm selection problem [Rice 1976] seeks to answer the question: Which algorithm is likely to perform best for my problem? Recognizing the problem as a learning task in the early 1990's, the machine learning community has developed the field of meta-learning, focused on learning about learning algorithm performance on classification problems. But there has been only limited generalization of these ideas beyond classification, and many related attempts have been made in other disciplines (such as AI and operations research) to tackle the algorithm selection problem in different ways, introducing different terminology, and overlooking the similarities of approaches. In this sense, there is much to be gained from a greater awareness of developments in meta-learning, and how these ideas can be generalized to learn about the behaviors of other (nonlearning) algorithms. In this article we present a unified framework for considering the algorithm selection problem as a learning problem, and use this framework to tie together the crossdisciplinary developments in tackling the algorithm selection problem. We discuss the generalization of meta-learning concepts to algorithms focused on tasks including sorting, forecasting, constraint satisfaction, and optimization, and the extension of these ideas to bioinformatics, cryptography, and other fields.},

Many anomaly detection techniques have been specifically developed for certain application domains, while others are more generic. This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research on anomaly detection. We have grouped existing techniques into different categories based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain, these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which they were not intended to begin with.},

abstract = {In practice, any database management system sometimes needs reorganization, that is, a change in some aspect of the logical and/or physical arrangement of a database. In traditional practice, many types of reorganization have required denying access to a database (taking the database offline) during reorganization. Taking a database offline can be unacceptable for a highly available (24-hour) database, for example, a database serving electronic commerce or armed forces, or for a very large database. A solution is to reorganize online (concurrently with usage of the database, incrementally during users' activities, or interpretively). This article is a tutorial and survey on requirements, issues, and strategies for online reorganization. It analyzes the issues and then presents the strategies, which use the issues. The issues, most of which involve design trade-offs, include use of partitions, the locus of control for the process that reorganizes (a background process or users' activities), reorganization by copying to newly allocated storage (as opposed to reorganizing in place), use of differential files, references to data that has moved, performance, and activation of reorganization. The article surveys online strategies in three categories of reorganization. The first category, maintenance, involves restoring the physical arrangement of data instances without changing the database definition. This category includes restoration of clustering, reorganization of an index, rebalancing of parallel or distributed data, garbage collection for persistent storage, and cleaning (reclamation of space) in a log-structured file system. The second category involves changing the physical database definition; topics include construction of indexes, conversion between B+ -trees and linear hash files, and redefinition (e.g., splitting) of partitions. The third category involves changing the logical database definition. Some examples are changing a column's data type, changing the inheritance hierarchy of object classes, and changing a relationship from one-to-many to many-to-many. The survey encompasses both research and commercial implementations, and this article points out several open research topics. As highly available or very large databases continue to become more common and more important in the world economy, the importance of online reorganization is likely to continue growing.},

Satisfiability solvers for propositional and first-order logic significantly automate the task of deductive program verification. We introduce some of the basic deduction techniques used in software and hardware verification and outline the theoretical and engineering issues in building deductive verification tools.

We classify attacks against reputation systems by identifying which system components and design choices are the targets of attacks. We survey defense mechanisms employed by existing reputation systems. Finally, we analyze several landmark systems in the peer-to-peer domain, characterizing their individual strengths and weaknesses. Our work contributes to understanding (1) which design components of reputation systems are most vulnerable, (2) what are the most appropriate defense mechanisms and (3) how these defense mechanisms can be integrated into existing or future reputation systems to make them resilient to attacks.},

It is currently proposed or in use for a wide variety of purposes, including targeted marketing, restricting digital content sales to authorized jurisdictions, and security applications such as reducing credit card fraud. This raises questions about the veracity of claims of accurate and reliable geolocation. We provide a survey of Internet geolocation technologies with an emphasis on adversarial contexts; that is, we consider how this technology performs against a knowledgeable adversary whose goal is to evade geolocation. We do so by examining first the limitations of existing techniques, and then, from this base, determining how best to evade existing geolocation techniques. We also consider two further geolocation techniques which may be of use even against adversarial targets: (1) the extraction of client IP addresses using functionality introduced in the 1.5 Java API, and (2) the collection of round-trip times using HTTP refreshes. These techniques illustrate that the seemingly straightforward technique of evading geolocation by relaying traffic through a proxy server (or network of proxy servers) is not as straightforward as many end-users might expect. We give a demonstration of this for users of the popular Tor anonymizing network.},

To address this problem, researchers have developed numerous approaches at both the programming languages as well as the compilation levels, to offer high-level programming abstractions that would allow programmers to easily map applications to reconfigurable architectures. This survey describes the major research efforts on compilation techniques for reconfigurable computing architectures.

This article presents a comprehensive survey of videoblogging (vlogging for short) as a new technological trend. We first summarize the technological challenges for vlogging as four key issues that need to be answered. Along with their respective possibilities, we give a review of the currently available techniques and tools supporting vlogging, and envision emerging technological directions for future vlogging. Several multimedia technologies are introduced to empower vlogging technology with better scalability, interactivity, searchability, and accessability, and to potentially reduce the legal, economic, and moral risks of vlogging applications. We also make an in-depth investigation of various vlog mining topics from a research perspective and present several incentive applications such as user-targeted video advertising and collective intelligence gaming.

Driven by mutual benefits, or by regulations that require certain data to be published, there is a demand for the exchange and publication of data among various parties. Data in its original form, however, typically contains sensitive information about individuals, and publishing such data will violate individual privacy. The current practice in data publishing relies mainly on policies and guidelines as to what types of data can be published and on agreements on the use of published data. This approach alone may lead to excessive data distortion or insufficient protection. Privacy-preserving data publishing (PPDP) provides methods and tools for publishing useful information while preserving data privacy. Recently, PPDP has received considerable attention in research communities, and many approaches have been proposed for different data publishing scenarios. In this survey, we will systematically summarize and evaluate different approaches to PPDP, study the challenges in practical data publishing, clarify the differences and requirements that distinguish PPDP from other related problems, and propose future research directions.},

abstract = {Studying proteins and their structures has an important role for understanding protein functionalities. Recently, due to important results obtained with proteomics, a great interest has been given to interactomics, that is, the study of protein-to-protein interactions, called PPI, or more generally, interactions among macromolecules, particularly within cells. Interactomics means studying, modeling, storing, and retrieving protein-to-protein interactions as well as algorithms for manipulating, simulating, and predicting interactions. PPI data can be obtained from biological experiments studying interactions. Modeling and storing PPIs can be realized by using graph theory and graph data management, thus graph databases can be queried for further experiments. PPI graphs can be used as input for data-mining algorithms, where raw data are binary interactions forming interaction graphs, and analysis algorithms retrieve biological interactions among proteins (i.e., PPI biological meanings). For instance, predicting the interactions between two or more proteins can be obtained by mining interaction networks stored in databases. In this article we survey modeling, storing, analyzing, and manipulating PPI data. After describing the main PPI models, mostly based on graphs, the article reviews PPI data representation and storage, as well as PPI databases. Algorithms and software tools for analyzing and managing PPI networks are discussed in depth. The article concludes by discussing the main challenges and research directions in PPI networks.},

abstract = {Requirements capture is arguably the most important step in software engineering, and yet the most difficult and the least formalized one [Phalp and Shepperd 2000]. Enterprises build information systems to support their business processes. Software engineering research has typically focused on the development process, starting with user requirements—if that—with business modeling often confused with software system modeling [Isoda 2001]. Researchers and practitioners in management information systems have long recognized that understanding the business processes that an information system must support is key to eliciting the needs of its users (see e.g., Eriksson and Penker 2000]), but lacked the tools to model such business processes or to relate such models to software requirements. Researchers and practitioners in business administration have long been interested in modeling the processes of organizations for the purposes of understanding, analyzing, and improving such processes [Hammer and Champy 1993], but their models were often too coarse to be of use to software engineers. The advent of ecommerce and workflow management systems, among other things, has led to a convergence of interests and tools, within the broad IT community, for modeling and enabling business processes. In this article we present an overview of business process modeling languages. We first propose a categorization of the various languages and then describe representative languages from each family.},

Applications of risk or those demanding precision (like alert-based systems) require a rigorous and reliable validation of deployed network protocols. While the main goal is to ensure the reliability of the protocols, validation techniques also allow the establishment of their correctness regarding the related protocols' requirements. Nevertheless, even if different communities have carried out intensive research activities on the validation domain, WSONs still raise new issues for and challenging constraints to these communities. We thus, advocate the use of complementary techniques coming from different research communities to efficiently address the validation of WSON protocols. The goal of this tutorial is to present a comprehensive review of the literature on protocol engineering techniques and to discuss difficulties imposed by the characteristics of WSONs on the protocol engineering community. Following the formal and nonformal classification of techniques, we provide a discussion about components and similarities of existing protocol validation approaches. We also investigate how to take advantage of such similarities to obtain complementary techniques and outline new challenges.},

abstract = {Object-oriented programming represents an original implementation issue due to its philosophy of making the program behavior depend on the dynamic type of objects. This is expressed by the late binding mechanism, aka message sending. The underlying principle is that the address of the actually called procedure is not statically determined at compile-time, but depends on the dynamic type of a distinguished parameter known as the receiver. A similar issue arises with attributes, because their position in the object layout may also depend on the object's dynamic type. Furthermore, subtyping introduces another original feature (i.e., runtime subtype checks). All three mechanisms need specific implementations and data structures. In static typing, late binding is generally implemented with so-called virtual function tables. These tables reduce method calls to pointers to functions via a small fixed number of extra indirections. It follows that object-oriented programming yields some overhead, as compared to the usual procedural languages.The different techniques and their resulting overhead depend on several parameters. First, inheritance and subtyping may be single or multiple, and even a mixing is possible, as in Java and ˙NET which present single inheritance for classes and multiple subtyping for interfaces. Multiple inheritance is a well-known complication. Second, the production of executable programs may involve various schemes, from global compilation, which implies the closed-world assumption (CWA), as the whole program is known at compile time, to separate compilation and dynamic loading, where each program unit is compiled and loaded independently of any usage, hence under the open-world assumption (OWA). Global compilation is well-known to facilitate optimization.This article reviews the various implementation techniques available in static typing and in the three cases of single inheritance, multiple inheritance, and multiple subtyping. This language-independent survey focuses on separate compilation and dynamic loading, as they represent the most commonly used and the most demanding framework. However, many works have been undertaken in the global compilation framework, mostly for dynamically typed languages, but also applied to the EIFFEL language. Hence, we also examine global techniques and how they can improve implementation efficiency. Finally, mixed frameworks that combine open and closed world assumptions are considered. For instance, just-in-time (JIT) compilers work under provisional CWA, at the expense of possible recompilations. In contrast, we present an experimental compiler-linker, where separate compilation implies the OWA, whereas the whole program is finally linked under the CWA.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are attracting great interest in a number of application domains concerned with monitoring and control of physical phenomena, as they enable dense and untethered deployments at low cost and with unprecedented flexibility.However, application development is still one of the main hurdles to a wide adoption of WSN technology. In current real-world WSN deployments, programming is typically carried out very close to the operating system, therefore requiring the programmer to focus on low-level system issues. This not only distracts the programmer from the application logic, but also requires a technical background rarely found among application domain experts. The need for appropriate high-level programming abstractions, capable of simplifying the programming chore without sacrificing efficiency, has long been recognized, and several solutions have hitherto been proposed, which differ along many dimensions.In this article, we survey the state of the art in programming approaches for WSNs. We begin by presenting a taxonomy of WSN applications, to identify the fundamental requirements programming platforms must deal with. Then, we introduce a taxonomy of WSN programming approaches that captures the fundamental differences among existing solutions, and constitutes the core contribution of this article. Our presentation style relies on concrete examples and code snippets taken from programming platforms representative of the taxonomy dimensions being discussed. We use the taxonomy to provide an exhaustive classification of existing approaches. Moreover, we also map existing approaches back to the application requirements, therefore providing not only a complete view of the state of the art, but also useful insights for selecting the programming abstraction most appropriate to the application at hand.},

For example, a teacher might write a grading spreadsheet to save time grading, or an interaction designer might use an interface builder to test some user interface design ideas. Although these end-user programmers may not have the same goals as professional developers, they do face many of the same software engineering challenges, including understanding their requirements, as well as making decisions about design, reuse, integration, testing, and debugging. This article summarizes and classifies research on these activities, defining the area of End-User Software Engineering (EUSE) and related terminology. The article then discusses empirical research about end-user software engineering activities and the technologies designed to support them. The article also addresses several crosscutting issues in the design of EUSE tools, including the roles of risk, reward, and domain complexity, and self-efficacy in the design of EUSE tools and the potential of educating users about software engineering principles.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition is an important area of computer vision research. Its applications include surveillance systems, patient monitoring systems, and a variety of systems that involve interactions between persons and electronic devices such as human-computer interfaces. Most of these applications require an automated recognition of high-level activities, composed of multiple simple (or atomic) actions of persons. This article provides a detailed overview of various state-of-the-art research papers on human activity recognition. We discuss both the methodologies developed for simple human actions and those for high-level activities. An approach-based taxonomy is chosen that compares the advantages and limitations of each approach.Recognition methodologies for an analysis of the simple actions of a single person are first presented in the article. Space-time volume approaches and sequential approaches that represent and recognize activities directly from input images are discussed. Next, hierarchical recognition methodologies for high-level activities are presented and compared. Statistical approaches, syntactic approaches, and description-based approaches for hierarchical recognition are discussed in the article. In addition, we further discuss the papers on the recognition of human-object interactions and group activities. Public datasets designed for the evaluation of the recognition methodologies are illustrated in our article as well, comparing the methodologies' performances. This review will provide the impetus for future research in more productive areas.},

abstract = {The problem of time-varying, multisource localization using robotic swarms has received relatively little attention when compared to single-source localization. It involves distinct challenges regarding how to partition the robots during search to ensure that all sources are located in minimal time, how to avoid obstacles and other robots, and how to proceed after each source is found. Unfortunately, no common set of validation problems and reference algorithms has evolved, and there are no general theoretical foundations that guarantee progress, convergence, and termination. This article surveys the current multisource literature from the viewpoint of these central questions.},

abstract = {It has appeared recently that the underlying degree distribution of networks may play a crucial role concerning their robustness. Previous work insisted on the fact that power-law degree distributions induce high resilience to random failures but high sensitivity to attack strategies, while Poisson degree distributions are quite sensitive in both cases. Then much work has been done to extend these results.We aim here at studying in depth these results, their origin, and limitations. We review in detail previous contributions in a unified framework, and identify the approximations on which these results rely. We then present new results aimed at clarifying some important aspects. We also provide extensive rigorous experiments which help evaluate the relevance of the analytic results.We reach the conclusion that, even if the basic results are clearly important, they are in practice much less striking than generally thought. The differences between random failures and attacks are not so huge and can be explained with simple facts. Likewise, the differences in the behaviors induced by power-law and Poisson distributions are not as striking as often claimed.},

abstract = {Disk drives have experienced dramatic development to meet performance requirements since the IBM 1301 disk drive was announced in 1961. However, the performance gap between memory and disk drives has widened to 6 orders of magnitude and continues to widen by about 50% per year. Furthermore, energy efficiency has become one of the most important challenges in designing disk drive storage systems. The architectural design of disk drives has reached a turning point which should allow their performance to advance further, while still maintaining high reliability and energy efficiency. This article explains how disk drives have evolved over five decades to meet challenging customer demands. First of all, it briefly introduces the development of disk drives, and deconstructs disk performance and power consumption. Secondly, it describes the design constraints and challenges that traditional disk drives are facing. Thirdly, it presents some innovative disk drive architectures discussed in the community. Fourthly, it introduces some new storage media types and the impacts they have on the architecture of the traditional disk drives. Finally, it discusses two important evolutions of disk drives: hybrid disk and solid state disk. The article highlights the challenges and opportunities facing these storage devices, and explores how we can expect them to affect storage systems.},

abstract = {Trust is at once an elusive, imprecise concept, and a critical attribute that must be engineered into e-commerce systems. Trust conveys a vast number of meanings, and is deeply dependent upon context. The literature on engineering trust into e-commerce systems reflects these ambiguous meanings; there are a large number of articles, but there is as yet no clear theoretical framework for the investigation of trust in e-commerce. E-commerce, however, is predicated on trust; indeed, any e-commerce vendor that fails to establish a trusting relationship with their customers is doomed. There is a very clear need for specific guidance on e-commerce system attributes and business operations that will effectively promote consumer trust. To address this need, we have conducted a meta-study of the empirical literature on trust in e-commerce systems. This area of research is still immature, and hence our meta-analysis is qualitative rather than quantitative. We identify the major theoretical frameworks that have been proposed in the literature, and propose a qualitative model incorporating the various factors that have been empirically found to influence consumer trust in e-commerce. As this model is too complex to be of practical use, we explore subsets of this model that have the strongest support in the literature, and discuss the implications of this model for Web site design. Finally, we outline key conceptual and methodological needs for future work on this topic.},

Moreover, the availability of new digital equipment (such as computers and 3D scanners) has resulted in a significant advance in the applicability of this forensic identification technique. The purpose of this contribution is twofold. On the one hand, we aim to clearly define the different stages involved in the computer-aided craniofacial superimposition process. Besides, we aim to clarify the role played by computers in the methods considered.In order to accomplish these objectives, an up-to-date review of the recent works is presented along with a discussion of advantages and drawbacks of the existing approaches, with an emphasis on the automatic ones. Future case studies will be easily categorized by identifying which stage is tackled and which kind of computer-aided approach is chosen to face the identification problem.

abstract = {Aspect-orientation provides a new way of modularization by clearly separating crosscutting concerns from noncrosscutting ones. While aspect-orientation originally has emerged at the programming level, it now stretches also over other development phases. There are, for example, already several proposals for Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM), most of them pursuing distinguished goals, providing different concepts as well as notations, and showing various levels of maturity. Consequently, there is an urgent need to provide an in-depth survey, clearly identifying commonalities and differences between current AOM approaches. Existing surveys in this area focus more on comprehensibility with respect to development phases or evaluated approaches rather than on comparability on bases of a detailed evaluation framework.This article tries to fill this gap focusing on aspect-oriented design modeling. As a prerequisite for an in-depth evaluation, a conceptual reference model is presented as the article's first contribution, centrally capturing the basic design concepts of AOM and their interrelationships in terms of a UML class diagram. Based on this conceptual reference model, an evaluation framework has been designed, resembling the second contribution, by deriving a detailed and well-defined catalogue of evaluation criteria, thereby operationalizing the conceptual reference model. This criteria catalogue is employed together with a running example in order to evaluate a carefully selected set of eight design-level AOM approaches representing the third contribution of the article. This per approach evaluation is complemented with an extensive report on lessons learned, summarizing the approaches' strengths and shortcomings.},

The software engineering literature describes several techniques to choose among architectural alternatives, but it gives no clear guidance on which technique is more suitable than another, and in which circumstances. As such, there is no systematic way for software engineers to choose among decision-making techniques for resolving tradeoffs in architecture design. In this article, we provide a comparison of existing decision-making techniques, aimed to guide architects in their selection. The results show that there is no “best” decision-making technique; however, some techniques are more susceptible to specific difficulties. Hence architects should choose a decision-making technique based on the difficulties that they wish to avoid. This article represents a first attempt to reason on meta-decision-making, that is, the issue of deciding how to decide.},

In this article, we first outline the application contexts in which clustering is useful, then we survey approaches so far proposed relying on the abstract representation of data (instances or schema), on the identified similarity measure, and on the clustering algorithm. In this presentation, we aim to draw a taxonomy in which the current approaches can be classified and compared. We aim at introducing an integrated view that is useful when comparing XML data clustering approaches, when developing a new clustering algorithm, and when implementing an XML clustering component.

abstract = {The task of similarity search is widely used in various areas of computing, including multimedia databases, data mining, bioinformatics, social networks, etc. In fact, retrieval of semantically unstructured data entities requires a form of aggregated qualification that selects entities relevant to a query. A popular type of such a mechanism is similarity querying. For a long time, the database-oriented applications of similarity search employed the definition of similarity restricted to metric distances. Due to its topological properties, metric similarity can be effectively used to index a database which can then be queried efficiently by so-called metric access methods. However, together with the increasing complexity of data entities across various domains, in recent years there appeared many similarities that were not metrics—we call them nonmetric similarity functions. In this article we survey domains employing nonmetric functions for effective similarity search, and methods for efficient nonmetric similarity search. First, we show that the ongoing research in many of these domains requires complex representations of data entities. Simultaneously, such complex representations allow us to model also complex and computationally expensive similarity functions (often represented by various matching algorithms). However, the more complex similarity function one develops, the more likely it will be a nonmetric. Second, we review state-of-the-art techniques for efficient (fast) nonmetric similarity search, concerning both exact and approximate search. Finally, we discuss some open problems and possible future research trends.},

abstract = {Digital images are everywhere—from our cell phones to the pages of our online news sites. How we choose to use digital image processing raises a surprising host of legal and ethical questions that we must address. What are the ramifications of hiding data within an innocent image? Is this an intentional security practice when used legitimately, or intentional deception? Is tampering with an image appropriate in cases where the image might affect public behavior? Does an image represent a crime, or is it simply a representation of a scene that has never existed? Before action can even be taken on the basis of a questionable image, we must detect something about the image itself. Investigators from a diverse set of fields require the best possible tools to tackle the challenges presented by the malicious use of today's digital image processing techniques.In this survey, we introduce the emerging field of digital image forensics, including the main topic areas of source camera identification, forgery detection, and steganalysis. In source camera identification, we seek to identify the particular model of a camera, or the exact camera, that produced an image. Forgery detection's goal is to establish the authenticity of an image, or to expose any potential tampering the image might have undergone.

One well known method to overcome this limitation is automatic query expansion (AQE), whereby the user’s original query is augmented by new features with a similar meaning. AQE has a long history in the information retrieval community but it is only in the last years that it has reached a level of scientific and experimental maturity, especially in laboratory settings such as TREC. This survey presents a unified view of a large number of recent approaches to AQE that leverage various data sources and employ very different principles and techniques. The following questions are addressed. Why is query expansion so important to improve search effectiveness? What are the main steps involved in the design and implementation of an AQE component? What approaches to AQE are available and how do they compare? Which issues must still be resolved before AQE becomes a standard component of large operational information retrieval systems (e.g., search engines)?},

Using the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (HKPU) palmprint database (version 2), we compare the recognition performance of a number of holistic-based (Fisherpalms and DCT+LDA) and local feature-based (competitive code, ordinal code, robust line orientation code, derivative of Gaussian code, and wide line detector) methods, and then investigate the error correlation and score-level fusion performance of different algorithms. After discussing the achievements and limitations of current palmprint recognition algorithms, we conclude with providing several potential research directions for the future.},

Traditionally developed for programming languages, this article provides a tutorial development of the approach of Flow Logic for process calculi based on a decade of research.We first develop a simple analysis for the π-calculus; this consists of the specification, semantic soundness (in the form of subject reduction and adequacy results), and a Moore Family result showing that a least solution always exists, as well as providing insights on how to implement the analysis. We then show how to strengthen the analysis technology by introducing reachability components, interaction points, and localized environments, and finally, we extend it to a relational analysis.A Flow Logic is a program logic---in the same sense that a Hoare’s logic is. We conclude with an executive summary presenting the highlights of the approach from this perspective including a discussion of theoretical properties as well as implementation considerations.The electronic supplements present an application of the analysis techniques to a version of the π-calculus incorporating distribution and code mobility; also the proofs of the main results can be found in the electronic supplements.},

abstract = {Microprocessor design has recently encountered many constraints such as power, energy, reliability, and temperature. Among these challenging issues, temperature-related issues have become especially important within the past several years. We summarize recent thermal management techniques for microprocessors, focusing on those that affect or rely on the microarchitecture. We categorize thermal management techniques into six main categories: temperature monitoring, microarchitectural techniques, floorplanning, OS/compiler techniques, liquid cooling techniques, and thermal reliability/security. Temperature monitoring, a requirement for Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM), includes temperature estimation and sensor placement techniques for accurate temperature measurement or estimation. Microarchitectural techniques include both static and dynamic thermal management techniques that control hardware structures. Floorplanning covers a range of thermal-aware floorplanning techniques for 2D and 3D microprocessors. OS/compiler techniques include thermal-aware task scheduling and instruction scheduling techniques. Liquid cooling techniques are higher-capacity alternatives to conventional air cooling techniques. Thermal reliability/security issues cover temperature-dependent reliability modeling, Dynamic Reliability Management (DRM), and malicious codes that specifically cause overheating. Temperature-related issues will only become more challenging as process technology continues to evolve and transistor densities scale up faster than power per transistor scales down. The overall objective of this survey is to give microprocessor designers a broad perspective on various aspects of designing thermal-aware microprocessors and to guide future thermal management studies.},

Examples include intrusion detection systems which analyze network traffic in real-time to identify possible attacks; environmental monitoring applications which process raw data coming from sensor networks to identify critical situations; or applications performing online analysis of stock prices to identify trends and forecast future values.Traditional DBMSs, which need to store and index data before processing it, can hardly fulfill the requirements of timeliness coming from such domains. Accordingly, during the last decade, different research communities developed a number of tools, which we collectively call Information flow processing (IFP) systems, to support these scenarios. They differ in their system architecture, data model, rule model, and rule language. In this article, we survey these systems to help researchers, who often come from different backgrounds, in understanding how the various approaches they adopt may complement each other.In particular, we propose a general, unifying model to capture the different aspects of an IFP system and use it to provide a complete and precise classification of the systems and mechanisms proposed so far.},

Unfortunately, there is no comprehensive comparative analysis of different vulnerability mitigation works. As a result, there exists an obscure mapping between the techniques, the addressed vulnerabilities, and the limitations of different approaches. This article attempts to address these issues. The work extensively compares and contrasts the existing program security vulnerability mitigation techniques, namely testing, static analysis, and hybrid analysis. We also discuss three other approaches employed to mitigate the most common program security vulnerabilities: secure programming, program transformation, and patching. The survey provides a comprehensive understanding of the current program security vulnerability mitigation approaches and challenges as well as their key characteristics and limitations.

Much work has been done to enable context-awareness and to ease the diffusion of context-aware services; at the same time, several middleware solutions have been designed to transparently implement context management and provisioning in the mobile system. However, to the best of our knowledge, an in-depth analysis of the context data distribution, namely, the function in charge of distributing context data to interested entities, is still missing. Starting from the core assumption that only effective and efficient context data distribution can pave the way to the deployment of truly context-aware services, this article aims at putting together current research efforts to derive an original and holistic view of the existing literature. We present a unified architectural model and a new taxonomy for context data distribution by considering and comparing a large number of solutions.

This article aims to provide a detailed survey of one of these new features—multihoming—which, as it is shown, is the subject of evaluation in more than half of all published SCTP-related articles. To this end, the article first summarizes and organizes SCTP-related research conducted so far by developing a four-dimensional taxonomy reflecting the (1) protocol feature examined, (2) application area, (3) network environment, and (4) study approach. Over 430 SCTP-related publications have been analyzed and classified according to the proposed taxonomy. As a result, a clear perspective on this research area in the decade since the first protocol standardization in 2000 is given, covering both current and future research trends. On continuation, a detailed survey of the SCTP multihoming feature is provided, examining possible applications of multihoming, such as robustness, handover support, and loadsharing.},

abstract = {Along with the explosive growth of multimedia data, automatic multimedia tagging has attracted great interest of various research communities, such as computer vision, multimedia, and information retrieval. However, despite the great progress achieved in the past two decades, automatic tagging technologies still can hardly achieve satisfactory performance on real-world multimedia data that vary widely in genre, quality, and content. Meanwhile, the power of human intelligence has been fully demonstrated in the Web 2.0 era. If well motivated, Internet users are able to tag a large amount of multimedia data. Therefore, a set of new techniques has been developed by combining humans and computers for more accurate and efficient multimedia tagging, such as batch tagging, active tagging, tag recommendation, and tag refinement. These techniques are able to accomplish multimedia tagging by jointly exploring humans and computers in different ways. This article refers to them collectively as assistive tagging and conducts a comprehensive survey of existing research efforts on this theme. We first introduce the status of automatic tagging and manual tagging and then state why assistive tagging can be a good solution. We categorize existing assistive tagging techniques into three paradigms: (1) tagging with data selection &amp; organization; (2) tag recommendation; and (3) tag processing. We introduce the research efforts on each paradigm and summarize the methodologies. We also provide a discussion on several future trends in this research direction.},

abstract = {Chip multicore processors (CMPs) have emerged as the dominant architecture choice for modern computing platforms and will most likely continue to be dominant well into the foreseeable future. As with any system, CMPs offer a unique set of challenges. Chief among them is the shared resource contention that results because CMP cores are not independent processors but rather share common resources among cores such as the last level cache (LLC). Shared resource contention can lead to severe and unpredictable performance impact on the threads running on the CMP. Conversely, CMPs offer tremendous opportunities for mulithreaded applications, which can take advantage of simultaneous thread execution as well as fast inter thread data sharing. Many solutions have been proposed to deal with the negative aspects of CMPs and take advantage of the positive. This survey focuses on the subset of these solutions that exclusively make use of OS thread-level scheduling to achieve their goals. These solutions are particularly attractive as they require no changes to hardware and minimal or no changes to the OS. The OS scheduler has expanded well beyond its original role of time-multiplexing threads on a single core into a complex and effective resource manager. This article surveys a multitude of new and exciting work that explores the diverse new roles the OS scheduler can successfully take on.},

abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a one made up of small sensing devices equipped with processors, memory, and short-range wireless communication. Sensor nodes, are autonomous nodes, which include smart dust sensors, motes and so on. They co-operatively monitor physical or environmental conditions and send the sensed data to the sink node. They differ from traditional computer networks due to resource constraints, unbalanced mixture traffic, data redundancy, network dynamics, and energy balance. These kinds of networks support a wide range of applications that have strong requirements to reduce end-to-end delay and losses during data transmissions. When large numbers of sensors are deployed in a sensor field and are active in transmitting the data, there is a possibility of congestion. Congestion may occur due to buffer overflow, channel contention, packet collision, a high data rate, many to one nature, and so on. This leads to packet loss which causes a decrease in throughput and lifetime. Maximum throughput, energy efficiency and minimum error rate can be achieved by minimizing the congestion. A number of quality of service (QoS) techniques has been developed to improve the quality of the network. This article gives an overview of existing QoS techniques and a parametric comparison made with recent developments. This article mainly concentrates on network congestion in WSN environment.},

Our discussions focus on the background, main features, operation procedures, major design issues, and the advantages and disadvantages of these protocols. We also present an analysis of the inherent and desirable features of the protocols, and the key challenges of MAC technology for WSNs.

In this survey, we review algorithmic paradigms—search based, cycle based, transformation based, and BDD based—as well as specific algorithms for reversible synthesis, both exact and heuristic. We conclude the survey by outlining key open challenges in synthesis of reversible and quantum logic, as well as most common misconceptions.},

abstract = {Recognizing people by their ear has recently received significant attention in the literature. Several reasons account for this trend: first, ear recognition does not suffer from some problems associated with other non-contact biometrics, such as face recognition; second, it is the most promising candidate for combination with the face in the context of multi-pose face recognition; and third, the ear can be used for human recognition in surveillance videos where the face may be occluded completely or in part. Further, the ear appears to degrade little with age. Even though current ear detection and recognition systems have reached a certain level of maturity, their success is limited to controlled indoor conditions. In addition to variation in illumination, other open research problems include hair occlusion, earprint forensics, ear symmetry, ear classification, and ear individuality.This article provides a detailed survey of research conducted in ear detection and recognition. It provides an up-to-date review of the existing literature revealing the current state-of-art for not only those who are working in this area but also for those who might exploit this new approach. Furthermore, it offers insights into some unsolved ear recognition problems as well as ear databases available for researchers.},

Features and classifications techniques utilized in recent research work have diversified noticeably compared to the past. Moreover, more efforts have been diverted, in last few years, to construct different databases for Arabic handwriting recognition. This article provides a comprehensive survey of recent developments in Arabic handwriting recognition. The article starts with a summary of the characteristics of Arabic text, followed by a general model for an Arabic text recognition system. Then the used databases for Arabic text recognition are discussed. Research works on preprocessing phase, like text representation, baseline detection, line, word, character, and subcharacter segmentation algorithms, are presented. Different feature extraction techniques used in Arabic handwriting recognition are identified and discussed. Different classification approaches, like HMM, ANN, SVM, k-NN, syntactical methods, etc., are discussed in the context of Arabic handwriting recognition. Works on Arabic lexicon construction and spell checking are presented in the postprocessing phase. Several summary tables of published research work are provided for used Arabic text databases and reported results on Arabic character, word, numerals, and text recognition. These tables summarize the features, classifiers, data, and reported recognition accuracy for each technique. Finally, we discuss some future research directions in Arabic handwriting recognition.},

abstract = {Although system virtualization is not a new paradigm, the way in which it is used in modern system architectures provides a powerful platform for system building, the advantages of which have only been realized in recent years, as a result of the rapid deployment of commodity hardware and software systems. In principle, virtualization involves the use of an encapsulating software layer (Hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor) which surrounds or underlies an operating system and provides the same inputs, outputs, and behavior that would be expected from an actual physical device. This abstraction means that an ideal Virtual Machine Monitor provides an environment to the software equivalent to the host system, but which is decoupled from the hardware state. Because a virtual machine is not dependent on the state of the physical hardware, multiple virtual machines may be installed on a single set of hardware. The decoupling of physical and logical states gives virtualization inherent security benefits. However, the design, implementation, and deployment of virtualization technology have also opened up novel threats and security issues which, while not particular to system virtualization, take on new forms in relation to it. Reverse engineering becomes easier due to introspection capabilities, as encryption keys, security algorithms, low-level protection, intrusion detection, or antidebugging measures can become more easily compromised. Furthermore, associated technologies such as virtual routing and networking can create challenging issues for security, intrusion control, and associated forensic processes. We explain the security considerations and some associated methodologies by which security breaches can occur, and offer recommendations for how virtualized environments can best be protected. Finally, we offer a set of generalized recommendations that can be applied to achieve secure virtualized implementations.},

This article analyzes typical defects that make a 3D model unsuitable for key application contexts, and surveys existing algorithms that process, repair, and improve its structure, geometry, and topology to make it appropriate to case-by-case requirements.The analysis is focused on polygon meshes, which constitute by far the most common 3D object representation. In particular, this article provides a structured overview of mesh repairing techniques from the point of view of the application context. Different types of mesh defects are classified according to the upstream application that produced the mesh, whereas mesh quality requirements are grouped by representative sets of downstream applications where the mesh is to be used. The numerous mesh repair methods that have been proposed during the last two decades are analyzed and classified in terms of their capabilities, properties, and guarantees. Based on these classifications, guidelines can be derived to support the identification of repairing algorithms best-suited to bridge the compatibility gap between the quality provided by the upstream process and the quality required by the downstream applications in a given geometry processing scenario.},

We illustrate how groups are formed using different P2P system architectures, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of using each P2P system architecture for implementing P2P group management. The evaluation criteria in the analysis are performance, robustness, fairness, suitability for battery-powered devices, scalability, and security. The outcome of the analysis facilitates the selection of an appropriate P2P system architecture for implementing P2P group management in both further research and prototype development.},

To support this improvement, this article presents a complete systematic classification of the existing scheduling techniques solving this problem in a (near-)optimal way. We show that the proposed approach covers any global scheduling technique, including also future ones. In our systematic classification a technique may belong to one primitive class or to a hybrid combination of such classes. In the latter case the technique is efficiently decomposed into more primitive components each one belonging to a specific class. The systematic classification assists in the in-depth understanding of the diverse classes of techniques which is essential for their further improvement. Their main characteristics and structure, their similarities and differences, and the interrelationships of the classes are conceived. In this way, our classification provides guidance for contributing in novel ways to the broad domain of global scheduling techniques.},

As nonintrusive autonomous sensing and context recognition are desirable characteristics of a personal sensing system; efforts have been made to develop opportunistic sensing techniques on mobile phones. The resulting combination of these approaches has ushered in a new realm of applications, namely opportunistic user context recognition with mobile phones.This article surveys the existing research and approaches towards realization of such systems. In doing so, the typical architecture of a mobile-centric user context recognition system as a sequential process of sensing, preprocessing, and context recognition phases is introduced. The main techniques used for the realization of the respective processes during these phases are described, and their strengths and limitations are highlighted. In addition, lessons learned from previous approaches are presented as motivation for future research.

With a more comprehensive and systematic understanding of exploration and exploitation, more research in this direction may be motivated and refined.},

abstract = {As computer systems continue to grow in complexity, the possibility of failure increases. At the same time, the increase in computer system pervasiveness in day-to-day activities bring along increased expectations on their reliability. This has led to the need for effective and automatic error-recovery techniques to resolve failures. Transactions enable the handling of failure propagation over concurrent systems due to dependencies, restoring the system to the point before the failure occurred. However, in various settings, especially when interacting with the real world, reversal is not possible. The notion of compensations has been long advocated as a way of addressing this issue, through the specification of activities which can be executed to undo partial transactions. Still, there is no accepted standard theory; the literature offers a plethora of distinct formalisms and approaches.In this survey, we review the compensations from a theoretical point of view by (i) giving a historic account of the evolution of compensating transactions; (ii) delineating and describing a number of design options involved; (iii) presenting a number of formalisms found in the literature, exposing similarities and differences; (iv) comparing formal notions of compensation correctness; (v) giving insights regarding the application of compensations in practice; and (vi) discussing current and future research trends in the area.},

Some physical properties of the technology are also discussed, providing a basis for architectural discussions. Also briefly shown are other architectural alternatives, such as FeRAM and MRAM. The designs surveyed in this article include read before write, wear leveling, write cancellation, write pausing, some encryption schemes, and buffer organizations.

abstract = {Numerous practical systems based on network coding have been proposed in recent years demonstrating the wide range of benefits of network coding, such as increased throughput, reliability, and energy efficiency. However, network coding systems are inherently vulnerable to a severe attack, known as packet pollution, which presents a key obstacle to the deployment of such systems. Several cryptographic schemes have been proposed to defend against pollution attacks.We conduct a detailed analysis and an experimental evaluation in a realistic wireless network coding setting of a set of representative cryptographic defenses against pollution attacks. Our analysis identifies severe limitations of asymmetric-based schemes, which impose high communication overhead by placing constraints on the basic network coding parameters and high computation overhead by relying on numerous operations over large fields. Our analysis also shows that symmetric cryptographic schemes, while having better performance than asymmetric cryptographic-based schemes, impose prohibitive overhead in the presence of multiple byzantine adversaries. We further evaluate these schemes by using a set of typical network coding system parameters on a realistic topology. Our experimental evaluation shows that all the schemes we compare induce a throughput degradation that negates the performance benefits of network coding in the presence of multiple colluding adversaries.},

abstract = {The development of wireless sensor networks, such as researchers Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) requires the ability to analyze the road scene just like a human does. Road scene analysis is an essential, complex, and challenging task and it consists of: road detection (which includes the localization of the road, the determination of the relative position between vehicle and road, and the analysis of the vehicle's heading direction) and obstacle detection (which is mainly based on localizing possible obstacles on the vehicle's path). The detection of the road borders, the estimation of the road geometry, and the localization of the vehicle are essential tasks in this context since they are required for the lateral and longitudinal control of the vehicle. Within this field, on-board vision has been widely used since it has many advantages (higher resolution, low power consumption, low cost, easy aesthetic integration, and nonintrusive nature) over other active sensors such as RADAR or LIDAR. At first glance the problem of detecting the road geometry from visual information seems simple and early works in this field were quickly rewarded with promising results. However, the large variety of scenarios and the high rates of success demanded by the industry have kept the lane detection research work alive.

abstract = {In the last two decades, the continuous increase of computational power has produced an overwhelming flow of data which has called for a paradigm shift in the computing architecture and large-scale data processing mechanisms. MapReduce is a simple and powerful programming model that enables easy development of scalable parallel applications to process vast amounts of data on large clusters of commodity machines. It isolates the application from the details of running a distributed program such as issues on data distribution, scheduling, and fault tolerance. However, the original implementation of the MapReduce framework had some limitations that have been tackled by many research efforts in several followup works after its introduction. This article provides a comprehensive survey for a family of approaches and mechanisms of large-scale data processing mechanisms that have been implemented based on the original idea of the MapReduce framework and are currently gaining a lot of momentum in both research and industrial communities. We also cover a set of introduced systems that have been implemented to provide declarative programming interfaces on top of the MapReduce framework. In addition, we review several large-scale data processing systems that resemble some of the ideas of the MapReduce framework for different purposes and application scenarios. Finally, we discuss some of the future research directions for implementing the next generation of MapReduce-like solutions.},

In this context, several data stream clustering algorithms have been proposed to perform unsupervised learning. Nevertheless, data stream clustering imposes several challenges to be addressed, such as dealing with nonstationary, unbounded data that arrive in an online fashion. The intrinsic nature of stream data requires the development of algorithms capable of performing fast and incremental processing of data objects, suitably addressing time and memory limitations. In this article, we present a survey of data stream clustering algorithms, providing a thorough discussion of the main design components of state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, this work addresses the temporal aspects involved in data stream clustering, and presents an overview of the usually employed experimental methodologies. A number of references are provided that describe applications of data stream clustering in different domains, such as network intrusion detection, sensor networks, and stock market analysis. Information regarding software packages and data repositories are also available for helping researchers and practitioners.

Based on the sequence in which nodes access the shared medium, repetitiveness, and determinism, distributed schedulers that are supported by wireless mesh standards can be classified as either random, pseudo-random, or cyclic schemes. We performed qualitative and quantitative studies that show the strengths and weaknesses of each category, and how the schemes complement each other.

The underlying architecture plays an important role in meeting these conditions. Peer-to-peer architectures, due to their distributed and collaborative nature, have low infrastructure costs and can achieve high scalability. They can also achieve fast response times by creating direct connections between players. However, these architectures face many challenges. Distributing a game among peers makes maintaining control over the game more complex. Peer-to-peer architectures also tend to be vulnerable to churn and cheating. Moreover, different genres of games have different requirements that should be met by the underlying architecture, rendering the task of designing a general-purpose architecture harder. Many peer-to-peer gaming solutions have been proposed that utilize a range of techniques while using somewhat different and confusing terminologies.

The first and the second components are the source state, s, and the label, α, of the transition, while the third component is the continuation function, 𝒫, associating a value of a suitable type to each state s'. For example, in the case of stochastic process algebras the value of the continuation function on s' represents the rate of the negative exponential distribution characterizing the duration/delay of the action performed to reach state s' from s. We first provide the semantics of a simple formalism used to describe continuous-time Markov chains, then we model a number of process algebras that permit parallel composition of models according to the two main interaction paradigms (multiparty and one-to-one synchronization). Finally, we deal with formalisms where actions and rates are kept separate and address the issues related to the coexistence of stochastic, probabilistic, and nondeterministic behaviors. For each formalism, we establish the formal correspondence between the FuTSs semantics and its original semantics.},

abstract = {Networks-on-Chip constitute the interconnection architecture of future, massively parallel multiprocessors that assemble hundreds to thousands of processing cores on a single chip. Their integration is enabled by ongoing miniaturization of chip manufacturing technologies following Moore's Law. It comes with the downside of the circuit elements' increased susceptibility to failure. Research on fault-tolerant Networks-on-Chip tries to mitigate partial failure and its effect on network performance and reliability by exploiting various forms of redundancy at the suitable network layers. The article at hand reviews the failure mechanisms, fault models, diagnosis techniques, and fault-tolerance methods in on-chip networks, and surveys and summarizes the research of the last ten years. It is structured along three communication layers: the data link, the network, and the transport layers. The most important results are summarized and open research problems and challenges are highlighted to guide future research on this topic.},

Over the past few years, many studies have proposed different techniques to address trust management issues. However, despite these past efforts, several trust management issues such as identification, privacy, personalization, integration, security, and scalability have been mostly neglected and need to be addressed before cloud computing can be fully embraced. In this article, we present an overview of the cloud service models and we survey the main techniques and research prototypes that efficiently support trust management of services in cloud environments. We present a generic analytical framework that assesses existing trust management research prototypes in cloud computing and relevant areas using a set of assessment criteria.

Second, an emerging OSS should be further explored for software development: social networks.

abstract = {Network virtualization provides a novel approach to running multiple concurrent virtual networks over a common physical network infrastructure. From a research perspective, this enables the networking community to concurrently experiment with new Internet architectures and protocols. From a market perspective, on the other hand, this paradigm is appealing as it enables infrastructure service providers to experiment with new business models that range from leasing virtual slices of their infrastructure to hosting multiple concurrent network services.In this article, we present the slice embedding problem and recent developments in the area. A slice is a set of virtual instances spanning a set of physical resources. The embedding problem consists of three main tasks: (1) resource discovery, which involves monitoring the state of the physical resources, (2) virtual network mapping, which involves matching users' requests with the available resources, and (3) allocation, which involves assigning the resources that match the users' requests.We also outline how these three tasks are tightly coupled, and how there exists a wide spectrum of solutions that either solve a particular task or jointly solve multiple tasks along with the interactions among them. To dissect the space of solutions, we introduce three main classification criteria, namely: (1) the type of constraints imposed by the user, (2) the type of dynamics considered in the embedding process, and (3) the allocation strategy adopted. Finally, we conclude with a few interesting research directions.},

In consequence, interest in this problem is increasing rapidly among the research community and the number of publications on the question has grown exponentially in recent years. This article proposes a taxonomy of botnet research and presents a survey of the field to provide a comprehensive overview of all these contributions. Furthermore, we hope to provide researchers with a clear perspective of the gaps that remain to be filled in our defenses against botnets. The taxonomy is based upon the botnet's life-cycle, defined as the sequence of stages a botnet needs to pass through in order to reach its goal.This approach allows us to consider the problem of botnets from a global perspective, which constitutes a key difference from other taxonomies that have been proposed. Under this novel taxonomy, we conclude that all attempts to defeat botnets should be focused on one or more stages of this life-cycle. In fact, the sustained hindering of any of the stages makes it possible to thwart a botnet's progress and thus render it useless. We test the potential capabilities of our taxonomy by means of a survey of current botnet research, and find it genuinely useful in understanding the focus of the different contributions in this field.},

abstract = {Throughput, flexibility, and security form the design trilogy of reconfigurable crypto engines; they must be carefully considered without reducing the major role of classical design constraints, such as surface, power consumption, dependability, and cost. Applications such as network security, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), Digital Rights Management (DRM), and pay per view have drawn attention to these three constraints. For more than ten years, many studies in the field of cryptographic engineering have focused on the design of optimized high-throughput hardware cryptographic cores (e.g., symmetric and asymmetric key block ciphers, stream ciphers, and hash functions). The flexibility of cryptographic systems plays a very important role in their practical application. Reconfigurable hardware systems can evolve with algorithms, face up to new types of attacks, and guarantee interoperability between countries and institutions. The flexibility of reconfigurable crypto processors and crypto coprocessors has reached new levels with the emergence of dynamically reconfigurable hardware architectures and tools. Last but not least, the security of systems that handle confidential information needs to be thoroughly evaluated at the design stage in order to meet security objectives that depend on the importance of the information to be protected and on the cost of protection. Usually, designers tackle security problems at the same time as other design constraints and in many cases target only one security objective, for example, a side-channel attack countermeasures, fault tolerance capability, or the monitoring of the device environment. Only a few authors have addressed all three design constraints at the same time. In particular, key management security (e.g., secure key generation and transmission, the use of a hierarchical key structure composed of session keys and master keys) has frequently been neglected to the benefit of performance and/or flexibility. Nevertheless, a few authors propose original processor architectures based on multi-crypto-processor structures and reconfigurable cryptographic arrays. In this article, we review published works on symmetric key crypto engines and present current trends and design challenges.},

A number of approaches have been recently proposed embedded in various languages such as Haskell, Scheme, JavaScript, Java, .NET, etc. This survey describes and provides a taxonomy of existing reactive programming approaches along six axes: representation of time-varying values, evaluation model, lifting operations, multidirectionality, glitch avoidance, and support for distribution. From this taxonomy, we observe that there are still open challenges in the field of reactive programming. For instance, multidirectionality is supported only by a small number of languages, which do not automatically track dependencies between time-varying values. Similarly, glitch avoidance, which is subtle in reactive programs, cannot be ensured in distributed reactive programs using the current techniques.},

Therefore, trust becomes an essential and important element of a successful social network.

abstract = {The need for flexible customization of large feature-rich software systems, according to requirements of various stakeholders, has become an important problem in software development. Among the many software engineering approaches dealing with variability management, the notion of Software Product Line (SPL) has emerged as a major unifying concept. Drawing from established disciplines of manufacturing, SPL approaches aim to design repertoires of software artifacts, from which customized software systems for specific stakeholder requirements can be developed. A major difficulty SPL approaches attempt to address is the modularization of software artifacts, which reconciles the user's needs for certain features and the development and technical constraints. Towards this end, many SPL approaches use feature diagrams to describe possible configurations of a feature set. There have been several proposals for feature diagram languages with varying degrees of expressiveness, intuitiveness, and precision. However, these feature diagram languages have limited scalability when applied to realistic software systems. This article provides a systematic survey of various concerns of feature diagrams and ways in which concerns have been separated. The survey shows how the uncertainty in the purpose of feature diagram languages creates both conceptual and practical limitations to scalability of those languages.},

abstract = {Web-based malware is a growing threat to today's Internet security. Attacks of this type are prevalent and lead to serious security consequences. Millions of malicious URLs are used as distribution channels to propagate malware all over the Web. After being infected, victim systems fall in the control of attackers, who can utilize them for various cyber crimes such as stealing credentials, spamming, and distributed denial-of-service attacks. Moreover, it has been observed that traditional security technologies such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems have only limited capability to mitigate this new problem.In this article, we survey the state-of-the-art research regarding the analysis of—and defense against—Web-based malware attacks. First, we study the attack model, the root cause, and the vulnerabilities that enable these attacks. Second, we analyze the status quo of the Web-based malware problem. Third, three categories of defense mechanisms are discussed in detail: (1) building honeypots with virtual machines or signature-based detection system to discover existing threats; (2) using code analysis and testing techniques to identify the vulnerabilities of Web applications; and (3) constructing reputation-based blacklists or smart sandbox systems to protect end-users from attacks. We show that these three categories of approaches form an extensive solution space to the Web-based malware problem. Finally, we compare the surveyed approaches and discuss possible future research directions.},

abstract = {Focus on movement data has increased as a consequence of the larger availability of such data due to current GPS, GSM, RFID, and sensors techniques. In parallel, interest in movement has shifted from raw movement data analysis to more application-oriented ways of analyzing segments of movement suitable for the specific purposes of the application. This trend has promoted semantically rich trajectories, rather than raw movement, as the core object of interest in mobility studies. This survey provides the definitions of the basic concepts about mobility data, an analysis of the issues in mobility data management, and a survey of the approaches and techniques for: (i) constructing trajectories from movement tracks, (ii) enriching trajectories with semantic information to enable the desired interpretations of movements, and (iii) using data mining to analyze semantic trajectories and extract knowledge about their characteristics, in particular the behavioral patterns of the moving objects. Last but not least, the article surveys the new privacy issues that arise due to the semantic aspects of trajectories.},

A thorough comparison of different algorithms (a total of fourteen) is provided. In addition to community-level evaluation, we propose a framework for evaluating algorithms' ability to detect overlapping nodes, which helps to assess overdetection and underdetection. After considering community-level detection performance measured by normalized mutual information, the Omega index, and node-level detection performance measured by F-score, we reached the following conclusions. For low overlapping density networks, SLPA, OSLOM, Game, and COPRA offer better performance than the other tested algorithms. For networks with high overlapping density and high overlapping diversity, both SLPA and Game provide relatively stable performance. However, test results also suggest that the detection in such networks is still not yet fully resolved. A common feature observed by various algorithms in real-world networks is the relatively small fraction of overlapping nodes (typically less than 30%), each of which belongs to only 2 or 3 communities.},

This review examines studies investigating Critical Success Factors (CSFs) in implementing Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. Keywords relating to the theme of this study were defined and used to search known Web engines and journal databases for studies on both implementing ERP systems per se and integrating ERP systems with other well- known systems (e.g., SCM, CRM) whose importance to business organizations and academia is acknowledged to work in a complementary fashion. A total of 341 articles were reviewed to address three main goals. This study structures previous research by presenting a comprehensive taxonomy of CSFs in the area of ERP. Second, it maps studies, identified through an exhaustive and comprehensive literature review, to different dimensions and facets of ERP system implementation. Third, it presents studies investigating CSFs in terms of a specific ERP lifecycle phase and across the entire ERP life cycle. This study not only reviews articles in which an ERP system is the sole or primary field of research, but also articles that refer to an integration of ERP systems and other popular systems (e.g., SCM, CRM). Finally it provides a comprehensive bibliography of the articles published during this period that can serve as a guide for future research.},

abstract = {The exponential growth of online videos, along with increasing user involvement in video-related activities, has been observed as a constant phenomenon during the last decade. User's time spent on video capturing, editing, uploading, searching, and viewing has boosted to an unprecedented level. The massive publishing and sharing of videos has given rise to the existence of an already large amount of near-duplicate content. This imposes urgent demands on near-duplicate video retrieval as a key role in novel tasks such as video search, video copyright protection, video recommendation, and many more. Driven by its significance, near-duplicate video retrieval has recently attracted a lot of attention. As discovered in recent works, latest improvements and progress in near-duplicate video retrieval, as well as related topics including low-level feature extraction, signature generation, and high-dimensional indexing, are employed to assist the process.As we survey the works in near-duplicate video retrieval, we comparatively investigate existing variants of the definition of near-duplicate video, describe a generic framework, summarize state-of-the-art practices, and explore the emerging trends in this research topic.},

But today, with the popularity of mobile devices and exponential growth of apps, videos, and clouds, service providers are gradually moving toward more sophisticated pricing schemes. This decade will therefore likely witness a major change in the ways in which network resources are managed, and the role of economics in allocating these resources. This survey reviews some of the well-known past broadband pricing proposals (both static and dynamic), including their current realizations in various consumer data plans around the world, and discusses several research problems and open questions.

Moreover, since the 1980s grammars have been used in computer vision and related areas. Some factors accountable for this increasing use regard its relatively simple understanding and its ability to represent some semantic pattern models found in images, both spatially and temporally. The objective of this article is to present an overview regarding the use of syntactic pattern recognition methods in image representations in several applications. To achieve this purpose, we used a systematic review process to investigate the main digital libraries in the area and to document the phases of the study in order to allow the auditing and further investigation. The results indicated that in some of the studies retrieved, manually created grammars were used to comply with a particular purpose. Other studies performed a learning process of the grammatical rules. In addition, this article also points out still unexplored research opportunities in the literature.},

abstract = {Increasingly, one of the most prominent ways to disseminate information on the Web is through “notifications” (also known as alerts), and as such they are at the core of many large-scale applications. For instance, users are notified of articles in which they are interested through RSS feeds, of posts from their friends through social networks, or of recommendation generated by various sites. Event notification usually relies on the so-called Publish-Subscribe (Pub/Sub) communication paradigm. In Pub/Sub systems, subscribers sign up for events or classes of events in order to be asynchronously notified afterward by the system. The size of such systems (with respect to events and subscriptions) keeps growing, and providing scalable implementations of Pub/Sub systems is extremely challenging. Although there exist popular examples of centralized Pub/Sub systems that currently support a large number of subscribers, such as online social networks, they periodically face formidable challenges due to peak loads and do not always offer a support for fine-grain subscriptions. In fact, providing scalability along with expressiveness in the subscription patterns calls for distributed implementations of Pub/Sub systems. In parallel, peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks have emerged, providing a sound and highly scalable network foundation upon which to build distributed applications including Pub/Sub systems.In this article, we focus on fully decentralized (P2P), highly scalable, Pub/Sub systems. More specifically, we investigate how Pub/Sub and P2P research can be integrated. We define the design space and explore it in a systematic way. We expose an understanding of available design choices; provide a comprehensive classification and understanding of prominent P2P Pub/Sub systems, positioning them against the design dimensions; and highlight correlations between and implications, benefits, and shortcomings of design alternatives.},

In this article, we provide an exhaustive survey of the work on mining these traces. We first provide a formalization of the data sets, along with an overview of different mechanisms for preprocessing the data. We then classify the existing work into three main categories: social dynamics, traffic dynamics and operational dynamics. Social dynamics refers to the study of the collective behaviour of a city’s population, based on their observed movements; Traffic dynamics studies the resulting flow of the movement through the road network; Operational dynamics refers to the study and analysis of taxi driver’s modus operandi. We discuss the different problems currently being researched, the various approaches proposed, and suggest new avenues of research. Finally, we present a historical overview of the research work in this field and discuss which areas hold most promise for future research.},

People reidentification can be a useful tool for people analysis in security as a data association method for long-term tracking in surveillance. However, current identification techniques being utilized present many difficulties and shortcomings. For instance, they rely solely on the exploitation of visual cues such as color, texture, and the object’s shape. Despite the many advances in this field, reidentification is still an open problem. This survey aims to tackle all the issues and challenging aspects of people reidentification while simultaneously describing the previously proposed solutions for the encountered problems. This begins with the first attempts of holistic descriptors and progresses to the more recently adopted 2D and 3D model-based approaches.

The successful use of auditory representations in this growing number of application scenarios has in turn prompted researchers to rediscover the more basic auditory representations and extend them in various directions. The goal of this article is to survey both classical auditory representations (e.g., auditory icons and earcons) and those auditory representations that have been created as extensions to earlier approaches, including speech-based sounds (e.g., spearcons and spindex representations), emotionally grounded sounds (e.g., auditory emoticons and spemoticons), and various other sound types used to provide sonifications in practical scenarios.

More precisely, we implemented and tested the same lookup table oscillator example program, one of the most classical algorithms for sound synthesis, using a selection of significant synchronous programming languages, half of which designed as specific music languages—Csound, Pure Data, SuperCollider, ChucK, Faust—and the other half being general synchronous formalisms—Signal, Lustre, Esterel, Lucid Synchrone and C with the OpenMP Stream Extension (Matlab/Octave is used for the initial specification).

abstract = {The spatial features of emitted wireless signals are the basis of location distinction and determination for wireless indoor localization. Available in mainstream wireless signal measurements, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) has been adopted in vast indoor localization systems. However, it suffers from dramatic performance degradation in complex situations due to multipath fading and temporal dynamics.Break-through techniques resort to finer-grained wireless channel measurement than RSSI. Different from RSSI, the PHY layer power feature, channel response, is able to discriminate multipath characteristics, and thus holds the potential for the convergence of accurate and pervasive indoor localization. Channel State Information (CSI, reflecting channel response in 802.11 a/g/n) has attracted many research efforts and some pioneer works have demonstrated submeter or even centimeter-level accuracy. In this article, we survey this new trend of channel response in localization. The differences between CSI and RSSI are highlighted with respect to network layering, time resolution, frequency resolution, stability, and accessibility. Furthermore, we investigate a large body of recent works and classify them overall into three categories according to how to use CSI. For each category, we emphasize the basic principles and address future directions of research in this new and largely open area.},

abstract = {After more than 40 years of life, software evolution should be considered as a mature field. However, despite such a long history, many research questions still remain open, and controversial studies about the validity of the laws of software evolution are common. During the first part of these 40 years, the laws themselves evolved to adapt to changes in both the research and the software industry environments. This process of adaption to new paradigms, standards, and practices stopped about 15 years ago, when the laws were revised for the last time. However, most controversial studies have been raised during this latter period. Based on a systematic and comprehensive literature review, in this article, we describe how and when the laws, and the software evolution field, evolved. We also address the current state of affairs about the validity of the laws, how they are perceived by the research community, and the developments and challenges that are likely to occur in the coming years.},

abstract = {The explosive growth and widespread accessibility of community-contributed media content on the Internet have led to a surge of research activity in multimedia search. Approaches that apply text search techniques for multimedia search have achieved limited success as they entirely ignore visual content as a ranking signal. Multimedia search reranking, which reorders visual documents based on multimodal cues to improve initial text-only searches, has received increasing attention in recent years. Such a problem is challenging because the initial search results often have a great deal of noise. Discovering knowledge or visual patterns from such a noisy ranked list to guide the reranking process is difficult. Numerous techniques have been developed for visual search re-ranking. The purpose of this paper is to categorize and evaluate these algorithms. We also discuss relevant issues such as data collection, evaluation metrics, and benchmarking. We conclude with several promising directions for future research.},

abstract = {Software verification has emerged as a key concern for ensuring the continued progress of information technology. Full verification generally requires, as a crucial step, equipping each loop with a “loop invariant.” Beyond their role in verification, loop invariants help program understanding by providing fundamental insights into the nature of algorithms. In practice, finding sound and useful invariants remains a challenge. Fortunately, many invariants seem intuitively to exhibit a common flavor. Understanding these fundamental invariant patterns could therefore provide help for understanding and verifying a large variety of programs.We performed a systematic identification, validation, and classification of loop invariants over a range of fundamental algorithms from diverse areas of computer science. This article analyzes the patterns, as uncovered in this study, governing how invariants are derived from postconditions; it proposes a taxonomy of invariants according to these patterns; and it presents its application to the algorithms reviewed. The discussion also shows the need for high-level specifications based on “domain theory.” It describes how the invariants and the corresponding algorithms have been mechanically verified using an automated program prover; the proof source files are available. The contributions also include suggestions for invariant inference and for model-based specification.},

We detail each component of the framework, provide references to related research, and introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity recognition research community. We conclude with the educational example problem of recognizing different hand gestures from inertial sensors attached to the upper and lower arm.

However, for Dynamic Multi-Objective Optimisation (DMOO), no standard benchmark functions are used. A number of DMOOPs have been proposed in recent years. However, no comprehensive overview of DMOOPs exist in the literature. Therefore, choosing which benchmark functions to use is not a trivial task. This article seeks to address this gap in the DMOO literature by providing a comprehensive overview of proposed DMOOPs, and proposing characteristics that an ideal DMOO benchmark function suite should exhibit. In addition, DMOOPs are proposed for each characteristic. Shortcomings of current DMOOPs that do not address certain characteristics of an ideal benchmark suite are highlighted. These identified shortcomings are addressed by proposing new DMOO benchmark functions with complicated Pareto-Optimal Sets (POSs), and approaches to develop DMOOPs with either an isolated or deceptive Pareto-Optimal Front (POF). In addition, DMOO application areas and real-world DMOOPs are discussed.},

abstract = {The past two decades have witnessed an explosion in the deployment of large-scale distributed simulations and distributed virtual environments in different domains, including military and academic simulation systems, social media, and commercial applications such as massively multiplayer online games. As these systems become larger, more data intensive, and more latency sensitive, the optimisation of the flow of data, a paradigm referred to as interest management, has become increasingly critical to address the scalability requirements and enable their successful deployment. Numerous interest management schemes have been proposed for different application scenarios. This article provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in the design of interest management algorithms and systems. The scope of the survey includes current and historical projects providing a taxonomy of the existing schemes and summarising their key features. Identifying the primary requirements of interest management, the article discusses the trade-offs involved in the design of existing approaches.},

abstract = {Web applications are one of the most prevalent platforms for information and service delivery over the Internet today. As they are increasingly used for critical services, web applications have become a popular and valuable target for security attacks. Although a large body of techniques have been developed to fortify web applications and mitigate attacks launched against them, there has been little effort devoted to drawing connections among these techniques and building the big picture of web application security research.This article surveys the area of securing web applications from the server side, with the aim of systematizing the existing techniques into a big picture that promotes future research. We first present the unique aspects of the web application development that cause inherent challenges in building secure web applications. We then discuss three commonly seen security vulnerabilities within web applications: input validation vulnerabilities, session management vulnerabilities, and application logic vulnerabilities, along with attacks that exploit these vulnerabilities. We organize the existing techniques along two dimensions: (1) the security vulnerabilities and attacks that they address and (2) the design objective and the phases of a web application during which they can be carried out. These phases are secure construction of new web applications, security analysis/testing of legacy web applications, and runtime protection of legacy web applications. Finally, we summarize the lessons learned and discuss future research opportunities in this area.},

abstract = {Memory encryption has yet to be used at the core of operating system designs to provide confidentiality of code and data. As a result, numerous vulnerabilities exist at every level of the software stack. Three general approaches have evolved to rectify this problem. The most popular approach is based on complex hardware enhancements; this allows all encryption and decryption to be conducted within a well-defined trusted boundary. Unfortunately, these designs have not been integrated within commodity processors and have primarily been explored through simulation with very few prototypes. An alternative approach has been to augment existing hardware with operating system enhancements for manipulating keys, providing improved trust. This approach has provided insights into the use of encryption but has involved unacceptable overheads and has not been adopted in commercial operating systems. Finally, specialized industrial devices have evolved, potentially adding coprocessors, to increase security of particular operations in specific operating environments. However, this approach lacks generality and has introduced unexpected vulnerabilities of its own. Recently, memory encryption primitives have been integrated within commodity processors such as the Intel i7, AMD bulldozer, and multiple ARM variants. This opens the door for new operating system designs that provide confidentiality across the entire software stack outside the CPU. To date, little practical experimentation has been conducted, and the improvements in security and associated performance degradation has yet to be quantified. This article surveys the current memory encryption literature from the viewpoint of these central issues.},

A so-called preprocessing algorithm may compute certain information (a data structure or index) to prepare for the next phase. After this preprocessing step, applications may ask shortest-path or distance queries, which should be answered as fast as possible.Due to its many applications in areas such as transportation, networking, and social science, this problem has been considered by researchers from various communities (sometimes under different names): algorithm engineers construct fast route planning methods; database and information systems researchers investigate materialization tradeoffs, query processing on spatial networks, and reachability queries; and theoretical computer scientists analyze distance oracles and sparse spanners. Related problems are considered for compact routing and distance labeling schemes in networking and distributed computing and for metric embeddings in geometry as well.In this survey, we review selected approaches, algorithms, and results on shortest-path queries from these fields, with the main focus lying on the tradeoff between the index size and the query time. We survey methods for general graphs as well as specialized methods for restricted graph classes, in particular for those classes with arguable practical significance such as planar graphs and complex networks.},

This article presents a survey of optimizations for stream processing. It is aimed both at users who need to understand and guide the system’s optimizer and at implementers who need to make engineering tradeoffs. To consolidate terminology, this article is organized as a catalog, in a style similar to catalogs of design patterns or refactorings. To make assumptions explicit and help understand tradeoffs, each optimization is presented with its safety constraints (when does it preserve correctness?) and a profitability experiment (when does it improve performance?). We hope that this survey will help future streaming system builders to stand on the shoulders of giants from not just their own community.},

abstract = {Transformation-based learning (TBL) is a machine learning method for, in particular, sequential classification, invented by Eric Brill [Brill 1993b, 1995a]. It is widely used within computational linguistics and natural language processing, but surprisingly little in other areas.TBL is a simple yet flexible paradigm, which achieves competitive or even state-of-the-art performance in several areas and does not overtrain easily. It is especially successful at catching local, fixed-distance dependencies and seamlessly exploits information from heterogeneous discrete feature types. The learned representation—an ordered list of transformation rules—is compact and efficient, with clear semantics. Individual rules are interpretable and often meaningful to humans.The present article offers a survey of the most important theoretical work on TBL, addressing a perceived gap in the literature. Because the method should be useful also outside the world of computational linguistics and natural language processing, a chief aim is to provide an informal but relatively comprehensive introduction, readable also by people coming from other specialities.},

However, cloud vendors have not taken into account cloud interoperability issues, and each cloud comes with its own solution and interfaces for services. This survey initially discusses all the relevant aspects motivating cloud interoperability. Furthermore, it categorizes and identifies possible cloud interoperability scenarios and architectures. The spectrum of challenges and obstacles that the Inter-cloud realization is faced with are covered, a taxonomy of them is provided, and fitting enablers that tackle each challenge are identified. All these aspects require a comprehensive review of the state of the art, including ongoing projects and studies in the area.

In addition, maps—especially historical maps—are often the only information source about the earth as surveyed using geodetic techniques. In order to preserve these unique documents, increasing numbers of digital map archives have been established, driven by advances in software and hardware technologies. Since the early 1980s, researchers from a variety of disciplines, including computer science and geography, have been working on computational methods for the extraction and recognition of geographic features from archived images of maps (digital map processing). The typical result from map processing is geographic information that can be used in spatial and spatiotemporal analyses in a Geographic Information System environment, which benefits numerous research fields in the spatial, social, environmental, and health sciences. However, map processing literature is spread across a broad range of disciplines in which maps are included as a special type of image.

The resulting research progress has established the importance of the user-item (U-I) matrix, which encodes the individual preferences of users for items in a collection, for recommender systems. The U-I matrix provides the basis for collaborative filtering (CF) techniques, the dominant framework for recommender systems. Currently, new recommendation scenarios are emerging that offer promising new information that goes beyond the U-I matrix. This information can be divided into two categories related to its source: rich side information concerning users and items, and interaction information associated with the interplay of users and items. In this survey, we summarize and analyze recommendation scenarios involving information sources and the CF algorithms that have been recently developed to address them. We provide a comprehensive introduction to a large body of research, more than 200 key references, with the aim of supporting the further development of recommender systems exploiting information beyond the U-I matrix. On the basis of this material, we identify and discuss what we see as the central challenges lying ahead for recommender system technology, both in terms of extensions of existing techniques as well as of the integration of techniques and technologies drawn from other research areas.},

abstract = {Visual sensor networks (VSNs) are receiving a lot of attention in research, and at the same time, commercial applications are starting to emerge. VSN devices come with image sensors, adequate processing power, and memory. They use wireless communication interfaces to collaborate and jointly solve tasks such as tracking persons within the network. VSNs are expected to replace not only many traditional, closed-circuit surveillance systems but also to enable emerging applications in scenarios such as elderly care, home monitoring, or entertainment. In all of these applications, VSNs monitor a potentially large group of people and record sensitive image data that might contain identities of persons, their behavior, interaction patterns, or personal preferences. These intimate details can be easily abused, for example, to derive personal profiles.The highly sensitive nature of images makes security and privacy in VSNs even more important than in most other sensor and data networks. However, the direct use of security techniques developed for related domains might be misleading due to the different requirements and design challenges. This is especially true for aspects such as data confidentiality and privacy protection against insiders, generating awareness among monitored people, and giving trustworthy feedback about recorded personal data—all of these aspects go beyond what is typically required in other applications.In this survey, we present an overview of the characteristics of VSN applications, the involved security threats and attack scenarios, and the major security challenges. A central contribution of this survey is our classification of VSN security aspects into data-centric, node-centric, network-centric, and user-centric security. We identify and discuss the individual security requirements and present a profound overview of related work for each class. We then discuss privacy protection techniques and identify recent trends in VSN security and privacy. A discussion of open research issues concludes this survey.},

abstract = {The automatic elimination of duplicate data in a storage system, commonly known as deduplication, is increasingly accepted as an effective technique to reduce storage costs. Thus, it has been applied to different storage types, including archives and backups, primary storage, within solid-state drives, and even to random access memory. Although the general approach to deduplication is shared by all storage types, each poses specific challenges and leads to different trade-offs and solutions. This diversity is often misunderstood, thus underestimating the relevance of new research and development.The first contribution of this article is a classification of deduplication systems according to six criteria that correspond to key design decisions: granularity, locality, timing, indexing, technique, and scope. This classification identifies and describes the different approaches used for each of them. As a second contribution, we describe which combinations of these design decisions have been proposed and found more useful for challenges in each storage type. Finally, outstanding research challenges and unexplored design points are identified and discussed.},

abstract = {Software-product-line engineering has gained considerable momentum in recent years, both in industry and in academia. A software product line is a family of software products that share a common set of features. Software product lines challenge traditional analysis techniques, such as type checking, model checking, and theorem proving, in their quest of ensuring correctness and reliability of software. Simply creating and analyzing all products of a product line is usually not feasible, due to the potentially exponential number of valid feature combinations. Recently, researchers began to develop analysis techniques that take the distinguishing properties of software product lines into account, for example, by checking feature-related code in isolation or by exploiting variability information during analysis. The emerging field of product-line analyses is both broad and diverse, so it is difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand their similarities and differences. We propose a classification of product-line analyses to enable systematic research and application. Based on our insights with classifying and comparing a corpus of 123 research articles, we develop a research agenda to guide future research on product-line analyses.},

Many solutions have been proposed in the literature to address this important issue from complementary perspectives, which are often hard to capture in a comprehensive manner. This survey article aims at providing a structured and unifying treatment of the existing literature on intelligent energy management systems in buildings, with a distinct focus on available architectures and methodology supporting a vision transcending the well-established smart home vision, in favor of the novel Ambient Intelligence paradigm. Our exposition will cover the main architectural components of such systems, beginning with the basic sensory infrastructure, moving on to the data processing engine where energy-saving strategies may be enacted, to the user interaction interface subsystem, and finally to the actuation infrastructure necessary to transfer the planned modifications to the environment. For each component, we will analyze different solutions, and we will provide qualitative comparisons, also highlighting the impact that a single design choice can have on the rest of the system.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) provide a convenient way to monitor the physical environment. They consist of a large number of sensors that have sensing, computing, and communication abilities. In the past, sensors were considered as static, but the network functionality would degrade when some sensors were broken. Today, the emerging hardware techniques have promoted the development of mobile sensors. Introducing mobility to sensors not only improves their capability but also gives them flexibility to deal with node failure. The article studies the research progress of mobile sensor networks, which embraces both system hardware and dispatch software. For system hardware, we review two popular types of mobile sensor platforms. One is to integrate mobile robots with sensors, whereas the other is to use existing conveyances to carry sensors. Dispatch software includes two topics. We first address how to solve different coverage problems by using a purely mobile WSN and then investigate how to dispatch mobile sensors in a hybrid WSN to perform various missions including data collection, faulty recovery, and event analysis. A discussion about research challenges in mobile sensor networks is also presented in the article.},

A consistent taxonomy has not yet been established for this field. A new multifaceted taxonomy is presented in this work that provides a framework for authors to clearly and consistently describe their models, making them easier to understand and reproduce. By surveying the application field of mobile communication networks, a common nomenclature and a high-level view of existing literature are provided, which are required to reduce duplication of effort and to enable a better sense of the way forward.

Graphical modeling languages have been introduced to minimize this limit. Here, we survey the main graphical formalisms (supported by software tools) available to model biological systems with a primary focus on their usability, within the framework of modeling reaction pathways with two-dimensional (2D) (possibly nested) compartments. Considering the main characteristics of the surveyed formalisms, we synthesise a new proposal (Style) and report the results of an online survey conducted among biologists to assess usability of available graphical formalisms. We consider this proposal a guideline developed from what we learned in the survey, which can inform development of graphical formalisms to model reaction pathways in 2D space.},

Thus, we sacrifice full details and proofs of individual constructions in favor of an overview of the underlying key techniques. We categorize and compare the different SE schemes in terms of their security, efficiency, and functionality. For the experienced researcher, we point out connections between the many approaches to SE and identify open research problems.Two major conclusions can be drawn from our work. While the so-called IND-CKA2 security notion becomes prevalent in the literature and efficient (sublinear) SE schemes meeting this notion exist in the symmetric setting, achieving this strong form of security efficiently in the asymmetric setting remains an open problem. We observe that in multirecipient SE schemes, regardless of their efficiency drawbacks, there is a noticeable lack of query expressiveness that hinders deployment in practice.},

abstract = {Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are infrastructureless and distributed communication systems that require sophisticated approaches to routing to cope with node mobility and heterogeneous application requirements. In the past few years, distributed hash table (DHT) has come forth as a useful additional technique to the design and specification of spontaneous and self-organized networks. Researchers have exploited its advantages by implementing it at the network layer and developing scalable routing protocols for MANETs. The implementation of DHT-based routing in a MANET requires different algorithms and specifications compared to routing in the Internet because a MANET has its unique characteristics, such as node mobility, spontaneous networking, decentralized architecture, limited transmission range, dynamic topology, and frequent network partitioning/merging.In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of research related to DHT-based routing that aims at enhancing the scalability of MANETs. We present a vivid taxonomy of DHT-based routing protocols and the guidelines to design such protocols for MANETs. We compare the features, strengths, and weaknesses of existing DHT-based routing protocols and highlight key research challenges that are vital to address. The outcome of the analysis serves as a guide for anyone willing to delve into research on DHT-based routing in MANETs.},

F/J requests spawn K tasks that are sent to K parallel servers, and the completion of all K tasks marks the completion of an F/J request. The exact formula for the mean response time of K = 2-way F/J requests derived under Markovian assumptions (RF/J2) served as the starting point for an approximate expression for RF/JK for 2 &lt; K ≤ 32. When servers process independent requests in addition to F/J requests, the mean response time of F/J requests is better approximated by RmaxK, which is the maximum of the response times of tasks constituting F/J requests. RmaxK is easier to compute and serves as an upper bound to RF/JK. We discuss techniques to compute RmaxK and generally the maximum of K random variables denoting the processing times of the tasks of a parallel computation XmaxK. Graph models of computations such as Petri nets—a more general form of parallelism than F/J requests—are also discussed in this work.

A service-based system is subjected to continuous evolution and regression testing is required to check whether new faults have been introduced. Based on the current scientific work of web service regression testing, this survey aims to identify gaps in current research and suggests some promising areas for further study. To this end, we performed a broad automatic search on publications in the selected electronic databases published from 2000 to 2013. Through our careful review and manual screening, a total of 30 papers have been selected as primary studies for answering our research questions. We presented a qualitative analysis of the findings, including stakeholders, challenges, standards, techniques, and validations employed in these primary studies. Our main results include the following: (1) Service integrator is the key stakeholder that largely impacts how regression testing is performed. (2) Challenges of cost and autonomy issues have been studied heavily. However, more emphasis should be put on the other challenges, such as test timing, dynamics, privacy, quota constraints, and concurrency issues. (3) Orchestration-based services have been largely studied, while little attention has been paid to either choreography-based services or semantic-based services. (4) An appreciable amount of web service regression testing techniques have been proposed, including 48 test case prioritization techniques, 10 test selection techniques, two test suite minimization techniques, and another collaborative technique. (5) Many regression test techniques have not been theoretically proven or experimentally analyzed, which limits their application in large-scale systems. We believe that our survey has identified gaps in current research work and reveals new insights for the future work.},

abstract = {Key management is required for basic security services of confidentiality, integrity, and data source authentication. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a challenging environment to provide such services due to the resource constraints and the increased likelihood of nodes to be captured. Various key management techniques were proposed that trade off resilience to node capture and overhead in terms of communication and memory.We identify the main factors influencing the design space of key management protocols for sensor networks and describe representative protocols that trade off the number of links established, communication overhead, and resilience to node capture. These trade-offs are due to using direct, pathbased, or multipath-based communication to establish secure links. We propose a new multipath protocol relying on an encoding scheme tailored for WSNs and analyze the effects of key pre-distribution on multipath key establishment.We provide extensive simulations to understand the trade-offs between resilience to node compromise and communication overhead under numerous network scenarios. This comparison highlights the trade-offs between these vastly different key management schemes. For the newer class of key management schemes—multipath based—we quantify experimentally the additional communication overhead required for extra paths and the improvement in resilience from using these paths.},

The hunger for power brings large electricity bills to datacenter operators and causes significant impacts to the environment. To reduce costs and environmental impacts, modern datacenters, such as those of Google and Apple, are beginning to integrate renewable or green energy sources into their power supply. This article investigates the green-energy-aware power management problem for these datacenters and surveys and classifies works that explicitly consider renewable energy and/or carbon emission. Our aim is to give a full view of this problem. Hence, we first provide some basic knowledge on datacenters (including datacenter components, power infrastructure, power load estimation, and energy sources' operations), the electrical grid (including dynamic pricing, power outages, and emission factor), and the carbon market (including cap-and-trade and carbon tax). Then, we categorize existing research works according to their basic approaches used, including workload scheduling, virtual machine management, and energy capacity planning.

One such vulnerability involves the use of artificial fingers, where materials such as Play-Doh, silicone, and gelatin are inscribed with fingerprint ridges. Researchers have demonstrated that some commercial fingerprint recognition systems can be deceived when these artificial fingers are placed on the sensor; that is, the system successfully processes the ensuing fingerprint images, thereby allowing an adversary to spoof the fingerprints of another individual. However, at the same time, several countermeasures that discriminate between live fingerprints and spoof artifacts have been proposed. While some of these antispoofing schemes are hardware based, several software-based approaches have been proposed as well.

These playlists are basically sequences of tracks that traditionally are designed manually and whose organization is based on some underlying logic or theme. With the digitalization of music and the availability of various types of additional track-related information on the Web, new opportunities have emerged on how to automate the playlist creation process. Correspondingly, a number of proposals for automated playlist generation have been made in the literature during the past decade. These approaches vary both with respect to which kind of data they rely on and which types of algorithms they use. In this article, we review the literature on automated playlist generation and categorize the existing approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the evaluation designs that are used today in research to assess the quality of the generated playlists. Finally, we report the results of a comparative evaluation of typical playlist generation schemes based on historical data. Our results show that track and artist popularity can play a dominant role and that additional measures are required to better characterize and compare the quality of automatically generated playlists.},

In particular, mobile phone datasets offer access to insights into urban dynamics and human activities at an unprecedented scale and level of detail, representing a huge opportunity for research and real-world applications. This article surveys the new ideas and techniques related to the use of telecommunication data for urban sensing. We outline the data that can be collected from telecommunication networks as well as their strengths and weaknesses with a particular focus on urban sensing. We survey existing filtering and processing techniques to extract insights from this data and summarize them to provide recommendations on which datasets and techniques to use for specific urban sensing applications. Finally, we discuss a number of challenges and open research areas currently being faced in this field. We strongly believe the material and recommendations presented here will become increasingly important as mobile phone network datasets are becoming more accessible to the research community.},

abstract = {Open production communities (OPCs) provide technical features and social norms for a vast but dispersed and diverse crowd to collectively accumulate content. In OPCs, certain mechanisms, policies, and technologies are provided for voluntary users to participate in community-related activities including content generation, evaluation, qualification, and distribution and in some cases even community governance. Due to the known complexities and dynamism of online communities, designing a successful community is deemed more an art than a science. Numerous studies have investigated different aspects of certain types of OPCs. Most of these studies, however, fall short of delivering a general view or prescription due to their narrow focus on a certain type of OPCs. In contribution to theories on technology-mediated social participation (TMSP), this study synthesizes the streams of research in the particular area of OPCs and delivers a theoretical framework as a baseline for adapting findings from one specific type of community on another. This framework consists of four primary dimensions, namely, platform features, content, user, and community. The corresponding attributes of these dimensions and the existing interdependencies are discussed in detail. Furthermore, a decision diagram for selecting features and a design guideline for “decontextualizing” findings are introduced as possible applications of the framework. The framework also provides a new and reliable foundation on which future research can extend its findings and prescriptions in a systematic way.},

First, we provide a brief introduction to the underlying human factors of skill acquisition relevant to interaction with computer systems. We then present our focus, which is a review of the state of the art in user interfaces that promote expertise development. The review of interface research is based around four domains of performance improvement: intramodal improvement that occurs as a factor of repetition and practice with a single method of interaction; intermodal improvement that occurs when users switch from one method to another that has a higher performance ceiling; vocabulary extension, in which the user broadens his or her knowledge of the range of functions available; and task mapping, which examines the ways in which users perform their tasks. The review emphasizes the relationship between interface techniques and the human factors that explain their relative success.},

abstract = {Opportunistic Routing (OR) is a new promising paradigm that has been proposed for wireless networks. OR has gained a lot of attention from the research communities for its ability to increase the performance of wireless networks. It benefits from the broadcast characteristic of wireless mediums to improve network performance. The basic function of OR is its ability to overhear the transmitted packet and to coordinate among relaying nodes. In OR, a candidate set is a potential group of nodes that is selected as the next-hop forwarders. Hence, each node in OR can use different potential paths to send packets toward the destination. Any of the candidates of a node that have received the transmitted packet may forward it. The decision of choosing the next forwarder is made by coordination between candidates that have successfully received the transmitted packet. In OR, by using a dynamic relay node to forward the packet, the transmission reliability and network throughput can be increased. In this article, we explain the fundamental idea of OR and its important issues by providing some examples. We then categorize each of the important issues and explain them in detail. Furthermore, we illustrate different protocols from each category and compare their benefits and drawbacks. Finally, some potential directions for future research in OR is explained.},

However, such great significance comes with the support of a great infrastructure that includes large data centers comprising thousands of server units and other supporting equipment. Their share in power consumption generates between 1.1% and 1.5% of the total electricity use worldwide and is projected to rise even more. Such alarming numbers demand rethinking the energy efficiency of such infrastructures. However, before making any changes to infrastructure, an analysis of the current status is required. In this article, we perform a comprehensive analysis of an infrastructure supporting the cloud computing paradigm with regards to energy efficiency. First, we define a systematic approach for analyzing the energy efficiency of most important data center domains, including server and network equipment, as well as cloud management systems and appliances consisting of a software utilized by end users. Second, we utilize this approach for analyzing available scientific and industrial literature on state-of-the-art practices in data centers and their equipment.

abstract = {Affect detection is an important pattern recognition problem that has inspired researchers from several areas. The field is in need of a systematic review due to the recent influx of Multimodal (MM) affect detection systems that differ in several respects and sometimes yield incompatible results. This article provides such a survey via a quantitative review and meta-analysis of 90 peer-reviewed MM systems. The review indicated that the state of the art mainly consists of person-dependent models (62.2% of systems) that fuse audio and visual (55.6%) information to detect acted (52.2%) expressions of basic emotions and simple dimensions of arousal and valence (64.5%) with feature- (38.9%) and decision-level (35.6%) fusion techniques. However, there were also person-independent systems that considered additional modalities to detect nonbasic emotions and complex dimensions using model-level fusion techniques. The meta-analysis revealed that MM systems were consistently (85% of systems) more accurate than their best unimodal counterparts, with an average improvement of 9.83% (median of 6.60%). However, improvements were three times lower when systems were trained on natural (4.59%) versus acted data (12.7%). Importantly, MM accuracy could be accurately predicted (cross-validated R2 of 0.803) from unimodal accuracies and two system-level factors. Theoretical and applied implications and recommendations are discussed.},

abstract = {In response to the revival of virtualized technology by Rosenblum and Garfinkel [2005], NIST defined cloud computing, a new paradigm in service computing infrastructures. In cloud environments, the basic security mechanism is ingrained in virtualization—that is, the execution of instructions at different privilege levels. Despite its obvious benefits, the caveat is that a crashed virtual machine (VM) is much harder to recover than a crashed workstation. When crashed, a VM is nothing but a giant corrupt binary file and quite unrecoverable by standard disk-based forensics. Therefore, VM crashes should be avoided at all costs. Security is one of the major contributors to such VM crashes. This includes compromising the hypervisor, cloud storage, images of VMs used infrequently, and remote cloud client used by the customer as well as threat from malicious insiders. Although using secure infrastructures such as private clouds alleviate several of these security problems, most cloud users end up using cheaper options such as third-party infrastructures (i.e., private clouds), thus a thorough discussion of all known security issues is pertinent. Hence, in this article, we discuss ongoing research in cloud security in order of the attack scenarios exploited most often in the cloud environment. We explore attack scenarios that call for securing the hypervisor, exploiting co-residency of VMs, VM image management, mitigating insider threats, securing storage in clouds, abusing lightweight software-as-a-service clients, and protecting data propagation in clouds. Wearing a practitioner's glasses, we explore the relevance of each attack scenario to a service company like Infosys. At the same time, we draw parallels between cloud security research and implementation of security solutions in the form of enterprise security suites for the cloud. We discuss the state of practice in the form of enterprise security suites that include cryptographic solutions, access control policies in the cloud, new techniques for attack detection, and security quality assurance in clouds.},

Furthermore, we propose a pipeline to classify the existing methods and define a standard formal notation, offering a global point of view of the literature.Our discussion, based on the results presented in the analyzed papers, shows how, although certain aspects of the registration process still need to be tested further in real application situations, the registration pipeline as a whole has progressed steadily.

This survey performs a systematic classification of the state of the art on the analysis and modeling of such threats, which are caused by physical mechanisms to digital systems. The purpose of this article is to provide a classification tool that can aid with the navigation across the entire landscape of reliability analysis and modeling. A classification framework is constructed in a top-down fashion from complementary categories, each one addressing an approach on reliability analysis and modeling. In comparison to other classifications, the proposed methodology approaches the target research domain in a complete way, without suppressing hybrid works that fall under multiple categories. To substantiate the usability of the classification framework, representative works from the state of the art are mapped to each appropriate category and are briefly analyzed. Thus, research trends and opportunities for novel approaches can be identified.},

This article provides an overview of the current state of the art in mobile sensing and context prediction paving the way for full-fledged anticipatory mobile computing. We present a survey of phenomena that mobile phones can infer and predict, and offer a description of machine learning techniques used for such predictions.

abstract = {Network covert channels are used to hide communication inside network protocols. Various techniques for covert channels have arisen in the past few decades. We surveyed and analyzed 109 techniques developed between 1987 and 2013 and show that these techniques can be reduced to only 11 different patterns. Moreover, the majority (69.7%) of techniques can be categorized into only four different patterns (i.e., most techniques we surveyed are similar). We represent the patterns in a hierarchical catalog using a pattern language. Our pattern catalog will serve as a base for future covert channel novelty evaluation. Furthermore, we apply the concept of pattern variations to network covert channels. With pattern variations, the context of a pattern can change. For example, a channel developed for IPv4 can automatically be adapted to other network protocols. We also propose the pattern-based covert channel optimizations pattern hopping and pattern combination. Finally, we lay the foundation for pattern-based countermeasures: whereas many current countermeasures were developed for specific channels, a pattern-oriented approach allows application of one countermeasure to multiple channels. Hence, future countermeasure development can focus on patterns, and the development of real-world protection against covert channels is greatly simplified.},

abstract = {Wireless indoor positioning has been extensively studied for the past 2 decades and continuously attracted growing research efforts in mobile computing context. As the integration of multiple inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) to nowadays smartphones in recent years, human-centric mobility sensing is emerging and coming into vogue. Mobility information, as a new dimension in addition to wireless signals, can benefit localization in a number of ways, since location and mobility are by nature related in the physical world. In this article, we survey this new trend of mobility enhancing smartphone-based indoor localization. Specifically, we first study how to measure human mobility: what types of sensors we can use and what types of mobility information we can acquire. Next, we discuss how mobility assists localization with respect to enhancing location accuracy, decreasing deployment cost, and enriching location context. Moreover, considering the quality and cost of smartphone built-in sensors, handling measurement errors is essential and accordingly investigated. Combining existing work and our own working experiences, we emphasize the principles and conduct comparative study of the mainstream technologies. Finally, we conclude this survey by addressing future research directions and opportunities in this new and largely open area.},

In the case of multimedia data, such as images and videos, fast querying and processing of the available information requires the annotation of the multimedia data with semantic descriptors, that is, labels. However, only a small proportion of the available data are labeled. The rest should undergo an annotation-labeling process. The necessity for the creation of automatic annotation algorithms gave birth to label propagation and semi-supervised learning. In this study, basic concepts in graph-based label propagation methods are discussed. Methods for proper graph construction based on the structure of the available data and label inference methods for spreading label information from a few labeled data to a larger set of unlabeled data are reviewed. Applications of label propagation algorithms in digital media, as well as evaluation metrics for measuring their performance, are presented.},

Of the two key approaches in renegotiation, namely bargaining-based negotiation and offer generation--based negotiation, the latter approach is the most promising due to its ability to generate optimized multiple-offer SLA parameters within one round during renegotiation.},

Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) seems to be one of the dominant solutions to achieve this goal since it is a simple scheme and can prolong the devices’ lifetime by allowing them to transmit only a portion of the time during conversation. For that reason, several TDMA scheduling algorithms may be found in the literature. The scope of this article is to classify the existing TDMA scheduling algorithms based on several factors, such as the entity that is scheduled, the network topology information that is needed to produce or maintain the schedule, and the entity or entities that perform the computation that produces and maintains the schedules, and to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each category.},

abstract = {The dependency of our society on networked computers has become frightening: In the economy, all-digital networks have turned from facilitators to drivers; as cyber-physical systems are coming of age, computer networks are now becoming the central nervous systems of our physical world—even of highly critical infrastructures such as the power grid. At the same time, the 24/7 availability and correct functioning of networked computers has become much more threatened: The number of sophisticated and highly tailored attacks on IT systems has significantly increased. Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component of the corresponding defense measures; they have been extensively studied and utilized in the past. Since conventional IDSs are not scalable to big company networks and beyond, nor to massively parallel attacks, Collaborative IDSs (CIDSs) have emerged. They consist of several monitoring components that collect and exchange data. Depending on the specific CIDS architecture, central or distributed analysis components mine the gathered data to identify attacks. Resulting alerts are correlated among multiple monitors in order to create a holistic view of the network monitored. This article first determines relevant requirements for CIDSs; it then differentiates distinct building blocks as a basis for introducing a CIDS design space and for discussing it with respect to requirements. Based on this design space, attacks that evade CIDSs and attacks on the availability of the CIDSs themselves are discussed. The entire framework of requirements, building blocks, and attacks as introduced is then used for a comprehensive analysis of the state of the art in collaborative intrusion detection, including a detailed survey and comparison of specific CIDS approaches.},

abstract = {Many content distribution architectures offer desirable elements that lead to less bandwidth usage, reduced network congestion, higher content availability, and reduced costs. However, their level of adoption and utilization in commercial environments depends on the level of content accounting and accountability they offer. Content accounting refers to any information that a content distributor needs to track relating to the delivery of content to its intended consumers. In contrast, content accountability refers to the willingness of the communicating infrastructure to produce accurate and verifiable information about the content distribution process. This article surveys existing and proposed future content delivery architectures detailing their methodologies for providing efficient low-cost content distribution, content accounting, and accountability across trustworthy and untrustworthy infrastructures. We use two methods to help identify the drawbacks and merits of these architectures. The first is a taxonomy for accounting information based on our analysis of logging information gathered from the surveyed systems. The second is a generic model for content distribution based on a synthesis of desirable elements from the surveyed architectures. These methods help highlight key architectural elements required for efficient low-cost content distribution. Finally, we identify outstanding challenges related to establishing accountability in accounting information produced for content distributed across trusted and untrusted infrastructures.},

abstract = {Cloud computing has emerged as a long-dreamt vision of the utility computing paradigm that provides reliable and resilient infrastructure for users to remotely store data and use on-demand applications and services. Currently, many individuals and organizations mitigate the burden of local data storage and reduce the maintenance cost by outsourcing data to the cloud. However, the outsourced data is not always trustworthy due to the loss of physical control and possession over the data. As a result, many scholars have concentrated on relieving the security threats of the outsourced data by designing the Remote Data Auditing (RDA) technique as a new concept to enable public auditability for the stored data in the cloud. The RDA is a useful technique to check the reliability and integrity of data outsourced to a single or distributed servers. This is because all of the RDA techniques for single cloud servers are unable to support data recovery; such techniques are complemented with redundant storage mechanisms. The article also reviews techniques of remote data auditing more comprehensively in the domain of the distributed clouds in conjunction with the presentation of classifying ongoing developments within this specified area. The thematic taxonomy of the distributed storage auditing is presented based on significant parameters, such as scheme nature, security pattern, objective functions, auditing mode, update mode, cryptography model, and dynamic data structure. The more recent remote auditing approaches, which have not gained considerable attention in distributed cloud environments, are also critically analyzed and further categorized into three different classes, namely, replication based, erasure coding based, and network coding based, to present a taxonomy. This survey also aims to investigate similarities and differences of such a framework on the basis of the thematic taxonomy to diagnose significant and explore major outstanding issues.},

abstract = {Data clustering is a popular unsupervised data mining tool that is used for partitioning a given dataset into homogeneous groups based on some similarity/dissimilarity metric. Traditional clustering algorithms often make prior assumptions about the cluster structure and adopt a corresponding suitable objective function that is optimized either through classical techniques or metaheuristic approaches. These algorithms are known to perform poorly when the cluster assumptions do not hold in the data. Multiobjective clustering, in which multiple objective functions are simultaneously optimized, has emerged as an attractive and robust alternative in such situations. In particular, application of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for clustering has become popular in the past decade because of their population-based nature. Here, we provide a comprehensive and critical survey of the multitude of multiobjective evolutionary clustering techniques existing in the literature. The techniques are classified according to the encoding strategies adopted, objective functions, evolutionary operators, strategy for maintaining nondominated solutions, and the method of selection of the final solution.

In this work, we focus on energy efficiency of the networking component. However, how different networking solutions impact energy consumption is still an open question. We investigate the state of the art in energy-efficient networking solutions in cloud-based environments. We follow a systematic literature review method to select primary studies. We create a metamodel based on the codes extracted from our primary studies using the Coding analytical method. Our findings show three abstraction levels of the proposed networking solutions to achieve energy efficiency in cloud-based environments: Strategy, Solution, and Technology. We study the historical trends in the investigated solutions and conclude that the emerging and most widely adopted one is the Decision framework.},

abstract = {The Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) model is a parallel programming model that aims to improve programmer productivity while at the same time aiming for high performance. The main premise of PGAS is that a globally shared address space improves productivity, but that a distinction between local and remote data accesses is required to allow performance optimizations and to support scalability on large-scale parallel architectures. To this end, PGAS preserves the global address space while embracing awareness of nonuniform communication costs.Today, about a dozen languages exist that adhere to the PGAS model. This survey proposes a definition and a taxonomy along four axes: how parallelism is introduced, how the address space is partitioned, how data is distributed among the partitions, and finally, how data is accessed across partitions. Our taxonomy reveals that today’s PGAS languages focus on distributing regular data and distinguish only between local and remote data access cost, whereas the distribution of irregular data and the adoption of richer data access cost models remain open challenges.},

abstract = {Social media platforms provide active communication channels during mass convergence and emergency events such as disasters caused by natural hazards. As a result, first responders, decision makers, and the public can use this information to gain insight into the situation as it unfolds. In particular, many social media messages communicated during emergencies convey timely, actionable information. Processing social media messages to obtain such information, however, involves solving multiple challenges including: parsing brief and informal messages, handling information overload, and prioritizing different types of information found in messages. These challenges can be mapped to classical information processing operations such as filtering, classifying, ranking, aggregating, extracting, and summarizing. We survey the state of the art regarding computational methods to process social media messages and highlight both their contributions and shortcomings. In addition, we examine their particularities, and methodically examine a series of key subproblems ranging from the detection of events to the creation of actionable and useful summaries. Research thus far has, to a large extent, produced methods to extract situational awareness information from social media. In this survey, we cover these various approaches, and highlight their benefits and shortcomings. We conclude with research challenges that go beyond situational awareness, and begin to look at supporting decision making and coordinating emergency-response actions.},

Through analyzing the cloud computing architecture, this survey first presents taxonomy at two levels of scheduling cloud resources. It then paints a landscape of the scheduling problem and solutions. According to the taxonomy, a comprehensive survey of state-of-the-art approaches is presented systematically. Looking forward, challenges and potential future research directions are investigated and invited, including real-time scheduling, adaptive dynamic scheduling, large-scale scheduling, multiobjective scheduling, and distributed and parallel scheduling. At the dawn of Industry 4.0, cloud computing scheduling for cyber-physical integration with the presence of big data is also discussed.

abstract = {In recent years, configuration errors (i.e., misconfigurations) have become one of the dominant causes of system failures, resulting in many severe service outages and downtime. Unfortunately, it is notoriously difficult for system users (e.g., administrators and operators) to prevent, detect, and troubleshoot configuration errors due to the complexity of the configurations as well as the systems under configuration. As a result, the cost of resolving configuration errors is often tremendous from the aspects of both compensating the service disruptions and diagnosing, recovering from the failures. The prevalence, severity, and cost have made configuration errors one of the most thorny system problems that desire to be addressed.This survey article provides a holistic and structured overview of the systems approaches that tackle configuration errors. To understand the problem fundamentally, we first discuss the characteristics of configuration errors and the challenges of tackling such errors. Then, we discuss the state-of-the-art systems approaches that address different types of configuration errors in different scenarios. Our primary goal is to equip the stakeholder with a better understanding of configuration errors and the potential solutions for resolving configuration errors in the spectrum of system development and management. To inspire follow-up research, we further discuss the open problems with regard to system configuration. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey on the topic of tackling configuration errors.},

abstract = {The cloud computing paradigm has become a mainstream solution for the deployment of business processes and applications. In the public cloud vision, infrastructure, platform, and software services are provisioned to tenants (i.e., customers and service providers) on a pay-as-you-go basis. Cloud tenants can use cloud resources at lower prices, and higher performance and flexibility, than traditional on-premises resources, without having to care about infrastructure management. Still, cloud tenants remain concerned with the cloud’s level of service and the nonfunctional properties their applications can count on. In the last few years, the research community has been focusing on the nonfunctional aspects of the cloud paradigm, among which cloud security stands out. Several approaches to security have been described and summarized in general surveys on cloud security techniques. The survey in this article focuses on the interface between cloud security and cloud security assurance. First, we provide an overview of the state of the art on cloud security. Then, we introduce the notion of cloud security assurance and analyze its growing impact on cloud security approaches. Finally, we present some recommendations for the development of next-generation cloud security and assurance solutions.},

Thus, for the past decades, many works have been proposed trying to make ad hoc networks a reality. The importance of broadcasting in networking and the broadcast nature of the wireless medium have encouraged researchers to join their efforts on designing efficient dissemination algorithms for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs). The many different challenges that MANETs face, such as limited network resources, network partitions, or energy restrictions, gave rise to many different approaches to overcome one or more of those problems. Therefore, literature reveals a huge variety of techniques that have been proposed for efficient message dissemination. In this article, we make an in-depth review of the existing state-of-the-art techniques, as well as propose a new taxonomy that provides a global overview of the most relevant existing algorithms.},

abstract = {Security is oftentimes centrally managed. An alternative trend of using collaboration in order to improve security has gained momentum over the past few years. Collaborative security is an abstract concept that applies to a wide variety of systems and has been used to solve security issues inherent in distributed environments. Thus far, collaboration has been used in many domains such as intrusion detection, spam filtering, botnet resistance, and vulnerability detection. In this survey, we focus on different mechanisms of collaboration and defense in collaborative security. We systematically investigate numerous use cases of collaborative security by covering six types of security systems. Aspects of these systems are thoroughly studied, including their technologies, standards, frameworks, strengths and weaknesses. We then present a comprehensive study with respect to their analysis target, timeliness of analysis, architecture, network infrastructure, initiative, shared information and interoperability. We highlight five important topics in collaborative security, and identify challenges and possible directions for future research. Our work contributes the following to the existing research on collaborative security with the goal of helping to make collaborative security systems more resilient and efficient. This study (1) clarifies the scope of collaborative security, (2) identifies the essential components of collaborative security, (3) analyzes the multiple mechanisms of collaborative security, and (4) identifies challenges in the design of collaborative security.},

abstract = {When designing computer monitoring systems, one goal has always been to have a complete view of the monitored target and at the same time stealthily protect the monitor itself. One way to achieve this is to use hypervisor-based, or more generally out of virtual machine (VM)-based, monitoring. There are, however, challenges that limit the use of this mechanism; the most significant of these is the semantic gap problem. Over the past decade, a considerable amount of research has been carried out to bridge the semantic gap and develop all kinds of out-of-VM monitoring techniques and applications. By tracing the evolution of out-of-VM security solutions, this article examines and classifies different approaches that have been proposed to overcome the semantic gap—the fundamental challenge in hypervisor-based monitoring—and how they have been used to develop various security applications. In particular, we review how the past approaches address different constraints, such as practicality, flexibility, coverage, and automation, while bridging the semantic gap; how they have developed different monitoring systems; and how the monitoring systems have been applied and deployed. In addition to systematizing all of the proposed techniques, we also discuss the remaining research problems and shed light on the future directions of hypervisor-based monitoring.},

abstract = {Genome sequencing technology has advanced at a rapid pace and it is now possible to generate highly-detailed genotypes inexpensively. The collection and analysis of such data has the potential to support various applications, including personalized medical services. While the benefits of the genomics revolution are trumpeted by the biomedical community, the increased availability of such data has major implications for personal privacy; notably because the genome has certain essential features, which include (but are not limited to) (i) an association with traits and certain diseases, (ii) identification capability (e.g., forensics), and (iii) revelation of family relationships. Moreover, direct-to-consumer DNA testing increases the likelihood that genome data will be made available in less regulated environments, such as the Internet and for-profit companies. The problem of genome data privacy thus resides at the crossroads of computer science, medicine, and public policy. While the computer scientists have addressed data privacy for various data types, there has been less attention dedicated to genomic data. Thus, the goal of this paper is to provide a systematization of knowledge for the computer science community. In doing so, we address some of the (sometimes erroneous) beliefs of this field and we report on a survey we conducted about genome data privacy with biomedical specialists. Then, after characterizing the genome privacy problem, we review the state-of-the-art regarding privacy attacks on genomic data and strategies for mitigating such attacks, as well as contextualizing these attacks from the perspective of medicine and public policy. This paper concludes with an enumeration of the challenges for genome data privacy and presents a framework to systematize the analysis of threats and the design of countermeasures as the field moves forward.},

abstract = {Autonomous agents that operate as components of dynamic spatial systems are becoming increasingly popular and mainstream. Applications can be found in consumer robotics, in road, rail, and air transportation, manufacturing, and military operations. Unfortunately, the approaches to modeling and analyzing the behavior of dynamic spatial systems are just as diverse as these application domains. In this article, we discuss reasoning approaches for the medium-term control of autonomous agents in dynamic spatial systems, which requires a sufficiently detailed description of the agent’s behavior and environment but may still be conducted in a qualitative manner. We survey logic-based qualitative and hybrid modeling and commonsense reasoning approaches with respect to their features for describing and analyzing dynamic spatial systems in general, and the actions of autonomous agents operating therein in particular. We introduce a conceptual reference model, which summarizes the current understanding of the characteristics of dynamic spatial systems based on a catalog of evaluation criteria derived from the model. We assess the modeling features provided by logic-based qualitative commonsense and hybrid approaches for projection, planning, simulation, and verification of dynamic spatial systems. We provide a comparative summary of the modeling features, discuss lessons learned, and introduce a research roadmap for integrating different approaches of dynamic spatial system analysis to achieve coverage of all required features.},

abstract = {Linearisability is a key correctness criterion for concurrent data structures, ensuring that each history of the concurrent object under consideration is consistent with respect to a history of the corresponding abstract data structure. Linearisability allows concurrent (i.e., overlapping) operation calls to take effect in any order, but requires the real-time order of nonoverlapping to be preserved. The sophisticated nature of concurrent objects means that linearisability is difficult to judge, and hence, over the years, numerous techniques for verifying lineasizability have been developed using a variety of formal foundations such as data refinement, shape analysis, reduction, etc. However, because the underlying framework, nomenclature, and terminology for each method is different, it has become difficult for practitioners to evaluate the differences between each approach, and hence, evaluate the methodology most appropriate for verifying the data structure at hand. In this article, we compare the major of methods for verifying linearisability, describe the main contribution of each method, and compare their advantages and limitations.},

abstract = {The term “System of Systems” (SoS) has been used since the 1950s to describe systems that are composed of independent constituent systems, which act jointly towards a common goal through the synergism between them. Examples of SoS arise in areas such as power grid technology, transport, production, and military enterprises. SoS engineering is challenged by the independence, heterogeneity, evolution, and emergence properties found in SoS. This article focuses on the role of model-based techniques within the SoS engineering field. A review of existing attempts to define and classify SoS is used to identify several dimensions that characterise SoS applications. The SoS field is exemplified by a series of representative systems selected from the literature on SoS applications. Within the area of model-based techniques the survey specifically reviews the state of the art for SoS modelling, architectural description, simulation, verification, and testing. Finally, the identified dimensions of SoS characteristics are used to identify research challenges and future research areas of model-based SoS engineering.},

Basically, existing deterministic replay schemes can be classified into two categories, single-processor (SP) schemes and multiprocessor (MP) schemes. By reviewing the details of these two categories of schemes respectively, we summarize and compare how existing schemes address technical issues such as log size, record slowdown, replay slowdown, implementation cost, and probe effect, which may shed some light on future studies on deterministic replay.},

Recently, a number of many-objective evolutionary algorithms (MaOEAs) have been proposed to deal with this scalability issue. In this article, a survey of MaOEAs is reported. According to the key ideas used, MaOEAs are categorized into seven classes: relaxed dominance based, diversity-based, aggregation-based, indicator-based, reference set based, preference-based, and dimensionality reduction approaches.

Our article contributes to the field of software diversity as the first work that adopts an inclusive vision of the area, with an emphasis on the most recent advances in the field. This survey includes classical work about design and data diversity for fault tolerance, as well as the cybersecurity literature that investigates randomization at different system levels. It broadens this standard scope of diversity to include the study and exploitation of natural diversity and the management of diverse software products. Our survey includes the most recent works, with an emphasis from 2000 to the present.

abstract = {Ensuring lifetime reliability of microprocessors has become more critical. Continuous scaling and increasing temperatures due to growing power density are threatening lifetime reliability. Negative bias temperature instability (NBTI) has been known for decades, but its impact has been insignificant compared to other factors. Aggressive scaling, however, makes NBTI the most serious threat to chip lifetime reliability in today's and future process technologies. The delay of microprocessors gradually increases as time goes by, due to stress and recovery phases. The delay eventually becomes higher than the value required to meet design constraints, which results in failed systems. In this article, the mechanism of NBTI and its effects on lifetime reliability are presented, then various techniques to mitigate NBTI degradation on microprocessors are introduced. The mitigation can be addressed at either the circuit level or architectural level. Circuit-level techniques include design-time techniques such as transistor sizing and NBTI-aware synthesis. Forward body biasing, and adaptive voltage scaling are adaptive techniques that can mitigate NBTI degradation at the circuit level by controlling the threshold voltage or supply voltage to hide the lengthened delay caused by NBTI degradation. Reliability has been regarded as something to be addressed by chip manufacturers. However, there are recent attempts to bring lifetime reliability problems to the architectural level. Architectural techniques can reduce the cost added by circuit-level techniques, which are based on the worst-case degradation estimation. Traditional low-power and thermal management techniques can be successfully extended to deal with reliability problems since aging is dependent on power consumption and temperature. Self-repair is another option to enhance the lifetime of microprocessors using either core-level or lower-level redundancy. With a growing thermal crisis and constant scaling, lifetime reliability requires more intensive research in conjunction with other design issues.},

Billion-node graphs that exceed the memory capacity of commodity machines are not well supported by popular Big Data tools like MapReduce, which are notoriously poor performing for iterative graph algorithms such as PageRank. In response, a new type of framework challenges one to “think like a vertex” (TLAV) and implements user-defined programs from the perspective of a vertex rather than a graph. Such an approach improves locality, demonstrates linear scalability, and provides a natural way to express and compute many iterative graph algorithms. These frameworks are simple to program and widely applicable but, like an operating system, are composed of several intricate, interdependent components, of which a thorough understanding is necessary in order to elicit top performance at scale. To this end, the first comprehensive survey of TLAV frameworks is presented. In this survey, the vertex-centric approach to graph processing is overviewed, TLAV frameworks are deconstructed into four main components and respectively analyzed, and TLAV implementations are reviewed and categorized.},

abstract = {The concept of trust and/or trust management has received considerable attention in engineering research communities as trust is perceived as the basis for decision making in many contexts and the motivation for maintaining long-term relationships based on cooperation and collaboration. Even if substantial research effort has been dedicated to addressing trust-based mechanisms or trust metrics (or computation) in diverse contexts, prior work has not clearly solved the issue of how to model and quantify trust with sufficient detail and context-based adequateness. The issue of trust quantification has become more complicated as we have the need to derive trust from complex, composite networks that may involve four distinct layers of communication protocols, information exchange, social interactions, and cognitive motivations. In addition, the diverse application domains require different aspects of trust for decision making such as emotional, logical, and relational trust. This survey aims to outline the foundations of trust models for applications in these contexts in terms of the concept of trust, trust assessment, trust constructs, trust scales, trust properties, trust formulation, and applications of trust. We discuss how different components of trust can be mapped to different layers of a complex, composite network; applicability of trust metrics and models; research challenges; and future work directions.},

Based on that, this article presents an extensive but not exhaustive review about the most significant trust and reputation models published over the past two decades, and hundreds of models were analyzed using two perspectives. The first one is a combination of trust dimensions and principles proposed by some relevant authors in the field, and the models are discussed using an MAS perspective. The second one is the discussion of these dimensions taking into account some types of interaction found in MASs, such as coalition, argumentation, negotiation, and recommendation. By these analyses, we aim to find significant relations between trust dimensions and types of interaction so it would be possible to construct MASs using the most relevant dimensions according to the types of interaction, which may help developers in the design of MASs.},

abstract = {Multicore processors are being extensively used by real-time systems, mainly because of their demand for increased computing power. However, multicore processors have shared resources that affect the predictability of real-time systems, which is the key to correctly estimate the worst-case execution time of tasks. One of the main factors for unpredictability in a multicore processor is the cache memory hierarchy. Recently, many research works have proposed different techniques to deal with caches in multicore processors in the context of real-time systems. Nevertheless, a review and categorization of these techniques is still an open topic and would be very useful for the real-time community. In this article, we present a survey of cache management techniques for real-time embedded systems, from the first studies of the field in 1990 up to the latest research published in 2014. We categorize the main research works and provide a detailed comparison in terms of similarities and differences. We also identify key challenges and discuss future research directions.},

In addition to safety, VANETs also provide a cost-effective platform for numerous comfort and entertainment applications. A pragmatic solution of VANETs requires synergistic efforts in multidisciplinary areas of communication standards, routings, security and trust. Furthermore, a realistic VANET simulator is required for performance evaluation. There have been many research efforts in these areas, and consequently, a number of surveys have been published on various aspects. In this article, we first explain the key characteristics of VANETs, then provide a meta-survey of research works. We take a tutorial approach to introducing VANETs and gradually discuss intricate details. Extensive listings of existing surveys and research projects have been provided to assess development efforts.

In this article, we targeted the definition of QoE based on completeness of QoS to deal with decisions concerning with performance correction in a system level. This study also presents a statistical bibliometric analysis before the proposed model. The idea was to show the origin of first studies with correlated focus, which also have initial conceptualizations, and then propose a new model. This model concerns concise QoS definitions, grouped to provide a basis for QoE analysis. Afterward, it is foreseen that a DDB system will be able to autoevaluate and be aware of recovering situations before they happen.},

This framework is necessary to enable effective exploration, understanding, assessing, comparing, and selecting service composition models, languages, techniques, platforms, and tools.

abstract = {Various reputation systems have been proposed for a broad range of distributed applications, such as peer-to-peer, ad-hoc, and multiagent systems. Their evaluation has been mostly based on proprietary methods due to the lack of widely acceptable evaluation measures and methodologies. Differentiating factors in various evaluation approaches include the evaluation metrics, the consideration of the dynamic behavior of peers, the use of social networks, or the study of resilience to specific threat scenarios. The lack of a generally accepted common evaluation framework hinders the objective evaluation and comparison of different reputation systems. Aiming at narrowing the gap in the research area of objective evaluation of reputation systems, in this article, we study the various approaches to evaluating and comparing reputation systems, present them in a taxonomy, and analyze their strengths and limitations, with special focus on works suggesting a Common Evaluation Framework (CEF). We identify the challenges for a widely accepted CEF that enables testing and benchmarking of reputation systems, and we present the required properties for such a CEF; we also present an analysis of current CEF-related works in the context of the identified properties and our related proposals.},

These P2P systems are regularly used by a large number of users, both in desktop and mobile environments, and they generate a remarkable portion of the overall Internet traffic. However, many common P2P protocols and applications were designed neglecting the energy problem. In fact, they often require always-on devices in order to work properly, thus producing significant energy waste. The problem is even more relevant in the mobile context, since the battery lifetime of mobile devices is limited. Therefore, energy efficiency in P2P systems is a highly debated topic in the literature. New P2P approaches—more energy efficient than traditional client/server solutions—have been proposed. In addition, several improvements to existing P2P protocols have been introduced to reduce their energy consumption. In this article, we present a general taxonomy to classify state-of-the-art approaches to the energy problem in P2P systems and applications. Then, we survey the main solutions available in the literature, focusing on three relevant classes of P2P systems and applications: file sharing/distribution, content streaming, and epidemics. Furthermore, we outline open issues and provide future research guidelines for each class of P2P systems.},

Many protocol specifications are unknown, unavailable, or minimally documented, which prevents thorough analysis of the protocol for security purposes. For example, modern botnets often use undocumented and unique application-layer communication protocols to maintain command and control over numerous distributed hosts. Inferring the specification of closed protocols has numerous advantages, such as intelligent deep packet inspection, enhanced intrusion detection system algorithms for communications, and integration with legacy software packages. The multitude of closed protocols coupled with existing time-intensive reverse engineering methodologies has spawned investigation into automated approaches for reverse engineering of closed protocols. This article summarizes and organizes previously presented automatic protocol reverse engineering tools by approach. Approaches that focus on reverse engineering the finite state machine of a target protocol are separated from those that focus on reverse engineering the protocol format.},

However, living environments are usually inhabited by more than one person and possibly with pets. Hence, human activity recognition in the context of multioccupancy is more general, but also more challenging. The difficulty comes from mainly two aspects: resident identification, known as data association, and diversity of human activities. The present survey article provides an overview of existing approaches and current practices for activity recognition in multioccupant smart homes.

abstract = {As computing infrastructure expands, resource management in a large, heterogeneous, and distributed environment becomes a challenging task. In a cloud environment, with uncertainty and dispersion of resources, one encounters problems of allocation of resources, which is caused by things such as heterogeneity, dynamism, and failures. Unfortunately, existing resource management techniques, frameworks, and mechanisms are insufficient to handle these environments, applications, and resource behaviors. To provide efficient performance of workloads and applications, the aforementioned characteristics should be addressed effectively. This research depicts a broad methodical literature analysis of autonomic resource management in the area of the cloud in general and QoS (Quality of Service)-aware autonomic resource management specifically. The current status of autonomic resource management in cloud computing is distributed into various categories. Methodical analysis of autonomic resource management in cloud computing and its techniques are described as developed by various industry and academic groups. Further, taxonomy of autonomic resource management in the cloud has been presented. This research work will help researchers find the important characteristics of autonomic resource management and will also help to select the most suitable technique for autonomic resource management in a specific application along with significant future research directions.},

However, UGC varies in quality and, consequently, raises the challenge of how to maximize its utility for a variety of end-users. This study aims to provide researchers and Web data curators with comprehensive answers to the following questions: What are the existing approaches and methods for assessing and ranking UGC? What features and metrics have been used successfully to assess and predict UGC value across a range of application domains? What methods can be effectively employed to maximize that value? This survey is composed of a systematic review of approaches for assessing and ranking UGC: results are obtained by identifying and comparing methodologies within the context of short text-based UGC on the Web. Existing assessment and ranking approaches adopt one of four framework types: the community-based framework takes into consideration the value assigned to content by a crowd of humans, the end-user--based framework adapts and personalizes the assessment and ranking process with respect to a single end-user, the designer-based framework encodes the software designer’s values in the assessment and ranking method, and the hybrid framework employs methods from more than one of these types. This survey suggests a need for further experimentation and encourages the development of new approaches for the assessment and ranking of UGC.},

This has led to the adoption of modeling techniques from other disciplines such as kinetic theory or urban planning. Yet these techniques generate movement behavior that is often perceived as not “realistic” for humans or provides only a macroscopic view on mobility. More recent approaches infer mobility models from real traces provided by positioning technologies or by the marks the mobile users leave in the wireless network. However, there is no common framework for assessing and comparing mobility models.In an attempt to provide a solid foundation for realistic mobility modeling in mobile networking research, we take an engineering approach and thoroughly discuss the required steps of model creation and validation. In this context, we survey how and to what extent existing mobility modeling approaches implement the proposed steps. This also summarizes helpful information for readers who do not want to develop a new model, but rather intend to choose among existing ones.},

This article systematically surveys the landscape of SLA-based cloud research to understand the state of the art and identify open problems. The survey is particularly aimed at the resource allocation phase of the SLA life cycle while highlighting implications on other phases. Results indicate that (i) minimal number of SLA parameters are accounted for in most studies; (ii) heuristics, policies, and optimisation are the most commonly used techniques for resource allocation; and (iii) the monitor-analysis-plan-execute (MAPE) architecture style is predominant in autonomic cloud systems. The results contribute to the fundamentals of engineering cloud SLA and their autonomic management, motivating further research and industrial-oriented solutions.},

However, given the diversity inherent in their design and application scenarios, several challenges need to be addressed to effectively architect AMPs and leverage their potential in optimizing both sequential and parallel performance. Several recent techniques address these challenges. In this article, we present a survey of architectural and system-level techniques proposed for designing and managing AMPs. By classifying the techniques on several key characteristics, we underscore their similarities and differences. We clarify the terminology used in this research field and identify challenges that are worthy of future investigation. We hope that more than just synthesizing the existing work on AMPs, the contribution of this survey will be to spark novel ideas for architecting future AMPs that can make a definite impact on the landscape of next-generation computing systems.},

abstract = {Workload characterization is a well-established discipline that plays a key role in many performance engineering studies. The large-scale social behavior inherent in the applications and services being deployed nowadays leads to rapid changes in workload intensity and characteristics and opens new challenging management and performance issues. A deep understanding of user behavior and workload properties and patterns is therefore compelling. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the state of the art of workload characterization by addressing its exploitation in some popular application domains. In particular, we focus on conventional web workloads as well as on the workloads associated with online social networks, video services, mobile apps, and cloud computing infrastructures. We discuss the peculiarities of these workloads and present the methodological approaches and modeling techniques applied for their characterization. The role of workload models in various scenarios (e.g., performance evaluation, capacity planning, content distribution, resource provisioning) is also analyzed.},

Even if the benefits in terms of performance, maintenance, and cost are evident, however, virtualization has also been exploited by attackers to devise new ways to compromise a system. To address these problems, research security solutions have evolved considerably over the years to cope with new attacks and threat models. In this work, we review the protection strategies proposed in the literature and show how some of the solutions have been invalidated by new attacks, or threat models, that were previously not considered. The goal is to show the evolution of the threats, and of the related security and trust assumptions, in virtualized systems that have given rise to complex threat models and the corresponding sophistication of protection strategies to deal with such attacks. We also categorize threat models, security and trust assumptions, and attacks against a virtualized system at the different layers—in particular, hardware, virtualization, OS, and application.},

abstract = {While Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been traditionally tasked with single applications, in recent years we have witnessed the emergence of Shared Sensor Networks (SSNs) as integrated cyber-physical system infrastructures for a multitude of applications. Instead of assuming an application-specific network design, SSNs allow the underlying infrastructure to be shared among multiple applications that can potentially belong to different users. On one hand, a potential benefit of such a design approach is to increase the utilization of sensing and communication resources, whenever the underlying network infrastructure covers the same geographic area and the sensor nodes monitor the same physical variables of common interest for different applications. On the other hand, compared with the existing application-specific design, the SSNs approach poses several research challenges with regard to different aspects of WSNs. In this article, we present a systematic literature survey on SSNs. The main goal of the article is to provide the reader with the opportunity to understand what has been done and what remains as open issues in this field, as well as which are the pivotal factors of this evolutionary design and how this kind of design can be exploited by a wide range of WSN applications.},

abstract = {Virtual machines (VMs) and virtualization are one of the core computing technologies today. Inter-VM communication is not only prevalent but also one of the leading costs for data-intensive systems and applications in most data centers and cloud computing environments. One way to improve inter-VM communication efficiency is to support coresident VM communication using shared-memory-based methods and resort to the traditional TCP/IP for communications between VMs that are located on different physical machines. In recent years, several independent kernel development efforts have been dedicated to improving communication efficiency between coresident VMs using shared-memory channels, and the development efforts differ from one another in terms of where and how the shared-memory channel is established. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of the design choices and techniques for performance optimization of coresident inter-VM communication. We examine the key issues for improving inter-VM communication using shared-memory-based mechanisms, such as implementation choices in the software stack, seamless agility for dynamic addition or removal of coresident VMs, and multilevel transparency, as well as advanced requirements in reliability, security, and stability. An in-depth comparison of state-of-the-art research efforts, implementation techniques, evaluation methods, and performance is conducted. We conjecture that this comprehensive survey will not only provide the foundation for developing the next generation of inter-VM communication optimization mechanisms but also offers opportunities to both cloud infrastructure providers and cloud service providers and consumers for improving communication efficiency between coresident VMs in virtualized computing platforms.},

RBAC critically depends on defining roles, which are a functional intermediate between users and permissions. Thus, for RBAC to be effective, an appropriate set of roles needs to be identified. Since many organizations already have user-permission assignments defined in some form, it makes sense to identify roles from this existing information. This process, known as role mining, is one of the critical steps for successful RBAC adoption in any enterprise. In recent years, numerous role mining techniques have been developed, which take into account the characteristics of the core RBAC model, as well as its various extended features. In this article, we comprehensively study and classify the basic problem of role mining along with its several variants and the corresponding solution strategies. Categorization is done on the basis of the nature of the target RBAC system, the objective of role mining, and the type of solution. We then discuss the limitations of existing work and identify new areas of research that can lead to further enrichment of this field.},

In this article, audio-based automated surveillance methods are organized into a comprehensive survey: A general taxonomy, inspired by the more widespread video surveillance field, is proposed to systematically describe the methods covering background subtraction, event classification, object tracking, and situation analysis. For each of these tasks, all the significant works are reviewed, detailing their pros and cons and the context for which they have been proposed. Moreover, a specific section is devoted to audio features, discussing their expressiveness and their employment in the above-described tasks. Differing from other surveys on audio processing and analysis, the present one is specifically targeted to automated surveillance, highlighting the target applications of each described method and providing the reader with a systematic and schematic view useful for retrieving the most suited algorithms for each specific requirement.},

This makes them appealing for the construction of critical systems connected to the Internet, which are constantly a target for cyber attacks.BFT protocols differ based on the kind of application, deployment settings, performance, access control mechanisms, number of servers in the system, and protocol implementation. The large number of protocols present in the literature and their differences make it difficult for a system builder to choose the solution that best satisfies the requirements of the system that he wants to build. In particular, the main difference among BFT protocols lies in their system models: server-side versus client-side. In the server-side model each client relies on the system to consistently order and replicate updates, while in the client-side model each client actively participates in the protocol.In this article, we classify BFT protocols as server-side or client-side. We analyze the trade-offs between the two models, describe systems that use these models and the trade-offs they choose, highlight the research gaps, and provide guidelines to system builders in order to choose the solution that best satisfies their needs.},

abstract = {Rarely occurring events present unique challenges to energy constrained systems designed for long term sensing of their occurrence or effect. Unlike periodic sampling or query based sensing systems, longevity cannot be achieved simply by adjusting the sensing nodes’ duty cycle until an equitable balance between data density and network lifetime is established. The low probability of occurrence and random nature of rare events makes it difficult to guarantee duty cycled battery powered sensing nodes will be energised when events occur. Equally, it is usually considered impractical to leave the sensing nodes energised at all times if the network is to have an acceptably long operational life. In the past decade and a half, wireless sensor network research has addressed this aspect of rare event sensing by investigating techniques including synchronised duty cycling of redundant nodes, passive sensing, duplicate message suppression, and energy efficient network protocols. Researchers have also demonstrated the efficacy of harvesting energy from the environment to extend operational life. Here we survey existing rare event detection and propagation techniques, and suggest areas suitable for continued research.},

abstract = {Recent growth in the processing and memory resources of mobile devices has fueled research within the field of mobile virtualization. Mobile virtualization enables multiple persona on a single mobile device by hosting heterogeneous operating systems (OSs) concurrently. However, adding a virtualization layer to resource-constrained mobile devices with real-time requirements can lead to intolerable performance overheads. Hardware virtualization extensions that support efficient virtualization have been incorporated in recent mobile processors. Prior to hardware virtualization extensions, virtualization techniques that are enabled by performance prohibitive and resource consuming software were adopted for mobile devices. Moreover, mobile virtualization solutions lack standard procedures for device component sharing and interfacing between multiple OSSs. The objective of this article is to survey software- and hardware-based mobile virtualization techniques in light of the recent advancements fueled by the hardware support for mobile virtualization. Challenges and issues faced in virtualization of CPU, memory, I/O, interrupt, and network interfaces are highlighted. Moreover, various performance parameters are presented in a detailed comparative analysis to quantify the efficiency of mobile virtualization techniques and solutions.},

abstract = {A smart power grid transforms the traditional electric grid into a user-centric, intelligent power network. The cost-saving potential of smart homes is an excellent motivating factor to involve users in smart grid operations. To that end, this survey explores the contemporary cost-saving strategies for smart grids from the users’ perspective. The study shows that optimization methods are the most popular cost-saving techniques reported in the literature. These methods are used to plan scheduling and power utilization schemes of household appliances, energy storages, renewables, and other energy generation devices. The survey shows that trading energy among neighborhoods is one of the effective methods for cost optimization. It also identifies the prediction methods that are used to forecast energy price, generation, and consumption profiles, which are required to optimize energy cost in advance. The contributions of this article are threefold. First, it discusses the computational methods reported in the literature with their significance and limitations. Second, it identifies the components and their characteristics that may reduce energy cost. Finally, it proposes a unified cost optimization framework and addresses the challenges that may influence the overall residential energy cost optimization problem in smart grids.},

abstract = {Software obfuscation has always been a controversially discussed research area. While theoretical results indicate that provably secure obfuscation in general is impossible, its widespread application in malware and commercial software shows that it is nevertheless popular in practice. Still, it remains largely unexplored to what extent today’s software obfuscations keep up with state-of-the-art code analysis and where we stand in the arms race between software developers and code analysts. The main goal of this survey is to analyze the effectiveness of different classes of software obfuscation against the continuously improving deobfuscation techniques and off-the-shelf code analysis tools.The answer very much depends on the goals of the analyst and the available resources. On the one hand, many forms of lightweight static analysis have difficulties with even basic obfuscation schemes, which explains the unbroken popularity of obfuscation among malware writers. On the other hand, more expensive analysis techniques, in particular when used interactively by a human analyst, can easily defeat many obfuscations. As a result, software obfuscation for the purpose of intellectual property protection remains highly challenging.},

Given that typed variables provide fundamental semantics of a program, for the last 16 years, a large amount of research has been carried out on binary code type inference, a challenging task that aims to infer typed variables from executables (also referred to as binary code). In this article, we systematize the area of binary code type inference according to its most important dimensions: the applications that motivate its importance, the approaches used, the types that those approaches infer, the implementation of those approaches, and how the inference results are evaluated. We also discuss limitations, underdeveloped problems and open challenges, and propose further applications.},

abstract = {Cloud log forensics (CLF) mitigates the investigation process by identifying the malicious behavior of attackers through profound cloud log analysis. However, the accessibility attributes of cloud logs obstruct accomplishment of the goal to investigate cloud logs for various susceptibilities. Accessibility involves the issues of cloud log access, selection of proper cloud log file, cloud log data integrity, and trustworthiness of cloud logs. Therefore, forensic investigators of cloud log files are dependent on cloud service providers (CSPs) to get access of different cloud logs. Accessing cloud logs from outside the cloud without depending on the CSP is a challenging research area, whereas the increase in cloud attacks has increased the need for CLF to investigate the malicious activities of attackers. This paper reviews the state of the art of CLF and highlights different challenges and issues involved in investigating cloud log data. The logging mode, the importance of CLF, and cloud log-as-a-service are introduced. Moreover, case studies related to CLF are explained to highlight the practical implementation of cloud log investigation for analyzing malicious behaviors. The CLF security requirements, vulnerability points, and challenges are identified to tolerate different cloud log susceptibilities. We identify and introduce challenges and future directions to highlight open research areas of CLF for motivating investigators, academicians, and researchers to investigate them.},

The goal of sensor fusion is to make the final decision robust, minimizing the influence of noise and system errors. One problem that has not been adequately addressed is establishing the bounds of fusion result precision. Precision is the maximum range of disagreement that can be introduced by one or more faulty inputs. This definition of precision is consistent both with Lamport’s Byzantine Generals problem and the mini-max criteria commonly found in game theory. This article considers the precision bounds of several fault-tolerant information fusion approaches, including Byzantine agreement, Marzullo’s interval-based approach, and the Brooks-Iyengar fusion algorithm. We derive precision bounds for these fusion algorithms. The analysis provides insight into the limits imposed by fault tolerance and guidance for applying fusion approaches to applications.},

In all cases, it is of vital importance that the optimal camera configuration (i.e., optimal location, orientation, etc.) is determined before cameras are deployed as a suboptimal placement solution will adversely affect intelligent video surveillance and video analytic algorithms. The optimal configuration may also provide substantial savings on the total number of cameras required to achieve the same level of utility.In this article, we examine most, if not all, of the recent approaches (post 2000) addressing camera placement in a structured manner. We believe that our work can serve as a first point of entry for readers wishing to start researching into this area or engineers who need to design a camera system in practice. To this end, we attempt to provide a complete study of relevant formulation strategies and brief introductions to most commonly used optimization techniques by researchers in this field.

abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) are becoming a popular method of meeting people and keeping in touch with friends. OSNs resort to trust evaluation models and algorithms to improve service quality and enhance user experiences. Much research has been done to evaluate trust and predict the trustworthiness of a target, usually from the view of a source. Graph-based approaches make up a major portion of the existing works, in which the trust value is calculated through a trusted graph (or trusted network, web of trust, or multiple trust chains). In this article, we focus on graph-based trust evaluation models in OSNs, particularly in the computer science literature. We first summarize the features of OSNs and the properties of trust. Then we comparatively review two categories of graph-simplification-based and graph-analogy-based approaches and discuss their individual problems and challenges. We also analyze the common challenges of all graph-based models. To provide an integrated view of trust evaluation, we conduct a brief review of its pre- and postprocesses (i.e., the preparation and validation of trust models, including information collection, performance evaluation, and related applications). Finally, we identify some open challenges that all trust models are facing.},

A comprehensive treatise of three closely linked problems (i.e., image tag assignment, refinement, and tag-based image retrieval) is presented. While existing works vary in terms of their targeted tasks and methodology, they rely on the key functionality of tag relevance, that is, estimating the relevance of a specific tag with respect to the visual content of a given image and its social context. By analyzing what information a specific method exploits to construct its tag relevance function and how such information is exploited, this article introduces a two-dimensional taxonomy to structure the growing literature, understand the ingredients of the main works, clarify their connections and difference, and recognize their merits and limitations. For a head-to-head comparison with the state of the art, a new experimental protocol is presented, with training sets containing 10,000, 100,000, and 1 million images, and an evaluation on three test sets, contributed by various research groups. Eleven representative works are implemented and evaluated. Putting all this together, the survey aims to provide an overview of the past and foster progress for the near future.},

However, under open networks and not fully trusted cloud environments, they face enormous security and privacy risks (e.g., data leakage or disclosure, data corruption or loss, and user privacy breach) when outsourcing their data to a public cloud or using their outsourced data. Recently, several studies were conducted to address these risks, and a series of solutions were proposed to enable data and privacy protection in untrusted cloud environments. To fully understand the advances and discover the research trends of this area, this survey summarizes and analyzes the state-of-the-art protection technologies. We first present security threats and requirements of an outsourcing data service to a cloud, and follow that with a high-level overview of the corresponding security technologies. We then dwell on existing protection solutions to achieve secure, dependable, and privacy-assured cloud data services including data search, data computation, data sharing, data storage, and data access.

The related solutions are then classified according to their architectural definition. Within each category, solutions are described based on the techniques and strategies that have been adopted.

abstract = {Large-scale virtual machine (VM) deployment in virtualized data centers is a very slow process. This is primarily due to the resource bottlenecks that are created at the storage, network, and host physical machines when a large number of VMs are requested simultaneously. For companies that provide virtual desktops to their employees, it is common to encounter such requests each day, when their employees turn up for work. In addition, a large number of VMs are often required to be deployed instantly, in order to absorb a spike in the workload, at online e-commerce websites. In such scenarios, long deployment times are unacceptable, and reducing them is of paramount importance. In this article, we first abstract out the key techniques suggested in the literature to speed up this deployment process. We follow this with a classification of these techniques into a taxonomy and propose a framework that can be used to compare them. Finally, we identify problem areas that warrant further research and bring out the shortcomings of the current state-of-the-art solutions.},

abstract = {A design pattern is a well-defined solution to a recurrent problem. Over the years, the number of patterns and domains of design patterns have expanded, as the patterns are the experiences of the experts of the domain captured in a higher-level abstraction. This led others to work on languages for design patterns to systematically document abstraction detailed in the design pattern rather than capture algorithms and data. These design-pattern specification languages come in different flavors, targeting different aspects of design patterns. Some design-pattern specification languages tried to capture the description of the design pattern in graphical or textual format, others tried to discover design patterns in code or design diagrams, and still other design-pattern specification languages have other objectives. However, so far, no effort has been made to compare these design-pattern specification languages and identify their strengths and weaknesses. This article provides a survey and a comparison between existing design-pattern specification languages using a design-pattern specification language evaluation framework. Analysis is done by grouping the design-pattern specification languages into different categories. In addition, a brief description is provided regarding the tools available for the design-pattern specification languages. Finally, we identify some open research issues that still need to be resolved.},

It has provided an enormous dataset of the so-called sentiments, whose classification can take place through supervised learning. To build supervised learning models, classification algorithms require a set of representative labeled data. However, labeled data are usually difficult and expensive to obtain, which motivates the interest in semi-supervised learning. This type of learning uses unlabeled data to complement the information provided by the labeled data in the training process; therefore, it is particularly useful in applications including tweet sentiment analysis, where a huge quantity of unlabeled data is accessible. Semi-supervised learning for tweet sentiment analysis, although appealing, is relatively new. We provide a comprehensive survey of semi-supervised approaches applied to tweet classification. Such approaches consist of graph-based, wrapper-based, and topic-based methods. A comparative study of algorithms based on self-training, co-training, topic modeling, and distant supervision highlights their biases and sheds light on aspects that the practitioner should consider in real-world applications.},

abstract = {In recent years, distributed intelligent microelectromechanical systems (DiMEMSs) have appeared as a new form of distributed embedded systems. DiMEMSs contain thousands or millions of removable autonomous devices, which will collaborate with each other to achieve the final target of the whole system. Programming such systems is becoming an extremely difficult problem. The difficulty is due not only to their inherent nature of distributed collaboration, mobility, large scale, and limited resources of their devices (e.g., in terms of energy, memory, communication, and computation) but also to the requirements of real-time control and tolerance for uncertainties such as inaccurate actuation and unreliable communications. As a result, existing programming languages for traditional distributed and embedded systems are not suitable for DiMEMSs. In this article, we first introduce the origin and characteristics of DiMEMSs and then survey typical implementations of DiMEMSs and related research hotspots. Finally, we propose a real-time programming framework that can be used to design new real-time programming languages for DiMEMSs. The framework is composed of three layers: a real-time programming model layer, a compilation layer, and a runtime system layer. The design challenges and requirements of these layers are investigated. The framework is then discussed in further detail and suggestions for future research are given.},

While in the ’80s “consistency” typically meant strong consistency, later defined also as linearizability, in recent years, with the advent of highly available and scalable systems, the notion of “consistency” has been at the same time both weakened and blurred.In this article, we aim to fill the void in the literature by providing a structured and comprehensive overview of different consistency notions that appeared in distributed systems, and in particular storage systems research, in the last four decades. We overview more than 50 different consistency notions, ranging from linearizability to eventual and weak consistency, defining precisely many of these, in particular where the previous definitions were ambiguous. We further provide a partial order among different consistency predicates, ordering them by their semantic “strength,” which we believe will be useful in future research. Finally, we map the consistency semantics to different practical systems and research prototypes.The scope of this article is restricted to non-transactional semantics, that is, those that apply to single storage object operations. As such, our article complements the existing surveys done in the context of transactional, database consistency semantics.},

abstract = {With the marvelous development of wireless techniques and ubiquitous deployment of wireless systems indoors, myriad indoor location-based services (ILBSs) have permeated into numerous aspects of modern life. The most fundamental functionality is to pinpoint the location of the target via wireless devices. According to how wireless devices interact with the target, wireless indoor localization schemes roughly fall into two categories: device based and device free. In device-based localization, a wireless device (e.g., a smartphone) is attached to the target and computes its location through cooperation with other deployed wireless devices. In device-free localization, the target carries no wireless devices, while the wireless infrastructure deployed in the environment determines the target’s location by analyzing its impact on wireless signals.This article is intended to offer a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey on wireless indoor localization from the device perspective. In this survey, we review the recent advances in both modes by elaborating on the underlying wireless modalities, basic localization principles, and data fusion techniques, with special emphasis on emerging trends in (1) leveraging smartphones to integrate wireless and sensor capabilities and extend to the social context for device-based localization, and (2) extracting specific wireless features to trigger novel human-centric device-free localization. We comprehensively compare each scheme in terms of accuracy, cost, scalability, and energy efficiency. Furthermore, we take a first look at intrinsic technical challenges in both categories and identify several open research issues associated with these new challenges.},

We identify three different formulations for the target-tracking problem and classify the target-tracking algorithms based on common characteristics. Furthermore, for the sake of a better understanding of the target-tracking process, we organize this process in six components: target detection, node cooperation, position computation, future-position estimation, energy management, and target recovery.

This makes it an interesting topic of study and there is an abundance of literature employing heap abstractions. Although most studies have addressed similar concerns, insights gained in one description of heap abstraction may not directly carry over to some other description.In our search of a unified theme, we view heap abstraction as consisting of two steps: (a) heap modelling, which is the process of representing a heap memory (i.e., an unbounded set of concrete locations) as a heap model (i.e., an unbounded set of abstract locations), and (b) summarization, which is the process of bounding the heap model by merging multiple abstract locations into summary locations. We classify the heap models as storeless, store based, and hybrid. We describe various summarization techniques based on k-limiting, allocation sites, patterns, variables, other generic instrumentation predicates, and higher-order logics. This approach allows us to compare the insights of a large number of seemingly dissimilar heap abstractions and also paves the way for creating new abstractions by mix and match of models and summarization techniques.},

LM and DR present several challenges due to the large amounts of data that need to be transferred over long-distance networks, which increase with the number of migrated or protected resources. In this context, our work presents the way LM and DR are currently being performed and their operation in long-distance networking environments, discussing related issues and bottlenecks and surveying other works. We also present the way networks are evolving today and the new technologies and protocols (e.g., software-defined networking, or SDN, and flexible optical networks) that can be used to boost the efficiency of LM and DR over long distances.

Since its introduction in 1995, it has caught the attention of both researchers and academicians as a way of solving various optimization problems, such as in the fields of engineering and medicine, to computer image processing and mission critical operations. PSO has been widely applied in the field of swarm robotics, however, the trend of creating a new variant PSO for each swarm robotic project is alarming. We investigate the basic properties of PSO algorithms relevant to the implementation of swarm robotics and characterize the limitations that promote this trend to manifest. Experiments were conducted to investigate the convergence properties of three PSO variants (original PSO, SPSO and APSO) and the global optimum and local optimal of these PSO algorithms were determined. We were able to validate the existence of premature convergence in these PSO variants by comparing 16 functions implemented alongside the PSO variant. This highlighted the fundamental flaws in most variant PSOs, and signifies the importance of developing a more generalized PSO algorithm to support the implementation of swarm robotics. This is critical in curbing the influx of custom PSO and theoretically addresses the fundamental flaws of the existing PSO algorithm.},

Second, we discuss research on the difference between good and bad abandonment, which shows that in approximately 30% of all abandoned searches the users are in fact satisfied with the results. Third, we catalog techniques to determine queries and groups of queries that are underperforming in terms of user satisfaction.

Moreover, the events may have different costs and benefits, which, when associated with the rarity of some of them on the available training data, creates serious problems to predictive modeling techniques. This article presents a survey of existing techniques for handling these important applications of predictive analytics. Although most of the existing work addresses classification tasks (nominal target variables), we also describe methods designed to handle similar problems within regression tasks (numeric target variables). In this survey, we discuss the main challenges raised by imbalanced domains, propose a definition of the problem, describe the main approaches to these tasks, propose a taxonomy of the methods, summarize the conclusions of existing comparative studies as well as some theoretical analyses of some methods, and refer to some related problems within predictive modeling.},

abstract = {The field of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) has experienced a rapid and ongoing growth of available sources for geospatial data. This growth has demanded more data integration in order to explore the benefits of these data further. However, many data providers implies many points of view for the same phenomena: geospatial features. We need sophisticated procedures aiming to find the correspondences between two vector datasets, a process named geospatial data matching. Similarity measures are key-tools for matching methods, so it is interesting to review these concepts together. This article provides a survey of 30 years of research into the measures and methods facing geospatial data matching. Our survey presents related work and develops a common taxonomy that permits us to compare measures and methods. This study points out relevant issues that may help to discover the potential of these approaches in many applications, like data integration, conflation, quality evaluation, and data management.},

abstract = {Today's multimedia search engines are expected to respond to queries reflecting a wide variety of information needs from users with different goals. The topical dimension (“what” the user is searching for) of these information needs is well studied; however, the intent dimension (“why” the user is searching) has received relatively less attention. Specifically, intent is the “immediate reason, purpose, or goal” that motivates a user to query a search engine. We present a thorough survey of multimedia information retrieval research directed at the problem of enabling search engines to respond to user intent. The survey begins by defining intent, including a differentiation from related, often-confused concepts. It then presents the key conceptual models of search intent. The core is an overview of intent-aware approaches that operate at each stage of the multimedia search engine pipeline (i.e., indexing, query processing, ranking). We discuss intent in conventional text-based search wherever it provides insight into multimedia search intent or intent-aware approaches. Finally, we identify and discuss the most important future challenges for intent-aware multimedia search engines. Facing these challenges will allow multimedia information retrieval to recognize and respond to user intent and, as a result, fully satisfy the information needs of users.},

With the increasing number and complexity of security problems and solutions, we believe this is the right moment to step back and systematically re-evaluate the Android security architecture and security practices in the ecosystem. We organize the most recent security research on the Android platform into two categories: the software stack and the ecosystem. For each category, we provide a comprehensive narrative of the problem space, highlight the limitations of the proposed solutions, and identify open problems for future research.

Wearables equipped with an array of sensors are able to capture the owner’s physiological and behavioural traits, thus are well suited for biometric authentication to control other devices or access digital services. However, wearable biometrics have substantial differences from traditional biometrics for computer systems, such as fingerprints, eye features, or voice. In this article, we discuss these differences and analyse how researchers are approaching the wearable biometrics field. We review and provide a categorization of wearable sensors useful for capturing biometric signals. We analyse the computational cost of the different signal processing techniques, an important practical factor in constrained devices such as wearables. Finally, we review and classify the most recent proposals in the field of wearable biometrics in terms of the structure of the biometric system proposed, their experimental setup, and their results. We also present a critique of experimental issues such as evaluation and feasibility aspects, and offer some final thoughts on research directions that need attention in future work.},

The technological changes are related to three of the most important attributes of interconnection networks: topology, routing, and flow-control algorithms. On the other hand, the physical constraints, that is, port counts, number of communication nodes, and communication speed, determine the realistic properties of the network. We present the state-of-the-art technology for the most commonly used interconnection networks and some background related to often-used network topologies. The interconnection networks of the best-performing petascale parallel computers from past and present Top500 lists are analyzed. The lessons learned from this analysis indicate that computer networks need better performance in future exascale computers. Such an approach leads to the conclusion that a high-radix topology with optical connections for longer links is set to become the optimum interconnect for a number of relevant application domains.},

abstract = {Modern graphics processing units (GPUs) have complex architectures that admit exceptional performance and energy efficiency for high-throughput applications. Although GPUs consume large amounts of power, their use for high-throughput applications facilitate state-of-the-art energy efficiency and performance. Consequently, continued development relies on understanding their power consumption. This work is a survey of GPU power modeling and profiling methods with increased detail on noteworthy efforts. As direct measurement of GPU power is necessary for model evaluation and parameter initiation, internal and external power sensors are discussed. Hardware counters, which are low-level tallies of hardware events, share strong correlation to power use and performance. Statistical correlation between power and performance counters has yielded worthwhile GPU power models, yet the complexity inherent to GPU architectures presents new hurdles for power modeling. Developments and challenges of counter-based GPU power modeling are discussed. Often building on the counter-based models, research efforts for GPU power simulation, which make power predictions from input code and hardware knowledge, provide opportunities for optimization in programming or architectural design. Noteworthy strides in power simulations for GPUs are included along with their performance or functional simulator counterparts when appropriate. Last, possible directions for future research are discussed.},

Moreover, advances in Web technologies coupled with social networks has enabled users to not only access, but also generate, content in many forms. The overwhelming amount of produced content and resulting network traffic gives rise to precarious scalability issues for social networks, such as handling a large number of users, infrastructure management, internal network traffic, content dissemination, and data storage. There are few surveys conducted to explore the different dimensions of social networks, such as security, privacy, and data acquisition. Most of the surveys focus on privacy or security-related issues and do not specifically address scalability challenges faced by social networks. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive study of social networks along with their significant characteristics and categorize social network architectures into three broad categories: (a) centralized, (b) decentralized, and (c) hybrid. We also highlight various scalability issues faced by social network architectures. Finally, a qualitative comparison of presented architectures is provided, which is based on various scalability metrics, such as availability, latency, interserver communication, cost of resources, and energy consumption, just to name a few.},

abstract = {Current rapid advancements in deep submicron technologies have enabled the implementation of very large memory devices and embedded memories. However, the memory growth increases the number of defects, reducing the yield and reliability of such devices. Faulty cells are commonly repaired by using redundant cells, which are embedded in memory arrays by adding spare rows and columns. The repair process requires an efficient redundancy analysis (RA) algorithm. Spare architectures for the repair of faulty memory include one-dimensional (1D) spare architectures, two-dimensional (2D) spare architectures, and configurable spare architectures. Of these types, 2D spare architectures, which prepare extra rows and columns for repair, are popular because of their better repairing efficiency than 1D spare architectures and easier implementation than configurable spare architectures. However, because the complexity of the RA is NP-complete, the RA algorithm should consider various factors in order to determine a repair solution. The performance depends on three factors: analysis time, repair rate, and area overhead. In this article, we survey RA algorithms for memory devices as well as built-in repair algorithms for improving these performance factors. Built-in redundancy analysis techniques for emergent three-dimensional integrated circuits are also discussed. Based on this analysis, we then discuss future research challenges for faulty-memory repair studies.},

In spite of its relevance, it is rarely recorded in the majority of breast cancer datasets, which makes research in its prediction more difficult. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques applied to the prediction of breast cancer recurrence. Material and Methods: Revision of published works that used machine learning techniques in local and open source databases between 1997 and 2014. Results: The revision showed that it is difficult to obtain a representative dataset for breast cancer recurrence and there is no consensus on the best set of predictors for this disease. High accuracy results are often achieved, yet compromising sensitivity. The missing data and class imbalance problems are rarely addressed and most often the chosen performance metrics are inappropriate for the context. Discussion and Conclusions: Although different techniques have been used, prediction of breast cancer recurrence is still an open problem. The combination of different machine learning techniques, along with the definition of standard predictors for breast cancer recurrence seem to be the main future directions to obtain better results.},

abstract = {Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are robust stochastic optimisers that perform well over a wide range of problems. Their robustness, however, may be affected by several adjustable parameters, such as mutation rate, crossover rate, and population size. Algorithm parameters are usually problem-specific, and often have to be tuned not only to the problem but even the problem instance at hand to achieve ideal performance. In addition, research has shown that different parameter values may be optimal at different stages of the optimisation process. To address these issues, researchers have shifted their focus to adaptive parameter control, in which parameter values are adjusted during the optimisation process based on the performance of the algorithm. These methods redefine parameter values repeatedly based on implicit or explicit rules that decide how to make the best use of feedback from the optimisation algorithm.In this survey, we systematically investigate the state of the art in adaptive parameter control. The approaches are classified using a new conceptual model that subdivides the process of adapting parameter values into four steps that are present explicitly or implicitly in all existing approaches that tune parameters dynamically during the optimisation process. The analysis reveals the major focus areas of adaptive parameter control research as well as gaps and potential directions for further development in this area.},

This effort has addressed a wide range of problems and resulted in the creation of many tools for application analysis. In this article, we perform the first systematization of Android security research that analyzes applications, characterizing the work published in more than 17 top venues since 2010. We categorize each paper by the types of problems they solve, highlight areas that have received the most attention, and note whether tools were ever publicly released for each effort. Of the released tools, we then evaluate a representative sample to determine how well application developers can apply the results of our community’s efforts to improve their products. We find not only that significant work remains to be done in terms of research coverage but also that the tools suffer from significant issues ranging from lack of maintenance to the inability to produce functional output for applications with known vulnerabilities. We close by offering suggestions on how the community can more successfully move forward.},

abstract = {Some excellent surveys of the Gaussian random number generators (GRNGs) from the algorithmic perspective exist in the published literature to date (e.g., Thomas et al. [2007]). In the last decade, however, advancements in digital hardware have resulted in an ever-decreasing hardware cost and increased design flexibility. Additionally, recent advances in applications like gaming, weather forecasting, and simulations in physics and astronomy require faster, cheaper, and statistically accurate GRNGs. These two trends have contributed toward the development of a number of novel GRNG architectures optimized for hardware design. A detailed comparative study of these hardware architectures has been somewhat missing in the published literature. This work provides the potential user a capsulization of the published hardware GRNG architectures. We have provided the method and theory, pros and cons, and a comparative summary of the speed, statistical accuracy, and hardware resource utilization of these architectures. Finally, we have complemented this work by describing two novel hardware GRNG architectures, namely, the CLT-inversion and the multihat algorithm, respectively. These new architectures provide high tail accuracy (6σ and 8σ, respectively) at a low hardware cost.},

Among these, hand-based biometric systems have come to the attention of researchers worldwide who utilize them for low- to medium-security applications such as financial transactions, access control, law enforcement, border control, computer security, time and attendance systems, dormitory meal plan access, etc. Several approaches for biometric recognition have been summarized in the literature. The survey in this article focuses on the interface between various hand modalities, summary of inner- and dorsal-knuckle print recognition, and fusion techniques. First, an overview of various feature extraction and classification approaches for knuckle print, a new entrant in the hand biometrics family with a higher user acceptance and invariance to emotions, is presented. Next, knuckle print fusion schemes with possible integration scenarios, and traditional capturing devices have been discussed. The economic relevance of various biometric traits, including knuckle print for commercial and forensic applications is debated. Finally, conclusions related to the scope of knuckle print as a biometric trait are drawn and some recommendations for the development of hand-based multimodal biometrics have been presented.},

abstract = {One of the main characteristics of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is the constrained energy resources of their wireless sensor nodes. Although this issue has been addressed in several works and received much attention over the years, the most recent advances pointed out that the energy harvesting and wireless charging techniques may offer means to overcome such a limitation. Consequently, an issue that had been put in second place now emerges: the low availability of spectrum resources. Because of it, the incorporation of the WSNs into the Internet of Things and the exponential growth of the latter may be hindered if no control over the data generation is taken. Alternatively, part of the sensed data can be predicted without triggering transmissions that could congest the wireless medium. In this work, we analyze and categorize existing prediction-based data reduction mechanisms that have been designed for WSNs. Our main contribution is a systematic procedure for selecting a scheme to make predictions in WSNs, based on WSNs’ constraints, characteristics of prediction methods, and monitored data. Finally, we conclude the article with a discussion about future challenges and open research directions in the use of prediction methods to support the WSNs’ growth.},

abstract = {The goal of ubiquitous computing is to create ambience in which one’s experiences and quality of life are improved by monitoring and assisting people using ubiquitous technologies and computation in coherence. The continuous advancements of involved technologies, such as wireless communications, mobile devices, and sensors, imply fast evolution of ubiquitous computing environments too. The complexity of these environments is reaching a point where traditional solutions simply no longer work. The environments are in need of computational techniques that can deal with the evolution and uncertainty of ubiquitous computing environments dynamically and automatically. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute towards satisfying this future scenario in many ways, while numerous approaches inspired by work in the AI planning community have already been designed for ubiquitous computing. We devote this study to investigate the current progress of AI planning for ubiquitous computing by analysing those approaches. We rigorously search for and select relevant literature out of which we extract qualitative information. Using the extracted qualities, we derive a generic framework that consists of aspects important to planning for ubiquitous computing. The framework’s main purpose is to facilitate the understanding of those aspects, and classify the literature according to them. We then analyse the literature in a consolidated way, and identify future challenges of planning for ubiquitous computing.},

However, the research area lacks a systematic assessment of known research work: No model exists that defines IS thoroughly. Various case studies provide insights into IS programs in the context of specific organizations but only few publications apply a broader perspective. To resolve this, we performed an extensive literature survey and analyzed 43 IS related publications plus additional background literature. Using qualitative data analysis methods, we developed a model of the elements that constitute IS. We present a classification framework for IS programs and projects and apply it to lay out a map of known IS endeavors. Further, we present qualitative models summarizing the benefits and challenges of IS adoption.

abstract = {Shared memory architectures have recently experienced a large increase in thread-level parallelism, leading to complex memory hierarchies with multiple cache memory levels and memory controllers. These new designs created a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) behavior, where the performance and energy consumption of memory accesses depend on the place where the data is located in the memory hierarchy. Accesses to local caches or memory controllers are generally more efficient than accesses to remote ones. A common way to improve the locality and balance of memory accesses is to determine the mapping of threads to cores and data to memory controllers based on the affinity between threads and data. Such mapping techniques can operate at different hardware and software levels, which impacts their complexity, applicability, and the resulting performance and energy consumption gains. In this article, we introduce a taxonomy to classify different mapping mechanisms and provide a comprehensive overview of existing solutions.},

abstract = {Modern scientific collaborations have opened up the opportunity to solve complex problems that require both multidisciplinary expertise and large-scale computational experiments. These experiments typically consist of a sequence of processing steps that need to be executed on selected computing platforms. Execution poses a challenge, however, due to (1) the complexity and diversity of applications, (2) the diversity of analysis goals, (3) the heterogeneity of computing platforms, and (4) the volume and distribution of data.A common strategy to make these in silico experiments more manageable is to model them as workflows and to use a workflow management system to organize their execution. This article looks at the overall challenge posed by a new order of scientific experiments and the systems they need to be run on, and examines how this challenge can be addressed by workflows and workflow management systems. It proposes a taxonomy of workflow management system (WMS) characteristics, including aspects previously overlooked. This frames a review of prevalent WMSs used by the scientific community, elucidates their evolution to handle the challenges arising with the emergence of the “fourth paradigm,” and identifies research needed to maintain progress in this area.},

As a consequence, they have motivated many studies in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Facing the large variety of menus, it is difficult to have a clear understanding of the design possibilities and to ascertain their similarities and differences. In this article, we address a main challenge of menu design: the need to characterize the design space of menus. To do this, we propose a taxonomy of menu properties that structures existing work on visual menus. As properties have an impact on the performance of the menu, we start by refining performance through a list of quality criteria and by reviewing existing analytical and empirical methods for quality evaluation. This taxonomy of menu properties is a step toward the elaboration of advanced predictive models of menu performance and the optimization of menus. A key point of this work is to focus both on menus and on the properties of menus, and then enable a fine-grained analysis in terms of performance.},

abstract = {One of the main challenges in security today is defending against malware attacks. As trends and anecdotal evidence show, preventing these attacks, regardless of their indiscriminate or targeted nature, has proven difficult: intrusions happen and devices get compromised, even at security-conscious organizations. As a consequence, an alternative line of work has focused on detecting and disrupting the individual steps that follow an initial compromise and are essential for the successful progression of the attack. In particular, several approaches and techniques have been proposed to identify the command and control (C8C) channel that a compromised system establishes to communicate with its controller.A major oversight of many of these detection techniques is the design’s resilience to evasion attempts by the well-motivated attacker. C8C detection techniques make widespread use of a machine learning (ML) component. Therefore, to analyze the evasion resilience of these detection techniques, we first systematize works in the field of C8C detection and then, using existing models from the literature, go on to systematize attacks against the ML components used in these approaches.},

However, they have not been systematically explored based on the understanding of attack-defense interactions, which are affected by various factors, including the degree of system vulnerabilities, the power of system defense mechanisms, attack (or threat) severity, and situations a system at risk faces. This survey particularly focuses on how a system security state can evolve as an outcome of cyber attack-defense interactions. This survey concerns how to measure system-level security by proposing a security metrics framework based on the following four sub-metrics: (1) metrics of system vulnerabilities, (2) metrics of defense power, (3) metrics of attack or threat severity, and (4) metrics of situations. To investigate the relationships among these four sub-metrics, we propose a hierarchical ontology with four sub-ontologies corresponding to the four sub-metrics and discuss how they are related to each other. Using the four sub-metrics, we discuss the state-of-art existing security metrics and their advantages and disadvantages (or limitations) to obtain lessons and insight in order to achieve an ideal goal in developing security metrics. Finally, we discuss open research questions in the security metrics research domain and we suggest key factors to enhance security metrics from a system security perspective.},

Network data mining has a large number of applications in many disciplines including protein-protein interaction networks, social networks, transportation networks, and telecommunication networks. Different empirical studies have shown that it is possible to predict new relationships between elements attending to the topology of the network and the properties of its elements. The problem of predicting new relationships in networks is called link prediction. Link prediction aims to infer the behavior of the network link formation process by predicting missed or future relationships based on currently observed connections.

In this survey, we will review the general-purpose techniques at the heart of the link prediction problem, which can be complemented by domain-specific heuristic methods in practice.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a comprehensive environment that consists of a large number of smart devices interconnecting heterogeneous physical objects to the Internet. Many domains such as logistics, manufacturing, agriculture, urban computing, home automation, ambient assisted living, and various ubiquitous computing applications have utilized IoT technologies. Meanwhile, Business Process Management Systems (BPMSs) have become a successful and efficient solution for coordinated management and optimized utilization of resources/entities. However, past BPMSs have not considered many issues they will face in managing large-scale connected heterogeneous IoT entities. Without fully understanding the behavior, capability, and state of the IoT entities, the BPMS can fail to manage the IoT integrated information systems. In this article, we analyze existing BPMSs for IoT and identify the limitations and their drawbacks based on a Mobile Cloud Computing perspective. Later, we discuss a number of open challenges in BPMS for IoT.},

However, formalization of a foundational model of ABAC and large scale adoption is still in its infancy. The relatively recent emergence of ABAC still leaves a number of problems unexplored. Issues like delegation, administration, auditability, scalability, hierarchical representations, and the like, have been largely ignored or left to future work.This article provides a basic introduction to ABAC and a comprehensive review of recent research efforts toward developing formal models of ABAC.

In response, a volunteer defense has emerged, led by security companies, infrastructure operators, and vigilantes. This reactionary force does not concern itself with making proactive upgrades to the cyber infrastructure. Instead, it operates on the front lines by remediating infections as they appear. We construct a model of the abuse reporting infrastructure in order to explain how voluntary action against cybercrime functions today, in hopes of improving our understanding of what works and how to make remediation more effective in the future. We examine the incentives to participate among data contributors, affected resource owners, and intermediaries. Finally, we present a series of key attributes that differ among voluntary actions to investigate further through experimentation, pointing toward a research agenda that could establish causality between interventions and outcomes.},

Even though the general deduplication approach has been increasingly accepted, it comes with many security and privacy problems due to the outsourced data delivery models of cloud storage. To deal with specific security and privacy issues, secure deduplication techniques have been proposed for cloud data, leading to a diverse range of solutions and trade-offs. Hence, in this article, we discuss ongoing research on secure deduplication for cloud data in consideration of the attack scenarios exploited most widely in cloud storage. On the basis of classification of deduplication system, we explore security risks and attack scenarios from both inside and outside adversaries. We then describe state-of-the-art secure deduplication techniques for each approach that deal with different security issues under specific or combined threat models, which include both cryptographic and protocol solutions. We discuss and compare each scheme in terms of security and efficiency specific to different security goals. Finally, we identify and discuss unresolved issues and further research challenges for secure deduplication in cloud storage.},

The current widely deployed method for providing Internet Protocol (IP) services to mobile devices is the mobile IP. This includes a handover process for a mobile device to maintain its IP session while it switches between points of access. However, the mobile IP handover causes performance degradation due to its disruptive latency and high packet drop rate. This is largely problematic for vehicles, as they will be forced to transition between access points more frequently due to their higher speeds and frequent topological changes in vehicular networks. In this article, we discuss the different mobile IP handover solutions found within related literature and their potential for resolving issues pertinent to vehicular networks. First, we provide an overview of the mobile IP handover and its problematic components. This is followed by categorization and comparison between different mobile IP handover solutions, with an analysis of their benefits and drawbacks.},

abstract = {Hypervideos and interactive multimedia presentations allow the creation of fully interactive and enriched video. It is possible to organize video scenes in a nonlinear way. Additional information can be added to the video ranging from short descriptions to images and more videos. Hypervideos are video-based but also provide navigation between video scenes and additional multimedia elements. Interactive multimedia presentations consist of different media with a temporal and spatial synchronization that can be navigated via hyperlinks. Their creation and description requires description formats, multimedia models, and standards—as well as players. Specialized authoring tools with advanced editing functions allow authors to manage all media files, link and arrange them to an overall presentation, and keep an overview during the whole process. They considerably simplify the creation process compared to writing and editing description documents in simple text editors. Data formats need features that describe interactivity and nonlinear navigation while maintaining temporal and spatial synchronization. Players should be easy to use with extended feature sets keeping elements synchronized. In this article, we analyzed more than 400 papers for relevant work in this field. From the findings we discovered a set of trends and unsolved problems, and propose directions for future research.},

Fire protection systems are crucial because of the increased loss of human lives due to coal fires and fatal explosions in coal mines across the world in the past few decades. And with the growth in the demand for energy and the mining of coal expected up to the year 2050, determining conditions leading up to a breakout of fire is paramount. To detect uncertain fire breakout conditions, thermal imaging is considered the most significant among several early warning methods to recognize spontaneous combustion of coal piles (e.g., temperature recordings by sensors, compaction testing of ore seam, gas tests). The evolution of thermographic imaging applied in various industrial sectors (e.g., coal furnaces, oil tankers, building inspections, security) with numerous applications of mathematical models will be presented in the light of safety dimensions in the mining industry. The missing links or unattended areas of mathematics in the application of thermal image processing in mining, especially in the coal industry, will be evolved as the gap in knowledge suggested in our concluding statements.},

abstract = {A timing channel is a communication channel that can transfer information to a receiver/decoder by modulating the timing behavior of an entity. Examples of this entity include the interpacket delays of a packet stream, the reordering packets in a packet stream, or the resource access time of a cryptographic module. Advances in the information and coding theory and the availability of high-performance computing systems interconnected by high-speed networks have spurred interest in and development of various types of timing channels. With the emergence of complex timing channels, novel detection and prevention techniques are also being developed to counter them. In this article, we provide a detailed survey of timing channels broadly categorized into network timing channel, in which communicating entities are connected by a network, and in-system timing channel, in which the communicating entities are within a computing system. This survey builds on the last comprehensive survey by Zander et al. [2007] and considers all three canonical applications of timing channels, namely, covert communication, timing side channel, and network flow watermarking. We survey the theoretical foundations, the implementation, and the various detection and prevention techniques that have been reported in literature. Based on the analysis of the current literature, we discuss potential future research directions both in the design and application of timing channels and their detection and prevention techniques.},

abstract = {Data-flow testing (DFT) is a family of testing strategies designed to verify the interactions between each program variable’s definition and its uses. Such a test objective of interest is referred to as a def-use pair. DFT selects test data with respect to various test adequacy criteria (i.e., data-flow coverage criteria) to exercise each pair. The original conception of DFT was introduced by Herman in 1976. Since then, a number of studies have been conducted, both theoretically and empirically, to analyze DFT’s complexity and effectiveness. In the past four decades, DFT has been continuously concerned, and various approaches from different aspects are proposed to pursue automatic and efficient data-flow testing. This survey presents a detailed overview of data-flow testing, including challenges and approaches in enforcing and automating it: (1) it introduces the data-flow analysis techniques that are used to identify def-use pairs; (2) it classifies and discusses techniques for data-flow-based test data generation, such as search-based testing, random testing, collateral-coverage-based testing, symbolic-execution-based testing, and model-checking-based testing; (3) it discusses techniques for tracking data-flow coverage; (4) it presents several DFT applications, including software fault localization, web security testing, and specification consistency checking; and (5) it summarizes recent advances and discusses future research directions toward more practical data-flow testing.},

This gap triggered significant research efforts over the past decade, leading to an array of approaches to business process variability modeling. In general, each of these approaches extends a conventional process modeling language with constructs to capture customizable process models. A customizable process model represents a family of process variants in a way that a model of each variant can be derived by adding or deleting fragments according to customization options or according to a domain model. This survey draws up a systematic inventory of approaches to customizable process modeling and provides a comparative evaluation with the aim of identifying common and differentiating modeling features, providing criteria for selecting among multiple approaches, and identifying gaps in the state of the art. The survey puts into evidence an abundance of customizable process-modeling languages, which contrasts with a relative scarcity of available tool support and empirical comparative evaluations.},

An essential activity in SPL is variability management, i.e., defining and managing commonality and variability among member products. Due to the large scale and complexity of today's software-intensive systems, variability management has become increasingly complex to conduct. Accordingly, tool support for variability management has been gathering increasing momentum over the last few years and can be considered a key success factor for developing and maintaining SPLs. While several studies have already been conducted on variability management, none of these analyzed the available tool support in detail. In this work, we report on a survey in which we analyzed 37 existing variability management tools identified using a systematic literature review to understand the tools’ characteristics, maturity, and the challenges in the field. We conclude that while most studies on variability management tools provide a good motivation and description of the research context and challenges, they often lack empirical data to support their claims and findings. It was also found that quality attributes important for the practical use of tools such as usability, integration, scalability, and performance were out of scope for most studies.},

abstract = {The vulnerability of face recognition systems to presentation attacks (also known as direct attacks or spoof attacks) has received a great deal of interest from the biometric community. The rapid evolution of face recognition systems into real-time applications has raised new concerns about their ability to resist presentation attacks, particularly in unattended application scenarios such as automated border control. The goal of a presentation attack is to subvert the face recognition system by presenting a facial biometric artifact. Popular face biometric artifacts include a printed photo, the electronic display of a facial photo, replaying video using an electronic display, and 3D face masks. These have demonstrated a high security risk for state-of-the-art face recognition systems. However, several presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms (also known as countermeasures or antispoofing methods) have been proposed that can automatically detect and mitigate such targeted attacks. The goal of this survey is to present a systematic overview of the existing work on face presentation attack detection that has been carried out. This paper describes the various aspects of face presentation attacks, including different types of face artifacts, state-of-the-art PAD algorithms and an overview of the respective research labs working in this domain, vulnerability assessments and performance evaluation metrics, the outcomes of competitions, the availability of public databases for benchmarking new PAD algorithms in a reproducible manner, and finally a summary of the relevant international standardization in this field. Furthermore, we discuss the open challenges and future work that need to be addressed in this evolving field of biometrics.},

abstract = {Ensemble-based methods are among the most widely used techniques for data stream classification. Their popularity is attributable to their good performance in comparison to strong single learners while being relatively easy to deploy in real-world applications. Ensemble algorithms are especially useful for data stream learning as they can be integrated with drift detection algorithms and incorporate dynamic updates, such as selective removal or addition of classifiers. This work proposes a taxonomy for data stream ensemble learning as derived from reviewing over 60 algorithms. Important aspects such as combination, diversity, and dynamic updates, are thoroughly discussed. Additional contributions include a listing of popular open-source tools and a discussion about current data stream research challenges and how they relate to ensemble learning (big data streams, concept evolution, feature drifts, temporal dependencies, and others).},

abstract = {Animals play a profoundly important and intricate role in our lives today. Dogs have been human companions for thousands of years, but now they work to assist the disabled, and in combat and search and rescue situations. Farm animals are a critical part of sustainable agriculture today, and there is increasing consumer interest in humanely raised livestock, and how it impacts our health and environmental footprint. Wild animals are threatened with extinction by human induced factors, and shrinking and compromised habitats. There are many reasons, including societal and economic ones, to explore how new computing technologies can be used to ensure the welfare of animals in these settings. The goal of this review is to systematically survey the existing literature in smart computing and sensing technologies for domestic, farm, and wild animal welfare. We use a broad notion of animal welfare to refer to an assessment of whether animals are healthy, free of pain and suffering, and positively stimulated in their environment. Smart computing and sensing is also used in broad terms, to refer to systems that are not isolated but interconnected with communication networks, and capable of remote data collection, processing, exchange, and analysis. The findings of this review are expected to motivate future research in computer science and engineering, as well as contribute to data, information, and communication management for animal welfare.},

The continuous increase in computing power, together with advancements in metaheuristics frameworks and parallelization strategies, are empowering these types of algorithms as one of the best alternatives to solve rich and real-life combinatorial optimization problems that arise in a number of financial and banking activities. This article reviews some of the works related to the use of metaheuristics in solving both classical and emergent problems in the finance arena. A non-exhaustive list of examples includes rich portfolio optimization, index tracking, enhanced indexation, credit risk, stock investments, financial project scheduling, option pricing, feature selection, bankruptcy and financial distress prediction, and credit risk assessment. This article also discusses some open opportunities for researchers in the field, and forecast the evolution of metaheuristics to include real-life uncertainty conditions into the optimization problems being considered.},

For decades, hashing has been one of the most effective tools commonly used to compress data for fast access and analysis, as well as information integrity verification. Hashing techniques have also evolved from simple randomization approaches to advanced adaptive methods considering locality, structure, label information, and data security, for effective hashing. This survey reviews and categorizes existing hashing techniques as a taxonomy, in order to provide a comprehensive view of mainstream hashing techniques for different types of data and applications. The taxonomy also studies the uniqueness of each method and therefore can serve as technique references in understanding the niche of different hashing mechanisms for future development.},

abstract = {In the current hyperconnected era, modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT) systems form sophisticated networks where not only do people interact with other people, but also machines take an increasingly visible and participatory role. Such Human-Machine Networks (HMNs) are embedded in the daily lives of people, both for personal and professional use. They can have a significant impact by producing synergy and innovations. The challenge in designing successful HMNs is that they cannot be developed and implemented in the same manner as networks of machines nodes alone, or following a wholly human-centric view of the network. The problem requires an interdisciplinary approach. Here, we review current research of relevance to HMNs across many disciplines. Extending the previous theoretical concepts of socio-technical systems, actor-network theory, cyber-physical-social systems, and social machines, we concentrate on the interactions among humans and between humans and machines. We identify eight types of HMNs: public-resource computing, crowdsourcing, web search engines, crowdsensing, online markets, social media, multiplayer online games and virtual worlds, and mass collaboration. We systematically select literature on each of these types and review it with a focus on implications for designing HMNs. Moreover, we discuss risks associated with HMNs and identify emerging design and development trends.},

Control-flow hijacking attacks exploit memory corruption vulnerabilities to divert program execution away from the intended control flow. Researchers have spent more than a decade studying and refining defenses based on Control-Flow Integrity (CFI); this technique is now integrated into several production compilers. However, so far, no study has systematically compared the various proposed CFI mechanisms nor is there any protocol on how to compare such mechanisms. We compare a broad range of CFI mechanisms using a unified nomenclature based on (i) a qualitative discussion of the conceptual security guarantees, (ii) a quantitative security evaluation, and (iii) an empirical evaluation of their performance in the same test environment. For each mechanism, we evaluate (i) protected types of control-flow transfers and (ii) precision of the protection for forward and backward edges. For open-source, compiler-based implementations, we also evaluate (iii) generated equivalence classes and target sets and (iv) runtime performance.},

abstract = {Imitation learning techniques aim to mimic human behavior in a given task. An agent (a learning machine) is trained to perform a task from demonstrations by learning a mapping between observations and actions. The idea of teaching by imitation has been around for many years; however, the field is gaining attention recently due to advances in computing and sensing as well as rising demand for intelligent applications. The paradigm of learning by imitation is gaining popularity because it facilitates teaching complex tasks with minimal expert knowledge of the tasks. Generic imitation learning methods could potentially reduce the problem of teaching a task to that of providing demonstrations, without the need for explicit programming or designing reward functions specific to the task. Modern sensors are able to collect and transmit high volumes of data rapidly, and processors with high computational power allow fast processing that maps the sensory data to actions in a timely manner. This opens the door for many potential AI applications that require real-time perception and reaction such as humanoid robots, self-driving vehicles, human computer interaction, and computer games, to name a few. However, specialized algorithms are needed to effectively and robustly learn models as learning by imitation poses its own set of challenges. In this article, we survey imitation learning methods and present design options in different steps of the learning process. We introduce a background and motivation for the field as well as highlight challenges specific to the imitation problem. Methods for designing and evaluating imitation learning tasks are categorized and reviewed. Special attention is given to learning methods in robotics and games as these domains are the most popular in the literature and provide a wide array of problems and methodologies. We extensively discuss combining imitation learning approaches using different sources and methods, as well as incorporating other motion learning methods to enhance imitation. We also discuss the potential impact on industry, present major applications, and highlight current and future research directions.},

abstract = {In software development, models are often used to represent multiple views of the same system. Such models need to be properly related to each other in order to provide a consistent description of the developed system. Models may contain contradictory system specifications, for instance, when they evolve independently. Therefore, it is very crucial to ensure that models conform to each other. In this context, we focus on consistency checking of behavior models. Several techniques and approaches have been proposed in the existing literature to support behavioral model consistency checking. This article presents a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) that was carried out to obtain an overview of the various consistency concepts, problems, and solutions proposed regarding behavior models. In our study, the identification and selection of the primary studies was based on a well-planned search strategy. The search process identified a total of 1770 studies, out of which 96 have been thoroughly analyzed according to our predefined SLR protocol. The SLR aims to highlight the state-of-the-art of software behavior model consistency checking and identify potential gaps for future research. Based on research topics in selected studies, we have identified seven main categories: targeted software models, types of consistency checking, consistency checking techniques, inconsistency handling, type of study and evaluation, automation support, and practical impact. The findings of the systematic review also reveal suggestions for future research, such as improving the quality of study design and conducting evaluations, and application of research outcomes in industrial settings. For this purpose, appropriate strategy for inconsistency handling, better tool support for consistency checking and/or development tool integration should be considered in future studies.},

However, naively partitioning the cache may lead to performance loss, unfairness, and lack of quality-of-service guarantees. It is clear that intelligent techniques are required for realizing the full potential of cache partitioning.

abstract = {Ocean and water basically cover the major parts of our planet. To obtain the best utilization of the underlying resources on these parts of the Earth, people have made some research advancements. Specifically, the research on underwater wireless acoustic sensor networks (UWA-SNs) has made great progress. However, wide deployment of UWA-SNs is far from a reality due to several reasons. One important reason is that offshore deployment and field-level experiments of ocean-centric applications are both expensive and labor intensive. Other alternatives to attain this objective are to conduct simulation or experimentation that can reduce cost and accelerate the research activities and their outcomes. However, designing efficient and reliable simulation and experimentation platforms have proven to be more challenging beyond the expectation. In this article, we explore the main techniques (including their pros and cons) and components to develop simulation and experimentation platforms and provide a comprehensive survey report in this area. We classify simulation and experimentation platforms based on some typical criteria and then provide useful guidelines for researchers on choosing suitable platforms in accordance with their requirements.

abstract = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) applications have become more and more attractive with the miniaturization of circuits and the large variety of sensors. The different application domains, especially critical fields of WSN use, make the reliability of data acquisition and communication a hot research field that must be tackled efficiently. Indeed, the quality of largely used, cheap-cost wireless sensors and their scarce energy supply support these reliability challenges that lead to data loss or corruption. For solving this problem, the conception of a reliability mechanism that detects these shortcomings and recovers to them becomes necessary. In this article, we present a survey on existing reliability protocols conceived especially for WSNs due to their special features. The deep classification and discussion in this study allow for understanding the pros and cons of state-of-the-art works in order to enhance the existing schemes and fill the gaps. We have classified the works according to the required level of reliability, the manner to identify the origins of the lack of reliability, and the control to recover this lack of reliability. Across the discussion along this study, we deduce that the cross-layer design between MAC, routing, and transport layers presents a good concept to efficiently overcome the different reliability holes.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis from text consists of extracting information about opinions, sentiments, and even emotions conveyed by writers towards topics of interest. It is often equated to opinion mining, but it should also encompass emotion mining. Opinion mining involves the use of natural language processing and machine learning to determine the attitude of a writer towards a subject. Emotion mining is also using similar technologies but is concerned with detecting and classifying writers emotions toward events or topics. Textual emotion-mining methods have various applications, including gaining information about customer satisfaction, helping in selecting teaching materials in e-learning, recommending products based on users emotions, and even predicting mental-health disorders. In surveys on sentiment analysis, which are often old or incomplete, the strong link between opinion mining and emotion mining is understated. This motivates the need for a different and new perspective on the literature on sentiment analysis, with a focus on emotion mining. We present the state-of-the-art methods and propose the following contributions: (1) a taxonomy of sentiment analysis; (2) a survey on polarity classification methods and resources, especially those related to emotion mining; (3) a complete survey on emotion theories and emotion-mining research; and (4) some useful resources, including lexicons and datasets.},

The selected studies are categorized according to the selection procedure, empirical study design, and adequacy criteria with respect to their effectiveness measurement capability and methods used to measure the validity of these results.The results showed that mining and learning-based regression test case selection was reported in 39% of the studies, unit level testing was reported in 18% of the studies, and object-oriented environment (Java) was used in 26% of the studies. Structural faults, the most common target, was used in 55% of the studies. Overall, only 39% of the studies conducted followed experimental guidelines and are reproducible.There are 7 different cost measures, 13 different coverage types, and 5 fault-detection metrics reported in these studies. It is also observed that 70% of the studies being analyzed used cost as the effectiveness measure compared to 31% that used fault-detection capability and 16% that used coverage.},

abstract = {In many fields, recent years have brought a sharp rise in the size of the data to be analyzed and the complexity of the analysis to be performed. Such analyses are often described as dataflows specified in declarative dataflow languages. A key technique to achieve scalability for such analyses is the optimization of the declarative programs; however, many real-life dataflows are dominated by user-defined functions (UDFs) to perform, for instance, text analysis, graph traversal, classification, or clustering. This calls for specific optimization techniques as the semantics of such UDFs are unknown to the optimizer.In this article, we survey techniques for optimizing dataflows with UDFs. We consider methods developed over decades of research in relational database systems as well as more recent approaches spurred by the popularity of Map/Reduce-style data processing frameworks. We present techniques for syntactical dataflow modification, approaches for inferring semantics and rewrite options for UDFs, and methods for dataflow transformations both on the logical and the physical levels. Furthermore, we give a comprehensive overview on declarative dataflow languages for Big Data processing systems from the perspective of their build-in optimization techniques. Finally, we highlight open research challenges with the intention to foster more research into optimizing dataflows that contain UDFs.},

abstract = {Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSE) when deployed in the cloud allows one to query encrypted data without the risk of data leakage. Despite the widespread interest, existing surveys do not examine in detail how SSE’s underlying structures are designed and how these result in the many properties of a SSE scheme. This is the gap we seek to address, as well as presenting recent state-of-the-art advances on SSE. Specifically, we present a general framework and believe the discussions may lead to insights for potential new designs. We draw a few observations. First, most schemes use index table, where optimal index size and sublinear search can be achieved using an inverted index. Straightforward updating can only be achieved using direct index, but search time would be linear. A recent trend is the combinations of index table, and tree, deployed for efficient updating and storage. Secondly, mechanisms from related fields such as Oblivious RAM (ORAM) have been integrated to reduce leakages. However, using these mechanisms to minimise leakages in schemes with richer functionalities (e.g., ranked, range) is relatively unexplored. Thirdly, a new approach (e.g., multiple servers) is required to mitigate new and emerging attacks on leakage. Lastly, we observe that a proposed index may not be practically efficient when implemented, where I/O access must be taken into consideration.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect billions of smart objects to the Internet, which can bring a promising future to smart cities. These objects are expected to generate large amounts of data and send the data to the cloud for further processing, especially for knowledge discovery, in order that appropriate actions can be taken. However, in reality sensing all possible data items captured by a smart object and then sending the complete captured data to the cloud is less useful. Further, such an approach would also lead to resource wastage (e.g., network, storage, etc.). The Fog (Edge) computing paradigm has been proposed to counterpart the weakness by pushing processes of knowledge discovery using data analytics to the edges. However, edge devices have limited computational capabilities. Due to inherited strengths and weaknesses, neither Cloud computing nor Fog computing paradigm addresses these challenges alone. Therefore, both paradigms need to work together in order to build a sustainable IoT infrastructure for smart cities. In this article, we review existing approaches that have been proposed to tackle the challenges in the Fog computing domain. Specifically, we describe several inspiring use case scenarios of Fog computing, identify ten key characteristics and common features of Fog computing, and compare more than 30 existing research efforts in this domain. Based on our review, we further identify several major functionalities that ideal Fog computing platforms should support and a number of open challenges toward implementing them, to shed light on future research directions on realizing Fog computing for building sustainable smart cities.},

To protect legitimate users from these threats, anti-malware software products from different companies, including Comodo, Kaspersky, Kingsoft, and Symantec, provide the major defense against malware. Unfortunately, driven by the economic benefits, the number of new malware samples has explosively increased: anti-malware vendors are now confronted with millions of potential malware samples per year. In order to keep on combating the increase in malware samples, there is an urgent need to develop intelligent methods for effective and efficient malware detection from the real and large daily sample collection. In this article, we first provide a brief overview on malware as well as the anti-malware industry, and present the industrial needs on malware detection. We then survey intelligent malware detection methods. In these methods, the process of detection is usually divided into two stages: feature extraction and classification/clustering. The performance of such intelligent malware detection approaches critically depend on the extracted features and the methods for classification/clustering. We provide a comprehensive investigation on both the feature extraction and the classification/clustering techniques. We also discuss the additional issues and the challenges of malware detection using data mining techniques and finally forecast the trends of malware development.},

Of particular interest are the intersections where traffic bottlenecks are known to occur despite being traditionally signalized. Reinforcement learning (RL), which is an artificial intelligence approach, has been adopted in traffic signal control for monitoring and ameliorating traffic congestion. RL enables autonomous decision makers (e.g., traffic signal controllers) to observe, learn, and select the optimal action (e.g., determining the appropriate traffic phase and its timing) to manage traffic such that system performance is improved. This article reviews various RL models and algorithms applied to traffic signal control in the aspects of the representations of the RL model (i.e., state, action, and reward), performance measures, and complexity to establish a foundation for further investigation in this research field. Open issues are presented toward the end of this article to discover new research areas with the objective to spark new interest in this research field.},

Many extreme-scale computing systems today (for example: Top500) have tight integration of multicore CPU processors and accelerators (mix of Graphical Processing Units, Intel Xeon Phis, or Field Programmable Gate Arrays) empowering them to provide not just unprecedented computational power but also to address these concerns. However, such integration renders these systems highly heterogeneous and hierarchical, thereby necessitating design of novel performance, power, and energy models to accurately capture these inherent characteristics.There are now several extensive research efforts focusing exclusively on power and energy efficiency models and techniques for the processors composing these extreme-scale computing systems. This article synthesizes these research efforts with absolute concentration on predictive power and energy models and prime emphasis on node architecture. Through this survey, we also intend to highlight the shortcomings of these models to correctly and comprehensively predict the power and energy consumptions by taking into account the hierarchical and heterogeneous nature of these tightly integrated high-performance computing systems.},

To achieve this objective, we have conducted a systematic literature review of 94 shortlisted studies. We classified the selected studies using the tag-based approach and designed classification grids. Using classification grids, it was found that the category-domain contributed a maximum of 62%, whereas the time domain contributed at least 3%. User-item overlaps were found to have equal contribution. Single target domain recommendation task was found at a maximum of 78%, whereas cross-domain recommendation task had a minor influence at only 10%.

To fulfill this aim, we introduce a comparison framework to compare and classify EP systems. Our comparison framework is composed of thirteen criteria that include: profiling source, the entity being modeled, the information that constitutes the profile, representation schema, profile construction technique, scale, scope/target domain, language, updating mechanism, enrichment technique, dynamicity, evaluation method, and application among others.

abstract = {Many proofs in discrete mathematics and theoretical computer science are based on the probabilistic method. To prove the existence of a good object, we pick a random object and show that it is bad with low probability. This method is effective, but the underlying probabilistic machinery can be daunting. “Encoding arguments” provide an alternative presentation in which probabilistic reasoning is encapsulated in a “uniform encoding lemma.” This lemma provides an upper bound on the probability of an event using the fact that a uniformly random choice from a set of size n cannot be encoded with fewer than log 2n bits on average. With the lemma, the argument reduces to devising an encoding where bad objects have short codewords.In this expository article, we describe the basic method and provide a simple tutorial on how to use it. After that, we survey many applications to classic problems from discrete mathematics and computer science. We also give a generalization for the case of non-uniform distributions, as well as a rigorous justification for the use of non-integer codeword lengths in encoding arguments. These latter two results allow encoding arguments to be applied more widely and to produce tighter results.},

abstract = {During a processor development cycle, post-silicon validation is performed on the first fabricated chip to detect and fix design errors. Design errors occur due to functional issues when a unit in a design does not meet its specification. The chances of occurrence of such errors are high when new features are added in a processor. Thus, in multicore architectures, with new features being added in core and uncore components, the task of verifying the functionality independently and in coordination with other units gains significance. Several new techniques are being proposed in the field of functional validation. In this article, we undertake a survey of these techniques to identify areas that need to be addressed for multicore designs. We start with an analysis of design errors in multicore architectures. We then survey different functional validation techniques based on hardware, software, and formal methods and propose a comprehensive taxonomy for each of these approaches. We also perform a critical analysis to identify gaps in existing research and propose new research directions for validation of multicore architectures.},

This article provides an overview of the state-of-the-art regarding business process model similarity measures and aims at analyzing which similarity measures exist, how they are characterized, and what kind of calculations are typically applied to determine similarity values. Finally, the analysis of 123 similarity measures results in the suggestions to conduct further comparative analyses of similarity measures, to investigate the integration of human input into similarity measurement, and to further analyze the requirements of similarity measurement usage scenarios as future research opportunities.},

Each combination of resources in query resolution process requires a different type of search engine with its own technical challenges and usage scenarios. This diversity complicates both the development of new systems and assessment of the state of the art. In this article, we present a systematic survey on Web of Things Search Engines (WoTSE), focusing on the diversity in forms of these systems. We collect and analyze over 200 related academic works to build a flexible conceptual model for WoTSE. We develop an analytical framework on this model to review the development of the field and its current status, reflected by 30 representative works in the area. We conclude our survey with a discussion on open issues to bridge the gap between the existing progress and an ideal WoTSE.},

abstract = {Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR) is a well-known setting in which explicit collaboration occurs among a group of users working together to solve a shared information need. This type of collaboration has been deemed as beneficial for complex or exploratory search tasks. With the multiplicity of factors impacting on the search effectiveness (e.g., collaborators’ interactions or the individual perception of the shared information need), CIR gives rise to several challenges in terms of collaboration support through algorithmic approaches. More particularly, CIR should allow us to satisfy the shared information need by optimizing the collaboration within the search session over all collaborators, while ensuring that both mutually beneficial goals are reached and that the cognitive cost of the collaboration does not impact the search effectiveness. In this survey, we propose an overview of CIR with a particular focus on the collaboration support through algorithmic approaches. The objective of this article is (a) to organize previous empirical studies analyzing collaborative search with the goal to provide useful design implications for CIR models, (b) to give a picture of the CIR area by distinguishing two main categories of models using the collaboration mediation axis, and (c) to point out potential perspectives in the domain.},

abstract = {Detecting and analyzing dense groups or communities from social and information networks has attracted immense attention over the last decade due to its enormous applicability in different domains. Community detection is an ill-defined problem, as the nature of the communities is not known in advance. The problem has turned even more complicated due to the fact that communities emerge in the network in various forms such as disjoint, overlapping, and hierarchical. Various heuristics have been proposed to address these challenges, depending on the application in hand. All these heuristics have been materialized in the form of new metrics, which in most cases are used as optimization functions for detecting the community structure, or provide an indication of the goodness of detected communities during evaluation. Over the last decade, a large number of such metrics have been proposed. Thus, there arises a need for an organized and detailed survey of the metrics proposed for community detection and evaluation. Here, we present a survey of the start-of-the-art metrics used for the detection and the evaluation of community structure. We also conduct experiments on synthetic and real networks to present a comparative analysis of these metrics in measuring the goodness of the underlying community structure.},

abstract = {Ray tracing has long been considered as the next-generation technology for graphics rendering. Recently, there has been strong momentum to adopt ray tracing--based rendering techniques on consumer-level platforms due to the inability of further enhancing user experience by increasing display resolution. On the other hand, the computing workload of ray tracing is still overwhelming. A 10-fold performance gap has to be narrowed for real-time applications, even on the latest graphics processing units (GPUs). As a result, hardware acceleration techniques are critical to delivering a satisfying level performance while at the same time meeting an acceptable power budget. A large body of research on ray-tracing hardware has been proposed over the past decade. This article is aimed at providing a timely survey on hardware techniques to accelerate the ray-tracing algorithm. First, a quantitative profiling on the ray-tracing workload is presented. We then review hardware techniques for the main functional blocks in a ray-tracing pipeline. On such a basis, the ray-tracing microarchitectures for both ASIC and processors are surveyed by following a systematic taxonomy.},

They have been used in several fields, and many trust and reputation models were developed recently. We perceived that most of them were built upon the numeric and cognitive paradigms, which do not use affective aspects to build trust or help in decision making. Studies in psychology argued that personality, emotions, and mood are important in decision making and can change the behaviors of individuals. Based on that, we present links between trust and affective computing, showing relations of trust dimensions found in trust models with affective aspects, and presenting why affective computing approaches fit trust issues often addressed by research in this field. We also discuss trust relationships and decision making, emotions, and personality. Affective computing concepts have been used in a dispersed way and specifically in some models, so we aim to bring them together to encourage the growth of fuller trust models similar to those used by humans. We aim to find relations between both fields so it will be possible to employ such concepts to develop trust models using this new paradigm, defined as the affective paradigm.},

With the LOCAL model, theoretical research already established a common model of locality that has gained little practical relevance. As a result, practical research de facto lacks any common locality model. The only common denominator among practitioners is that a local algorithm is distributed with a restricted scope of interaction. This article closes the gap by introducing four practically motivated classes of locality that successively weaken the strict requirements of the LOCAL model. These classes are applied to categorize and survey 36 local algorithms from 12 different application domains. A detailed comparison shows the practicality of the classification and provides interesting insights. For example, the majority of algorithms limit the scope of interaction to at most two hops, independent of their locality class. Moreover, the application domain of algorithms tends to influence their degree of locality.},

abstract = {Automatic sarcasm detection is the task of predicting sarcasm in text. This is a crucial step to sentiment analysis, considering prevalence and challenges of sarcasm in sentiment-bearing text. Beginning with an approach that used speech-based features, automatic sarcasm detection has witnessed great interest from the sentiment analysis community. This article is a compilation of past work in automatic sarcasm detection. We observe three milestones in the research so far: semi-supervised pattern extraction to identify implicit sentiment, use of hashtag-based supervision, and incorporation of context beyond target text. In this article, we describe datasets, approaches, trends, and issues in sarcasm detection. We also discuss representative performance values, describe shared tasks, and provide pointers to future work, as given in prior works. In terms of resources to understand the state-of-the-art, the survey presents several useful illustrations—most prominently, a table that summarizes past papers along different dimensions such as the types of features, annotation techniques, and datasets used.},

abstract = {Modeling pedestrian dynamics and their implementation in a computer are challenging and important issues in the knowledge areas of transportation and computer simulation. The aim of this article is to provide a bibliographic outlook so that the reader may have quick access to the most relevant works related to this problem. We have used three main axes to organize the article’s contents: pedestrian models, validation techniques, and multiscale approaches. The backbone of this work is the classification of existing pedestrian models; we have organized the works in the literature under five categories, according to the techniques used for implementing the operational level in each pedestrian model. Then the main existing validation methods, oriented to evaluate the behavioral quality of the simulation systems, are reviewed. Furthermore, we review the key issues that arise when facing multiscale pedestrian modeling, where we first focus on the behavioral scale (combinations of micro and macro pedestrian models) and second on the scale size (from individuals to crowds). The article begins by introducing the main characteristics of walking dynamics and its analysis tools and concludes with a discussion about the contributions that different knowledge fields can make in the near future to this exciting area.},

The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive study of the state-of-the-art of approaches for the structural querying of XML data. In particular, we start with a description of labeling schemas to capture the structure of the data and the respective storage strategies. Then we deal with the key part of every XML query processing: a twig query join, XML query algebras, optimizations of query plans, and selectivity estimation of XML queries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that provides such a detailed description of XML query processing techniques that are related to structural aspects and that contains information about their theoretical and practical features as well as about their mutual compatibility and general usability.},

Next we discuss the two most fundamental graph querying functionalities: graph patterns and navigational expressions. We start with graph patterns, in which a graph-structured query is matched against the data. Thereafter, we discuss navigational expressions, in which patterns can be matched recursively against the graph to navigate paths of arbitrary length; we give an overview of what kinds of expressions have been proposed and how they can be combined with graph patterns. We also discuss several semantics under which queries using the previous features can be evaluated, what effects the selection of features and semantics has on complexity, and offer examples of such features in three modern languages that are used to query graphs: SPARQL, Cypher, and Gremlin. We conclude by discussing the importance of formalisation for graph query languages; a summary of what is known about SPARQL, Cypher, and Gremlin in terms of expressivity and complexity; and an outline of possible future directions for the area.},

Evaluating multimedia user-perceived Quality of Experience (QoE) is already non-trivial and the addition of multisensorial media components increases this challenge. No standardized methodology exists to conduct subjective quality assessments of multisensorial media applications. To date, researchers have employed different aspects of audiovisual standards to assess user QoE of multisensorial media applications and thus, a fragmented approach exists. In this article, the authors highlight issues researchers face from numerous perspectives including applicability (or lack of) existing audiovisual standards to evaluate user QoE and lack of result comparability due to varying approaches, specific requirements of olfactory-based multisensorial media applications, and novelty associated with these applications. Finally, based on the diverse approaches in the literature and the collective experience of authors, this article provides a tutorial and recommendations on the key steps to conduct olfactory-based multisensorial media QoE evaluation.},

We develop a broad taxonomy-based overview of common properties of social networks, review how they might be used in different applications, and point out potential pitfalls where appropriate. We propose a framework, distinguishing between two main types of social network-based user selection—personalised user selection, which identifies target users who may be relevant for a given source node, using the social network around the source as a context, and generic user selection or group delimitation, which filters for a set of users who satisfy a set of application requirements based on their social properties. Using this framework, we survey applications of social networks in three typical kinds of application scenarios: recommender systems, content-sharing systems (e.g., P2P or video streaming), and systems that defend against users who abuse the system (e.g., spam or sybil attacks). In each case, we discuss potential directions for future research that involve using social network properties.},

Numerous benefits provided by connecting clouds have garnered attraction from the academic as well as the industry sector. Just as every new evolution faces challenges, inter-connected clouds have their own set of challenges such as security, monitoring, authorization and identity management, vendor lock-in, and so forth. This article considers the vendor lock-in problem, which is a direct consequence of the lack of interoperability and portability. An extensive literature review by surveying more than 120 papers has been done to analyze and categorize various solutions suggested in literature for solving the interoperability and portability issues of inter-connected clouds. After categorizing the solutions, the literature has been mapped to a specific solution and a comparative analysis of the papers under the same solution has been done. The term “inter-connected clouds” has been used generically in this article to refer to any collaboration of clouds which may be from the user side (Multi-clouds or Aggregated service by Broker) or the provider side (Federated clouds or Hybrid clouds). Lastly, two closely related issues (Brokers and Meta-scheduling) and the remaining challenges of inter-connected clouds are discussed.},

Arrays offer both structural efficiency with reconfiguration and prospective capability of integration with different technologies. However, certain problems need to be addressed, and the most important one is the prevailing occurrence of faults. Considering fault rate projections as high as 20% that is much higher than those of CMOS, it is fair to expect sophisticated fault-tolerance methods. The focus of this survey article is the assessment and evaluation of these methods and related algorithms applied in logic mapping and configuration processes. As a start, we concisely explain reconfigurable nano-crossbar arrays with their fault characteristics and models. Following that, we demonstrate configuration techniques of the arrays in the presence of permanent faults and elaborate on two main fault-tolerance methodologies, namely defect-unaware and defect-aware approaches, with a short review on advantages and disadvantages. For both methodologies, we present detailed experimental results of related algorithms regarding their strengths and weaknesses with a comprehensive yield, success rate and runtime analysis. Next, we overview fault-tolerance approaches for transient faults. As a conclusion, we overview the proposed algorithms with future directions and upcoming challenges.},

First, as a background, we identify a wide range of existing as well as upcoming wearable devices and investigate their broad applications. Second, we provide an exposition of the security and privacy of wearable computing, studying dual aspects, that is, both attacks and defenses. Third, we provide a comprehensive study of the potential security, privacy, and safety enhancements to existing systems based on the emergence of wearable technology.

abstract = {A new form of caching, namely application-level caching, has been recently employed in web applications to improve their performance and increase scalability. It consists of the insertion of caching logic into the application base code to temporarily store processed content in memory and then decrease the response time of web requests by reusing this content. However, caching at this level demands knowledge of the domain and application specificities to achieve caching benefits, given that this information supports decisions such as what and when to cache content. Developers thus must manually manage the cache, possibly with the help of existing libraries and frameworks. Given the increasing popularity of application-level caching, we thus provide a survey of approaches proposed in this context. We provide a comprehensive introduction to web caching and application-level caching, and present state-of-the-art work on designing, implementing, and managing application-level caching. Our focus is not only on static solutions but also approaches that adaptively adjust caching solutions to avoid the gradual performance decay that caching can suffer over time. This survey can be used as a start point for researchers and developers, who aim to improve application-level caching or need guidance in designing application-level caching solutions, possibly with humans out-of-the-loop.},

This article surveys the state of the art in software platforms for Smart Cities. We analyzed 23 projects concerning the most used enabling technologies, as well as functional and non-functional requirements, classifying them into four categories: Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things, Big Data, and Cloud Computing. Based on these results, we derived a reference architecture to guide the development of next-generation software platforms for Smart Cities. Finally, we enumerated the most frequently cited open research challenges and discussed future opportunities.

Since its proposition, canonical correlation analysis has, for instance, been extended to extract relations between two sets of variables when the sample size is insufficient in relation to the data dimensionality, when the relations have been considered to be non-linear, and when the dimensionality is too large for human interpretation. This tutorial explains the theory of canonical correlation analysis, including its regularised, kernel, and sparse variants. Additionally, the deep and Bayesian CCA extensions are briefly reviewed. Together with the numerical examples, this overview provides a coherent compendium on the applicability of the variants of canonical correlation analysis. By bringing together techniques for solving the optimisation problems, evaluating the statistical significance and generalisability of the canonical correlation model, and interpreting the relations, we hope that this article can serve as a hands-on tool for applying canonical correlation methods in data analysis.},

abstract = {Authenticated encryption (AE) has been a vital operation in cryptography due to its ability to provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity at the same time. Its use has soared in parallel with widespread use of the internet and has led to several new schemes. There have been studies investigating software performance of various schemes. However, the same is yet to be done for hardware. We present a comprehensive survey of hardware (specifically ASIC) performance of the most commonly used AE schemes in the literature. These schemes include encrypt-then-MAC combination, block-cipher-based AE modes, and the recently introduced permutation-based AE scheme. For completeness, we implemented each scheme with various standardized block ciphers and/or hash algorithms, and their lightweight versions. Our evaluation targets minimizing the time-area product while maximizing the throughput on an ASIC platform. We used 45nm NANGATE Open Cell Library for syntheses. We present area, speed, time-area product, throughput, and power figures for both standard and lightweight versions of each scheme. We also provide an unbiased discussion on the impact of the structure and complexity of each scheme on hardware implementation. Our results reveal 13%--30% performance boost in permutation-based AE compared to conventional schemes, and they can be used as a benchmark in the ongoing AE competition CAESAR.},

abstract = {Optical on-chip data transmission enabled by silicon photonics (SiP) is widely considered a key technology to overcome the bandwidth and energy limitations of electrical interconnects. The possibility of integrating optical links into the on-chip communication fabric has opened up a fascinating new research field—Optical Networks-on-Chip (ONoCs)—which has been gaining large interest by the community. SiP devices and materials, however, are still evolving, and dealing with optical data transmission on chip makes designers and researchers face a whole new set of obstacles and challenges. Designing efficient ONoCs is a challenging task and requires a detailed knowledge from on-chip traffic demands and patterns down to the physical layout and implications of integrating both electronic and photonic devices. In this paper, we provide an exhaustive review of recently proposed ONoC architectures, discuss their strengths and weaknesses, and outline active research areas. Moreover, we discuss recent research efforts in key enabling technologies, such as on-chip and adaptive laser sources, automatic synthesis tools, and ring heating techniques, which are essential to enable a widespread commercial adoption of ONoCs in the future.},

This article presents the first comprehensive survey of research on Fuzzy Logic approaches in the context of vehicular networks, and provides fundamental information which enables readers to design their own Fuzzy Logic systems in this context. As such, this article describes the Fuzzy Logic concepts with emphasis on their implementation in vehicular networks, includes classification and thorough analysis of the Fuzzy Logic-based solutions in vehicular networks, and discusses how Fuzzy Logic could be employed in the context of some of the key research directions in the 5G-enabled vehicular networks.},

The objectives of feature selection include building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data-mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities to feature selection. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the era of big data, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective and review representative feature selection algorithms for conventional data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for conventional data, we categorize them into four main groups: similarity-based, information-theoretical-based, sparse-learning-based, and statistical-based methods. To facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present an open source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (http://featureselection.asu.edu/). Also, we use it as an example to show how to evaluate feature selection algorithms. At the end of the survey, we present a discussion about some open problems and challenges that require more attention in future research.},

abstract = {Firewalls are network security components that handle incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of rules. The process of correctly configuring a firewall is complicated and prone to error, and it worsens as the network complexity grows. A poorly configured firewall may result in major security threats; in the case of a network firewall, an organization’s security could be endangered, and in the case of a personal firewall, an individual computer’s security is threatened. A major reason for poorly configured firewalls, as pointed out in the literature, is usability issues. Our aim is to identify existing solutions that help professional and non-professional users to create and manage firewall configuration files, and to analyze the proposals in respect of usability. A systematic literature review with a focus on the usability of firewall configuration is presented in the article. Its main goal is to explore what has already been done in this field. In the primary selection procedure, 1,202 articles were retrieved and then screened. The secondary selection led us to 35 articles carefully chosen for further investigation, of which 14 articles were selected and summarized. As main contributions, we propose a taxonomy of existing solutions as well as a synthesis and in-depth discussion about the state of the art in firewall usability. Among the main findings, we perceived that there is a lack (or even an absence) of usability evaluation or user studies to validate the proposed models. Although all articles are related to the topic of usability, none of them clearly defines it, and only a few actually employ usability design principles and/or guidelines.},

It still remains a great challenge to process such large-scale graphs. Researchers have been seeking for new possible solutions. Because of the massive degree of parallelism and the high memory access bandwidth in GPU, utilizing GPU to accelerate graph processing proves to be a promising solution. This article surveys the key issues of graph processing on GPUs, including data layout, memory access pattern, workload mapping, and specific GPU programming.

We first provide a detailed understanding of the major application areas to which EHR mining has been applied and then discuss the nature of EHR data and its accompanying challenges. Next, we describe major approaches used for EHR mining, the metrics associated with EHRs, and the various study designs.

abstract = {Modeling and predicting player behavior is of the utmost importance in developing games. Experience has proven that, while theory-driven approaches are able to comprehend and justify a model's choices, such models frequently fail to encompass necessary features because of a lack of insight of the model builders. In contrast, data-driven approaches rely much less on expertise, and thus offer certain potential advantages. Hence, this study conducts a systematic review of the extant research on data-driven approaches to game player modeling. To this end, we have assessed experimental studies of such approaches over a nine-year period, from 2008 to 2016; this survey yielded 46 research studies of significance. We found that these studies pertained to three main areas of focus concerning the uses of data-driven approaches in game player modeling. One research area involved the objectives of data-driven approaches in game player modeling: behavior modeling and goal recognition. Another concerned methods: classification, clustering, regression, and evolutionary algorithm. The third was comprised of the current challenges and promising research directions for data-driven approaches in game player modeling.},

Both conventional techniques and emerging approaches are brought together to fill this gap between user demand and mobile devices’ limited capabilities. Recent research has focused on enhancing the performance of mobile devices via augmentation techniques. Augmentation techniques for mobile cloud computing refer to the computing paradigms and solutions to outsource mobile device computation and storage to more powerful computing resources in order to enhance a mobile device’s computing capability and energy efficiency (e.g., code offloading). Adopting augmentation techniques in the heterogeneous and intermittent mobile cloud computing environment creates new challenges for computation management, energy efficiency, and system reliability. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive taxonomy and survey of the existing techniques and frameworks for mobile cloud augmentation regarding both computation and storage. Different from the existing taxonomies in this field, we focus on the techniques aspect, following the idea of realizing a complete mobile cloud computing system. The objective of this survey is to provide a guide on what available augmentation techniques can be adopted in mobile cloud computing systems as well as supporting mechanisms such as decision-making and fault tolerance policies for realizing reliable mobile cloud services. We also present a discussion on the open challenges and future research directions in this field.},

abstract = {The last decades have seen a growing interest and demand for community-centered collaborative systems and platforms. These systems and platforms aim to provide an environment in which users can collaboratively create, share, and manage resources. While offering attractive opportunities for online collaboration and information sharing, they also open several security and privacy issues. This has attracted several research efforts toward the design and implementation of novel access control solutions that can handle the complexity introduced by collaboration. Despite these efforts, transition to practice has been hindered by the lack of maturity of the proposed solutions. The access control mechanisms typically adopted by commercial collaborative systems like online social network websites and collaborative editing platforms, are still rather rudimentary and do not provide users with a sufficient control over their resources. This survey examines the growing literature on access control for collaborative systems centered on communities, and identifies the main challenges to be addressed in order to facilitate the adoption of collaborative access control solutions in real-life settings. Based on the literature study, we delineate a roadmap for future research in the area of access control for community-centered collaborative systems.},

Common problems approached with crowdsourcing are labeling images, translating or transcribing text, providing opinions or ideas, and similar—all tasks that computers are not good at or where they may even fail altogether. The introduction of humans into computations and/or everyday work, however, also poses critical, novel challenges in terms of quality control, as the crowd is typically composed of people with unknown and very diverse abilities, skills, interests, personal objectives, and technological resources. This survey studies quality in the context of crowdsourcing along several dimensions, so as to define and characterize it and to understand the current state of the art. Specifically, this survey derives a quality model for crowdsourcing tasks, identifies the methods and techniques that can be used to assess the attributes of the model, and the actions and strategies that help prevent and mitigate quality problems. An analysis of how these features are supported by the state of the art further identifies open issues and informs an outlook on hot future research directions.},

The assurance of their protection is crucial, as their reliance on information technology is a continuing challenge for both security experts and chief executives. As risk assessment could be a necessary process in an organization, one of its deliverables could be utilized in addressing threats and thus facilitate the development of a security strategy. Given the large number of heterogeneous methods and risk assessment tools that exist, comparison criteria can provide better understanding of their options and characteristics and facilitate the selection of a method that best fits an organization's needs. This article aims to address the problem of selecting an appropriate risk assessment method to assess and manage information security risks, by proposing a set of comparison criteria, grouped into four categories. Based upon them, it provides a comparison of the 10 popular risk assessment methods that could be utilized by organizations to determine the method that is more suitable for their needs. Finally, a case study is presented to demonstrate the selection of a method based on the proposed criteria.},

abstract = {The need to design an optimally distributed database is increasingly important with the growth of information technology and computer networks. However, designing a distributed database is an extremely complex process due to a large number of geographically distributed sites and database relations. Moreover, decreasing communication costs and query response time should be taken into consideration. There are three main techniques applied to design a distributed database, namely Fragmentation, Data allocation, and Replication. It is notable that these techniques are often treated separately and rarely processed together. Some available allocation methods are applied regardless of how the fragmentation technique is performed or replication process is adopted. In contrast, other fragmentation techniques do not consider the allocation or the replication techniques. Therefore, the first and foremost step for designing an optimal database is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the current fragmentation, replication, and allocation techniques and their disadvantages. This article presents an attempt to fulfill this step by proposing a comprehensive taxonomy of the available fragmentation and allocation techniques in distributed database design. The article also discusses some case studies of these techniques for a deeper understanding of its achievements and limitations.},

abstract = {Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) will pave the way for a new era of underwater monitoring and actuation applications. The envisioned landscape of UWSN applications will help us learn more about our oceans, as well as about what lies beneath them. They are expected to change the current reality where no more than 5% of the volume of the oceans has been observed by humans. However, to enable large deployments of UWSNs, networking solutions toward efficient and reliable underwater data collection need to be investigated and proposed. In this context, the use of topology control algorithms for a suitable, autonomous, and on-the-fly organization of the UWSN topology might mitigate the undesired effects of underwater wireless communications and consequently improve the performance of networking services and protocols designed for UWSNs. This article presents and discusses the intrinsic properties, potentials, and current research challenges of topology control in underwater sensor networks. We propose to classify topology control algorithms based on the principal methodology used to change the network topology. They can be categorized in three major groups: power control, wireless interface mode management, and mobility assisted–based techniques. Using the proposed classification, we survey the current state of the art and present an in-depth discussion of topology control solutions designed for UWSNs.},

Most research efforts in HPC cloud aim to understand the cost benefit of moving resource-intensive applications from on-premise environments to public cloud platforms. Industry trends show that hybrid environments are the natural path to get the best of the on-premise and cloud resources—steady (and sensitive) workloads can run on on-premise resources and peak demand can leverage remote resources in a pay-as-you-go manner. Nevertheless, there are plenty of questions to be answered in HPC cloud, which range from how to extract the best performance of an unknown underlying platform to what services are essential to make its usage easier. Moreover, the discussion on the right pricing and contractual models to fit small and large users is relevant for the sustainability of HPC clouds. This article brings a survey and taxonomy of efforts in HPC cloud and a vision on what we believe is ahead of us, including a set of research challenges that, once tackled, can help advance businesses and scientific discoveries. This becomes particularly relevant due to the fast increasing wave of new HPC applications coming from big data and artificial intelligence.},

In this article, we will focus on reporting how experiments that used eye-trackers in programming research are conducted, and the information that can be collected from these experiments. In this mapping study, we identify and report on 63 studies, published between 1990 and June 2017, collected and gathered via manual search on digital libraries and databases related to computer science and computer engineering. Among the five main areas of research interest are program comprehension and debugging, which received an increased interest in recent years, non-code comprehension, collaborative programming, and requirements traceability research, which had the fewest number of publications due to possible limitations of the eye-tracking technology in this type of experiments. We find that most of the participants in these studies were students and faculty members from institutions of higher learning, and while they performed programming tasks on a range of programming languages and programming representations, we find Java language and Unified Modeling Language (UML) representation to be the most used materials. We also report on a range of eye-trackers and attention tracking tools that have been utilized, and find Tobii eye-trackers to be the most used devices by researchers.},

However, little attention has been given to its potential for tackling the communication bottleneck that remains one of the looming challenges to be tackled for efficient parallelism. This article explores the potential benefits of approximate computing for communication reduction by surveying three promising techniques for approximate communication: compression, relaxed synchronization, and value prediction. The techniques are compared based on an evaluation framework composed of communication cost reduction, performance, energy reduction, applicability, overheads, and output degradation. Comparison results demonstrate that lossy link compression and approximate value prediction show great promise for reducing the communication bottleneck in bandwidth-constrained applications. Meanwhile, relaxed synchronization is found to provide large speedups for select error-tolerant applications, but suffers from limited general applicability and unreliable output degradation guarantees. Finally, this article concludes with several suggestions for future research on approximate communication techniques.},

In areas such as scientific experiments, social networks management, credit card fraud detection, targeted advertisement, and financial analysis, massive amounts of information are generated and processed daily to extract valuable, summarized information. Due to its fast development cycle (i.e., less expensive to develop), mainly because of automatic memory management, and rich community resources, managed object-oriented programming languages (e.g., Java) are the first choice to develop Big Data platforms (e.g., Cassandra, Spark) on which such Big Data applications are executed.However, automatic memory management comes at a cost. This cost is introduced by the garbage collector, which is responsible for collecting objects that are no longer being used. Although current (classic) garbage collection algorithms may be applicable to small-scale applications, these algorithms are not appropriate for large-scale Big Data environments, as they do not scale in terms of throughput and pause times.In this work, current Big Data platforms and their memory profiles are studied to understand why classic algorithms (which are still the most commonly used) are not appropriate, and also to analyze recently proposed and relevant memory management algorithms, targeted to Big Data environments. The scalability of recent memory management algorithms is characterized in terms of throughput (improves the throughput of the application) and pause time (reduces the latency of the application) when compared to classic algorithms. The study is concluded by presenting a taxonomy of the described works and some open problems, with regard to Big Data memory management, that could be addressed in future works.},

abstract = {The use of robots in our daily lives is increasing. Different types of robots perform different tasks that are too dangerous or too dull to be done by humans. These sophisticated machines are susceptible to different types of faults. These faults have to be detected and diagnosed in time to allow recovery and continuous operation. The field of Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) has been studied for many years. This research has given birth to many approaches and techniques that are applicable to different types of physical machines. Yet the domain of robotics poses unique requirements that are very challenging for traditional FDD approaches. The study of FDD for robotics is relatively new, and only few surveys were presented. These surveys have focused on traditional FDD approaches and how these approaches may broadly apply to a generic type of robot. Yet robotic systems can be identified by fundamental characteristics, which pose different constraints and requirements from FDD. In this article, we aim to provide the reader with useful insights regarding the use of FDD approaches that best suit the different characteristics of robotic systems. We elaborate on the advantages these approaches have and the challenges they must face. To meet this aim, we use two perspectives: (1) we elaborate on FDD from the perspective of the different characteristics a robotic system may have and give examples of successful FDD approaches, and (2) we elaborate on FDD from the perspective of the different FDD approaches and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each approach with respect to robotic systems. Finally, we describe research opportunities for robotic systems’ FDD. With these three contributions, readers from the FDD research communities are introduced to FDD for robotic systems, and the robotics research community is introduced to the field of FDD.},

abstract = {Because of the widespread adoption of GPS-enabled devices, such as smartphones and GPS navigation devices, more and more location information is being collected and available. Compared with traditional ones (e.g., Amazon, Taobao, and Dangdang), recommender systems built on location-based social networks (LBSNs) have received much attention. The former mine users’ preferences through the relationship between users and items, e.g., online commodity, movies and music. The latter add location information as a new dimension to the former, hence resulting in a three-dimensional relationship among users, locations, and activities. In this article, we summarize LBSN recommender systems from the perspective of such a relationship. User, activity, and location are called objects, and recommender objectives are formed and achieved by mining and using such 3D relationships. From the perspective of the 3D relationship among these objects, we summarize the state-of-the-art of LBSN recommender systems to fulfill the related objectives. We finally indicate some future research directions in this area.},

abstract = {Software deficiencies are minimized by utilizing recommended software development and quality assurance practices. However, these recommended practices (i.e., quality practices) become ineffective if software professionals purposefully ignore them. Conducting a systematic literature review (n = 4,838), we discovered that only a small number of previous studies, within software engineering and information systems literature, have investigated the omission of quality practices. These studies explain the omission of quality practices mainly as a result of organizational decisions and trade-offs made under resource constraints or market pressure. However, our study indicates that different aspects of this phenomenon deserve further research. In particular, future research must investigate the conditions triggering the omission of quality practices and the processes through which this phenomenon occurs. Especially, since software development is a human-centric phenomenon, the psychological and behavioral aspects of this process deserve in-depth empirical investigation. In addition, futures research must clarify the social, organizational, and economical consequences of ignoring quality practices. Gaining in-depth theoretically sound and empirically grounded understandings about different aspects of this phenomenon enables research and practice to suggest interventions to overcome this issue.},

In this survey, we concentrate exclusively on automatically gathering such datasets, which we refer to as sensing the behavior of pedestrians. We roughly distinguish two approaches: one that requires users to explicitly use local applications and wearables, and one that scans the presence of handheld devices such as smartphones. We come to the conclusion that despite the numerous reports in popular media, relatively few groups have been looking into practical solutions for sensing pedestrian behavior. Moreover, we find that much work is still needed, in particular when it comes to combining privacy, transparency, scalability, and ease of deployment. We report on over 90 relevant articles and discuss and compare in detail 30 reports on sensing pedestrian behavior.},

abstract = {Modern cloud computing environments support a relatively high degree of automation in service provisioning, which allows cloud service customers (CSCs) to dynamically acquire services required for deploying cloud applications. Cloud modeling languages (CMLs) have been proposed to address the diversity of features provided by cloud computing environments and support different application scenarios, such as migrating existing applications to the cloud, developing new cloud applications, or optimizing them. There is, however, still much debate in the research community on what a CML is, and what aspects of a cloud application and its target cloud computing environment should be modeled by a CML. Furthermore, the distinction between CMLs on a fine-grain level exposing their modeling concepts is rarely made. In this article, we investigate the diverse features currently provided by existing CMLs. We classify and compare them according to a common framework with the goal to support CSCs in selecting the CML that fits the needs of their application scenario and setting. As a result, not only features of existing CMLs are pointed out for which extensive support is already provided but also in which existing CMLs are deficient, thereby suggesting a research agenda.},

Based on a pay-per-use model, a client without enough computational power can easily outsource large-scale computational tasks to a cloud. Nonetheless, the issue of security and privacy becomes a major concern when the customer’s sensitive or confidential data is not processed in a fully trusted cloud environment. Recently, a number of publications have been proposed to investigate and design specific secure outsourcing schemes for different computational tasks. The aim of this survey is to systemize and present the cutting-edge technologies in this area. It starts by presenting security threats and requirements, followed with other factors that should be considered when constructing secure computation outsourcing schemes. In an organized way, we then dwell on the existing secure outsourcing solutions to different computational tasks such as matrix computations, mathematical optimization, and so on, treating data confidentiality as well as computation integrity. Finally, we provide a discussion of the literature and a list of open challenges in the area.},

Many variants of these techniques have started to make an impact in a wide range of applications, including robot navigation and augmented reality. However, despite some remarkable results in these areas, most SfM and visual SLAM techniques operate based on the assumption that the observed environment is static. However, when faced with moving objects, overall system accuracy can be jeopardized. In this article, we present for the first time a survey of visual SLAM and SfM techniques that are targeted toward operation in dynamic environments. We identify three main problems: how to perform reconstruction (robust visual SLAM), how to segment and track dynamic objects, and how to achieve joint motion segmentation and reconstruction. Based on this categorization, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of existing approaches. Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of each solution class are critically discussed from the perspective of practicality and robustness.},

abstract = {Several research studies have shown that complex networks modeling real-world phenomena are characterized by striking properties: (i) they are organized according to community structure, and (ii) their structure evolves with time. Many researchers have worked on methods that can efficiently unveil substructures in complex networks, giving birth to the field of community discovery. A novel and fascinating problem started capturing researcher interest recently: the identification of evolving communities. Dynamic networks can be used to model the evolution of a system: nodes and edges are mutable, and their presence, or absence, deeply impacts the community structure that composes them.This survey aims to present the distinctive features and challenges of dynamic community discovery and propose a classification of published approaches. As a “user manual,” this work organizes state-of-the-art methodologies into a taxonomy, based on their rationale, and their specific instantiation. Given a definition of network dynamics, desired community characteristics, and analytical needs, this survey will support researchers to identify the set of approaches that best fit their needs. The proposed classification could also help researchers choose in which direction to orient their future research.},

abstract = {Traffic load in any 802.11 infrastructure mode network is typically distributed unevenly between access points (APs), creating hotspots. This is due to the inherent nature of wireless area networks (WLANs), where stations are free to associate to any known AP they desire, and the lack of control by the APs themselves. This imbalance creates a condition where affected APs in the network suffer traffic congestion while others are underutilized, leading to stations experiencing lower throughput, longer latency, and operating below the network potential capacity. To alleviate this problem, some form of load balancing is required to redistribute the work load among other available APs in the wireless network. This article presents a survey of the various works done in performing load balancing in an infrastructure mode wireless network and will cover the common methods including admission control, association management, cell breathing, and association control. Updates to the IEEE standards are also presented that support load-balancing efforts. Finally, software-defined networks are investigated to determine the extent of control integration to support managing and load-balancing WLANs. Trends in load-balancing research are also uncovered that indicate how the introduction of new wireless standards influences the amount of research.},

In this article, we introduce and discuss two types of rumours that circulate on social media: long-standing rumours that circulate for long periods of time, and newly emerging rumours spawned during fast-paced events such as breaking news, where reports are released piecemeal and often with an unverified status in their early stages. We provide an overview of research into social media rumours with the ultimate goal of developing a rumour classification system that consists of four components: rumour detection, rumour tracking, rumour stance classification, and rumour veracity classification. We delve into the approaches presented in the scientific literature for the development of each of these four components. We summarise the efforts and achievements so far toward the development of rumour classification systems and conclude with suggestions for avenues for future research in social media mining for the detection and resolution of rumours.},

abstract = {While cloud computing has brought paradigm shifts to computing services, researchers and developers have also found some problems inherent to its nature such as bandwidth bottleneck, communication overhead, and location blindness. The concept of fog/edge computing is therefore coined to extend the services from the core in cloud data centers to the edge of the network. In recent years, many systems are proposed to better serve ubiquitous smart devices closer to the user. This article provides a complete and up-to-date review of edge-oriented computing systems by encapsulating relevant proposals on their architecture features, management approaches, and design objectives.},

abstract = {Recent demands for storing and querying big data have revealed various shortcomings of traditional relational database systems. This, in turn, has led to the emergence of a new kind of complementary nonrelational data store, named as NoSQL. This survey mainly aims at elucidating the design decisions of NoSQL stores with regard to the four nonorthogonal design principles of distributed database systems: data model, consistency model, data partitioning, and the CAP theorem. For each principle, its available strategies and corresponding features, strengths, and drawbacks are explained. Furthermore, various implementations of each strategy are exemplified and crystallized through a collection of representative academic and industrial NoSQL technologies. Finally, we disclose some existing challenges in developing effective NoSQL stores, which need attention of the research community, application designers, and architects.},

abstract = {Networks represent relationships between entities in many complex systems, spanning from online social interactions to biological cell development and brain connectivity. In many cases, relationships between entities are unambiguously known: are two users “friends” in a social network? Do two researchers collaborate on a published article? Do two road segments in a transportation system intersect? These are directly observable in the system in question. In most cases, relationships between nodes are not directly observable and must be inferred: Does one gene regulate the expression of another? Do two animals who physically co-locate have a social bond? Who infected whom in a disease outbreak in a population?Existing approaches for inferring networks from data are found across many application domains and use specialized knowledge to infer and measure the quality of inferred network for a specific task or hypothesis. However, current research lacks a rigorous methodology that employs standard statistical validation on inferred models. In this survey, we examine (1) how network representations are constructed from underlying data, (2) the variety of questions and tasks on these representations over several domains, and (3) validation strategies for measuring the inferred network’s capability of answering questions on the system of interest.},

abstract = {Activities of a clinical staff in healthcare environments must regularly be adapted to new treatment methods, medications, and technologies. This constant evolution requires the monitoring of the workflow, or the sequence of actions from actors involved in a procedure, to ensure quality of medical services. In this context, recent advances in sensing technologies, including Real-time Location Systems and Computer Vision, enable high-precision tracking of actors and equipment. The current state-of-the-art about healthcare workflow monitoring typically focuses on a single technology and does not discuss its integration with others. Such an integration can lead to better solutions to evaluate medical workflows. This study aims to fill the gap regarding the analysis of monitoring technologies with a systematic literature review about sensors for capturing the workflow of healthcare environments. Its main scientific contribution is to identify both current technologies used to track activities in a clinical environment and gaps on their combination to achieve better results. It also proposes a taxonomy to classify work regarding sensing technologies and methods. The literature review does not present proposals that combine data obtained from Real-time Location Systems and Computer Vision sensors. Further analysis shows that a multimodal analysis is more flexible and could yield better results.},

abstract = {Pilot-Job systems play an important role in supporting distributed scientific computing. They are used to execute millions of jobs on several cyberinfrastructures worldwide, consuming billions of CPU hours a year. With the increasing importance of task-level parallelism in high-performance computing, Pilot-Job systems are also witnessing an adoption beyond traditional domains. Notwithstanding the growing impact on scientific research, there is no agreement on a definition of Pilot-Job system and no clear understanding of the underlying abstraction and paradigm. Pilot-Job implementations have proliferated with no shared best practices or open interfaces and little interoperability. Ultimately, this is hindering the realization of the full impact of Pilot-Jobs by limiting their robustness, portability, and maintainability. This article offers a comprehensive analysis of Pilot-Job systems critically assessing their motivations, evolution, properties, and implementation. The three main contributions of this article are as follows: (1) an analysis of the motivations and evolution of Pilot-Job systems; (2) an outline of the Pilot abstraction, its distinguishing logical components and functionalities, its terminology, and its architecture pattern; and (3) the description of core and auxiliary properties of Pilot-Jobs systems and the analysis of six exemplar Pilot-Job implementations. Together, these contributions illustrate the Pilot paradigm, its generality, and how it helps to address some challenges in distributed scientific computing.},

Automatic expression recognition tolerant to partial occlusion remains less understood, particularly in real-world scenarios. In recent years, efforts investigating techniques to handle partial occlusion for FEA have seen an increase. The context is right for a comprehensive perspective of these developments and the state of the art from this perspective. This survey provides such a comprehensive review of recent advances in dataset creation, algorithm development, and investigations of the effects of occlusion critical for robust performance in FEA systems. It outlines existing challenges in overcoming partial occlusion and discusses possible opportunities in advancing the technology.

abstract = {Contemporary mobile devices are the result of an evolution process, during which computational and networking capabilities have been continuously pushed to keep pace with the constantly growing workload requirements. This has allowed devices such as smartphones, tablets, and personal digital assistants to perform increasingly complex tasks, up to the point of efficiently replacing traditional options such as desktop computers and notebooks. However, due to their portability and size, these devices are more prone to theft, to become compromised, or to be exploited for attacks and other malicious activity. The need for investigation of the aforementioned incidents resulted in the creation of the Mobile Forensics (MF) discipline. MF, a sub-domain of digital forensics, is specialized in extracting and processing evidence from mobile devices in such a way that attacking entities and actions are identified and traced. Beyond its primary research interest on evidence acquisition from mobile devices, MF has recently expanded its scope to encompass the organized and advanced evidence representation and analysis of future malicious entity behavior. Nonetheless, data acquisition still remains its main focus. While the field is under continuous research activity, new concepts such as the involvement of cloud computing in the MF ecosystem and the evolution of enterprise mobile solutions—particularly mobile device management and bring your own device—bring new opportunities and issues to the discipline. The current article presents the research conducted within the MF ecosystem during the last 7 years, identifies the gaps, and highlights the differences from past research directions, and addresses challenges and open issues in the field.},

Although several studies have been published about this subject, articles of reviews covering this topic usually focus only on specific domains. This article presents a systematic mapping aiming at providing a broad, albeit critical, overview of the literature in the topic of test data generation using genetic algorithms. The selected studies were categorized by software testing technique (structural, functional, or mutation testing) for which test data were generated and according to the most significantly adapted genetic algorithms aspects. The most used evaluation metrics and software testing techniques were identified. The results showed that genetic algorithms have been successfully applied to simple test data generation, but are rarely used to generate complex test data such as images, videos, sounds, and 3D (three-dimensional) models. From these results, we discuss some challenges and opportunities for research in this area.},

MDS is an exploratory and multivariate data analysis technique becoming more and more popular. MDS is one of the multivariate data analysis techniques, which tries to represent the higher dimensional data into lower space. The input data for MDS analysis is measured by the dissimilarity or similarity of the objects under observation. Once the MDS technique is applied to the measured dissimilarity or similarity, MDS results in a spatial map. In the spatial map, the dissimilar objects are far apart while objects which are similar are placed close to each other. In this survey article, MDS is described in comprehensive fashion by explaining the basic notions of classical MDS and how MDS can be helpful to analyze the multidimensional data. Later on, various special models based on MDS are described in a more mathematical way followed by comparisons of various MDS techniques.},

abstract = {Many security and software testing applications require checking whether certain properties of a program hold for any possible usage scenario. For instance, a tool for identifying software vulnerabilities may need to rule out the existence of any backdoor to bypass a program’s authentication. One approach would be to test the program using different, possibly random inputs. As the backdoor may only be hit for very specific program workloads, automated exploration of the space of possible inputs is of the essence. Symbolic execution provides an elegant solution to the problem, by systematically exploring many possible execution paths at the same time without necessarily requiring concrete inputs. Rather than taking on fully specified input values, the technique abstractly represents them as symbols, resorting to constraint solvers to construct actual instances that would cause property violations. Symbolic execution has been incubated in dozens of tools developed over the past four decades, leading to major practical breakthroughs in a number of prominent software reliability applications. The goal of this survey is to provide an overview of the main ideas, challenges, and solutions developed in the area, distilling them for a broad audience.},

abstract = {Modeling and simulation techniques are today extensively used both in industry and science. Parts of larger systems are, however, typically modeled and simulated by different techniques, tools, and algorithms. In addition, experts from different disciplines use various modeling and simulation techniques. Both these facts make it difficult to study coupled heterogeneous systems.Co-simulation is an emerging enabling technique, where global simulation of a coupled system can be achieved by composing the simulations of its parts. Due to its potential and interdisciplinary nature, co-simulation is being studied in different disciplines but with limited sharing of findings.In this survey, we study and survey the state-of-the-art techniques for co-simulation, with the goal of enhancing future research and highlighting the main challenges.To study this broad topic, we start by focusing on discrete-event-based co-simulation, followed by continuous-time-based co-simulation. Finally, we explore the interactions between these two paradigms, in hybrid co-simulation.To survey the current techniques, tools, and research challenges, we systematically classify recently published research literature on co-simulation, and summarize it into a taxonomy. As a result, we identify the need for finding generic approaches for modular, stable, and accurate coupling of simulation units, as well as expressing the adaptations required to ensure that the coupling is correct.},

This functionality brings the increasing popularity of location-based services in business as well as daily applications such as navigation, targeted advertising, and location-based social networking. Continuous spatial queries serve as a building block for location-based services. As an example, an Uber driver may want to be kept aware of the nearest customers or service stations. Continuous spatial queries require updates to the query result as the query or data objects are moving. This poses challenges to the query efficiency, which is crucial to the user experience of a service. A large number of approaches address this efficiency issue using the concept of safe region. A safe region is a region within which arbitrary movement of an object leaves the query result unchanged. Such a region helps reduce the frequency of query result update and hence improves query efficiency. As a result, safe region-based approaches have been popular for processing various types of continuous spatial queries. Safe regions have interesting theoretical properties and are worth in-depth analysis. We provide a comparative study of safe region-based approaches. We describe how safe regions are computed for different types of continuous spatial queries, showing how they improve query efficiency. We compare the different safe region-based approaches and discuss possible further improvements.},

With the advent of computational experiments (modeled as scientific workflows) and Scientific Workflow Management Systems, produced and consumed data, as well as the provenance of a given experiment, are automatically managed, so provenance capturing and storing in such a context is no longer a major concern. Similarly to several existing big data problems, the bottom line is now on how to analyze the large amounts of provenance data generated by workflow executions and how to be able to extract useful knowledge of this data. In this context, this article surveys the current state of the art on provenance analytics by presenting the key initiatives that have been taken to support provenance data analysis. We also contribute by proposing a taxonomy to classify elements related to provenance analytics.},

Such a behavior offers the foundation for achieving elasticity in a modern cloud computing paradigm. Given the dynamic and uncertain nature of the shared cloud infrastructure, the cloud autoscaling system has been engineered as one of the most complex, sophisticated, and intelligent artifacts created by humans, aiming to achieve self-aware, self-adaptive, and dependable runtime scaling. Yet the existing Self-aware and Self-adaptive Cloud Autoscaling System (SSCAS) is not at a state where it can be reliably exploited in the cloud. In this article, we survey the state-of-the-art research studies on SSCAS and provide a comprehensive taxonomy for this field. We present detailed analysis of the results and provide insights on open challenges, as well as the promising directions that are worth investigated in the future work of this area of research.

In this way, privacy metrics contribute to improving user privacy in the digital world. The diversity and complexity of privacy metrics in the literature make an informed choice of metrics challenging. As a result, instead of using existing metrics, new metrics are proposed frequently, and privacy studies are often incomparable. In this survey, we alleviate these problems by structuring the landscape of privacy metrics. To this end, we explain and discuss a selection of over 80 privacy metrics and introduce categorizations based on the aspect of privacy they measure, their required inputs, and the type of data that needs protection. In addition, we present a method on how to choose privacy metrics based on nine questions that help identify the right privacy metrics for a given scenario, and highlight topics where additional work on privacy metrics is needed. Our survey spans multiple privacy domains and can be understood as a general framework for privacy measurement.},

A large percentage of this growing dataset exists in the form of linked data, more generally, graphs, and of unprecedented sizes. While today's data from social networks contain hundreds of millions of nodes connected by billions of edges, inter-connected data from globally distributed sensors that forms the Internet of Things can cause this to grow exponentially larger. Although analyzing these large graphs is critical for the companies and governments that own them, big data tools designed for text and tuple analysis such as MapReduce cannot process them efficiently. So, graph distributed processing abstractions and systems are developed to design iterative graph algorithms and process large graphs with better performance and scalability. These graph frameworks propose novel methods or extend previous methods for processing graph data. In this article, we propose a taxonomy of graph processing systems and map existing systems to this classification. This captures the diversity in programming and computation models, runtime aspects of partitioning and communication, both for in-memory and distributed frameworks. Our effort helps to highlight key distinctions in architectural approaches, and identifies gaps for future research in scalable graph systems.},

As this information has to be extracted from the contents of the music, it is known as content-based music information retrieval (CB-MIR). In the past two decades, several research outcomes have been observed in the area of CB-MIR. There is a need to consolidate and critically analyze these research findings to evolve future research directions. In this survey article, various tasks of CB-MIR and their applications are critically reviewed. In particular, the article focuses on eight MIR-related tasks such as vocal/non-vocal segmentation, artist identification, genre classification, raga identification, query-by-humming, emotion recognition, instrument recognition, and music clip annotation. The fundamental concepts of Indian classical music are detailed to attract future research on this topic. The article elaborates on the signal-processing techniques to extract useful features for performing specific tasks mentioned above and discusses their strengths as well as weaknesses. This article also points to some general research issues in CB-MIR and probable approaches toward their solutions so as to improve the efficiency of the existing CB-MIR systems.},

This warrants a thorough systematization of the approaches and a careful review of the advantages and limitations of every group.In this article, we perform such an analysis. To achieve this goal, we present the necessary background knowledge on DNS and malicious activities leveraging DNS. We describe a general framework of malicious domain detection techniques using DNS data. Applying this framework, we categorize existing approaches using several orthogonal viewpoints, namely (1) sources of DNS data and their enrichment, (2) data analysis methods, and (3) evaluation strategies and metrics. In each aspect, we discuss the important challenges that the research community should address in order to fully realize the power of DNS data analysis to fight against attacks leveraging malicious domains.},

abstract = {Reproducibility is widely considered to be an essential requirement of the scientific process. However, a number of serious concerns have been raised recently, questioning whether today’s computational work is adequately reproducible. In principle, it should be possible to specify a computation to sufficient detail that anyone should be able to reproduce it exactly. But in practice, there are fundamental, technical, and social barriers to doing so. The many objectives and meanings of reproducibility are discussed within the context of scientific computing. Technical barriers to reproducibility are described, extant approaches surveyed, and open areas of research are identified.},

abstract = {The gap is widening between the processor clock speed of end-system architectures and network throughput capabilities. It is now physically possible to provide single-flow throughput of speeds up to 100&nbsp;Gbps, and 400&nbsp;Gbps will soon be possible. Most current research into high-speed data networking focuses on managing expanding network capabilities within datacenter Local Area Networks (LANs) or efficiently multiplexing millions of relatively small flows through a Wide Area Network (WAN). However, datacenter hyper-convergence places high-throughput networking workloads on general-purpose hardware, and distributed High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications require time-sensitive, high-throughput end-to-end flows (also referred to as “elephant flows”) to occur over WANs. For these applications, the bottleneck is often the end-system and not the intervening network. Since the problem of the end-system bottleneck was uncovered, many techniques have been developed which address this mismatch with varying degrees of effectiveness. In this survey, we describe the most promising techniques, beginning with network architectures and NIC design, continuing with operating and end-system architectures, and concluding with clean-slate protocol design.},

abstract = {Legacy encryption systems depend on sharing a key (public or private) among the peers involved in exchanging an encrypted message. However, this approach poses privacy concerns. The users or service providers with the key have exclusive rights on the data. Especially with popular cloud services, control over the privacy of the sensitive data is lost. Even when the keys are not shared, the encrypted material is shared with a third party that does not necessarily need to access the content. Moreover, untrusted servers, providers, and cloud operators can keep identifying elements of users long after users end the relationship with the services. Indeed, Homomorphic Encryption (HE), a special kind of encryption scheme, can address these concerns as it allows any third party to operate on the encrypted data without decrypting it in advance. Although this extremely useful feature of the HE scheme has been known for over 30 years, the first plausible and achievable Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme, which allows any computable function to perform on the encrypted data, was introduced by Craig Gentry in 2009. Even though this was a major achievement, different implementations so far demonstrated that FHE still needs to be improved significantly to be practical on every platform. Therefore, this survey focuses on HE and FHE schemes. First, we present the basics of HE and the details of the well-known Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) and Somewhat Homomorphic Encryption (SWHE), which are important pillars for achieving FHE. Then, the main FHE families, which have become the base for the other follow-up FHE schemes, are presented. Furthermore, the implementations and recent improvements in Gentry-type FHE schemes are also surveyed. Finally, further research directions are discussed. This survey is intended to give a clear knowledge and foundation to researchers and practitioners interested in knowing, applying, and extending the state-of-the-art HE, PHE, SWHE, and FHE systems.},

These physical entities generate a large amount of data in operation, and as the IoT gains momentum in terms of deployment, the combined scale of those data seems destined to continue to grow. Increasingly, applications for the IoT involve analytics. Data analytics is the process of deriving knowledge from data, generating value like actionable insights from them. This article reviews work in the IoT and big data analytics from the perspective of their utility in creating efficient, effective, and innovative applications and services for a wide spectrum of domains. We review the broad vision for the IoT as it is shaped in various communities, examine the application of data analytics across IoT domains, provide a categorisation of analytic approaches, and propose a layered taxonomy from IoT data to analytics. This taxonomy provides us with insights on the appropriateness of analytical techniques, which in turn shapes a survey of enabling technology and infrastructure for IoT analytics. Finally, we look at some tradeoffs for analytics in the IoT that can shape future research.},

To shed light on this topic, we introduce a comprehensive classification of existing solutions and survey the current application of deception techniques in computer security. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of existing solutions, and we analyze several open research directions, including the design of strategies to help defenders to design and integrate deception within a target architecture, the study of automated ways to deploy deception in complex systems, the update and re-deployment of deception, and, most importantly, the design of new techniques and experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of the existing deception techniques.},

This has motivated the development of large-sized independent ontologies within the same or different domains with some overlapping information among them. To integrate such large ontologies, automatic matchers become an inevitable solution. However, the process of matching large ontologies has high space and time complexities. Therefore, for a tool to efficiently and accurately match these large ontologies within the limited computing resources, it must have techniques that can significantly reduce the high space and time complexities associated with the ontology matching process. This article provides a review of the state-of-the-art techniques being applied by ontology matching tools to achieve scalability and produce high-quality mappings when matching large ontologies. In addition, we provide a direct comparison of the techniques to gauge their effectiveness in achieving scalability. A review of the state-of-the-art ontology matching tools that employ each strategy is also provided. We also evaluate the state-of-the-art tools to gauge the progress they have made over the years in improving alignment’s quality and reduction of execution time when matching large ontologies.},

The applications in which black box decision systems can be used are various, and each approach is typically developed to provide a solution for a specific problem and, as a consequence, it explicitly or implicitly delineates its own definition of interpretability and explanation. The aim of this article is to provide a classification of the main problems addressed in the literature with respect to the notion of explanation and the type of black box system. Given a problem definition, a black box type, and a desired explanation, this survey should help the researcher to find the proposals more useful for his own work. The proposed classification of approaches to open black box models should also be useful for putting the many research open questions in perspective.},

The large amount of network traffic that needs to be analyzed, in addition to the increase in attacks’ sophistication, renders the optimization of intrusion detection an important requirement for infrastructure security, and a very active research subject. In the state of the art, a number of approaches have been proposed to improve the efficiency of intrusion detection and response systems. In this article, we review the works relying on decision-making techniques focused on game theory and Markov decision processes to analyze the interactions between the attacker and the defender, and classify them according to the type of the optimization problem they address. While these works provide valuable insights for decision-making, we discuss the limitations of these solutions as a whole, in particular regarding the hypotheses in the models and the validation methods. We also propose future research directions to improve the integration of game-theoretic approaches into IDS optimization techniques.},

In this article, various studies proposed by the authors have been analysed focusing on test cases generation and their approach toward web application. A detailed study was conducted on Regression Test Case Generation and its approaches toward web application. From our detailed study, we have found that very few approaches and methodologies have been found that provide the real tool for test case generation. There is a need of an automated regression testing tool to generate the regression test cases directly based on user requirements. These test cases have to be generated and implemented by the tool so that the reduction in the overall effort and cost can be achieved.

abstract = {Recognizing people by their gait has become more and more popular nowadays due to the following reasons. First, gait recognition can work well remotely. Second, gait recognition can be done from low-resolution videos and with simple instrumentation. Third, gait recognition can be done without the cooperation of individuals. Fourth, gait recognition can work well while other features such as faces and fingerprints are hidden. Finally, gait features are typically difficult to be impersonated.Recent ubiquity of smartphones that capture gait patterns through accelerometers and gyroscope and advances in machine learning have opened new research directions and applications in gait recognition. A timely survey that addresses current advances is missing.In this article, we survey research works in gait recognition. In addition to recognition based on video, we address new modalities, such as recognition based on floor sensors, radars, and accelerometers; new approaches that include machine learning methods; and examine challenges and vulnerabilities in this field. In addition, we propose a set of future research directions. Our review reveals the current state-of-art and can be helpful to both experts and newcomers of gait recognition. Moreover, it lists future works and publicly available databases in gait recognition for researchers.},

abstract = {Stress is a major concern in daily life, as it imposes significant and growing health and economic costs on society every year. Stress and driving are a dangerous combination and can lead to life-threatening situations, evidenced by the large number of road traffic crashes that occur every year due to driver stress. In addition, the rate of general health issues caused by work-related chronic stress in drivers who work in public and private transport is greater than in many other occupational groups. An in-vehicle warning system for driver stress levels is needed to continuously predict dangerous driving situations and proactively alert drivers to ensure safe and comfortable driving. As a result of the recent developments in ambient intelligence, such as sensing technologies, pervasive devices, context recognition, and communications, driver stress can be automatically detected using multimodal measurements. This critical review investigates the state of the art of techniques and achievements for automatic driver stress level detection based on multimodal sensors and data. In this work, the most widely used data followed by frequent and highly performed selected features to detect driver stress levels are analyzed and presented. This review also discusses key methodological issues and gaps that hinder the implementation of driver stress detection systems and offers insights into future research directions.},

It supports a generic graph-based data model and data representation format for describing things, including their relationships with other things. As the size of RDF datasets is growing fast, RDF data management systems must be able to cope with growing amounts of data. Even though physically handling RDF data using a relational table is possible, querying a giant triple table becomes very expensive because of the multiple nested joins required for answering graph queries. In addition, the heterogeneity of RDF Data poses entirely new challenges to database systems. This article provides a comprehensive study of the state of the art in handling and querying RDF data. In particular, we focus on data storage techniques, indexing strategies, and query execution mechanisms. Moreover, we provide a classification of existing systems and approaches. We also provide an overview of the various benchmarking efforts in this context and discuss some of the open problems in this domain.},

abstract = {The field of machine learning is witnessing its golden era as deep learning slowly becomes the leader in this domain. Deep learning uses multiple layers to represent the abstractions of data to build computational models. Some key enabler deep learning algorithms such as generative adversarial networks, convolutional neural networks, and model transfers have completely changed our perception of information processing. However, there exists an aperture of understanding behind this tremendously fast-paced domain, because it was never previously represented from a multiscope perspective. The lack of core understanding renders these powerful methods as black-box machines that inhibit development at a fundamental level. Moreover, deep learning has repeatedly been perceived as a silver bullet to all stumbling blocks in machine learning, which is far from the truth. This article presents a comprehensive review of historical and recent state-of-the-art approaches in visual, audio, and text processing; social network analysis; and natural language processing, followed by the in-depth analysis on pivoting and groundbreaking advances in deep learning applications. It was also undertaken to review the issues faced in deep learning such as unsupervised learning, black-box models, and online learning and to illustrate how these challenges can be transformed into prolific future research avenues.},

abstract = {Since the mid-1990s, researchers have been trying to use machine-learning-based approaches to solve a number of different compiler optimization problems. These techniques primarily enhance the quality of the obtained results and, more importantly, make it feasible to tackle two main compiler optimization problems: optimization selection (choosing which optimizations to apply) and phase-ordering (choosing the order of applying optimizations). The compiler optimization space continues to grow due to the advancement of applications, increasing number of compiler optimizations, and new target architectures. Generic optimization passes in compilers cannot fully leverage newly introduced optimizations and, therefore, cannot keep up with the pace of increasing options. This survey summarizes and classifies the recent advances in using machine learning for the compiler optimization field, particularly on the two major problems of (1) selecting the best optimizations, and (2) the phase-ordering of optimizations. The survey highlights the approaches taken so far, the obtained results, the fine-grain classification among different approaches, and finally, the influential papers of the field.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional data are increasingly prevalent across biomedical and social domains. Notable examples are gene-sample-time, individual-feature-time, or node-node-time data, generally referred to as observation-attribute-context data. The unsupervised analysis of three-dimensional data can be pursued to discover putative biological modules, disease progression profiles, and communities of individuals with coherent behavior, among other patterns of interest. It is thus key to enhance the understanding of complex biological, individual, and societal systems. In this context, although clustering can be applied to group observations, its relevance is limited since observations in three-dimensional data domains are typically only meaningfully correlated on subspaces of the overall space. Biclustering tackles this challenge but disregards the third dimension. In this scenario, triclustering—the discovery of coherent subspaces within three-dimensional data—has been largely researched to tackle these problems. Despite the diversity of contributions in this field, there still lacks a structured view on the major requirements of triclustering, desirable forms of homogeneity (including coherency, structure, quality, locality, and orthonormality criteria), and algorithmic approaches. This work formalizes the triclustering task and its scope, introduces a taxonomy to categorize the contributions in the field, provides a comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art triclustering algorithms according to their behavior and output, and lists relevant real-world applications. Finally, it highlights challenges and opportunities to advance the field of triclustering and its applicability to complex three-dimensional data analysis.},

Moreover, the tutorial describes how to identify the best configuration for neural network training and learning such for tasks, besides presenting an easy way to generate and acquire training data. We do so by means of a general methodology, using complex network models adaptable to any application. We show that a regression model generated by the neural network successfully approximates the metric values and therefore is a robust, effective alternative in real-world applications.

Mobile cloud computing (MCC) offers a resource-rich environment to MDs for offloading compute-intensive tasks encountering resource scarcity challenges. However, users are unable to exploit its full potential owing to challenges of distance, limited bandwidth, and seamless connectivity between the remote cloud (RC) and MDs in the conventional MCC model. The cloudlet-based solution is widely used to address these challenges. The response of the cloudlet-based solution is faster than the conventional mobile cloud-computing model, rendering it suitable for the Internet of Things (IoT) and Smart Cities (SC). However, with the increase in devices and workloads, the cloudlet-based solution has to deal with resource-scarcity challenges, thus, forwarding the requests to remote clouds. This study has been carried out to provide an insight into existing cloudlet-based mobile augmentation (CtMA) approaches and highlights the underlying limitations for resource optimization. Furthermore, numerous performance parameters have been identified and their detailed comparative analysis has been used to quantify the efficiency of CtMA approaches.},

abstract = {In a contemporary data center, Linux applications often generate a large quantity of real-time system call traces, which are not suitable for traditional host-based intrusion detection systems deployed on every single host. Training data mining models with system calls on a single host that has static computing and storage capacity is time-consuming, and intermediate datasets are not capable of being efficiently handled. It is cumbersome for the maintenance and updating of host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) installed on every physical or virtual host, and comprehensive system call analysis can hardly be performed to detect complex and distributed attacks among multiple hosts. Considering these limitations of current system-call-based HIDS, in this article, we provide a review of the development of system-call-based HIDS and future research trends. Algorithms and techniques relevant to system-call-based HIDS are investigated, including feature extraction methods and various data mining algorithms. The HIDS dataset issues are discussed, including currently available datasets with system calls and approaches for researchers to generate new datasets. The application of system-call-based HIDS on current embedded systems is studied, and related works are investigated. Finally, future research trends are forecast regarding three aspects, namely, the reduction of the false-positive rate, the improvement of detection efficiency, and the enhancement of collaborative security.},

abstract = {Engaging users is a priority for designers of products and services of every kind. The need to understand users’ experiences has motivated a focus on user engagement across computer science. However, to date, there has been limited review of how Human--Computer Interaction and computer science research interprets and employs the concept. Questions persist concerning its conception, abstraction, and measurement. This article presents a systematic review of engagement spanning a corpus of 351 articles and 102 definitions. We map the current state of engagement research, including the diverse interpretation, theory, and measurement of the concept. We describe the ecology of engagement and strategies for the design of engaging experiences, discuss the value of the concept and its relationship to other terms, and present a set of guidelines and opportunities for future research.},

abstract = {Articular cartilage (AC) is a flexible and soft yet stiff tissue that can be visualized and interpreted using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for the assessment of knee osteoarthritis. Segmentation of AC from MR images is a challenging task that has been investigated widely. The development of computational methods to segment AC is highly dependent on various image parameters, quality, tissue structure, and acquisition protocol involved. This review focuses on the challenges faced during AC segmentation from MR images followed by the discussion on computational methods for semi/fully automated approaches, whilst performances parameters and their significances have also been explored. Furthermore, hybrid approaches used to segment AC are reviewed. This review indicates that despite the challenges in AC segmentation, the semi-automated method utilizing advanced computational methods such as active contour and clustering have shown significant accuracy. Fully automated AC segmentation methods have obtained moderate accuracy and show suitability for extensive clinical studies whilst advanced methods are being investigated that have led to achieving significantly better sensitivity. In conclusion, this review indicates that research in AC segmentation from MR images is moving towards the development of fully automated methods using advanced multi-level, multi-data, and multi-approach techniques to provide assistance in clinical studies.},

These ecosystems consider SCs as data production and sharing engines, setting new challenges for building effective SC architectures and novel services. The aim of this article is to “connect the pieces” among Data Science and SC domains, with a systematic literature review which identifies the core topics, services, and methods applied in SC data monitoring. The survey focuses on data harvesting and data mining processes over repeated SC data cycles. A survey protocol is followed to reach both quantitative and semantically important entities. The review results generate useful taxonomies for data scientists in the SC context, which offers clear guidelines for corresponding future works. In particular, a taxonomy is proposed for each of the main SC data entities, namely, the “D Taxonomy” for the data production, the “M Taxonomy” for data analytics methods, and the “S Taxonomy” for smart services. Each of these taxonomies clearly places entities in a classification which is beneficial for multiple stakeholders and for multiple domains in urban smartness targeting. Such indicative scenarios are outlined and conclusions are quite promising for systemizing.},

abstract = {The cloud-computing paradigm offers on-demand services over the Internet and supports a wide variety of applications. With the recent growth of Internet of Things (IoT)--based applications, the use of cloud services is increasing exponentially. The next generation of cloud computing must be energy efficient and sustainable to fulfill end-user requirements, which are changing dynamically. Presently, cloud providers are facing challenges to ensure the energy efficiency and sustainability of their services. The use of a large number of cloud datacenters increases cost as well as carbon footprints, which further affects the sustainability of cloud services. In this article, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of sustainable cloud computing. The taxonomy is used to investigate the existing techniques for sustainability that need careful attention and investigation as proposed by several academic and industry groups. The current research on sustainable cloud computing is organized into several categories: application design, sustainability metrics, capacity planning, energy management, virtualization, thermal-aware scheduling, cooling management, renewable energy, and waste heat utilization. The existing techniques have been compared and categorized based on common characteristics and properties. A conceptual model for sustainable cloud computing has been presented along with a discussion on future research directions.},

abstract = {Bayesian (machine) learning has been playing a significant role in machine learning for a long time due to its particular ability to embrace uncertainty, encode prior knowledge, and endow interpretability. On the back of Bayesian learning’s great success, Bayesian nonparametric learning (BNL) has emerged as a force for further advances in this field due to its greater modelling flexibility and representation power. Instead of playing with the fixed-dimensional probabilistic distributions of Bayesian learning, BNL creates a new “game” with infinite-dimensional stochastic processes. BNL has long been recognised as a research subject in statistics, and, to date, several state-of-the-art pilot studies have demonstrated that BNL has a great deal of potential to solve real-world machine-learning tasks. However, despite these promising results, BNL has not created a huge wave in the machine-learning community. Esotericism may account for this. The books and surveys on BNL written by statisticians are overcomplicated and filled with tedious theories and proofs. Each is certainly meaningful but may scare away new researchers, especially those with computer science backgrounds. Hence, the aim of this article is to provide a plain-spoken, yet comprehensive, theoretical survey of BNL in terms that researchers in the machine-learning community can understand. It is hoped this survey will serve as a starting point for understanding and exploiting the benefits of BNL in our current scholarly endeavours. To achieve this goal, we have collated the extant studies in this field and aligned them with the steps of a standard BNL procedure—from selecting the appropriate stochastic processes through manipulation to executing the model inference algorithms. At each step, past efforts have been thoroughly summarised and discussed. In addition, we have reviewed the common methods for implementing BNL in various machine-learning tasks along with its diverse applications in the real world as examples to motivate future studies.},

It provides attractive features, such as an on-demand model, scalability enhancement, and management cost reduction. However, cloud computing systems continue to face problems such as hardware failures, overloads caused by unexpected workloads, or the waste of energy due to inefficient resource utilization, which all result in resource shortages and application issues such as delays or saturation. A paradigm, the brownout, has been applied to handle these issues by adaptively activating or deactivating optional parts of applications or services to manage resource usage in cloud computing system. Brownout has successfully shown that it can avoid overloads due to changes in workload and achieve better load balancing and energy saving effects. This article proposes a taxonomy of the brownout approach for managing resources and applications adaptively in cloud computing systems and carries out a comprehensive survey. It identifies open challenges and offers future research directions.},

This article surveys e application layer communication protocols to fulfill the IoT communication requirements, and their potential for implementation in fog- and cloud-based IoT systems. To this end, the article first briefly presents potential protocol candidates, including request-reply and publish-subscribe protocols. After that, the article surveys these protocols based on their main characteristics, as well as the main performance issues, including latency, energy consumption, and network throughput. These findings are thereafter used to place the protocols in each segment of the system (IoT, fog, cloud), and thus opens up the discussion on their choice, interoperability, and wider system integration. The survey is expected to be useful to system architects and protocol designers when choosing the communication protocols in an integrated IoT-to-fog-to-cloud system architecture.},

abstract = {Due to decelerating gains in single-core CPU performance, computationally expensive simulations are increasingly executed on highly parallel hardware platforms. Agent-based simulations, where simulated entities act with a certain degree of autonomy, frequently provide ample opportunities for parallelisation. Thus, a vast variety of approaches proposed in the literature demonstrated considerable performance gains using hardware platforms such as many-core CPUs and GPUs, merged CPU-GPU chips as well as Field Programmable Gate Arrays. Typically, a combination of techniques is required to achieve high performance for a given simulation model, putting substantial burden on modellers. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic overview of techniques for agent-based simulations on hardware accelerators has been given in the literature. To close this gap, we provide an overview and categorisation of the literature according to the applied techniques. Since, at the current state of research, challenges such as the partitioning of a model for execution on heterogeneous hardware are still addressed in a largely manual process, we sketch directions for future research towards automating the hardware mapping and execution. This survey targets modellers seeking an overview of suitable hardware platforms and execution techniques for a specific simulation model, as well as methodology researchers interested in potential research gaps requiring further exploration.},

The survey systematically analyses the literature to identify and classify approaches to realise cloud brokerage, presenting an understanding of the state-of-the-art and a novel taxonomy to characterise cloud brokers. Method—A systematic literature survey was conducted to compile studies related to cloud brokerage and explore how cloud brokers are engineered. These studies are then analysed from multiple perspectives, such as motivation, functionality, engineering approach, and evaluation methodology. Results—The survey resulted in a knowledge base of current proposals for realising cloud brokers. The survey identified differences between the studies’ implementations, with engineering efforts directed at combinations of market-based solutions, middlewares, toolkits, algorithms, semantic frameworks, and conceptual frameworks. Conclusion—Our comprehensive meta-analysis shows that cloud brokerage is still a formative field.

Lattice-based cryptography is a promising post-quantum cryptography family, both in terms of foundational properties as well as in its application to both traditional and emerging security problems such as encryption, digital signature, key exchange, and homomorphic encryption. While such techniques provide guarantees, in theory, their realization on contemporary computing platforms requires careful design choices and tradeoffs to manage both the diversity of computing platforms (e.g., high-performance to resource constrained), as well as the agility for deployment in the face of emerging and changing standards. In this work, we survey trends in lattice-based cryptographic schemes, some recent fundamental proposals for the use of lattices in computer security, challenges for their implementation in software and hardware, and emerging needs for their adoption.

In recent years, the Semantic Web has been perceived as a potential enabling technology to overcome interoperability issues in the Internet of Things (IoT), especially for service discovery and composition. Despite the importance of making vocabulary terms discoverable and selecting the most suitable ones in forthcoming IoT applications, no state-of-the-art survey of tools achieving such recommendation tasks exists to date. This survey covers this gap by specifying an extensive evaluation framework and assessing linked vocabulary recommendation tools. Furthermore, we discuss challenges and opportunities of vocabulary recommendation and related tools in the context of emerging IoT ecosystems. Overall, 40 recommendation tools for linked vocabularies were evaluated, both empirically and experimentally. Some of the key findings include that (i) many tools neglect to thoroughly address both the curation of a vocabulary collection and effective selection mechanisms, (ii) modern information retrieval techniques are underrepresented, and (iii) the reviewed tools that emerged from Semantic Web use cases are not yet sufficiently extended to fit today’s IoT projects.},

TrustZone is a System-on-Chip and CPU system-wide security solution, available on today’s Arm application processors and present in the new generation Arm microcontrollers, which are expected to dominate the market of smart “things.” Although this technology has remained relatively underground since its inception in 2004, over the past years, numerous initiatives have significantly advanced the state of the art involving Arm TrustZone. Motivated by this revival of interest, this paper presents an in-depth study of TrustZone technology. We provide a comprehensive survey of relevant work from academia and industry, presenting existing systems into two main areas, namely, Trusted Execution Environments and hardware-assisted virtualization. Furthermore, we analyze the most relevant weaknesses of existing systems and propose new research directions within the realm of tiniest devices and the Internet of Things, which we believe to have potential to yield high-impact contributions in the future.},

abstract = {People who design, use, and are affected by autonomous artificially intelligent agents want to be able to trust such agents—that is, to know that these agents will perform correctly, to understand the reasoning behind their actions, and to know how to use them appropriately. Many techniques have been devised to assess and influence human trust in artificially intelligent agents. However, these approaches are typically ad hoc and have not been formally related to each other or to formal trust models. This article presents a survey of algorithmic assurances, i.e., programmed components of agent operation that are expressly designed to calibrate user trust in artificially intelligent agents. Algorithmic assurances are first formally defined and classified from the perspective of formally modeled human-artificially intelligent agent trust relationships. Building on these definitions, a synthesis of research across communities such as machine learning, human-computer interaction, robotics, e-commerce, and others reveals that assurance algorithms naturally fall along a spectrum in terms of their impact on an agent’s core functionality, with seven notable classes ranging from integral assurances (which impact an agent’s core functionality) to supplemental assurances (which have no direct effect on agent performance). Common approaches within each of these classes are identified and discussed; benefits and drawbacks of different approaches are also investigated.},

abstract = {Handwritten signatures are biometric traits at the center of debate in the scientific community. Over the last 40 years, the interest in signature studies has grown steadily, having as its main reference the application of automatic signature verification, as previously published reviews in 1989, 2000, and 2008 bear witness. Ever since, and over the last 10 years, the application of handwritten signature technology has strongly evolved and much research has focused on the possibility of applying systems based on handwritten signature analysis and processing to a multitude of new fields. After several years of haphazard growth of this research area, it is time to assess its current developments for their applicability in order to draw a structured way forward. This perspective reports a systematic review of the last 10 years of the literature on handwritten signatures with respect to the new scenario, focusing on the most promising domains of research and trying to elicit possible future research directions in this subject.},

This systematic review analyzes the approaches to the synthesis of facial expressions in photographs, as well as important aspects of the synthesis process, such as preprocessing techniques, databases, and evaluation metrics. Forty-eight studies from three different scientific databases were analyzed. From these studies, we established an overview of the process, including all the stages used to synthesize expressions in facial images. We also analyze important aspects involved in these stages such as methods and techniques of each stage, databases, and evaluation metrics. We observed that machine learning approaches are the most widely used to synthesize expressions. Landmark identification, deformation, mapping, fusion, and training are common tasks considered in the approaches. We also found that few studies used metrics to evaluate the results, and most studies used public databases. Although the studies analyzed generated consistent and realistic results while preserving the identity of the subject, there are still research themes to be exploited.},

Owing to flexibility in cloud services, numerous organizations are shifting their business to the cloud and service providers are establishing more data centers to provide services to users. However, it is essential to provide cost-effective execution of tasks and proper utilization of resources. Several techniques have been reported in the literature to improve performance and resource use based on load balancing, task scheduling, resource management, quality of service, and workload management. Load balancing in the cloud allows data centers to avoid overloading/underloading in virtual machines, which itself is a challenge in the field of cloud computing. Therefore, it becomes a necessity for developers and researchers to design and implement a suitable load balancer for parallel and distributed cloud environments.

NFV and SDN are complementary technologies capable of providing one network solution. SDN can provide connectivity between Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) in a flexible and automated way, whereas NFV can use SDN as part of a service function chain. There are many studies designing NFV/SDN architectures in different environments. Researchers have been trying to address reliability, performance, and scalability problems using different architectural designs. This Systematic Literature Review (SLR) focuses on integrated NFV/SDN architectures, with the following goals: (i) to investigate and provide an in-depth review of the state of the art of NFV/SDN architectures, (ii) to synthesize their architectural designs, and (iii) to identify areas for further improvements. Broadly, this SLR will encourage researchers to advance the current stage of development (i.e., the state of the practice) of integrated NFV/SDN architectures and shed some light on future research efforts and the challenges faced.},

abstract = {Various system metrics have been proposed for measuring the quality of computer-based systems, such as dependability and security metrics for estimating their performance and security characteristics. As computer-based systems grow in complexity with many subsystems or components, measuring their quality in multiple dimensions is a challenging task. In this work, we tackle the problem of measuring the quality of computer-based systems based on the four key attributes of trustworthiness we developed: security, trust, resilience, and agility. In addition to conducting a systematic survey on metrics, measurements, attributes of metrics, and associated ontologies, we propose a system-level trustworthiness metric framework that accommodates four submetrics, called STRAM (<u>S</u>ecurity, <u>T</u>rust, <u>R</u>esilience, and <u>A</u>gility <u>M</u>etrics). The proposed STRAM framework offers a hierarchical ontology structure where each submetric is defined as a sub-ontology. Moreover, this work proposes developing and incorporating metrics describing key assessment tools, including vulnerability assessment, risk assessment, and red teaming, to provide additional evidence in the measurement and quality of trustworthy systems. We further discuss how assessment tools are related to measuring the quality of computer-based systems and the limitations of the state-of-the-art metrics and measurements. Finally, we suggest future research directions for system-level metrics research toward measuring fundamental attributes of the quality of computer-based systems and improving the current metric and measurement methodologies.},

The communication is developed as a result of neural responses generated in the brain because of motor movements or cognitive activities. The means of communication here includes muscular and non-muscular actions. These actions generate brain activities or brain waves that are directed to a hardware device to perform a specific task. BCI initially was developed as the communication device for patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders. Owing to recent advancements in BCI devices—such as passive electrodes, wireless headsets, adaptive software, and decreased costs—it is also being used for developing communication between the general public. The BCI device records brain responses using various invasive and non-invasive acquisition techniques such as electrocorticography (ECoG), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this article, a survey on these techniques has been provided. The brain response needs to be translated using machine learning and pattern recognition methods to control any application. A brief review of various existing feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms applied on data recorded from the brain has been included in this article. A significant comparative analysis of popular existing BCI techniques is presented and possible future directives are provided.},

abstract = {Power management for data centers has been extensively studied in the past 10 years. Most research has focused on owner-operated data centers with less focus on Multi-Tenant Data Centers (MTDC) or colocation data centers. In an MTDC, an operator owns the building and leases out space, power, and cooling to tenants to install their own IT equipment. MTDC’s present new challenges for data center power management due to an inherent lack of coordination between the operator and tenants. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive survey of existing MTDC power management techniques for demand response programs, sustainability, and/or power hierarchy oversubscription. Power oversubscription is of particular interest, as it can maximize resource utilization, increase operator profit, and reduce tenant costs. We create a taxonomy to classify and compare key works. Our taxonomy and review differ from existing works in that our emphasis is on safe power oversubscription, which has been neglected in previous surveys. We propose future research for prediction and control of power overload events in an oversubscribed MTDC.},

abstract = {Cross-Cloud Federation (CCF) is beneficial for heterogeneous Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) for leasing additional resources from each other. Despite the benefits of on-demand scalability and enhanced service footprints for better service quality, the adoption of CCF is however mainly hindered due to the lack of a comprehensive trust model. The basic aim of such a model should be to address the security and performance concerns of a home CSP on its foreign peers before placing its users’ data and applications in their premises. A transitivity of users’ trust on home CSP and home CSP's trust on its foreign CSPs marks the uniqueness of trust paradigm in CCF. Addressing the concerns of cloud-to-cloud trust paradigm is inevitable to achieve users’ trust in a federation. Various trust models have been proposed in literature for conventional and multi-cloud computing environments. They focus on user requirements but none on federation perspective. Their applicability to CCF for addressing the concerns of cloud-to-cloud trust paradigm requires further consideration. For this reason, we have first outlined the general characteristics of CCF as being dynamic, multi-level and heterogeneous. Afterwards, cloud-to-cloud trust paradigm is proposed based on a set of unique principles identified as (i) trust bi-directionality, (ii) trust composition, (iii) delegation control, and (iv) Resource awareness. An insightful review of Trust Management Systems (TMS) proposed in literature reveals their shortcomings in addressing the requirements of cloud-to-cloud trust paradigm. To overcome these shortcomings, we suggest that some challenges can be merely addressed by aligning the existing methods to the nature of CCF. The remaining challenges require entirely new mechanisms to be introduced. A demonstration of this concept is presented in the form of a requirement matrix suggesting how the characteristics and properties of both CCF and the TMS are influenced by each other. This requirement matrix reveals the potential avenues of research for a TMS aimed specifically for CCF.},

abstract = {The unabated increase in the complexity of the hardware and software components of modern embedded real-time systems has given momentum to a host of research in the use of probabilistic and statistical techniques for timing analysis. In the last few years, that front of investigation has yielded a body of scientific literature vast enough to warrant some comprehensive taxonomy of motivations, strategies of application, and directions of research. This survey addresses this very need, singling out the principal techniques in the state of the art of timing analysis that employ probabilistic reasoning at some level, building a taxonomy of them, discussing their relative merit and limitations, and the relations among them. In addition to offering a comprehensive foundation to savvy probabilistic timing analysis, this article also identifies the key challenges to be addressed to consolidate the scientific soundness and industrial viability of this emerging field.},

abstract = {Mobile devices supporting the “Internet of Things” often have limited capabilities in computation, battery energy, and storage space, especially to support resource-intensive applications involving virtual reality, augmented reality, multimedia delivery, and artificial intelligence, which could require broad bandwidth, low response latency, and large computational power. Edge cloud or edge computing is an emerging topic and a technology that can tackle the deficiencies of the currently centralized-only cloud computing model and move the computation and storage resources closer to the devices in support of the above-mentioned applications. To make this happen, efficient coordination mechanisms and “offloading” algorithms are needed to allow mobile devices and the edge cloud to work together smoothly. In this survey article, we investigate the key issues, methods, and various state-of-the-art efforts related to the offloading problem. We adopt a new characterizing model to study the whole process of offloading from mobile devices to the edge cloud. Through comprehensive discussions, we aim to draw an overall “big picture” on the existing efforts and research directions. Our study also indicates that the offloading algorithms in the edge cloud have demonstrated profound potentials for future technology and application development.},

In this article, we discuss the details of GANs for those readers who are familiar with, but do not comprehend GANs deeply or who wish to view GANs from various perspectives. In addition, we explain how GANs operates and the fundamental meaning of various objective functions that have been suggested recently. We then focus on how the GAN can be combined with an autoencoder framework.

abstract = {Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) has been extensively explored to be applied as a vital tool to enhance the capabilities of mobile devices, increasing computing power, expanding storage capacity, and prolonging battery life. Offloading works as the fundamental feature that enables MCC to relieve task load and extend data storage through an accessible cloud resource pool. Several initiatives have drawn attention to delivering MCC-supported energy-oriented offloading as a method to cope with a lately steep increase in the number of rich mobile applications and the enduring limitations of battery technologies. However, MCC offloading relieves only the burden of energy consumption of mobile devices; performance concerns about Cloud resources, in most cases, are not considered when dynamically allocating them for dealing with mobile tasks. The application context of MCC, encompassing urban computing, aggravates the situation with very large-scale scenarios, posing as a challenge for achieving greener solutions in the scope of Cloud resources. Thus, this article gathers and analyzes recent energy-aware offloading protocols and architectures, as well as scheduling and balancing algorithms employed toward Cloud green computing. This survey provides a comparison among system architectures by identifying their most notable advantages and disadvantages. The existing enabling frameworks are categorized and compared based on the stage of the task offloading process and resource management types, describing current open challenges and future research directions.},

abstract = {Several mathematical frameworks have been used to model the information retrieval (IR) process, among them, formal logics. Logic-based IR models upgrade the IR process from document-query comparison to an inference process, in which both documents and queries are expressed as sentences of the selected formal logic. The underlying formal logic also permits one to represent and integrate knowledge in the IR process. One of the main obstacles that has prevented the adoption and large-scale diffusion of logic-based IR systems is their complexity. However, several logic-based IR models have been recently proposed that are applicable to large-scale data collections. In this survey, we present an overview of the most prominent logical IR models that have been proposed in the literature. The considered logical models are categorized under different axes, which include the considered logics and the way in which uncertainty has been modeled, for example, degrees of belief or degrees of truth. Accordingly, the main contribution of the article is to categorize the state-of-the-art logical models on a fine-grained basis, and for the considered models the related implementation aspects are described. Consequently, the proposed survey is finalized to better understand and compare the different logical IR models. Last, but not least, this article aims at reconsidering the potentials of logical approaches to IR by outlining the advances of logic-based approaches in close research areas.},

However, Linux has been developed as a general-purpose operating system, followed by several approaches to introduce actual real-time capabilities in the kernel. Among these, the PREEMPT_RT patch, developed by the kernel maintainers, has the goal to increase the predictability and reduce the latencies of the kernel directly modifying the existent kernel code. This article aims at providing a survey of the state-of-the-art approaches for building real-time Linux-based systems, with a focus on PREEMPT_RT, its evolution, and the challenges that should be addressed in order to move PREEMPT_RT one step ahead.

One of the main challenges in this context is the presence of instances whose event outcomes become unobservable after a certain time point or when some instances do not experience any event during the monitoring period. This so-called censoring can be handled most effectively using survival analysis techniques. Traditionally, statistical approaches have been widely developed in the literature to overcome the issue of censoring. In addition, many machine learning algorithms have been adapted to deal with such censored data and tackle other challenging problems that arise in real-world data. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured review of the statistical methods typically used and the machine learning techniques developed for survival analysis, along with a detailed taxonomy of the existing methods. We also discuss several topics that are closely related to survival analysis and describe several successful applications in a variety of real-world application domains.

Redundant multithreading (RMT) makes use of parallelism in modern systems by employing thread-level time redundancy for fault detection and recovery. RMT can detect faults by running identical copies of the program as separate threads in parallel execution units with identical inputs and comparing their outputs. In this article, we present a survey of RMT implementations at different architectural levels with several design considerations. We explain the implementations in seminal papers and their extensions and discuss the design choices employed by the techniques. We review both hardware and software approaches by presenting the main characteristics and analyze the studies with different design choices regarding their strengths and weaknesses. We also present a classification to help potential users find a suitable method for their requirement and to guide researchers planning to work on this area by providing insights into the future trend.},

abstract = {Understanding visual interestingness is a challenging task addressed by researchers in various disciplines ranging from humanities and psychology to, more recently, computer vision and multimedia. The rise of infographics and the visual information overload that we are facing today have given this task a crucial importance. Automatic systems are increasingly needed to help users navigate through the growing amount of visual information available, either on the web or our personal devices, for instance by selecting relevant and interesting content. Previous studies indicate that visual interest is highly related to concepts like arousal, unusualness, or complexity, where these connections are found based on psychological theories, user studies, or computational approaches. However, the link between visual interestingness and other related concepts has been only partially explored so far, for example, by considering only a limited subset of covariates at a time. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on visual interestingness and related concepts, aiming to bring together works based on different approaches, highlighting controversies, and identifying links that have not been fully investigated yet. Finally, we present some open questions that may be addressed in future works. Our work aims to support researchers interested in visual interestingness and related subjective or abstract concepts, providing an in-depth overlook at state-of-the-art theories in humanities and methods in computational approaches, as well as providing an extended list of datasets.},

abstract = {The use of machine learning (ML) in smart building applications is reviewed in this article. We split existing solutions into two main classes: occupant-centric versus energy/devices-centric. The first class groups solutions that use ML for aspects related to the occupants, including (1) occupancy estimation and identification, (2) activity recognition, and (3) estimating preferences and behavior. The second class groups solutions that use ML to estimate aspects related either to energy or devices. They are divided into three categories: (1) energy profiling and demand estimation, (2) appliances profiling and fault detection, and (3) inference on sensors. Solutions in each category are presented, discussed, and compared; open perspectives and research trends are discussed as well. Compared to related state-of-the-art survey papers, the contribution herein is to provide a comprehensive and holistic review from the ML perspectives rather than architectural and technical aspects of existing building management systems. This is by considering all types of ML tools, buildings, and several categories of applications, and by structuring the taxonomy accordingly. The article ends with a summary discussion of the presented works, with focus on lessons learned, challenges, open and future directions of research in this field.},

Among existing NSP mining algorithms, there are no general and systemic evaluation criteria available to assess them comprehensively. This article conducts a comprehensive technical review of existing NSA research. We explore and formalize a generic problem statement of NSA; investigate, compare, and consolidate the definitions of constraints and negative containment; and compare the working mechanisms and efficiency of existing NSP mining algorithms.

In this work, we propose structural taxonomy and novel categorization of research that contribute to the organization and disambiguation of insider threat incidents and the defense solutions used against them. The objective of our categorization is to systematize knowledge in insider threat research while using an existing grounded theory method for rigorous literature review. The proposed categorization depicts the workflow among particular categories that include incidents and datasets, analysis of incidents, simulations, and defense solutions. Special attention is paid to the definitions and taxonomies of the insider threat; we present a structural taxonomy of insider threat incidents that is based on existing taxonomies and the 5W1H questions of the information gathering problem. Our survey will enhance researchers’ efforts in the domain of insider threat because it provides (1) a novel structural taxonomy that contributes to orthogonal classification of incidents and defining the scope of defense solutions employed against them, (2) an overview on publicly available datasets that can be used to test new detection solutions against other works, (3) references of existing case studies and frameworks modeling insiders’ behaviors for the purpose of reviewing defense solutions or extending their coverage, and (4) a discussion of existing trends and further research directions that can be used for reasoning in the insider threat domain.},

In this article, a detailed study on DDoS threats prevalent in SDN is presented. First, SDN features are examined from the perspective of security, and then a discussion on SDN security features is done. Further, two viewpoints on protecting networks against DDoS attacks are presented. In the first view, SDN utilizes its abilities to secure conventional networks. In the second view, SDN may become a victim of the threat itself because of the centralized control mechanism. The main focus of this research work is on discovering critical security implications in SDN while reviewing the current ongoing research studies.

abstract = {The way people walk is a strong correlate of their identity. Several studies have shown that both humans and machines can recognize individuals just by their gait, given that proper measurements of the observed motion patterns are available. For surveillance applications, gait is also attractive, because it does not require active collaboration from users and is hard to fake. However, the acquisition of good-quality measures of a person’s motion patterns in unconstrained environments, (e.g., in person re-identification applications) has proved very challenging in practice. Existing technology (video cameras) suffer from changes in viewpoint, daylight, clothing, accessories, and other variations in the person’s appearance. Novel three-dimensional sensors are bringing new promises to the field, but still many research issues are open. This article presents a survey of the work done in gait analysis for re-identification in the past decade, looking at the main approaches, datasets, and evaluation methodologies. We identify several relevant dimensions of the problem and provide a taxonomic analysis of the current state of the art. Finally, we discuss the levels of performance achievable with the current technology and give a perspective of the most challenging and promising directions of research for the future.},

SP systems typically face intense and highly dynamic data streams. Parallelization and elasticity enable SP systems to process these streams with continuous high quality of service. The current research landscape provides a broad spectrum of methods for parallelization and elasticity in SP. Each method makes specific assumptions and focuses on particular aspects. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive overview and categorization of the state of the art in SP parallelization and elasticity, which is necessary to consolidate the state of the research and to plan future research directions on this basis.

Hence, it is a challenging rather impossible to easily make security solutions to work an integrated fashion. Security orchestration aims at smoothly integrating multivendor security tools that can effectively and efficiently interoperate to support security staff of a Security Operation Centre (SOC). Given the increasing role and importance of security orchestration, there has been an increasing amount of literature on different aspects of security orchestration solutions. However, there has been no effort to systematically review and analyze the reported solutions. We report a Multivocal Literature Review that has systematically selected and reviewed both academic and grey (blogs, web pages, white papers) literature on different aspects of security orchestration published from January 2007 until July 2017. The review has enabled us to provide a working definition of security orchestration and classify the main functionalities of security orchestration into three main areas—unification, orchestration, and automation. We have also identified the core components of a security orchestration platform and categorized the drivers of security orchestration based on technical and socio-technical aspects. We also provide a taxonomy of security orchestration based on the execution environment, automation strategy, deployment type, mode of task and resource type. This review has helped us to reveal several areas of further research and development in security orchestration.},

abstract = {In recent years, visual object tracking has become a very active research area. An increasing number of tracking algorithms are being proposed each year. It is because tracking has wide applications in various real-world problems such as human-computer interaction, autonomous vehicles, robotics, surveillance, and security just to name a few. In the current study, we review latest trends and advances in the tracking area and evaluate the robustness of different trackers based on the feature extraction methods. The first part of this work includes a comprehensive survey of the recently proposed trackers. We broadly categorize trackers into Correlation Filter based Trackers (CFTs) and Non-CFTs. Each category is further classified into various types based on the architecture and the tracking mechanism. In the second part of this work, we experimentally evaluated 24 recent trackers for robustness and compared handcrafted and deep feature based trackers. We observe that trackers using deep features performed better, though in some cases a fusion of both increased performance significantly. To overcome the drawbacks of the existing benchmarks, a new benchmark Object Tracking and Temple Color (OTTC) has also been proposed and used in the evaluation of different algorithms. We analyze the performance of trackers over 11 different challenges in OTTC and 3 other benchmarks. Our study concludes that Discriminative Correlation Filter (DCF) based trackers perform better than the others. Our study also reveals that inclusion of different types of regularizations over DCF often results in boosted tracking performance. Finally, we sum up our study by pointing out some insights and indicating future trends in the visual object tracking field.},

To bridge the gap, this article accordingly reviews and compares the key characteristics of modalities, contrasts the metrics used to evaluate system performance, and highlights the divergence in critical vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses for TBS and WBS. It further discusses how these factors affect the design considerations for WBS, the open challenges, and future directions of research in these areas. In doing so, the article provides a big-picture overview of the important avenues of challenges and potential solutions that researchers entering the field should be aware of.

abstract = {Anomaly detection has numerous applications in diverse fields. For example, it has been widely used for discovering network intrusions and malicious events. It has also been used in numerous other applications such as identifying medical malpractice or credit fraud. Detection of anomalies in quantitative data has received a considerable attention in the literature and has a venerable history. By contrast, and despite the widespread availability use of categorical data in practice, anomaly detection in categorical data has received relatively little attention as compared to quantitative data. This is because detection of anomalies in categorical data is a challenging problem. Some anomaly detection techniques depend on identifying a representative pattern then measuring distances between objects and this pattern. Objects that are far from this pattern are declared as anomalies. However, identifying patterns and measuring distances are not easy in categorical data compared with quantitative data. Fortunately, several papers focussing on the detection of anomalies in categorical data have been published in the recent literature. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of the research on the anomaly detection problem in categorical data. Previous review articles focus on either the statistics literature or the machine learning and computer science literature. This review article combines both literatures. We review 36 methods for the detection of anomalies in categorical data in both literatures and classify them into 12 different categories based on the conceptual definition of anomalies they use. For each approach, we survey anomaly detection methods, and then show the similarities and differences among them. We emphasize two important issues, the number of parameters each method requires and its time complexity. The first issue is critical, because the performance of these methods are sensitive to the choice of these parameters. The time complexity is also very important in real applications especially in big data applications. We report the time complexity if it is reported by the authors of the methods. If it is not, then we derive it ourselves and report it in this article. In addition, we discuss the common problems and the future directions of the anomaly detection in categorical data.},

Research has shown that custom hardware-based neural network accelerators can surpass their general-purpose processor equivalents in terms of both throughput and energy efficiency. Application-tailored accelerators, when co-designed with approximation-based network training methods, transform large, dense, and computationally expensive networks into small, sparse, and hardware-efficient alternatives, increasing the feasibility of network deployment. In this article, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of approximation methods for high-performance network inference along with in-depth discussion of their effectiveness for custom hardware implementation. We also include proposals for future research based on a thorough analysis of current trends.

A century later, in the smart era, the network to deliver services goes far beyond a single entity like electricity. Supplemented by a well-established Internet infrastructure that can run an endless number of applications, abundant processing and storage capabilities of clouds, resilient edge computing, and sophisticated data analysis like machine learning and deep learning, an already-booming Internet of Things movement makes this new era far more exciting.In this article, we present a multi-faceted survey of machine intelligence in modern implementations. We partition smart city infrastructure into application, sensing, communication, security, and data planes and put an emphasis on the data plane as the mainstay of computing and data storage. We investigate (i) a centralized and distributed implementation of data plane’s physical infrastructure and (ii) a complementary application of data analytics, machine learning, deep learning, and data visualization to implement robust machine intelligence in a smart city software core. We finalize our article with pointers to open issues and challenges.},

Vehicular nodes are capable of transporting, sensing, processing information, and wireless communication, which makes them more vulnerable to worm infections than conventional hosts. This survey provides an overview on worm spreading over VANETs. We first briefly introduce the computer worms. Then the V2X communication and applications are discussed from malware and worms propagation perspective to show the indispensability of studying the characteristics of worm propagating on VANETs. The recent literature on worm spreading and containment on VANETs are categorized based on their research methods. The improvements and limitations of the existing studies are discussed. Next, the main factors influencing worm spreading in vehicular networks are discussed followed by a summary of countermeasure strategies designed to deal with these worms.},

abstract = {Register allocation (mapping variables to processor registers or memory) and instruction scheduling (reordering instructions to increase instruction-level parallelism) are essential tasks for generating efficient assembly code in a compiler. In the past three decades, combinatorial optimization has emerged as an alternative to traditional, heuristic algorithms for these two tasks. Combinatorial optimization approaches can deliver optimal solutions according to a model, can precisely capture trade-offs between conflicting decisions, and are more flexible at the expense of increased compilation time.This article provides an exhaustive literature review and a classification of combinatorial optimization approaches to register allocation and instruction scheduling, with a focus on the techniques that are most applied in this context: integer programming, constraint programming, partitioned Boolean quadratic programming, and enumeration. Researchers in compilers and combinatorial optimization can benefit from identifying developments, trends, and challenges in the area; compiler practitioners may discern opportunities and grasp the potential benefit of applying combinatorial optimization.},

The number of communication rounds is one of the main concern for practical applications where the cardinality of group participants involved is considerable. It is critical to have fixed constant rounds in GKA protocols to secure these applications. In light of overwhelming variety and multitude of constant-round GKA protocols, this article surveys these protocols from a series of perspectives to supply better comprehension for researchers and scholars. Concretely, this article captures the state of the art of constant-round GKA protocols by analyzing the design rationale, examining the framework and security model, and evaluating all discussed protocols in terms of efficiency and security properties. In addition, this article discusses the extension of constant-round GKA protocols including dynamic membership updating, password-based, affiliation-hiding, and fault-tolerance.

abstract = {Scripts are widely used to design and run scientific experiments. Scripting languages are easy to learn and use, and they allow complex tasks to be specified and executed in fewer steps than with traditional programming languages. However, they also have important limitations for reproducibility and data management. As experiments are iteratively refined, it is challenging to reason about each experiment run (or trial), to keep track of the association between trials and experiment instances as well as the differences across trials, and to connect results to specific input data and parameters. Approaches have been proposed that address these limitations by collecting, managing, and analyzing the provenance of scripts. In this article, we survey the state of the art in provenance for scripts. We have identified the approaches by following an exhaustive protocol of forward and backward literature snowballing. Based on a detailed study, we propose a taxonomy and classify the approaches using this taxonomy.},

Recently, Channel State Information (CSI) measured by WiFi networks is widely used for different sensing purposes. To get a better understanding of existing WiFi sensing technologies and future WiFi sensing trends, this survey gives a comprehensive review of the signal processing techniques, algorithms, applications, and performance results of WiFi sensing with CSI. Different WiFi sensing algorithms and signal processing techniques have their own advantages and limitations and are suitable for different WiFi sensing applications. The survey groups CSI-based WiFi sensing applications into three categories, detection, recognition, and estimation, depending on whether the outputs are binary/multi-class classifications or numerical values. With the development and deployment of new WiFi technologies, there will be more WiFi sensing opportunities wherein the targets may go beyond from humans to environments, animals, and objects. The survey highlights three challenges for WiFi sensing: robustness and generalization, privacy and security, and coexistence of WiFi sensing and networking. Finally, the survey presents three future WiFi sensing trends, i.e., integrating cross-layer network information, multi-device cooperation, and fusion of different sensors, for enhancing existing WiFi sensing capabilities and enabling new WiFi sensing opportunities.},

This survey gives detailed insight into the development and state-of-the-art in binary rewriting by reviewing 67 publications from 1966 to 2018. Starting from these publications, we provide an in-depth investigation of the challenges and respective solutions to accomplish binary rewriting. Based on our findings, we establish a thorough categorization of binary rewriting approaches with respect to their use-case, applied analysis technique, code-transformation method, and code generation techniques. We contribute a comprehensive mapping between binary rewriting tools, applied techniques, and their domain of application. Our findings emphasize that although much work has been done over the past decades, most of the effort was put into improvements aiming at rewriting general purpose applications but ignoring other challenges like altering throughput-oriented programs or software with real-time requirements, which are often used in the emerging field of the Internet of Things. To the best of our knowledge, our survey is the first comprehensive overview on the complete binary rewriting process.},

In recent years, it is commonplace to notice the development of haptic, olfactory, and even gustatory displays to create more immersive experiences. Companies are proposing new additions to the multisensory world and are unveiling new products that promise to offer amazing experiences exploiting mulsemedia—multiple sensorial media—where users can perceive odors, tastes, and the sensation of wind blowing against their face. Whilst researchers, practitioners and users alike are faced with a wide range of such new devices, relatively little work has been undertaken to summarize efforts and initiatives in this area. The current article addresses this shortcoming in two ways: first, by presenting a survey of devices targeting senses beyond that of sight and hearing and, second, by describing an approach to guide newcomers and experienced practitioners alike to build their own mulsemedia environment, both in a desktop setting and in an immersive 360° environment.},

The goal of this article is to review various features of representing audio scenes and sound events and provide appropriate machine learning algorithms for audio surveillance tasks. Benchmark datasets are categorized based on the real-world scenarios of audio surveillance applications. To have a quantitative understanding, some of the state-of-the-art approaches are evaluated based on two benchmark datasets for audio scenes and sound event recognition tasks.

The fruitfulness of data prefetching is evident to both industry and academy: Nowadays, almost every high-performance processor incorporates a few data prefetchers for capturing various access patterns of applications; besides, there is a myriad of proposals for data prefetching in the research literature, where each proposal enhances the efficiency of prefetching in a specific way.In this survey, we evaluate the effectiveness of data prefetching in the context of server applications and shed light on its design trade-offs. To do so, we choose a target architecture based on a contemporary server processor and stack various state-of-the-art data prefetchers on top of it. We analyze the prefetchers in terms of their ability to predict memory accesses and enhance overall system performance, as well as their imposed overheads. Finally, by comparing the state-of-the-art prefetchers with impractical ideal prefetchers, we motivate further work on improving data prefetching techniques.},

abstract = {In the absence of any global positioning infrastructure for indoor environments, research on supporting human indoor localization and navigation trails decades behind research on outdoor localization and navigation. The major barrier to broader progress has been the dependency of indoor positioning on environment-specific infrastructure and resulting tailored technical solutions. Combined with the fragmentation and compartmentalization of indoor environments, this poses significant challenges to widespread adoption of indoor location-based services. This article puts aside all approaches of infrastructure-based support for human indoor localization and navigation and instead reviews technical concepts that are independent of sensors embedded in the environment. The reviewed concepts rely on a mobile computing platform with sensing capability and a human interaction interface (“smartphone”). This platform may or may not carry a stored map of the environment, but does not require in situ internet access. In this regard, the presented approaches are more challenging than any localization and navigation solutions specific to a particular, infrastructure-equipped indoor space, since they are not adapted to local context, and they may lack some of the accuracy achievable with those tailored solutions. However, only these approaches have the potential to be universally applicable.},

abstract = {Textual deception constitutes a major problem for online security. Many studies have argued that deceptiveness leaves traces in writing style, which could be detected using text classification techniques. By conducting an extensive literature review of existing empirical work, we demonstrate that while certain linguistic features have been indicative of deception in certain corpora, they fail to generalize across divergent semantic domains. We suggest that deceptiveness as such leaves no content-invariant stylistic trace, and textual similarity measures provide a superior means of classifying texts as potentially deceptive. Additionally, we discuss forms of deception beyond semantic content, focusing on hiding author identity by writing style obfuscation. Surveying the literature on both author identification and obfuscation techniques, we conclude that current style transformation methods fail to achieve reliable obfuscation while simultaneously ensuring semantic faithfulness to the original text. We propose that future work in style transformation should pay particular attention to disallowing semantically drastic changes.},

abstract = {Volunteer Computing is a kind of distributed computing that harnesses the aggregated spare computing resources of volunteer devices. It provides a cheaper and greener alternative computing infrastructure that can complement the dedicated, centralized, and expensive data centres. The aggregated idle computing resources of devices ranging from desktop computers to routers and smart TVs are being utilized to provide the much needed computing infrastructure for compute intensive tasks such as scientific simulations and big data analysis. However, the use of Volunteer Computing is still dominated by scientific applications and only a very small fraction of the potential volunteer nodes are participating. This article provides a comprehensive survey of Volunteer Computing, covering key technical and operational issues such as security, task distribution, resource management, and incentive models. The article also presents a taxonomy of Volunteer Computing systems, together with discussions of the characteristics of specific systems in each category. To harness the full potentials of Volunteer Computing and make it a reliable alternative computing infrastructure for general applications, we need to improve the existing techniques and device new mechanisms.

For this reason, many techniques of comparing them have been proposed in the last few decades.

Hence, a thorough understanding of state-of-the-art techniques remains limited and inconclusive. This article, therefore, focuses on providing a classification and a thematic analysis of studies on the comparison of software design models. We carried out a systematic mapping study following well-established guidelines to answer nine research questions. In total, 56 primary studies (out of 4,132) were selected from 10 widely recognized electronic databases after a careful filtering process. The main results are that a majority of the primary studies (1) provide coarse-grained techniques of the comparison of general-purpose diagrams, (2) adopt graphs as principal data structure and compare software design models considering structural properties only, (3) pinpoint commonalities and differences between software design models rather than assess their similarity, and (4) propose new techniques while neglecting the production of empirical knowledge from experimental studies.

abstract = {Blockchain offers an innovative approach to storing information, executing transactions, performing functions, and establishing trust in an open environment. Many consider blockchain as a technology breakthrough for cryptography and cybersecurity, with use cases ranging from globally deployed cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin, to smart contracts, smart grids over the Internet of Things, and so forth. Although blockchain has received growing interests in both academia and industry in the recent years, the security and privacy of blockchains continue to be at the center of the debate when deploying blockchain in different applications. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the security and privacy of blockchain. To facilitate the discussion, we first introduce the notion of blockchains and its utility in the context of Bitcoin-like online transactions. Then, we describe the basic security properties that are supported as the essential requirements and building blocks for Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency systems, followed by presenting the additional security and privacy properties that are desired in many blockchain applications. Finally, we review the security and privacy techniques for achieving these security properties in blockchain-based systems, including representative consensus algorithms, hash chained storage, mixing protocols, anonymous signatures, non-interactive zero-knowledge proof, and so forth. We conjecture that this survey can help readers to gain an in-depth understanding of the security and privacy of blockchain with respect to concept, attributes, techniques, and systems.},

Workflow scheduling in the cloud environment has been studied extensively over the years, and this article provides a comprehensive review of the approaches. This article analyses the characteristics of various workflow scheduling techniques and classifies them based on their objectives and execution model. In addition, the recent technological developments and paradigms such as serverless computing and Fog computing are creating new requirements/opportunities for workflow scheduling in a distributed environment. The serverless infrastructures are mainly designed for processing background tasks such as Internet-of-Things (IoT), web applications, or event-driven applications. To address the ever-increasing demands of resources and to overcome the drawbacks of the cloud-centric IoT, the Fog computing paradigm has been developed.

abstract = {Semantic annotation is a crucial part of achieving the vision of the Semantic Web and has long been a research topic among various communities. The most challenging problem in reaching the Semantic Web’s real potential is the gap between a large amount of unlabeled existing/new data and the limited annotation capability available. To resolve this problem, numerous works have been carried out to increase the degree of automation of semantic annotation from manual to semi-automatic to fully automatic. The richness of these works has been well-investigated by numerous surveys focusing on different aspects of the problem. However, a comprehensive survey targeting unsupervised approaches for semantic annotation is still missing and is urgently needed. To better understand the state-of-the-art of semantic annotation in the textual domain adopting unsupervised approaches, this article investigates existing literature and presents a survey to answer three research questions: (1) To what extent can semantic annotation be performed in a fully automatic manner by using an unsupervised way? (2) What kind of unsupervised approaches for semantic annotation already exist in literature? (3) What characteristics and relationships do these approaches have?In contrast to existing surveys, this article helps the reader get an insight into the state-of-art of semantic annotation using unsupervised approaches. While examining the literature, this article also addresses the inconsistency in the terminology used in the literature to describe the various semantic annotation tools’ degree of automation and provides more consistent terminology. Based on this, a uniform summary of the degree of automation of the many semantic annotation tools that were previously investigated can now be presented.},

The earliest research relies on computer vision, especially applied in video surveillance. More recently, the spread of wearable sensors, especially those embedded in mobile devices, has spurred a different research line. In fact, they are able to capture the dynamics of the walking pattern through simpler one-dimensional signals. This capture modality can avoid some problems related to computer vision-based techniques but suffers from specific limitations. Related research is still in a less advanced phase with respect to other biometric traits. However, many factors - the promising results achieved so far, the increasing accuracy of sensors, the ubiquitous presence of mobile devices, and the low cost of related techniques - contribute to making this biometrics attractive and suggest continuing investigating.

abstract = {Phase Change Memory (PCM) is an emerging memory technology that has the capability to address the growing demand for memory capacity and bridge the gap between the main memory and the secondary storage. As a resistive memory, PCM is able to store data based on its resistance values. The wide resistance range of PCM makes it possible to store even multiple bits per cell (MLC) rather than a single bit per cell (SLC). Unfortunately, PCM cells suffer from short lifetime. That means PCM cells could tolerate a limited number of write operations, and afterward they tend to permanently stick at a constant value.Limited lifetime is an issue related to PCM memory; hence, in recent years, many studies have been conducted to prolong PCM lifetime. These schemes have vast variety and are applied at different architectural levels. In this survey, we review the important works of such schemes to give insights to those starting to research on non-volatile memories (NVMs). These schemes are not limited to PCM and are applicable on other NVM technologies due to the similarities between them and the generality of lifetime-prolonging schemes.},

Advocates and engineers have recently proposed using defensive deception as a means to leverage the information asymmetry typically enjoyed by attackers as a tool for defenders. The term deception, however, has been employed broadly and with a variety of meanings. In this article, we survey 24 articles from 2008 to 2018 that use game theory to model defensive deception for cybersecurity and privacy. Then, we propose a taxonomy that defines six types of deception: perturbation, moving target defense, obfuscation, mixing, honey-x, and attacker engagement. These types are delineated by their information structures, agents, actions, and duration: precisely concepts captured by game theory. Our aims are to rigorously define types of defensive deception, to capture a snapshot of the state of the literature, to provide a menu of models that can be used for applied research, and to identify promising areas for future work. Our taxonomy provides a systematic foundation for understanding different types of defensive deception commonly encountered in cybersecurity and privacy.},

Unfortunately, sometimes there are real-world considerations that conflict with the goals of data mining; sometimes the privacy of the people being data mined needs to be considered. This necessitates that the output of data mining algorithms be modified to preserve privacy while simultaneously not ruining the predictive power of the outputted model. Differential privacy is a strong, enforceable definition of privacy that can be used in data mining algorithms, guaranteeing that nothing will be learned about the people in the data that could not already be discovered without their participation. In this survey, we focus on one particular data mining algorithm—decision trees—and how differential privacy interacts with each of the components that constitute decision tree algorithms. We analyze both greedy and random decision trees, and the conflicts that arise when trying to balance privacy requirements with the accuracy of the model.},

Many challenging computer vision tasks, such as detection, localization, recognition, and segmentation of objects in an unconstrained environment, are being efficiently addressed by various types of deep neural networks, such as convolutional neural networks, recurrent networks, adversarial networks, and autoencoders. Although there have been plenty of analytical studies regarding the object detection or recognition domain, many new deep learning techniques have surfaced with respect to image segmentation techniques. This article approaches these various deep learning techniques of image segmentation from an analytical perspective. The main goal of this work is to provide an intuitive understanding of the major techniques that have made a significant contribution to the image segmentation domain. Starting from some of the traditional image segmentation approaches, the article progresses by describing the effect that deep learning has had on the image segmentation domain. Thereafter, most of the major segmentation algorithms have been logically categorized with paragraphs dedicated to their unique contribution. With an ample amount of intuitive explanations, the reader is expected to have an improved ability to visualize the internal dynamics of these processes.},

Traditionally, energy efficiency research has focused on reducing energy consumption at the hardware level. Nevertheless, the software itself provides numerous opportunities for improving energy efficiency.Goal: Given that energy efficiency for it systems is a rising concern, we investigate existing work in the area of energy-aware software development and identify open research challenges. Our goal is to reveal limitations, features, and tradeoffs regarding energy-performance for software development and provide insights on existing approaches, tools, and techniques for energy-efficient programming.Method: We analyze and categorize research work mostly extracted from top-tier conferences and journals concerning energy efficiency across the software development lifecycle phases.Results: Our analysis shows that related work in this area has focused mainly on the implementation and verification phases of the software development lifecycle. Existing work shows that the use of parallel and approximate programming, source code analyzers, efficient data structures, coding practices, and specific programming languages can significantly increase energy efficiency. Moreover, the utilization of energy monitoring tools and benchmarks can provide insights for the software practitioners and raise energy-awareness during the development phase.},

abstract = {Attack trees are a well established and commonly used framework for security modeling. They provide a readable and structured representation of possible attacks against a system to protect. Their hierarchical structure reveals common features of the attacks and enables quantitative evaluation of security, thus highlighting the most severe vulnerabilities to focus on while implementing countermeasures. Since in real-life studies attack trees have a large number of nodes, their manual creation is a tedious and error-prone process, and their analysis is a computationally challenging task. During the last half decade, the attack tree community witnessed a growing interest in employing formal methods to deal with the aforementioned difficulties. We survey recent advances in graphical security modeling with focus on the application of formal methods to the interpretation, (semi-)automated creation, and quantitative analysis of attack trees and their extensions. We provide a unified description of existing frameworks, compare their features, and outline interesting open questions.},

However, IoT has also raised issues about the security and privacy of these digitally augmented spaces. Program analysis is crucial in identifying those issues, yet the application and scope of program analysis in IoT remains largely unexplored by the technical community. In this article, we study privacy and security issues in IoT that require program-analysis techniques with an emphasis on identified attacks against these systems and defenses implemented so far. Based on a study of five IoT programming platforms, we identify the key insights that result from research efforts in both the program analysis and security communities and relate the efficacy of program-analysis techniques to security and privacy issues. We conclude by studying recent IoT analysis systems and exploring their implementations. Through these explorations, we highlight key challenges and opportunities in calibrating for the environments in which IoT systems will be used.},

abstract = {The dynamic nature of the cloud environment has made the distributed resource management process a challenge for cloud service providers. The importance of maintaining quality of service in accordance with customer expectations and the highly dynamic nature of cloud-hosted applications add new levels of complexity to the process. Advances in big-data learning approaches have shifted conventional static capacity planning solutions to complex performance-aware resource management methods. It is shown that the process of decision-making for resource adjustment is closely related to the behavior of the system, including the utilization of resources and application components. Therefore, a continuous monitoring of system attributes and performance metrics provides the raw data for the analysis of problems affecting the performance of the application. Data analytic methods, such as statistical and machine-learning approaches, offer the required concepts, models, and tools to dig into the data and find general rules, patterns, and characteristics that define the functionality of the system. Obtained knowledge from the data analysis process helps to determine the changes in the workloads, faulty components, or problems that can cause system performance to degrade. A timely reaction to performance degradation can avoid violations of service level agreements, including performing proper corrective actions such as auto-scaling or other resource adjustment solutions. In this article, we investigate the main requirements and limitations of cloud resource management, including a study of the approaches to workload and anomaly analysis in the context of performance management in the cloud. A taxonomy of the works on this problem is presented that identifies main approaches in existing research from the data analysis side to resource adjustment techniques. Finally, considering the observed gaps in the general direction of the reviewed works, a list of these gaps is proposed for future researchers to pursue.},

These infection vectors hide embedded malicious code to the victim users, facilitating the use of social engineering techniques to infect their machines. Research showed that machine-learning algorithms provide effective detection mechanisms against such threats, but the existence of an arms race in adversarial settings has recently challenged such systems. In this work, we focus on malware embedded in PDF files as a representative case of such an arms race. We start by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of the different approaches used to generate PDF malware and of the corresponding learning-based detection systems. We then categorize threats specifically targeted against learning-based PDF malware detectors using a well-established framework in the field of adversarial machine learning. This framework allows us to categorize known vulnerabilities of learning-based PDF malware detectors and to identify novel attacks that may threaten such systems, along with the potential defense mechanisms that can mitigate the impact of such threats. We conclude the article by discussing how such findings highlight promising research directions towards tackling the more general challenge of designing robust malware detectors in adversarial settings.},

Food-related study may support multifarious applications and services, such as guiding human behavior, improving human health, and understanding the culinary culture. With the rapid development of social networks, mobile networks, and Internet of Things (IoT), people commonly upload, share, and record food images, recipes, cooking videos, and food diaries, leading to large-scale food data. Large-scale food data offers rich knowledge about food and can help tackle many central issues of human society. Therefore, it is time to group several disparate issues related to food computing. Food computing acquires and analyzes heterogenous food data from different sources for perception, recognition, retrieval, recommendation, and monitoring of food. In food computing, computational approaches are applied to address food-related issues in medicine, biology, gastronomy, and agronomy. Both large-scale food data and recent breakthroughs in computer science are transforming the way we analyze food data. Therefore, a series of works has been conducted in the food area, targeting different food-oriented tasks and applications. However, there are very few systematic reviews that shape this area well and provide a comprehensive and in-depth summary of current efforts or detail open problems in this area. In this article, we formalize food computing and present such a comprehensive overview of various emerging concepts, methods, and tasks. We summarize key challenges and future directions ahead for food computing. This is the first comprehensive survey that targets the study of computing technology for the food area and also offers a collection of research studies and technologies to benefit researchers and practitioners working in different food-related fields.},

abstract = {With the advent of fog and edge computing paradigms, computation capabilities have been moved toward the edge of the network to support the requirements of highly demanding services. To ensure that the quality of such services is still met in the event of users’ mobility, migrating services across different computing nodes becomes essential. Several studies have emerged recently to address service migration in different edge-centric research areas, including fog computing, multi-access edge computing (MEC), cloudlets, and vehicular clouds. Since existing surveys in this area focus on either VM migration in general or migration in a single research field (e.g., MEC), the objective of this survey is to bring together studies from different, yet related, edge-centric research fields while capturing the different facets they addressed. More specifically, we examine the diversity characterizing the landscape of migration scenarios at the edge, present an objective-driven taxonomy of the literature, and highlight contributions that rather focused on architectural design and implementation. Finally, we identify a list of gaps and research opportunities based on the observation of the current state of the literature. One such opportunity lies in joining efforts from both networking and computing research communities to facilitate future research in this area.},

Cloud data mining fuses the applicability of classical data mining with the promises of cloud computing. This allows it to perform knowledge discovery out of huge volumes of data with efficiency. This article presents the existing frameworks, services, platforms, and algorithms for cloud data mining. The frameworks and platforms are compared among each other based on similarity, data mining task support, parallelism, distribution, streaming data processing support, fault tolerance, security, memory types, storage systems, and others. Similarly, the algorithms are grouped on the basis of parallelism type, scalability, streaming data mining support, and types of data managed. We have also provided taxonomies on the basis of data mining techniques such as clustering, classification, and association rule mining. We also have attempted to discuss and identify the major applications of cloud data mining. The various taxonomies for cloud data mining frameworks, platforms, and algorithms have been identified.

Due to the complexity of the problem, special emphasis is placed on solutions to the characterization, management, and control of complex distributed applications using machine learning approaches. The survey is structured around a decomposition of the reliable resource provisioning problem into three categories of techniques: workload characterization and prediction, component placement and system consolidation, and application elasticity and remediation.

Due to this, efforts have been made to develop and utilize software tools for the purpose of aiding developers and third party assessors in the act of assessing and analyzing assurance cases. This article presents a survey of the various assurance case assessment features contained in 10 assurance case software tools, all of which identified and selected by us via a previously conducted systematic literature review.

abstract = {Although malicious software (malware) has been around since the early days of computers, the sophistication and innovation of malware has increased over the years. In particular, the latest crop of ransomware has drawn attention to the dangers of malicious software, which can cause harm to private users as well as corporations, public services (hospitals and transportation systems), governments, and security institutions. To protect these institutions and the public from malware attacks, malicious activity must be detected as early as possible, preferably before it conducts its harmful acts. However, it is not always easy to know what to look for—especially when dealing with new and unknown malware that has never been seen. Analyzing a suspicious file by static or dynamic analysis methods can provide relevant and valuable information regarding a file's impact on the hosting system and help determine whether the file is malicious or not, based on the method's predefined rules. While various techniques (e.g., code obfuscation, dynamic code loading, encryption, and packing) can be used by malware writers to evade static analysis (including signature-based anti-virus tools), dynamic analysis is robust to these techniques and can provide greater understanding regarding the analyzed file and consequently can lead to better detection capabilities. Although dynamic analysis is more robust than static analysis, existing dynamic analysis tools and techniques are imperfect, and there is no single tool that can cover all aspects of malware behavior. The most recent comprehensive survey performed in this area was published in 2012. Since that time, the computing environment has changed dramatically with new types of malware (ransomware, cryptominers), new analysis methods (volatile memory forensics, side-channel analysis), new computing environments (cloud computing, IoT devices), new machine-learning algorithms, and more. The goal of this survey is to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of existing methods used to dynamically analyze malware, which includes a description of each method, its strengths and weaknesses, and its resilience against malware evasion techniques. In addition, we include an overview of prominent studies presenting the usage of machine-learning methods to enhance dynamic malware analysis capabilities aimed at detection, classification, and categorization.},

abstract = {A character network is a graph extracted from a narrative in which vertices represent characters and edges correspond to interactions between them. A number of narrative-related problems can be addressed automatically through the analysis of character networks, such as summarization, classification, or role detection. Character networks are particularly relevant when considering works of fiction (e.g., novels, plays, movies, TV series), as their exploitation allows developing information retrieval and recommendation systems. However, works of fiction possess specific properties that make these tasks harder.This survey aims at presenting and organizing the scientific literature related to the extraction of character networks from works of fiction, as well as their analysis. We first describe the extraction process in a generic way and explain how its constituting steps are implemented in practice, depending on the medium of the narrative, the goal of the network analysis, and other factors. We then review the descriptive tools used to characterize character networks, with a focus on the way they are interpreted in this context. We illustrate the relevance of character networks by also providing a review of applications derived from their analysis. Finally, we identify the limitations of the existing approaches and the most promising perspectives.},

Being dynamic in nature, video skimming, through temporal connectivity, allows better understanding of the video from its summary. Having this obvious advantage, recently, video skimming has drawn the focus of many researchers benefiting from the easy availability of the required computing resources. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey on video skimming focusing on the substantial amount of literature from the past decade. We present a taxonomy of video skimming approaches and discuss their evolution highlighting key advances.

This article reviews the historical evolution of autonomy, its approaches, and the current trends in related fields to build robust autonomous systems. Toward such a goal and with the increased number of cyberattacks, the security of these systems needs special attention from the research community. To gauge the extent to which research has been done in this area, we discuss the cybersecurity of these systems. It is essential to model the system from a security perspective, identify the threats and vulnerabilities, and then model the attacks. A survey in this direction explores the theoretical/analytical system and attack models that have been proposed over the years and identifies the research gap that needs to be addressed by the research community.},

Descriptors of the spatial distribution of the data and estimates of the shape and size of the decision boundary are among the known measures for this characterization. This information can support the formulation of new data-driven pre-processing and pattern recognition techniques, which can in turn be focused on challenges highlighted by such characteristics of the problems. This article surveys and analyzes measures that can be extracted from the training datasets to characterize the complexity of the respective classification problems. Their use in recent literature is also reviewed and discussed, allowing to prospect opportunities for future work in the area.

Visually pleasing combinations of framing shot types and camera motion types are identified, while the presented camera motion types are modeled geometrically and graded into distinct energy consumption classes and required technology complexity levels for autonomous capture. Two specific strategies are prescribed, namely focal length compensation and multidrone compensation, for partially overcoming a number of issues arising in UAV live outdoor event coverage, deemed as the most complex UAV cinematography scenario. Finally, the shot types compatible with each compensation strategy are explicitly identified.

An extensive paper search was conducted by both automated query of popular digital libraries and snowballing, which resulted in the final selection of 147 primary studies. Along the survey, a framework has been incrementally derived that classifies cloud testing research among six main areas and their topics. The article includes a detailed analysis of the selected primary studies to identify trends and gaps, as well as an extensive report of the state-of-the-art as it emerges by answering the identified Research Questions.

However, the dramatically increasing number of devices and data traffic in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era are posing significant burdens on the capacity-limited Internet and uncontrollable service delay. It becomes difficult to meet the delay-sensitive and context-aware service requirements of IoT applications by using cloud computing alone. Facing these challenges, computing paradigms are shifting from the centralized cloud computing to distributed edge computing. Several new computing paradigms, including Transparent Computing, Mobile Edge Computing, Fog Computing, and Cloudlet, have emerged to leverage the distributed resources at network edge to provide timely and context-aware services. By integrating end devices, edge servers, and cloud, they form a hierarchical IoT architecture, i.e., End-Edge-Cloud orchestrated architecture to improve the performance of IoT systems. This article presents a comprehensive survey of these emerging computing paradigms from the perspective of end-edge-cloud orchestration. Specifically, we first introduce and compare the architectures and characteristics of different computing paradigms. Then, a comprehensive survey is presented to discuss state-of-the-art research in terms of computation offloading, caching, security, and privacy.

Traditional cybersecurity approaches are based on old threat-knowledge databases and need to be updated on a daily basis to stand against new generation of cyber-threats and protect underlying network-based systems. Along with updating threat-knowledge databases, there is a need for proper management and processing of data generated by sensitive real-time applications. In recent years, various computing platforms based on representation learning algorithms have emerged as a useful resource to manage and exploit the generated data to extract meaningful information. If these platforms are properly utilized, then strong cybersecurity systems can be developed to protect the underlying network-based systems and support sensitive real-time applications. In this survey, we highlight various cyber-threats, real-life examples, and initiatives taken by various international organizations. We discuss various computing platforms based on representation learning algorithms to process and analyze the generated data. We highlight various popular datasets introduced by well-known global organizations that can be used to train the representation learning algorithms to predict and detect threats. We also provide an in-depth analysis of research efforts based on representation learning algorithms made in recent years to protect the underlying network-based systems against current cyber-threats.

abstract = {Video summarization is the method of extracting key frames or clips from a video to generate a synopsis of the content of the video. Generally, video is compressed before storing or transmitting it in most of the practical applications. Traditional techniques require the videos to be decoded to summarize them, which is a tedious job. Instead, compressed domain video processing can be used for summarizing videos by partially decoding them. A classification and analysis of various summarization techniques are presented in this article with special focus on compressed domain techniques along with a discussion on machine-learning-based techniques that can be applied to summarize the videos.<!--?vsp -1.2pt?--> },

abstract = {This article provides a systematic review of cloud pricing in an interdisciplinary approach. It examines many historical cases of pricing in practice and tracks down multiple roots of pricing in research. The aim is to help both cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud customers to capture the essence of cloud pricing when they need to make a critical decision either to achieve competitive advantages or to manage cloud resource effectively. Currently, the number of available pricing schemes in the cloud market is overwhelming. It is an intricate issue to understand these schemes and associated pricing models clearly due to involving several domains of knowledge, such as cloud technologies, microeconomics, operations research, and value theory. Some earlier studies have introduced this topic unsystematically. Their approaches inevitably lead to much confusion for many cloud decision-makers. To address their weaknesses, we present a comprehensive taxonomy of cloud pricing, which is driven by a framework of three fundamental pricing strategies that are built on nine cloud pricing categories. These categories can be further mapped onto a total of 60 pricing models. Many of the pricing models have been already adopted by CSPs. Others have been widespread across in other industries. We give descriptions of these model categories and highlight both advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, this article offers an extensive survey of many cloud pricing models that were proposed by many researchers during the past decade. Based on the survey, we identify four trends of cloud pricing and the general direction, which is moving from intrinsic value per physical box to extrinsic value per serverless sandbox. We conclude that hyper-converged cloud resources pool supported by cloud orchestration, virtual machine, Open Application Programming Interface, and serverless sandbox will drive the future of cloud pricing.},

abstract = {Video description is the automatic generation of natural language sentences that describe the contents of a given video. It has applications in human-robot interaction, helping the visually impaired and video subtitling. The past few years have seen a surge of research in this area due to the unprecedented success of deep learning in computer vision and natural language processing. Numerous methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics have been proposed in the literature, calling the need for a comprehensive survey to focus research efforts in this flourishing new direction. This article fills the gap by surveying the state-of-the-art approaches with a focus on deep learning models; comparing benchmark datasets in terms of their domains, number of classes, and repository size; and identifying the pros and cons of various evaluation metrics, such as SPICE, CIDEr, ROUGE, BLEU, METEOR, and WMD. Classical video description approaches combined subject, object, and verb detection with template-based language models to generate sentences. However, the release of large datasets revealed that these methods cannot cope with the diversity in unconstrained open domain videos. Classical approaches were followed by a very short era of statistical methods that were soon replaced with deep learning, the current state-of-the-art in video description. Our survey shows that despite the fast-paced developments, video description research is still in its infancy due to the following reasons: Analysis of video description models is challenging, because it is difficult to ascertain the contributions towards accuracy or errors of the visual features and the adopted language model in the final description. Existing datasets neither contain adequate visual diversity nor complexity of linguistic structures. Finally, current evaluation metrics fall short of measuring the agreement between machine-generated descriptions with that of humans. We conclude our survey by listing promising future research directions.},

abstract = {Document layout analysis (DLA) is a preprocessing step of document understanding systems. It is responsible for detecting and annotating the physical structure of documents. DLA has several important applications such as document retrieval, content categorization, text recognition, and the like. The objective of DLA is to ease the subsequent analysis/recognition phases by identifying the document-homogeneous blocks and by determining their relationships. The DLA pipeline consists of several phases that could vary among DLA methods, depending on the documents’ layouts and final analysis objectives. In this regard, a universal DLA algorithm that fits all types of document-layouts or that satisfies all analysis objectives has not been developed, yet. In this survey paper, we present a critical study of different document layout analysis techniques. The study highlights the motivational reasons for pursuing DLA and discusses comprehensively the different phases of the DLA algorithms based on a general framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing the research in the field. The DLA framework consists of preprocessing, layout analysis strategies, post-processing, and performance evaluation phases. Overall, the article delivers an essential baseline for pursuing further research in document layout analysis.},

To structure the presentation of the research contributions, we propose novel technically oriented typologies for plagiarism prevention and detection efforts, the forms of academic plagiarism, and computational plagiarism detection methods. We show that academic plagiarism detection is a highly active research field. Over the period we review, the field has seen major advances regarding the automated detection of strongly obfuscated and thus hard-to-identify forms of academic plagiarism. These improvements mainly originate from better semantic text analysis methods, the investigation of non-textual content features, and the application of machine learning. We identify a research gap in the lack of methodologically thorough performance evaluations of plagiarism detection systems. Concluding from our analysis, we see the integration of heterogeneous analysis methods for textual and non-textual content features using machine learning as the most promising area for future research contributions to improve the detection of academic plagiarism further.},

Understanding the inner workings of such malware provides a leverage to effectively combat them. This understanding is pursued often through dynamic analysis which is conducted manually or automatically. Malware authors accordingly, have devised and advanced evasion techniques to thwart or evade these analyses. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on malware dynamic analysis evasion techniques. In addition, we propose a detailed classification of these techniques and further demonstrate how their efficacy holds against different types of detection and analysis approaches.Our observations attest that evasive behavior is mostly concerned with detecting and evading sandboxes. The primary tactic of such malware we argue is fingerprinting followed by new trends for reverse Turing test tactic which aims at detecting human interaction. Furthermore, we will posit that the current defensive strategies, beginning with reactive methods to endeavors for more transparent analysis systems, are readily foiled by zero-day fingerprinting techniques or other evasion tactics such as stalling. Accordingly, we would recommend the pursuit of more generic defensive strategies with an emphasis on path exploration techniques that has the potential to thwart all the evasive tactics.},

abstract = {The vast nature of scientific publications brings out the importance of Literature-Based Discovery (LBD) research that is highly beneficial to accelerate knowledge acquisition and the research development process. LBD is a knowledge discovery workflow that automatically detects significant, implicit knowledge associations hidden in fragmented knowledge areas by analysing existing scientific literature. Therefore, the LBD output not only assists in formulating scientifically sensible, novel research hypotheses but also encourages the development of cross-disciplinary research. In this systematic review, we provide an in-depth analysis of the computational techniques used in the LBD process using a novel, up-to-date, and detailed classification. Moreover, we also summarise the key milestones of the discipline through a timeline of topics. To provide a general overview of the discipline, the review outlines LBD validation checks, major LBD tools, application areas, domains, and generalisability of LBD methodologies. We also outline the insights gathered through our statistical analysis that capture the trends in LBD literature. To conclude, we discuss the prevailing research deficiencies in the discipline by highlighting the challenges and opportunities of future LBD research.},

abstract = {Random graph (RG) models play a central role in complex networks analysis. They help us to understand, control, and predict phenomena occurring, for instance, in social networks, biological networks, the Internet, and so on.Despite a large number of RG models presented in the literature, there are few concepts underlying them. Instead of trying to classify a wide variety of very dispersed models, we capture and describe concepts they exploit considering preferential attachment, copying principle, hyperbolic geometry, recursively defined structure, edge switching, Monte Carlo sampling, and so on. We analyze RG models, extract their basic principles, and build a taxonomy of concepts they are based on. We also discuss how these concepts are combined in RG models and how they work in typical applications like benchmarks, null models, and data anonymization.},

This survey provides a detailed discussion on 28 CPU cache simulators, including popular or recent simulators. We compare between all of these simulators in four different ways: major design characteristics, support for specific cache design features, support for specific cache-related metrics, and validation methods and efforts. The strengths and shortcomings of each simulator and major issues that are common to all simulators are highlighted. The information presented in this survey was collected from many different sources, including research papers, documentations, source code bases, and others.

Although advances in mobile context-aware applications have made our everyday environments increasingly intelligent, these applications are prone to bugs that are highly difficult to reproduce and repair. Compared to conventional computer software, mobile context-aware applications often have more complex structures to process a wide variety of dynamic context data in specific scenarios. Accordingly, researchers have proposed diverse context simulation techniques to enable low-cost and effective tests instead of conducting costly and time-consuming real-world experiments. This article aims to give a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art context simulation methods for testing mobile context-aware applications. In particular, this article highlights the technical distinctions and commonalities in previous research conducted across multiple disciplines, particularly at the intersection of software testing, ubiquitous computing, and mobile computing. This article also discusses how each method can be implemented and deployed by testing tool developers and mobile application testers.

abstract = {The breakdown of Dennard scaling has resulted in a decade-long stall of the maximum operating clock frequencies of processors. To mitigate this issue, computing shifted to multi-core devices. This introduced the need for programming flows and tools that facilitate the expression of workload parallelism at high abstraction levels. However, not all workloads are easily parallelizable, and the minor improvements to processor cores have not significantly increased single-threaded performance. Simultaneously, Instruction Level Parallelism in applications is considerably underexplored. This article reviews notable approaches that focus on exploiting this potential parallelism via automatic generation of specialized hardware from binary code. Although research on this topic spans over more than 20 years, automatic acceleration of software via translation to hardware has gained new importance with the recent trend toward reconfigurable heterogeneous platforms. We characterize this kind of binary acceleration approach and the accelerator architectures on which it relies. We summarize notable state-of-the-art approaches individually and present a taxonomy and comparison. Performance gains from 2.6\texttimes{} to 5.6\texttimes{} are reported, mostly considering bare-metal embedded applications, along with power consumption reductions between 1.3\texttimes{} and 3.9\texttimes{}. We believe the methodologies and results achievable by automatic hardware generation approaches are promising in the context of emergent reconfigurable devices.},

Although these AI technologies offer significant benefits, they can be used maliciously. Highly targeted and evasive attacks in benign carrier applications, such as DeepLocker, have demonstrated the intentional use of AI for harmful purposes. Threat actors are constantly changing and improving their attack strategy with particular emphasis on the application of AI-driven techniques in the attack process, called AI-based cyber attack, which can be used in conjunction with conventional attack techniques to cause greater damage. Despite several studies on AI and security, researchers have not summarized AI-based cyber attacks enough to be able to understand the adversary’s actions and to develop proper defenses against such attacks. This study aims to explore existing studies of AI-based cyber attacks and to map them onto a proposed framework, providing insight into new threats. Our framework includes the classification of several aspects of malicious uses of AI during the cyber attack life cycle and provides a basis for their detection to predict future threats. We also explain how to apply this framework to analyze AI-based cyber attacks in a hypothetical scenario of a critical smart grid infrastructure.},

However, deep learning-based video coding remains in its infancy. We review the representative works about using deep learning for image/video coding, an actively developing research area since 2015. We divide the related works into two categories: new coding schemes that are built primarily upon deep networks, and deep network-based coding tools that shall be used within traditional coding schemes. For deep schemes, pixel probability modeling and auto-encoder are the two approaches, that can be viewed as predictive coding and transform coding, respectively. For deep tools, there have been several techniques using deep learning to perform intra-picture prediction, inter-picture prediction, cross-channel prediction, probability distribution prediction, transform, post- or in-loop filtering, down- and up-sampling, as well as encoding optimizations. In the hope of advocating the research of deep learning-based video coding, we present a case study of our developed prototype video codec, Deep Learning Video Coding (DLVC). DLVC features two deep tools that are both based on convolutional neural network (CNN), namely CNN-based in-loop filter and CNN-based block adaptive resolution coding. The source code of DLVC has been released for future research.},

Following that, Erway et al. adapted the model for dynamically updatable data and called it the Dynamic Provable Data Possession (DPDP) model. The idea is that a client outsources her files to a cloud server and later challenges the server to obtain a proof of the integrity of her data. Many schemes have later been proposed for this purpose, all following a similar framework.We analyze dynamic data outsourcing schemes for the cloud regarding security and efficiency and show a general framework for constructing such schemes that encompasses existing DPDP-like schemes as different instantiations. This generalization shows that a dynamic outsourced data integrity verification scheme can be constructed given black-box access to an implicitly-ordered authenticated data structure. Moreover, for blockless verification efficiency, a homomorphic verifiable tag scheme is also needed. We investigate the requirements and conditions these building blocks should satisfy, using which one may easily check the applicability of a given building block for dynamic data outsourcing. Our framework serves as a guideline/tutorial/survey and enables us to provide a comparison among different building blocks that existing schemes employ.},

Vision stands out among the other senses for its richness and practicality. Even though there are well-established autonomous navigation solutions, as far as we can tell, no complete autonomous navigation system that is solely based on vision and that is suitable for dynamic indoor environments has fully succeeded. This article presents a systematic literature review of methods and techniques used to solve the complete autonomous navigation problem or its parts: localization, mapping, path planning, and locomotion. The focus of this review lays on vision-based methods for indoor environments and ground robots. A total of 121 studies were considered, comprising methods, conceptual models, and other literature reviews published between 2000 and 2017. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review about vision-based autonomous navigation suitable for dynamic indoor environments. It addresses navigation methods, autonomous navigation requirements, vision benefits, methods testing, and implementations validation. The results of this review show a deficiency in testing and validation of presented methods, poor requirements specification, and a lack of complete navigation systems in the literature. These results should encourage new works on computer vision techniques, requirements specification, development, integration, and systematic testing and validation of general navigation systems. In addition to these findings, we also present the complete methodology used for the systematic review, which provides a documentation of the process (allowing quality assessment and repeatability), the criteria for selecting and evaluating the studies, and a framework that can be used for future reviews in this research area.},

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL) has had an immense success in the recent past, leading to state-of-the-art results in various domains, such as image recognition and natural language processing. One of the reasons for this success is the increasing size of DL models and the proliferation of vast amounts of training data being available. To keep on improving the performance of DL, increasing the scalability of DL systems is necessary. In this survey, we perform a broad and thorough investigation on challenges, techniques and tools for scalable DL on distributed infrastructures. This incorporates infrastructures for DL, methods for parallel DL training, multi-tenant resource scheduling, and the management of training and model data. Further, we analyze and compare 11 current open-source DL frameworks and tools and investigate which of the techniques are commonly implemented in practice. Finally, we highlight future research trends in DL systems that deserve further research.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, Collective Intelligence (CI) platforms have become a vital resource for learning, problem solving, decision-making, and predictions. This rising interest in the topic has to led to the development of several models and frameworks available in published literature. Unfortunately, most of these models are built around domain-specific requirements, i.e., they are often based on the intuitions of their domain experts and developers. This has created a gap in our knowledge in the theoretical foundations of CI systems and models, in general. In this article, we attempt to fill this gap by conducting a systematic review of CI models and frameworks, identified from a collection of 9,418 scholarly articles published since 2000. Eventually, we contribute by aggregating the available knowledge from 12 CI models into one novel framework and present a generic model that describes CI systems irrespective of their domains. We add to the previously available CI models by providing a more granular view of how different components of CI systems interact. We evaluate the proposed model by examining it with respect to six popular, ongoing CI initiatives available on the Web.},

abstract = {Today, GPUs are widely used as coprocessors/accelerators in High-Performance Heterogeneous Computing due to their many advantages. However, many researches emphasize that GPUs are not as reliable as desired yet. Despite the fact that GPUs are more vulnerable to hardware errors than CPUs, the use of GPUs in HPCs is increasing more and more. Moreover, due to native reliability problems of GPUs, combining a great number of GPUs with CPUs can significantly increase HPCs’ failure rates. For this reason, analyzing the reliability characteristics of GPU-based HPCs has become a very important issue. Therefore, in this study we evaluate the reliability of GPU-based HPCs. For this purpose, we first examined field data analysis studies for GPU-based and CPU-based HPCs and identified factors that could increase systems failure/error rates. We then compared GPU-based HPCs with CPU-based HPCs in terms of reliability with the help of these factors in order to point out reliability challenges of GPU-based HPCs. Our primary goal is to present a study that can guide the researchers in this field by indicating the current state of GPU-based heterogeneous HPCs and requirements for the future, in terms of reliability. Our second goal is to offer a methodology to compare the reliability of GPU-based HPCs and CPU-based HPCs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey study to compare the reliability of GPU-based and CPU-based HPCs in a systematic manner.},

For cloud providers, the typical goal is to maximize their profits. However, maximizing profits in a highly competitive cloud market is a huge challenge for cloud providers. In this article, a survey of profit optimization techniques is proposed to increase cloud provider profitability through service quality improvement, service pricing, energy consumption reduction, and virtual network function (VNF) deployment. The strategy of improving user service quality is discussed first, followed by the pricing strategy for cloud resources to maximize revenue. Then, this article summarizes the techniques for cloud data centers to reduce server power consumption. Finally, various heuristic algorithms for VNF deployment in the cloud are further described to reduce the cost of cloud providers while maintaining performance. We classify research works based on components of profit and methods used to demonstrate similarities and differences in these studies. We hope this survey will provide researchers with insights into cloud profit optimization techniques.},

abstract = {The demand for artificial intelligence has grown significantly over the past decade, and this growth has been fueled by advances in machine learning techniques and the ability to leverage hardware acceleration. However, to increase the quality of predictions and render machine learning solutions feasible for more complex applications, a substantial amount of training data is required. Although small machine learning models can be trained with modest amounts of data, the input for training larger models such as neural networks grows exponentially with the number of parameters. Since the demand for processing training data has outpaced the increase in computation power of computing machinery, there is a need for distributing the machine learning workload across multiple machines, and turning the centralized into a distributed system. These distributed systems present new challenges: first and foremost, the efficient parallelization of the training process and the creation of a coherent model. This article provides an extensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in the field by outlining the challenges and opportunities of distributed machine learning over conventional (centralized) machine learning, discussing the techniques used for distributed machine learning, and providing an overview of the systems that are available.},

However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area.

However, the performance of Pareto-based MOEAs quickly degrades when solving multi-objective optimization problems (MOPs) having four or more objective functions (the so-called many-objective optimization problems), mainly because of the loss of selection pressure. Consequently, in recent years, MOEAs have been coupled with indicator-based selection mechanisms in furtherance of increasing the selection pressure so that they can properly solve many-objective optimization problems. Several research efforts have been conducted since 2003 regarding the design of the so-called indicator-based (IB) MOEAs. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of IB-MOEAs for continuous search spaces since their origins up to the current state-of-the-art approaches. We propose a taxonomy that classifies IB-mechanisms into two main categories: (1) IB-Selection (which is divided into IB-Environmental Selection, IB-Density Estimation, and IB-Archiving) and (2) IB-Mating Selection. Each of these classes is discussed in detail in this article, emphasizing the advantages and drawbacks of the selection mechanisms.

In this work, we present an overview of these efforts and provide insight into the important trends, developments, and exciting research opportunities in exascale computing. We use a three-stage approach in which we (1) discuss various exascale landmark studies, (2) use data-driven techniques to analyze the large collection of related literature, and (3) discuss eight research areas in depth based on influential articles. Overall, we observe that great advancements have been made in tackling the two primary exascale challenges: energy efficiency and fault tolerance. However, as we look forward, we still foresee two major concerns: the lack of suitable programming tools and the growing gap between processor performance and data bandwidth (i.e., memory, storage, networks). Although we will certainly reach exascale soon, without additional research, these issues could potentially limit the applicability of exascale computing.},

abstract = {Image classification is a key task in image understanding, and multi-label image classification has become a popular topic in recent years. However, the success of multi-label image classification is closely related to the way of constructing a training set. As active learning aims to construct an effective training set through iteratively selecting the most informative examples to query labels from annotators, it was introduced into multi-label image classification. Accordingly, multi-label active learning is becoming an important research direction. In this work, we first review existing multi-label active learning algorithms for image classification. These algorithms can be categorized into two top groups from two aspects respectively: sampling and annotation. The most important component of multi-label active learning is to design an effective sampling strategy that actively selects the examples with the highest informativeness from an unlabeled data pool, according to various information measures. Thus, different informativeness measures are emphasized in this survey. Furthermore, this work also makes a deep investigation on existing challenging issues and future promises in multi-label active learning with a focus on four core aspects: example dimension, label dimension, annotation, and application extension.},

This practice is emerging as a new trend in High Performance Computing (HPC), especially when new error-tolerant applications are considered. However, standard compiler frameworks do not support automated precision customization, and manual tuning and code transformation is the approach usually adopted in most domains. In recent years, research have been studying ways to improve the automation of this process. This article surveys this body of work, identifying the critical steps of this process, the most advanced tools available, and the open challenges in this research area.

abstract = {With the development of wireless technology, various emerging mobile applications are attracting significant attention and drastically changing our daily lives. Applications such as augmented reality and object recognition demand stringent delay and powerful processing capability, which exerts enormous pressure on mobile devices with limited resources and energy. In this article, a survey of techniques for mobile device energy optimization is presented in a hierarchy of device design and operation, computation offloading, wireless data transmission, and cloud execution of offloaded computation. Energy management strategies for mobile devices from hardware and software aspects are first discussed, followed by energy-efficient computation offloading frameworks for mobile applications that trade application response time for device energy consumption. Then, techniques for efficient wireless data communication to reduce transmission energy are summarized. Finally, the execution mechanisms of application components or tasks in various clouds are further described to provide energy-saving opportunities for mobile devices. We classify the research works based on key characteristics of devices and applications to emphasize their similarities and differences. We hope that this survey will give insights to researchers into energy management mechanisms on mobile devices, and emphasize the crucial importance of optimizing device energy consumption for more research efforts in this area.},

abstract = {Multilevel optimization aims at reducing the cost of executing a target network-based algorithm by exploiting coarsened, i.e., reduced or simplified, versions of the network. There is a growing interest in multilevel algorithms in networked systems, mostly motivated by the urge for solutions capable of handling large-scale networks. Notwithstanding the success of multilevel optimization in a multitude of application problems, we were unable to find a representative survey of the state-of-the-art, or consistent descriptions of the method as a general theoretical framework independent of a specific application domain. In this article, we strive to fill this gap, presenting an extensive survey of the literature that contemplates a systematic overview of the state-of-the-art, a panorama of the historical evolution and current challenges, and a formal theoretical framework of the multilevel optimization method in complex networks. We believe our survey provides a useful resource to individuals interested in learning about multilevel strategies, as well as to those engaged in advancing theoretical and practical aspects of the method or in developing solutions in novel application domains.},

abstract = {More than 70% of characters in the source code are used to label identifiers. Consequently, identifiers are one of the most important source for program comprehension. Meaningful identifiers are crucial to understand and maintain programs. However, for reasons like constrained schedule, inexperience, and unplanned evolution, identifiers may fail to convey the semantics of the entities associated with them. As a result, such entities should be renamed to improve software quality. However, manual renaming and recommendation are fastidious, time consuming, and error prone, whereas automating the process of renamings is challenging: (1) It involves complex natural language processing to understand the meaning of identifers; (2) It also involves difficult semantic analysis to determine the role of software entities. Researchers proposed a number of approaches and tools to facilitate renamings. We present a survey on existing approaches and classify them into identification of renaming opportunities, execution of renamings, and detection of renamings. We find that there is an imbalance between the three type of approaches, and most of implementation of approaches and evaluation dataset are not publicly available. We also discuss the challenges and present potential research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first comprehensive study on renamings of software entities.},

Network softwarization in the form of Software Defined Networks and Network Function Virtualization has been extensively researched for IoT in the recent past. In this article, we present a systematic and comprehensive review of virtualization techniques explicitly designed for IoT networks. We have classified the literature into software-defined networks designed for IoT, function virtualization for IoT networks, and software-defined IoT networks. These categories are further divided into works that present architectural, security, and management solutions.

abstract = {Recently, Content Delivery Networks (CDN) have become more and more popular. The technology itself is ahead of academic research in this area. Several dimensions of the technology have not been adequately investigated by academia. These dimensions include outline management, security, and standardization. Discovering and highlighting aspects of this technology that may have or have not been covered by academic research is the first step toward helping academia bridge the gap with industry or even go one step further to lead industry in the right direction. This suggests a comprehensive survey on research works in this regard. The literature in this area has already come up with some surveys and taxonomies, but some of them are outdated or do not cover every aspect of CDN while others fail to detect existing trends or to develop a holistic roadmap for research on the technology. Furthermore, none of the existing surveys aim at enlightening the dark aspects of the technology that have not been subject to academic research. In this survey, we first extract the lifecycle of a CDN as suggested by the existing research. Then, we investigate previous relevant works on each phase of the lifecycle to clarify where the research is currently located and headed. We show how CDN technology tends to converge with emerging paradigms such as cloud computing, edge computing, and machine learning, which are more mature in terms of academic research. This helps us determine the right direction for further research by revealing the deficiencies in existing works.},

Such systems require a particular attention with regards to security aspects, as they deal with critical infrastructures that are crucial to organizations and countries. Protecting SCADA systems from intrusion is a very challenging task because they do not only inherit traditional IT security threats but they also include additional vulnerabilities related to field components (e.g., cyber-physical attacks). Many of the existing intrusion detection techniques rely on supervised learning that consists of algorithms that are first trained with reference inputs to learn specific information, and then tested on unseen inputs for classification purposes. This article surveys supervised learning from a specific security angle, namely SCADA-based intrusion detection. Based on a systematic review process, existing literature is categorized and evaluated according to SCADA-specific requirements. Additionally, this survey reports on well-known SCADA datasets and testbeds used with machine learning methods. Finally, we present key challenges and our recommendations for using specific supervised methods for SCADA systems.},

abstract = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is present in many participants from the energy, health, manufacturing, transport, and public sectors. Many factors catalyze IIoT, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, and intelligent decentralized manufacturing. However, the convergence between IT, OT, and IoT environments involves the integration of heterogeneous technologies through protocols, standards, and buses. However, this integration brings with it security risks. To avoid the security risks, especially when systems in different environments interact, it is important and urgent to create an early consensus among the stakeholders on the IIoT security. The default Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) offers a mechanism to measure the severity of an asset's vulnerability and therefore a way to characterize the risk. However, CVSS by default has two drawbacks. On the one hand, to carry out a risk analysis, it is necessary to have additional metrics to the one established by CVSSv3.1. On the other hand, this index has been used mostly in IT environments and although there are numerous efforts to develop a model that suits industrial environments, there is no established proposal. Therefore, we first propose a survey of the main 33 protocols, standards, and buses used in an IIoT environment. This survey will focus on the security of each one. The second part of our study consists of the creation of a framework to characterize risk in industrial environments, i.e., to solve both problems of the CVSS index. To this end, we created the Vulnerability Analysis Framework (VAF), which is a methodology that allows the analysis of 1,363 vulnerabilities to establish a measure to describe the risk in IIoT environments.},

abstract = {Virtualization-based technologies have become ubiquitous in computing. While they provide an easy-to-implement platform for scalable, high-availability services, they also introduce new security issues. Traditionally, discussions on security vulnerabilities in server platforms have been focused on stand-alone (i.e., non-virtualized) environments. For cloud and virtualized platforms, the discussion focuses on the shared usage of resources and the lack of control over the infrastructure. However, the impact virtualization technologies can have on exploit mitigation mechanisms of host machines is often neglected. Therefore, this survey discusses the following issues: first, the security issues and challenges that are introduced by the migration from stand-alone solutions to virtualized environments—special attention is given to the Virtual Machine Monitor, since it is a core component in a virtualized solution; second, the impact (sometimes negative) that these new technologies have on existing security strategies for hosts; third, how virtualization technologies can be leveraged to provide new security mechanisms not previously available.; and, finally, how virtualization technologies can be used for malicious purposes.},

Despite its momentum in the research community, many aspects of the paradigm are still unclear, undefined, and unexplored, leading to misunderstandings that hamper the research and development of novel SDS technologies. In this article, we present an in-depth study of SDS systems, providing a thorough description and categorization of each plane of functionality. Further, we propose a taxonomy and classification of existing SDS solutions according to different criteria.

In this exposition, we extensively compare more than 30 state-of-the-art super-resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) over three classical and three recently introduced challenging datasets to benchmark single image super-resolution. We introduce a taxonomy for deep learning–based super-resolution networks that groups existing methods into nine categories including linear, residual, multi-branch, recursive, progressive, attention-based, and adversarial designs. We also provide comparisons between the models in terms of network complexity, memory footprint, model input and output, learning details, the type of network losses, and important architectural differences (e.g., depth, skip-connections, filters). The extensive evaluation performed shows the consistent and rapid growth in the accuracy in the past few years along with a corresponding boost in model complexity and the availability of large-scale datasets. It is also observed that the pioneering methods identified as the benchmarks have been significantly outperformed by the current contenders. Despite the progress in recent years, we identify several shortcomings of existing techniques and provide future research directions towards the solution of these open problems.

abstract = {The recent diffusion of online education (both MOOCs and e-courses) has led to an increased economic and scientific interest in e-learning environments. As widely documented, online students have a much higher chance of dropping out than those attending conventional classrooms. It is of paramount interest for institutions, students, and faculty members to find more efficient methodologies to mitigate withdrawals. Following the rise of attention on the Student Dropout Prediction (SDP) problem, the literature has witnessed a significant increase in contributions to this subject. In this survey, we present an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art literature in the field of SDP, under the central perspective, but not exclusive, of machine learning predictive algorithms. Our main contributions are the following: (i) we propose a comprehensive hierarchical classification of existing literature that follows the workflow of design choices in the SDP; (ii) to facilitate the comparative analysis, we introduce a formal notation to describe in a uniform way the alternative dropout models investigated by the researchers in the field; (iii) we analyse some other relevant aspects to which the literature has given less attention, such as evaluation metrics, gathered data, and privacy concerns; (iv) we pay specific attention to deep sequential machine learning methods—recently proposed by some contributors—which represent one of the most effective solutions in this area. Overall, our survey provides novice readers who address these topics with practical guidance on design choices, as well as directs researchers to the most promising approaches, highlighting current limitations and open challenges in the field.},

abstract = {Small screen and wearable devices play a key role in most of our daily tasks and activities. However, depending on the context, users can easily experience situationally induced impairments and disabilities (SIIDs). Previous studies have defined SIIDs as a new type of impairment in which an able-bodied user’s behaviour is impaired by the context including the characteristics of a device and the environment. This article systematically reviews the empirical studies on the effect of context on SIIDs. In particular, this review aims to answer the following two research questions: Which contextual factors have been examined in the literature that can cause SIIDs and how different contextual factors affect small screen and wearable device users’ performance. This article systematically reviews 187 publications under a framework that has five factors for context analysis: physical, temporal, social, task, and technical contexts. This review shows that a significant amount of empirical studies have been conducted focusing on some factors such as mobility but there still are some factors such as social factors that need to be further considered for SIIDs. Finally, some factors have shown to have significant impact on users’ performance such as multitasking but not all factors has been empirically demonstrated to have an effect on users’ performance.},

abstract = {Stream processing is an emerging paradigm to handle data streams upon arrival, powering latency-critical application such as fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and health surveillance. Though there are a variety of Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPSs) that facilitate the development of streaming applications, resource management and task scheduling is not automatically handled by the DSPS middleware and requires a laborious process to tune toward specific deployment targets. As the advent of cloud computing has supported renting resources on-demand, it is of great interest to review the research progress of hosting streaming systems in clouds under certain Service Level Agreements (SLA) and cost constraints. In this article, we introduce the hierarchical structure of streaming systems, define the scope of the resource management problem, and present a comprehensive taxonomy in this context covering critical research topics such as resource provisioning, operator parallelisation, and task scheduling. The literature is then reviewed following the taxonomy structure, facilitating a deeper understanding of the research landscape through classification and comparison of existing works. Finally, we discuss the open issues and future research directions toward realising an automatic, SLA-aware resource management framework.},

However, despite achieving impressive performance on complex tasks, they can be very sensitive: Small perturbations of inputs can be sufficient to induce incorrect behavior. Such perturbations, called adversarial examples, are intentionally designed to test the network’s sensitivity to distribution drifts. Given their surprisingly small size, a wide body of literature conjectures on their existence and how this phenomenon can be mitigated. In this article, we discuss the impact of adversarial examples on security, safety, and robustness of neural networks. We start by introducing the hypotheses behind their existence, the methods used to construct or protect against them, and the capacity to transfer adversarial examples between different machine learning models.

Touch-based behavioural biometrics is a time-based assessment of how a user performs a particular touch task on a mobile device. Several performance-focused surveys already exist. In this article, building upon the existing reviews, we have examined studies on touch-dynamics based behavioural biometrics based on usability and its impact on authentication performance. We also emphasize the need for shifting the focus on usability during performance evaluations by presenting a consolidated list of usability and ergonomic-based factors that influence user interaction, and cause performance variations. In this article, we report and review the usability evaluations, user acceptance studies and performance based studies influencing the user interaction process on three specific touch-dynamics based modalities - signature, keystroke and swipe. With regards to performance, we present a comparative analysis of error rates and accuracy of various research works undertaken. Additionally, we present a consolidated list of public datasets and discuss evolving vulnerabilities of touch-dynamics based behavioural biometrics, their adopted attack models and their feasibility.},

abstract = {A comprehensive artificial intelligence system needs to not only perceive the environment with different “senses” (e.g., seeing and hearing) but also infer the world’s conditional (or even causal) relations and corresponding uncertainty. The past decade has seen major advances in many perception tasks, such as visual object recognition and speech recognition, using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. In recent years, Bayesian deep learning has emerged as a unified probabilistic framework to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models.1 In this general framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and, in turn, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, control, and so on. We also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics, such as Bayesian treatment of neural networks.},

abstract = {We present a survey on multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT), which has gained a lot of traction in recent years. MNMT has been useful in improving translation quality as a result of translation knowledge transfer (transfer learning). MNMT is more promising and interesting than its statistical machine translation counterpart, because end-to-end modeling and distributed representations open new avenues for research on machine translation. Many approaches have been proposed to exploit multilingual parallel corpora for improving translation quality. However, the lack of a comprehensive survey makes it difficult to determine which approaches are promising and, hence, deserve further exploration. In this article, we present an in-depth survey of existing literature on MNMT. We first categorize various approaches based on their central use-case and then further categorize them based on resource scenarios, underlying modeling principles, core-issues, and challenges. Wherever possible, we address the strengths and weaknesses of several techniques by comparing them with each other. We also discuss the future directions for MNMT. This article is aimed towards both beginners and experts in NMT. We hope this article will serve as a starting point as well as a source of new ideas for researchers and engineers interested in MNMT.},

It faces a number of severe issues such as lack of essential evaluation data, demand of big data process, request of simple trust relationship expression, and expectation of automation. In order to overcome these problems and intelligently and automatically evaluate trust, machine learning has been applied into trust evaluation. Researchers have proposed many methods to use machine learning for trust evaluation. However, the literature still lacks a comprehensive literature review on this topic. In this article, we perform a thorough survey on trust evaluation based on machine learning. First, we cover essential prerequisites of trust evaluation and machine learning. Then, we justify a number of requirements that a sound trust evaluation method should satisfy, and propose them as evaluation criteria to assess the performance of trust evaluation methods. Furthermore, we systematically organize existing methods according to application scenarios and provide a comprehensive literature review on trust evaluation from the perspective of machine learning’s function in trust evaluation and evaluation granularity. Finally, according to the completed review and evaluation, we explore some open research problems and suggest the directions that are worth our research effort in the future.},

Evidence reveals that the behaviors of cloud servers make the major impact on data centers’ power consumption. Although extensive research can be found in this context, a systematic review of the models and modeling methods for the entire hierarchy (from underlying hardware components to the upper-layer applications) of the cloud server is still missing, which is supposed to cover the relevant studies on physical and virtual cloud server instances, server components, and cloud applications. In this article, we summarize a broad range of relevant studies from three perspectives: power data acquisition, power models, and power modeling methods for cloud servers (including bare-metal, virtual machine (VM), and container instances). We present a comprehensive taxonomy on the collection methods of server-level power data, the existing mainstream power models at multiple levels from hardware to software and application, and commonly used methods for modeling power consumption including classical regression analysis and emerging methods like reinforcement learning. Throughout the work, we introduce a variety of models and methods, illustrating their implementation, usability, and applicability while discussing the limitations of existing approaches and possible ways of improvement. Apart from reviewing existing studies on server power models and modeling methods, we further figure out several open challenges and possible research directions, such as the study on modeling the power consumption of lightweight virtual units like unikernel and the necessity of further explorations toward empowering server power estimation/prediction with machine learning. As power monitoring is drawing increasing attention from cloud service providers (CSPs), this survey provides useful guidelines on server power modeling and can be inspiring for further research on energy-efficient data centers.},

Thus, their behavior is getting more complex, particularly, in tasks related to mapping an environment and localizing themselves. These tasks comprise the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. Representation of knowledge related to the SLAM problem with a standard, flexible, and well-defined model, provides the base to develop efficient and interoperable solutions. As many existing works demonstrate, Semantic Web seems to be a clear approach, since they have formulated ontologies, as the base data model to represent such knowledge. In this article, we survey the most popular and recent SLAM ontologies with our aim being threefold: (i) propose a classification of SLAM ontologies according to the main knowledge needed to model the SLAM problem; (ii) identify existing ontologies for classifying, comparing, and contrasting them, in order to conceptualize SLAM domain for mobile robots; and (iii) pin-down lessons to learn from existing solutions in order to design better solutions and identify new research directions and further improvements. We compare the identified SLAM ontologies according to the proposed classification and, finally, we explore new data fields to enrich existing ontologies and highlight new possibilities in terms of performance and efficiency for SLAM solutions.},

abstract = {The convergence of quantum cryptography with applications used in everyday life is a topic drawing attention from the industrial and academic worlds. The development of quantum electronics has led to the practical achievement of quantum devices that are already available on the market and waiting for their first application on a broader scale. A major aspect of quantum cryptography is the methodology of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), which is used to generate and distribute symmetric cryptographic keys between two geographically separate users using the principles of quantum physics. In previous years, several successful QKD networks have been created to test the implementation and interoperability of different practical solutions. This article surveys previously applied methods, showing techniques for deploying QKD networks and current challenges of QKD networking. Unlike studies focusing on optical channels and optical equipment, this survey focuses on the network aspect by considering network organization, routing and signaling protocols, simulation techniques, and a software-defined QKD networking approach.},

Sustainability is already well established as a concern and a topic of study and practice, given the alarming increase of environmental degradation, pollution, and other adverse effects of industrialization and urbanization. Computational sustainability, which focuses on the use of effective computational models and computational approaches to help achieve the goal of sustainability, has attracted interest from computer science researchers worldwide. We review recent work on computational techniques applied to a range of domains related to sustainability, from bio-surveillance to poverty mapping, from renewable energy production forecasting to crop disease monitoring, and from agent-based modeling to stochastic network design. In sustainable computing, we discuss some directions that have recently been explored. Finally, we analyze research directions that could be explored in the future to achieve the goal of long-term environmental sustainability.},

Hash functions are also utilized in conjunction with digital signatures to provide authentication and non-repudiation services. The SHA has been developed over time by the National Institute of Standards and Technology for security, optimal performance, and robustness. The best-known hash standards are SHA-1, SHA-2, and SHA-3. Security is the most notable criterion for evaluating the hash functions. However, the hardware performance of an algorithm serves as a tiebreaker among the contestants when all other parameters (security, software performance, and flexibility) have equal strength. Field Programmable Gateway Array (FPGA) is a reconfigurable hardware that supports a variety of design options, making it the best choice for implementing the hash standards. In this survey, particular attention is devoted to the FPGA optimization techniques for the three hash standards. The study covers several types of optimization techniques and their contributions to the performance of FPGAs. Moreover, the article highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each of the optimization methods and their influence on performance. We are optimistic that the study will be a useful resource encompassing the efforts carried out on the SHAs and FPGA optimization techniques in a consolidated form.},

The next generation of intelligent vehicular networks enabled by 5G systems will integrate various heterogeneous wireless techniques to enable time-sensitive services with guaranteed quality of service and ultimate bandwidth usage. However, to allow the dense diversity of wireless technologies, seamless and reliable wireless communication protocols need to be thoroughly investigated in vehicular networks environment. Henceforth, efficient mobility management protocols that mitigate the challenges of vehicles’ mobility is essential to support massive data loads throughout various applications. In this article, we review different mobility management protocols and their ability to address issues related to 5G-enabled vehicular networks within the related works.

Therefore, clustering as a method of unsupervised learning is a crucial technique for big data analysis owing to the massive number of unlabeled objects involved. Density-based algorithms have attracted research interest, because they help to better understand complex patterns in spatial datasets that contain information about data related to co-located objects. Big data clustering is a challenging task, because the volume of data increases exponentially. However, clustering using MapReduce can help answer this challenge. In this context, density-based algorithms in MapReduce have been largely investigated in the past decade to eliminate the problem of big data clustering. Despite the diversity of the algorithms proposed, the field lacks a structured review of the available algorithms and techniques for desirable partitioning, local clustering, and merging. This study formalizes the problem of density-based clustering using MapReduce, proposes a taxonomy to categorize the proposed algorithms, and provides a systematic and comprehensive comparison of these algorithms according to the partitioning technique, type of local clustering, merging technique, and exactness of their implementations. Finally, the study highlights outstanding challenges and opportunities to contribute to the field of density-based clustering using MapReduce.},

Classical feature selection algorithms select features based on the correlations between predictive features and the class variable and do not attempt to capture causal relationships between them. It has been shown that the knowledge about the causal relationships between features and the class variable has potential benefits for building interpretable and robust prediction models, since causal relationships imply the underlying mechanism of a system. Consequently, causality-based feature selection has gradually attracted greater attentions and many algorithms have been proposed. In this article, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in causality-based feature selection. To facilitate the development of new algorithms in the research area and make it easy for the comparisons between new methods and existing ones, we develop the first open-source package, called CausalFS, which consists of most of the representative causality-based feature selection algorithms (available at https://github.com/kuiy/CausalFS). Using CausalFS, we conduct extensive experiments to compare the representative algorithms with both synthetic and real-world datasets.

The traffic efficiency services are designed to enhance the moving fluency and smoothness of traveling vehicles over the road network. The grid layout architecture of the downtown areas provides several routes toward any targeted destination. Moreover, since several conflicted traffic flows compete at the road intersections, many vehicles have to stop and wait for safe situations to pass the road intersection without coming into conflict with other vehicles. The traffic efficiency applications in this scenario are designed to select the most efficient path for vehicles traveling toward their targeted destination/destinations. Moreover, other applications aimed to decrease the queuing delay time for vehicles at road intersections.

In the Web context, multitier languages aim at reducing the distinction between client and server code, by translating the code that is to be executed on the clients to JavaScript or by executing JavaScript on the server, too. Ultimately, the goal of the multitier approach is to improve program comprehension, simplify maintenance and enable formal reasoning about the properties of the whole distributed application.A number of multitier research languages have been proposed over the last decade, which support various degrees of multitier programming and explore different design tradeoffs.

Edge Computing offers a solution to these performance drawbacks by extending the cloud paradigm to the edge of the network using capable nodes of processing compute-intensive tasks. In the recent years, vehicular edge computing has emerged for supporting mobile applications. Such paradigm relies on vehicles as edge node devices for providing storage, computation, and bandwidth resources for resource-constrained mobile applications. In this article, we study the challenges of computation offloading for vehicular edge computing. We propose a new classification for the better understanding of the literature designing vehicular edge computing. We propose a taxonomy to classify partitioning solutions in filter-based and automatic techniques; scheduling is separated in adaptive, social-based, and deadline-sensitive methods, and finally data retrieval is organized in secure, distance, mobility prediction, and social-based procedures. By reviewing and analyzing literature, we found that vehicular edge computing is feasible and a viable option to address the increasing volume of data traffic. Moreover, we discuss the open challenges and future directions that must be addressed towards efficient and effective computation offloading and retrieval from mobile users to vehicular edge computing.},

abstract = {Cryptographic algorithms have been used not only to create robust ciphertexts but also to generate cryptograms that, contrary to the classic goal of cryptography, are meant to be broken. These cryptograms, generally called puzzles, require the use of a certain amount of resources to be solved, hence introducing a cost that is often regarded as a time delay—though it could involve other metrics as well, such as bandwidth. These powerful features have made puzzles the core of many security protocols, acquiring increasing importance in the IT security landscape. The concept of a puzzle has subsequently been extended to other types of schemes that do not use cryptographic functions, such as CAPTCHAs, which are used to discriminate humans from machines. Overall, puzzles have experienced a renewed interest with the advent of Bitcoin, which uses a CPU-intensive puzzle as proof of work. In this article, we provide a comprehensive study of the most important puzzle construction schemes available in the literature, categorizing them according to several attributes, such as resource type, verification type, and applications. We have redefined the term puzzle by collecting and integrating the scattered notions used in different works, to cover all the existing applications. Moreover, we provide an overview of the possible applications, identifying key requirements and different design approaches. Finally, we highlight the features and limitations of each approach, providing a useful guide for the future development of new puzzle schemes.},

abstract = {As a recent innovation, network functions virtualization (NFV)—with its core concept of replacing hardware middleboxes with software network functions (NFs) implemented in commodity servers—promises cost savings and flexibility benefits. However, transitioning NFs from special-purpose hardware to commodity servers has turned out to be more challenging than expected, as it inevitably incurs performance penalties due to bottlenecks in both software and hardware. To achieve performance comparable to hardware middleboxes, there is a strong demand for a speedup in NF processing, which plays a crucial role in the success of NFV. In this article, we study the performance challenges that exist in general-purpose servers and simultaneously summarize the typical performance bottlenecks in NFV. Through reviewing the progress in the field of NFV acceleration, we present a new taxonomy of the state-of-the-art efforts according to various acceleration approaches. We discuss the surveyed works and identify the respective advantages and disadvantages in each category. We then discuss the products, solutions, and projects emerged in industry. We also present a gap analysis to improve current solutions and highlight promising research trends that can be explored in the future.},

abstract = {Due to technology scaling and harsh environments, a wide range of fault-tolerant techniques exists to deal with the error occurrences. Selecting a fault-tolerant technique is not trivial, whereas more than the necessary overhead is usually inserted during the system design. To avoid over-designing, it is necessary to have an in-depth understanding of the available design options. However, an exhaustive listing is neither possible to create nor efficient to use due to its prohibitive size. In this work, we present a top-down binary tree classification for error detection and correction techniques. At each split, the design space is clearly divided into two complementary parts using one single attribute, compared with existing classifications that use splits with multiple attributes. A leaf inherits all the attributes of its ancestors from the root to the leaf. A technique is decomposed into primitive components, each one belonging to a different leaf. The single attribute splits can be used to efficiently compare the techniques and to prune the incompatible parts of the design space during the design of a technique. This essential single attribute division of the design space is required for the improvement of the techniques and for novel contributions to the fault-tolerance domain.},

A popular and general way to formulate data association is as the NP-hard multi-dimensional assignment problem. Over the past few years, data-driven approaches to assignment have become increasingly prevalent as these techniques have started to mature. We focus this survey solely on learning algorithms for the assignment step of multi-object tracking, and we attempt to unify various methods by highlighting their connections to linear assignment and to the multi-dimensional assignment problem. First, we review probabilistic and end-to-end optimization approaches to data association, followed by methods that learn association affinities from data. We then compare the performance of the methods presented in this survey and conclude by discussing future research directions.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an exponential increase in the use of mobile and embedded devices. With the great success of deep learning in many fields, there is an emerging trend to deploy deep learning on mobile and embedded devices to better meet the requirement of real-time applications and user privacy protection. However, the limited resources of mobile and embedded devices make it challenging to fulfill the intensive computation and storage demand of deep learning models. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive review on the related issues for deep learning on mobile and embedded devices. We start with a brief introduction of deep learning and discuss major challenges of implementing deep learning models on mobile and embedded devices. We then conduct an in-depth survey on important compression and acceleration techniques that help adapt deep learning models to mobile and embedded devices, which we specifically classify as pruning, quantization, model distillation, network design strategies, and low-rank factorization. We elaborate on the hardware-based solutions, including mobile GPU, FPGA, and ASIC, and describe software frameworks for mobile deep learning models, especially the development of frameworks based on OpenCL and RenderScript. After that, we present the application of mobile deep learning in a variety of areas, such as navigation, health, speech recognition, and information security. Finally, we discuss some future directions for deep learning on mobile and embedded devices to inspire further research in this area.},

abstract = {Attribute-based encryption (ABE) for cloud computing access control is reviewed in this article. A taxonomy and comprehensive assessment criteria of ABE are first proposed. In the taxonomy, ABE schemes are assorted into key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) schemes, ciphertext-policy ABE (CP-ABE) schemes, anti-quantum ABE schemes, and generic constructions. In accordance with cryptographically functional features, CP-ABE is further divided into nine subcategories with regard to basic functionality, revocation, accountability, policy hiding, policy updating, multi-authority, hierarchy, offline computation, and outsourced computation. In addition, a systematical methodology for discussing and comparing existing ABE schemes is proposed. For KP-ABE and each type of CP-ABE, the corresponding access control scenario is presented and explained by concrete examples. Specifically, the syntax of ABE is given followed by the adversarial model and security goals. ABE schemes are discussed according to the design strategies and special features and are compared in the light of the proposed assessment criteria with respect to security and performance. Compared to related state-of-the-art survey papers, this article not only provides a broader 12 categories of ABE schemes, but also makes a more comprehensive and holistic comparison. Finally, a number of open research challenges in ABE are pointed out.},

This is essential, e.g., in the conditional if - then - else operator. We can specify this by associating a set μ(f) of indices of evaluable arguments to each function symbol f. With μ(if - then - else)={1}, only the Boolean argument b in calls if b, then e else e' is evaluated. In the realm of term rewriting, this is called context-sensitive rewriting. It has been proven useful to improve the termination behavior of rewriting computations while it is still able to compute (or approximate) canonical forms like head-normal forms, (infinite) values, and (infinite) normal forms by requiring a few reasonable conditions. This article provides an overview of basic results to use context-sensitive rewriting in practice.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm is being rapidly adopted for the creation of smart environments in various domains. The IoT-enabled cyber-physical systems associated with smart city, healthcare, Industry 4.0 and Agtech handle a huge volume of data and require data processing services from different types of applications in real time. The Cloud-centric execution of IoT applications barely meets such requirements as the Cloud datacentres reside at a multi-hop distance from the IoT devices. Fog computing, an extension of Cloud at the edge network, can execute these applications closer to data sources. Thus, Fog computing can improve application service delivery time and resist network congestion. However, the Fog nodes are highly distributed and heterogeneous, and most of them are constrained in resources and spatial sharing. Therefore, efficient management of applications is necessary to fully exploit the capabilities of Fog nodes. In this work, we investigate the existing application management strategies in Fog computing and review them in terms of architecture, placement and maintenance. Additionally, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy and highlight the research gaps in Fog-based application management. We also discuss a perspective model and provide future research directions for further improvement of application management in Fog computing.},

In this work, we address these shortcomings by (1) providing a robust definition of OMR and its relationship to related fields, (2) analyzing how OMR inverts the music encoding process to recover the musical notation and the musical semantics from documents, and (3) proposing a taxonomy of OMR, with most notably a novel taxonomy of applications. Additionally, we discuss how deep learning affects modern OMR research, as opposed to the traditional pipeline. Based on this work, the reader should be able to attain a basic understanding of OMR: its objectives, its inherent structure, its relationship to other fields, the state of the art, and the research opportunities it affords.},

abstract = {Driving can occupy a large portion of daily life and often can elicit negative emotional states like anger or stress, which can significantly impact road safety and long-term human health. In recent decades, the arrival of new tools to help recognize human affect has inspired increasing interest in how to develop emotion-aware systems for cars. To help researchers make needed advances in this area, this article provides a comprehensive literature survey of work addressing the problem of human emotion recognition in an automotive context. We systematically review the literature back to 2002 and identify 63 peer-review published articles on this topic. We overview each study’s methodology to measure and recognize emotions in the context of driving. Across the literature, we find a strong preference toward studying emotional states associated with high arousal and negative valence, monitoring the different states with cardiac, electrodermal activity, and speech signals, and using supervised machine learning to automatically infer the underlying human affective states. This article summarizes the existing work together with publicly available resources (e.g.,&nbsp;datasets and tools) to help new researchers get started in this field. We also identify new research opportunities to help advance progress for improving driver emotion recognition.},

abstract = {This article surveys the linear temporal logic (LTL) literature and presents all the LTL theorems from the survey, plus many new ones, in a calculational deductive system. Calculational deductive systems, developed by Dijkstra and Scholten and extended by Gries and Schneider, are based on only four inference rules—Substitution, Leibniz, Equanimity, and Transitivity. Inference rules in the older Hilbert-style systems, notably modus ponens, appear as theorems in this calculational deductive system. This article extends the calculational deductive system of Gries and Schneider to LTL, using only the same four inference rules. Although space limitations preclude giving a proof of every theorem in this article, every theorem has been proved with calculational logic.},

The goal of this article is to develop a coherent overview of the state of the art in blockchain technology, using a systematic (i.e., protocol-based, replicable), multivocal (i.e., featuring both white and grey literature alike) literature review to (1) define blockchain technology, (2) elaborate on its architecture options and (3) tradeoffs, as well as to understand (4) the current applications and challenges, as evident from the state of the art. We derive a systematic definition of blockchain technology, based on a formal concept analysis. Further, we flesh out an overview of blockchain technology elaborated by means of Grounded-Theory.},

abstract = {Data centers are large-scale, energy-hungry infrastructure serving the increasing computational demands as the world is becoming more connected in smart cities. The emergence of advanced technologies such as cloud-based services, internet of things (IoT), and big data analytics has augmented the growth of global data centers, leading to high energy consumption. This upsurge in energy consumption of the data centers not only incurs the issue of surging high cost (operational and maintenance) but also has an adverse effect on the environment. Dynamic power management in a data center environment requires the cognizance of the correlation between the system and hardware-level performance counters and the power consumption. Power consumption modeling exhibits this correlation and is crucial in designing energy-efficient optimization strategies based on resource utilization. Several works in power modeling are proposed and used in the literature. However, these power models have been evaluated using different benchmarking applications, power-measurement techniques, and error-calculation formulas on different machines. In this work, we present a taxonomy and evaluation of 24 software-based power models using a unified environment, benchmarking applications, power-measurement techniques, and error formulas, with the aim of achieving an objective comparison. We use different server architectures to assess the impact of heterogeneity on the models’ comparison. The performance analysis of these models is elaborated in the article.},

Large-scale, geographical distribution, and heterogeneity of edge computational nodes make service placement in such infrastructure a challenging issue. Diversity of user expectations and IoT devices characteristics also complicate the deployment problem. This article presents a survey of current research conducted on Service Placement Problem (SPP) in the Fog/Edge Computing.

abstract = {Blockchain technology is believed by many to be a game changer in many application domains. While the first generation of blockchain technology (i.e., Blockchain 1.0) is almost exclusively used for cryptocurrency, the second generation (i.e., Blockchain 2.0), as represented by Ethereum, is an open and decentralized platform enabling a new paradigm of computing—Decentralized Applications (DApps) running on top of blockchains. The rich applications and semantics of DApps inevitably introduce many security vulnerabilities, which have no counterparts in pure cryptocurrency systems like Bitcoin. Since Ethereum is a new, yet complex, system, it is imperative to have a systematic and comprehensive understanding on its security from a holistic perspective, which was previously unavailable in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, the present survey, which can also be used as a tutorial, fills this void. We systematize three aspects of Ethereum systems security: vulnerabilities, attacks, and defenses. We draw insights into vulnerability root causes, attack consequences, and defense capabilities, which shed light on future research directions.},

abstract = {When a computational task tolerates a relaxation of its specification or when an algorithm tolerates the effects of noise in its execution, hardware, system software, and programming language compilers or their runtime systems can trade deviations from correct behavior for lower resource usage. We present, for the first time, a synthesis of research results on computing systems that only make as many errors as their end-to-end applications can tolerate. The results span the disciplines of computer-aided design of circuits, digital system design, computer architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and information theory. Rather than over-provisioning the resources controlled by each of these layers of abstraction to avoid errors, it can be more efficient to exploit the masking of errors occurring at one layer and thereby prevent those errors from propagating to a higher layer.We demonstrate the potential benefits of end-to-end approaches using two illustrative examples. We introduce a formalization of terminology that allows us to present a coherent view across the techniques traditionally used by different research communities in their individual layer of focus. Using this formalization, we survey tradeoffs for individual layers of computing systems at the circuit, architecture, operating system, and programming language levels as well as fundamental information-theoretic limits to tradeoffs between resource usage and correctness.},
