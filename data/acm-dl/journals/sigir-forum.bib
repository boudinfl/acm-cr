abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing number of questions about the relationship between preprints and double-blind peer-review at the SIGIR conference. These questions come from authors who wish to post papers which are under review to preprint servers such as arXiv.org, as well as reviewers who become aware of author identities through such postings, and are subsequently, unsure of how to proceed in a double-blind review process. A review of current conference publication guidelines was conducted, along with a survey of SIGIR community members to gain insight about their behaviors, practices and opinions. The paper presents results of this survey, as well as recommendations about submission and review policies for the SIGIR conference.},

abstract = {In the last few years there have been the explosion in the use of heterogeneous distributed systems. Ranging from simple Network of Workstations to the more modern and complex Grid systems, the adoption of distributed systems instead of massively parallel supercomputers has been preferred due to their reduced cost of ownership. These kinds of systems pose many challenges in terms of information access, storage and retrieval. Usually, in fact, instead of having collections stored at a single site they are collected, and sometimes managed, at different sites (possibly owned by different institutions). Particular interest has been expressed on architectures and specifications for information retrieval in the context of heterogeneous distributed computing systems.},

abstract = {The SIGIR 2005 workshop program included seven workshops that were competitively selected from among eight proposals. Organizers of SIGIR 2004 workshops had reported that tight timelines for publicizing workshops and reviewing submissions had resulted in some workshop participants not being notified that a workshop paper had been accepted until the deadline for registration at regular prices had passed. The submission date for SIGIR 2005 workshop proposals was therefore advanced to occur one week after full papers were due. Expedited reviews of all workshop proposals were performed by a committee consisting of recent workshops chairs, augmented where necessary with additional reviewers to ensure that expertise in the topic of each workshop proposal was available. The review results were summarized in an email to the organizing committee and area chairs, and decisions were made by the PC chairs after an email discussion. Workshop organizers were notified of their selection shortly after the poster deadline, about 5 weeks earlier than in previous years. As a result, workshop organizers were generally able to solicit and review submissions sufficiently rapidly to permit workshop participants to qualify for discounted early registration rates.},

Some retrieval approaches work well on one topic but poorly on a second, while other approaches may work poorly on the first topic, but succeed on the second. If it could be determined in advance which approach would work well, then a guided approach could strongly improve performance.

SIGs are not required to implement badging, but given the growing interest in this topic in the SIGIR community, a task force has been assembled to determine how badging might be implemented.

abstract = {Searchers with a complex information need typically slice-and-dice their problem into several queries and subqueries, and laboriously combine the answers post hoc to solve their tasks. Consider planning a social event at the last day of SIGIR, in the unknown city of Beijing, factoring in distances, timing, and preferences on budget, cuisine, and entertainment. A system supporting the entire search episode should "know" a lot, either from profiles or implicit information, or from explicit information in the query or from feedback. This may lead to the (interactive) construction of a complexly structured query, but sometimes the most obvious query for a complex need is dead simple: entertain me. Rather than returning ten-blue-lines in response to a 2.4-word query, the desired system should support searchers during their whole task or search episode, by iteratively constructing a complex query or search strategy, by exploring the result-space at every stage, and by combining the partial answers into a coherent whole.The workshop brought together a varied group of researchers covering both user and system centered approaches, who worked together on the problem and potential solutions. There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. First, there was general optimism on the wealth of contextual information that can be derived from context or natural interactions without the need for obstrusive explicit feedback. Second, the task of "contextual suggestions"--matching specific types of results against rich profiles--was identified as a manageable first step, and concrete plans for such as track were discussed in the aftermath of the workshop. Third, the identified dimensions of variation--such as the level of engagement, or user versus system initiative--give clear suggestions of the types of input a searcher is willing or able to give and the type of response expected from a system.},

The purpose of the workshop was to serve as a platform for publication and discussion of Information Retrieval and NLP research and their applications in the domain of eCommerce. The workshop program was designed to bring together practitioners and researchers from academia and industry to discuss the challenges and approaches to product search and recommendation in the eCommerce domain. Another goal of the workshop was to examine the building of a benchmark data set to facilitate research into this topic. The workshop drew contributions from both industry as well as academia, in total the workshop received a total of twenty one submissions, and accepted thirteen papers. In addition to presentation of a subset of accepted submissions, the workshop had two keynotes by invited speakers from the industry, a poster session where all the accepted submissions were presented, a breakout session, a panel discussion, and a group discussion.},

From this we determined, using information retrieval approaches of course, which topics had come and gone over the last two and a half decades, and which topics are currently "hot". We also performed a co-authorship analysis among authors of the 853 SIGIR conference papers to determine which author is the most "central" in terms of a co-authorship graph and is our equivalent of Paul Erd\"{o}s in Mathematics. In the first section we report on the content analysis, leading to our prediction as to the most topical paper likely to appear at SIGIR2003. In the second section we present details of our co-authorship analysis, revealing who is the "Christopher Lee" of SIGIR, and in the final section we give pointers to where readers who are SIGIR conference paper authors may find details of where they fit into the coauthorship graph.},

Therefore the purpose of the MF/IR 2002, which was the third in row, workshop was, on the one hand, to continue and enhance the results obtained so far, and on the other hand, to present, discuss, analyze, integrate the newer/newest results. MF/IR 2002 also aimed at promoting discussion and interaction among those with theoretical and applicative research interests in mathematical/formal aspects of Information Retrieval, and also at being a forum for the presentation of both theoretical and applicative results (e.g., foundational issues; description and/or integration of models; retrieval applications; mathematical/formal techniques, properties and structures in IR; existing and/or new theories and theoretical aspects).The following areas were addressed: Information Retrieval, Information Filtering, Information, Mining, Indexing and Retrieval, Hypermedia, World Wide Web Retrieval, Digital Libraries, Evaluation, Human Computer Interaction, User Modeling, Semantic Web and Ontologies, where the different entities involved (e.g., documents, queries, indexing, retrieval, relevance, effectiveness, users, etc.) were modeled using any of, but not necessarily limited to, the following approaches: Classical Sets, Fuzzy Sets, Rough Sets, Vectors, Linear Space, Similarity Functions, Probability, Theory of Uncertainty, Functional Analysis, Algebra, Topology, Metric Spaces, Euclidean Geometry, Non-Euclidean Geometries, Boolean Logic, Non-standard Logics, Fuzzy Logic, Quantum Logic, Matroid Theory, Graph Theory.},

The P2P paradigm holds many promises: it fits naturally with the Internet, the universal knowledge and service exchange medium; it favors scalability, by allowing the seamless plugging of data, services and computational resources into the global system; it increases system resilience, by avoiding unique points of failures; and it can speed up global access by distributing the indexing and query processing tasks to multiple computing nodes. However, retrieval methods for P2P systems are still in their infancy. P2P networks are prone to congestion when messages are not routed intelligently. Many of the most effective routing or data placement methods developed recently rely on relatively simple retrieval methods and homogeneous network environments.},

The goal of the Neu-IR (pronounced "New IR") workshop was to serve as a forum for academic and industrial researchers, working at the intersection of information retrieval (IR) and machine learning, to present new work and early results, compare notes on neural network toolkits, share best practices, and discuss the main challenges facing this line of research. In total, 19 papers were presented, including oral and poster presentations. The workshop program also included a session on invited "lightning talks" to encourage participants to share personal insights and negative results with the community. The workshop was well-attended with more than 120 registrations.},

abstract = {The use of contexts --side information associated to information tasks-- has been one of the most important dimensions for the improvement of Information Retrieval tasks, helping to clarify the information needs of the users which usually start from a few keywords in a text box. Particularly, the social context has been leveraged in search and personalization since the inception of the Social Web, but even today we find new scenarios of information filtering, search, recommendation and personalization where the use of social signals can produce a steep improvement. In addition, the action of searching has become a social process on the Web, making traditional assumptions of relevance obsolete and requiring new paradigms for matching the most useful resources that solve information needs. This escenario has motivated us for organizing the Social Personalization and Search (SPS) workshop, a forum aimed at sharing and discussing research that leverage social data for improving classic personalization models for information access and to revisiting search from individual phenomena to a collaborative process.},

abstract = {All search in the real-world is inherently interactive. Information retrieval (IR) has a firm tradition of using simulation to evaluate IR systems as embodied by the Cranfield paradigm. However, to a large extent, such system evaluations ignore user interaction. Simulations provide a way to go beyond this limitation. With an increasing number of researchers using simulation to evaluate interactive IR systems, it is now timely to discuss, develop and advance this powerful methodology within the field of IR. During the SimInt 2010 workshop around 40 participants discussed and presented their views on the simulation of interaction. The main conclusion and general consensus was that simulation offers great potential for the field of IR; and that simulations of user interaction can make explicit the user and the user interface while maintaining the advantages of the Cranfield paradigm.},

abstract = {Modern Web data is highly structured in terms of entities and relations from large knowledge resources, geo-temporal references and social network structure, resulting in a massivemultidimensional graph. This graph essentially unifies both the searcher and the information resources that played a fundamentally different role in traditional IR, and "Graph Search" offers major new ways to access relevant information. Graph search affects both query formulation (complex queries about entities and relations building on the searcher's context) as well as result exploration and discovery (slicing and dicing the information using the graph structure) in a completely personalized way. This new graph based approach introduces great opportunities, but also great challenges, in terms of data quality and data integration, user interface design, and privacy.We view the notion of "graph search" as searching information from your personal point of view (you are the query) over a highly structured and curated information space. This goes beyond the traditional two-term queries and ten blue links results that users are familiar with, requiring a highly interactive session covering both query formulation and result exploration. The workshop brought together researchers from a range of areas in information access, who worked together on searching information from your personal point of view over a highly structured and curated information space.},

abstract = {The previous workshop on "XML and Information Retrieval" was held in the context of SIGIR'2000 (Athens, Greece) and showed that there is a serious interest in managing semi-structured data from an IR (i.e., unstructured) perspective rather than from the dominating database (i.e., structured) perspective. As a direct outcome of the workshop, a special JASIS issue on XML and IR was edited and published in March 2002. The topic is still in its prime both in the Academia, as evidenced by XML related papers presented at SIGIR'2001, and in the business world with more search engines adding "XML support" as a requirement.The purpose of this workshop was to continue the effort of applying an "IR approach" to XML search and retrieval. We believe that this approach is crucial to extending the role of XML from pure data exchange in business-to-business applications to actual information exchange in end-users facing and Knowledge Management applications. As a side issue, we also intended to ask the IR community how it should relate, if at all, to the XQuery initiative at W3C. The workshop included 3 presentation sessions, for a total of 8 reviewed papers, an invited talk and a panel. The workshop attracted an audience of more than 30 people, who were encouraged to interact with the speakers as well as the audience.},

The importance of information access and information processing in industry and academia is growing in a revolutionary way, making the discussion on fundamental and long term aspects, and their relation to short term success and failure, more urgent than ever before. To highlight the increasingly strong connections between Information Retrieval and its neighboring disciplines, ICTIR'17 explicitly welcomed papers in IR areas that overlap with Human Information Access, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Perception. ICTIR'17 in Amsterdam was a memorable conference. For those who like numbers: we had 142 attendees (biggest ICTIR ever), and 97 submissions with 52 accepted (largest ICTIR ever), 450/250 euro registration for everything (cheapest ICTIR ever), and for the first time in history the organization and keynotes of a leading IR conference where majority female (but selected for being outstanding researchers, of course).},

The aim of the workshop was to bring together researchers in NLP and IR to discuss the use of lexical cohesion in text applications, such as document and passage retrieval, question answering, topic segmentation and text summarization. There were a number of related workshops in the past: MEMURA 2004 Workshop on Methodologies and Evaluation of Multiword Units in Real-World Applications in association with the 4th International Conference on Language Resources (LREC 2004) [1], Multiword Expressions: Integrating Processing Workshop in association with the 42nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2004) [2], and Multiword Expressions: Analysis, Acquisition and Treatment Workshop in association with the 41st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2003) [3]. The goal of this workshop was to address a wider range of lexical cohesion phenomena in text, not only multiword units, but also relations between words on the sentence, passage and document level, and how they can be useful for information retrieval applications.},

The goal of the workshop, co-chaired by Baeza-Yates and Maarek, was to complement the INEX (Initiative for the Evaluation of XML Retrieval) meetings that have been organized for the last two years, by providing researchers a useful forum for discussing (before implementing) and evaluating their models at INEX in the second half of the year. Our intent was twofold: first encourage the exchanges of ideas between researchers who are now active in this "sub-field" and, second, attract new interests. Our focus, like in previous editions of the workshop, was to address issues related to the application of IR methods to XML data for querying, retrieval, navigating, etc. We have gone a long way since the first edition in 2000, when XML was entirely dominated by the DB community. However, it seems that the expected breakthrough has not occurred yet, and it is not clear whether it is for lack of XML data, of appropriate technology, or simply of real needs in the marketplace.},

The workshop included a mixture of short introductions to selected NP methods, paper presentations and a panel discussion by invited scholars. Each session included significant time allotted to open discussions among the participants. The high attendance and the lively discussions demonstrated significant interest in the use of NP methods in information retrieval research. The panel and discussions pointed out many advantages of using these methods as a data source complementary to traditional measures but also potentially offering deeper insights into humans interacting with information. Significant challenges, such as the lack of baseline data and reference tasks, and a need to collaborate with neuroscientists, were also noted. Overall, the NP-methods were found to be very promising and worth continued research efforts.},

CAIR'17 brought together academic and industry researchers to present and discuss new research on conversational approaches to search, particularly over speech. As speech interfaces to devices are becoming more pervasive, and with the advent of Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), investigating and designing more effective and efficient means of interacting with information sources and search engines is growing in importance. Spoken interfaces to search engines opens opportunities through the possibility of greater interactivity but also requires rethinking, e.g., how results are presented. CAIR'17 addressed a range of such issues via invited keynote presentations, research papers presented orally and via posters, and a panel discussion involving researchers from interactive IR, IR evaluation, and spoken dialogue systems.},

The retrieval of such information will depend on time, place, history of interaction, task in hand, and a range of other factors that are not given explicitly but are implicit in the interaction and ambient environment, namely the context. IR research is now conducted in multimedia, multi-lingual, and multi-modal environments but largely out of context (Jarvelin &amp; Ingwersen, 2004; Ingwersen &amp; Jarvelin, forthcoming). However, such contextual data can be used effectively to constrain retrieval of information thereby reducing the complexity of the retrieval process. To achieve this, context models for different modalities will need to be developed so that they can be deployed effectively to enhance retrieval performance. Thus truly context-aware and -dependent retrieval will become feasible.},

Objections to its use fall into two main categories: first, that clustering is too slow for large corpora (with running time often quadratic in the number of documents); and second, that clustering does not appreciably improve retrieval.We argue that these problems arise only when clustering is used in an attempt to improve conventional search techniques. However, looking at clustering as an information access tool in its own right obviates these objections, and provides a powerful new access paradigm. We present a document browsing technique that employs docum-ent clustering as its primary operation. We also present fast (linear time) clustering algorithm.},

abstract = {We present a framework for information retrieval that combines document models and query models using a probabilistic ranking function based on Bayesian decision theory. The framework suggests an operational retrieval model that extends recent developments in the language modeling approach to information retrieval. A language model for each document is estimated, as well as a language model for each query, and the retrieval problem is cast in terms of risk minimization. The query language model can be exploited to model user preferences, the context of a query, synonomy and word senses. While recent work has incorporated word translation models for this purpose, we introduce a new method using Markov chains defined on a set of documents to estimate the query models. The Markov chain method has connections to algorithms from link analysis and social networks. The new approach is evaluated on TREC collections and compared to the basic language modeling approach and vector space models together with query expansion using Rocchio. Significant improvements are obtained over standard query expansion methods for strong baseline TF-IDF systems, with the greatest improvements attained for short queries on Web data.},

abstract = {Most previous investigations comparing the performance of different representations have used recall and precision as performance measures. However, there is evidence to show that these measures are insensitive to an important difference between representations. To explain, two representations may perform similarly on these measures, while retrieving very different sets of documents. Equivalence of representations should be decided on the basis of similarity in performance and similarity in the documents retrieved. This study compared the performance of four representations in the PsycAbs database. In addition, overlap between retrieved sets was also computed where overlap is the proportion of retrieved documents that are the same for pairs of document representations. Results indicate that for any two representations considered, performance values differed slightly while overlap scores were also low, thus supporting the evidence that recall and precision as performance measures mask differences between the sets of retrieved documents. Results are interpreted to propose an optimal ordering of the representations and to examine the contribution of each representation given this combination.},

These results indicate that while the absolute performance of a search on a particular collection is dependent on the palrwise similarity of the relevant documents, the relative effectiveness of clustered retrieval versus sequential retrieval is independent of this factor. However, retrieval of entire clusters in response to a query usually results in a poorer performance than retrieval of individual documents from clusters.},

The central ingredient in this approach is a statistical model of how a user might distill or "translate" a given document into a query. To assess the relevance of a document to a user's query, we estimate the probability that the query would have been generated as a translation of the document, and factor in the user's general preferences in the form of a prior distribution over documents. We propose a simple, well motivated model of the document-to-query translation process, and describe an algorithm for learning the parameters of this model in an unsupervised manner from a collection of documents. As we show, one can view this approach as a generalization and justification of the "language modeling" strategy recently proposed by Ponte and Croft. In a series of experiments on TREC data, a simple translation-based retrieval system performs well in comparison to conventional retrieval techniques. This prototype system only begins to tap the full potential of translation-based retrieval.},

This report presents the motivation, output, and research challenges of the second DATA:SEARCH workshop which was held in conjunction with SIGIR 2018, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. This workshop explored challenges in data search, with a particular focus on data on the web. The aim was to share and establish links between different perspectives on search and discovery for different kinds of structured data, which can potentially inform the design of a wide range of information retrieval technologies. The DATA:SEARCH workshop tries to bring together communities interested in making the web of data more discoverable, easier to search and more user friendly.},

abstract = {Language modeling approaches to information retrieval are attractive and promising because they connect the problem of retrieval with that of language model estimation, which has been studied extensively in other application areas such as speech recognition. The basic idea of these approaches is to estimate a language model for each document, and then rank documents by the likelihood of the query according to the estimated language model. A core problem in language model estimation is smoothing, which adjusts the maximum likelihood estimator so as to correct the inaccuracy due to data sparseness. In this paper, we study the problem of language model smoothing and its influence on retrieval performance. We examine the sensitivity of retrieval performance to the smoothing parameters and compare several popular smoothing methods on different test collection.},

abstract = {IR and OCR have largely developed independent standards and metrics, with OCR focused on literal accuracy, and IR focused on essential "content/meaning". With more and more media not only paper, but in multiple image formats, the opportunities and challenges for OCR on new formats -- video and still images -- are enormous. While OCR is assessed in metrics that emphasize words and characters, IR has learned to apply end-to-end metrics that ask whether the needs of the users can be met by existing systems. The same considerations apply also to the problem of providing permanent worldwide access to millions of pages of legacy print documents, representing the shared human record as it existed until just a few years ago.The International Society for Optical Engineering (SPIE) has held a series of Document Recognition and Retrieval (DRR) conferences. The tenth, DRR X will be held in January 2003, in Santa Clara California. In 2001, Dan LoPresti of Bell Labs decided that the area would benefit from more intense collaboration between those who specialize in finding the words on a page image, and those researchers who know how to find the right documents, given the words. He invited Paul Kantor (Rutgers) to join the DRR Chairs, and together they invited Dave Lewis (Consultant) to give a keynote address at DRR VIII. Dan then stepped down. Paul chaired DRR IX (2002) and then handed the reins to Tapas Kanungo (IBM, Almaden) and together they invited Jamie Callan (CMU), David Grossman (IIT) and Alex Hauptmann (CMU) to join the conference committee for DRR X.To improve communication between SIGIR and DRR, this group proposed a SIGIR workshop on this area. The workshop on "Information Retrieval and OCR: From Converting Content to Grasping Meaning" was intended to stimulate cross-fertilization between OCR and IR, in hopes that better use of IR will enable the OCR community to avoid expensive hand processing, and to demonstrate that the combination of present static and dynamic image processing and present state-of-the-art robust information retrieval can generate substantial advances in both extraction of messages from image streams and conversion of existing paper variants. It solicited papers dealing with future applications, such as the indexing and retrieval of text embedded in static or video graphic images, with problems of skew, distortion, and obscuration, as well as state-of-the-art discussions of the storage and retrieval of handwritten or print legacy materials.The workshop was held on August 15, 2002 in Tampere, Finland, immediately following the SIGIR 2002 conference. Although the workshop was intended to appeal to a wide range of IR and OCR researchers (and indeed was proposed at the request of colleagues from the OCR community), it primarily drew people with a background in IR. About a dozen people participated. The small size allowed a very interactive, seminar-style format and very vigorous discussion between and during presentations. Most presentations ran 30% to 50% longer than planned, and our impression is that most of the participants found it very productive.},

Document length normalization is used to fairly retrieve documents of all lengths. In this study, we ohserve that a normalization scheme that retrieves documents of all lengths with similar chances as their likelihood of relevance will outperform another scheme which retrieves documents with chances very different from their likelihood of relevance. We show that the retrievaf probabilities for a particular normalization method deviate systematically from the relevance probabilities across different collections. We present pivoted normalization, a technique that can be used to modify any normalization function thereby reducing the gap between the relevance and the retrieval probabilities. Training pivoted normalization on one collection, we can successfully use it on other (new) text collections, yielding a robust, collectzorz independent normalization technique. We use the idea of pivoting with the well known cosine normalization function. We point out some shortcomings of the cosine function andpresent two new normalization functions--pivoted unique normalization and piuotert byte size normalization.},

We demonstrate that our technique can produce highly accurate relevance models, addressing important notions of synonymy and polysemy. Our experiments show relevance models outperforming baseline language modeling systems on TREC retrieval and TDT tracking tasks. The main contribution of this work is an effective formal method for estimating a relevance model with no training data.},

abstract = {This paper proposes evaluation methods based on the use of non-dichotomous relevance judgements in IR experiments. It is argued that evaluation methods should credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This is desirable from the user point of view in modem large IR environments. The proposed methods are (1) a novel application of P-R curves and average precision computations based on separate recall bases for documents of different degrees of relevance, and (2) two novel measures computing the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. We then demonstrate the use of these evaluation methods in a case study on the effectiveness of query types, based on combinations of query structures and expansion, in retrieving documents of various degrees of relevance. The test was run with a best match retrieval system (In- Query I) in a text database consisting of newspaper articles. The results indicate that the tested strong query structures are most effective in retrieving highly relevant documents. The differences between the query types are practically essential and statistically significant. More generally, the novel evaluation methods and the case demonstrate that non-dichotomous relevance assessments are applicable in IR experiments, may reveal interesting phenomena, and allow harder testing of IR methods.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel way of examining the accuracy of the evaluation measures commonly used in information retrieval experiments. It validates several of the rules-of-thumb experimenters use, such as the number of queries needed for a good experiment is at least 25 and 50 is better, while challenging other beliefs, such as the common evaluation measures are equally reliable. As an example, we show that Precision at 30 documents has about twice the average error rate as Average Precision has. These results can help information retrieval researchers design experiments that provide a desired level of confidence in their results. In particular, we suggest researchers using Web measures such as Precision at 10 documents will need to use many more than 50 queries or will have to require two methods to have a very large difference in evaluation scores before concluding that the two methods are actually different.},

abstract = {Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing is a novel approach to automated document indexing which is based on a statistical latent class model for factor analysis of count data. Fitted from a training corpus of text documents by a generalization of the Expectation Maximization algorithm, the utilized model is able to deal with domain-specific synonymy as well as with polysemous words. In contrast to standard Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) by Singular Value Decomposition, the probabilistic variant has a solid statistical foundation and defines a proper generative data model. Retrieval experiments on a number of test collections indicate substantial performance gains over direct term matching methods as well as over LSI. In particular, the combination of models with different dimensionalities has proven to be advantageous.},

The workshop focused on discussing the challenges and difficulties of researching and studying collaborative information retrieval and seeking (CIS/CIR). After an introductory and scene setting overview of developments in CIR/CIS, participants were challenged with devising a range of possible CIR/CIS tasks that could be used for evaluation purposes. Through the brainstorming and discussions, valuable insights regarding the evaluation of CIR/CIS tasks become apparent ? for particular tasks efficiency and/or effectiveness is most important, however for the majority of tasks the success and quality of outcomes along with knowledge sharing and sense-making were most important ? of which these latter attributes are much more difficult to measure and evaluate. Thus the major challenge for CIR/CIS research is to develop methods, measures and methodologies to evaluate these high order attributes.},

abstract = {In this report we describe the outcome of the First International Workshop on Professional Search, held in co-location with SIGIR 2018. The workshop addressed the specific requirements and challenges of professional search, as opposed to web search. The workshop included a survey held among 113 professional searchers, two keynote talks, six short paper talks, and two break-out sessions. From all parts of the workshop, we concluded that (1) we can define professional search with a set of common characteristics; but (2) there are definitely differences between domains; (3) we are in need of more knowledge about the search process in different domains, and (4) we need to collect data, not only Cranfieldstyle test collections, but also user observation data that help us understand the challenges and requirements of professional search better. Currently, there are many open problems that potentially have an impact on the IR community beyond the professional domains. We therefore call the scientific IR community to address professional search more actively.},

The second, and major part, considers the broad aspects of information science as a field: origin, problems addressed, areas of study, structure, specialties, paradigm splits, and education problems. The third part discusses the limits of information science in terms of internal limits imposed by the activities in the field and external limits imposed by the very human nature of information processing and use. Throughout, issues related to users and use are transposed, as being of primary concern.},

Previously, RuSSIRs have taken place in Yekaterinburg, Taganrog, Petrozavodsk, Voronezh, Saint Petersburg, Yaroslavl, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod, and Saratov. Over these years, RuSSIR courses have been taught by world-renowned researchers and industry leaders in Information Retrieval and related areas.This year, we had a record number of around 120 participants in total (counting in students, teachers, organizers, and sponsors' representatives); there were 87 students attending RuSSIR 2018. While the majority of participants were from various Russian universities, there were also representatives from the USA, Spain, Ireland, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, Estonia, China, Germany, Italy, Denmark, Austria, and Finland. School participation was free of charge due to support from the school's sponsors. In addition, 10 international students and two teachers received travel support from the BCS IRSG and ACM SIGIR.},

abstract = {In this paper we overview the 2014 Entity Recognition and Disambiguation Challenge (ERD'14), which took place from March to June 2014 and was summarized in a dedicated workshop at SIGIR 2014. The main goal of the ERD challenge was to promote research in recognition and disambiguation of entities in unstructured text. Unlike many past entity linking challenges, no mention segmentations were given to the participating systems for a given document. Participants were asked to implement a web service for their system to minimize human involvement during evaluation and to enable measuring the processing times. The challenge has attracted a lot of interest (over 100 teams registered, and 27 of those submitted final results).In this paper we cover the task definition, issues encountered during annotation, and provide a detailed analysis of all the participating systems. Specifically, we show how we adapted the pooling technique to address the difficulties of gathering annotations for the entity linking task. We also summarize the ERD workshop that followed the challenge, including the oral and poster presentations as well as the invited talks.},

abstract = {Although we see the positive results of information retrieval research embodied throughout the Internet, on our computer desktops, and in many other aspects of daily life, at the same time we notice that people still have a wide variety of difficulties in finding information that is useful in resolving their problematic situations. This suggests that there still remain substantial challenges for research in IR. Already in 1988, on the occasion of receiving the ACM SIGIR Gerard Salton Award, Karen Sp\"{a}rck Jones suggested that substantial progress in information retrieval was likely only to come through addressing issues associated with users (actual or potential) of IR systems, rather than continuing IR research's almost exclusive focus on document representation and matching and ranking techniques. In recent years it appears that her message has begun to be heard, yet we still have relatively few substantive results that respond to it. In this paper, I identify and discuss a few challenges for IR research which fall within the scope of association with users, and which I believe, if properly addressed, are likely to lead to substantial increases in the usefulness, usability and pleasurability of information retrieval.},

abstract = {SIGIR, from its very onset in the early 1960's, has been concerned with the development of automatic information retrieval systems and with improving the effectiveness of automatic indexing. Automatic indexing is a subsystem, or component, of an automatic information retrieval system. The term "automatic" implies that the process is to be accomplished by a set of computer programs rather than by the intellectual effort of skilled people. The essential questions that need to be answered are how automatic indexing can:• Adequately represent the subject content of a document;• Improve recall by increasing the number of relevant documents retrieved;• Improve precision by decreasing the number of non-relevant documents retrieved.In this tutorial, I will review the basic and improved procedures that have been devised to respond to each of these questions. Finally, after we have reviewed developments in automatic indexing, we will consider the more radical questions of:• Whether we can rely exclusively on automatic indexing to achieve adequate retrieval effectiveness in online interactive document retrieval systems, and• Whether the traditional recall and precision ratios are the best criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of online retrieval systems.},

abstract = {The second workshop on Searching Spontaneous Conversational Speech (SSCS 2008) was held in Singapore on July 24, 2008 in conjunction with the 31st Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference. The goal of the workshop was to bring the speech community and the information retrieval community together. The forum was designed to be conducive to the close interaction and the intense discussion necessary to promote fusion of these fields into a single discipline with a concerted vision of spoken content retrieval. At the workshop, talks and posters were presented covering a wide range of topics including vocabulary independent search, spoken term detection, combination of models/indexes, use of speech recognition lattices for search, segmentation, temporal analysis, benchmarking, exploitation of prosody, speech surrogates for user interfaces and multi-language collections. Demonstrations of speech-based retrieval systems from a variety of application domains introduced a strong practical emphasis into the workshop program. The workshop concluded with a panel discussion, whose goal it was to identify future research directions for speech retrieval. Among the important challenges identified during the panel discussions were: dealing with large scale multimedia collections, representing audio/video content effectively in the user interface, focusing on perfecting the component technologies on which speech retrieval systems are based, and developing systems and approaches that will enable users (both content seekers and content providers) to actively create their own speech search applications or contribute to the indexability of their content.},

abstract = {Information retrieval is the process of finding relevant information in large corpora of documents based on user queries. Within the discipline there are a number of open research questions and areas. This thesis presents a systematic study into improving the speed of all aspects of an information retrieval system, without such improvements having an adverse effect on the effectiveness of that system.Several key areas of the indexing process were investigated: the effect of removing spam and correcting encoding errors at indexing time; the amount of parallelism and further improvements to the indexing process; the methods of vocabulary accumulation and collision resolution within a hash table; and as part of the indexing process, a new family of hash functions for information retrieval which exploit the properties of natural language was proposed.Search performance was also investigated by examining the effects of the spam removal on search quality. A relationship between the size of a collection and the pre-calculation of retrieval scores was discovered.Overall results indicate a 30% improvement of indexing throughput. This is accompanied by a 15% increase in search quality, whilst its speed could be increased by 25% without degrading quality. The pre-calculation of retrieval scores further improves retrieval speed by up to 3--.These results were compared against other open-source indexing systems by ATIRE when participating in the SIGIR 2015 RIGOR Workshop Reproducibility Challenge. The results of this challenge show that ATIRE is the fastest indexing system (taking half the time of the next best system), and the second fastest search system using the discovered relationship.},

abstract = {After two successful years at SIGIR in 2007 and 2008, the third workshop on Searching Spontaneous Conversational Speech (SSCS 2009) was held conjunction with the ACM Multimedia 2009. The goal of the SSCS series is to serve as a forum that brings together the disciplines that collaborate on spoken content retrieval, including information retrieval, speech recognition and multimedia analysis. Multimedia collections often contain a speech track, but in many cases it is ignored or not fully exploited for information retrieval. Currently, spoken content retrieval research is expanding beyond highly-conventionalized domains such as broadcast news in to domains involving speech that is produced spontaneously and in conversational settings. Such speech is characterized by wide variability of speaking styles, subject matter and recording conditions. The work presented at SSCS 2009 included techniques for searching meetings, interviews, telephone conversations, podcasts and spoken annotations. The work encompassed a large range of approaches including using subword units, exploiting dialogue structure, fusing retrieval models, modeling topics and integrating visual features. Taken in sum, the workshop demonstrated the high potential of new ideas emerging in the area of speech search and also reinforced the need for concentrated research devoted to the classic challenges of spoken content retrieval, many of which remain yet unsolved.},

abstract = {The need for a network of heterogeneous interactive bibliographic information retrieval systems is projected from the facts of wide acceptance and growing demand for these systems and the limitations of their use caused by limited online data base size. Because of the established characters of the different I-R systems and unlikelihood that a standardized I-R system leading directly to the ultimate uniform network will soon be generally adopted, we propose an intermediate solution in which computer interfaces would provide the networking capability by translating and converting among the diverse languages and data bases of existing systems.We have begun work on such a network in which the computer interface is based on the concept of a common language for commands, indexing vocabularies, and data base structures. In particular, the common language for commands and data base structures is based on identifying the basic or primitive I-R functions and bibliographic data base elements. The conversion among indexing vocabularies is based on the concept of a Master Index and Thesaurus containing the conglomerate thesaurus information from the separate data bases. In addition, the phrase decomposition and stemming of the individual words in the search request and subject index phrases are used as further techniques for automated conversion among diverse vocabularies. An initial experimental interface is described which interconnects the M.I.T.

abstract = {Due to the dramatically increasing amount of available data, effective and scalable solutions for data organization and search are essential. Distributed solutions naturally provide promising alternatives to standard centralized approaches. With the computational power of thousands or millions of computers in clusters or peer-to-peer systems, the challenges that arise are manifold, ranging from efficient resource discovery to issues in load balancing and distributed query processing.The 2009 edition of the Workshop on Large-Scale Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval (LSDS-IR'09) provided a forum for researchers to discuss these problems and to define new directions in research on Distributed Information Retrieval. The Workshop program featured research contributions in the areas of collection selection, similarity search, index compression, distributed indexing, query processing, distributed computing, and network formation. In addition, there were two industry talks on large scale Web search and distributed computing.},

abstract = {Most information retrieval technologies are designed to facilitate information discovery. However, much knowledge work involves finding and re-using previously seen information. We describe the design and evaluation of a system, called Stuff I've Seen (SIS), that facilitates information re-use. This is accomplished in two ways. First, the system provides a unified index of information that a person has seen, whether it was seen as email, web page, document, appointment, etc. Second, because the information has been seen before, rich contextual cues can be used in the search interface. The system has been used internally by more than 230 employees. We report on both qualitative and quantitative aspects of system use. Initial findings show that time and people are important retrieval cues. Users find information more easily using SIS, and use other search tools less frequently after installation.},

abstract = {Classic IR (information retrieval) is inherently predicated on users searching for information, the so-called "information need". But the need behind a web search is often not informational -- it might be navigational (give me the url of the site I want to reach) or transactional (show me sites where I can perform a certain transaction, e.g. shop, download a file, or find a map). We explore this taxonomy of web searches and discuss how global search engines evolved to deal with web-specific needs.},

abstract = {There is broad consensus in the field of IR that search is complex in many use cases and applications, both on the Web and in domain-specific collections, and both in our professional and in our daily life. Yet our understanding of complex search tasks, in comparison to simple look up tasks, is fragmented at best. The workshop addressed many open research questions: What are the obvious use cases and applications of complex search? What are essential features of work tasks and search tasks to take into account? And how do these evolve over time? With a multitude of information, varying from introductory to specialized, and from authoritative to speculative or opinionated, when should which sources of information be shown? How does the information seeking process evolve and what are relevant differences between different stages? With complex task and search process management, blending searching, browsing, and recommendations, and supporting exploratory search to sensemaking and analytics, UI and UX design pose an overconstrained challenge. How do we know that our approach is any good? Supporting complex search tasks requires new collaborations across the whole field of IR, and the proposed workshop brought together a diverse group of researchers to work together on one of the greatest challenges of our field. The workshop featured three main elements. First, two keynotes, one on the complexity of meaningful interactive IR evaluation by Mark Hall and one on the types of search complexity encountered in real-world applications by Jussi Karlgren. Second, a lively boaster and poster session in which seven contributed papers were presented. Third, three breakout groups discussed concrete ideas on: (1) search context and tasks, (2) search process, and (3) evaluation of complex search tasks. There was an general feeling that the discussion made progress, and built new connections between related strands of research in IR},

abstract = {The overall motivation for the Interactive Track (iTrack) at INEX is twofold. First, to investigate the behaviour of users when interacting with components of XML documents, and secondly to investigate and develop approaches for XML retrieval which are effective in user-based environments. One of the major outcomes of the track in 2004 was the need to investigate methods that can be supportive during the search process based on features extracted from the XML formatting[1][2]. Problems that might be solved using such methods include overlapping components and the presentation of retrieved elements in the result list. In the experimental system that was offered in 2005, these two issues were addressed. This offered the opportunity to study how overall user search behaviour was affected by these changes when compared to the behaviour observed in 2004. In addition, the following issues were addressed in 2005, following the recommendations of the INEX Methodology Workshop at the Glasgow IR Festival1.},

abstract = {The news industry has undergone a revolution in the past decade, with substantial changes continuing to this day. News consumption habits are changing due to the increase in the volume of news and the variety of sources. Readers need new mechanisms to cope with this vast volume of information in order to not only find a signal in the noise, but also to understand what is happening in the world given the multiple points of view describing events. These challenges in journalism relate to Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) fields such as: verification of a source's reliability; the integration of news with other sources of information; real-time processing of both news content and social streams; de-duplication of stories; and entity detection and disambiguation. Although IR and NLP have been applied to news for decades, the changing nature of the space requires fresh approaches and a closer collaboration with our colleagues from the journalism environment. Following the success of the previous version of the workshop (NewsIR'16), the goal of this workshop, held in conjunction with ECIR 2018, is to continue to stimulate such discussion between the communities and to share interesting approaches to solve real user problems. A total number of 19 submissions were received and reviewed, of which 12 were accepted for presentation. In addition to that, we had over 30 registered participants in the workshop who were pleased to attend the two keynote talks given by well-known experts in the field - Edgar Meij (from industry) and Peter Tolmie (from academia) and oral and poster presentations from the accepted papers. The workshop also included a breakout session to discuss ideas for a future data challenge in news IR and closed with a focused panel discussion to reflect on the day. In summary, several ideas were presented in the workshop on solving complex information needs in the news domain. In addition, the workshop concluded with suggestions of important challenges and shared tasks to work on as a community for News IR.},

abstract = {There is an increasing amount of structure on the web as a result of modern web languages, user tagging and annotation, emerging robust NLP tools, and an ever growing volume of linked data. These meaningful, semantic, annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information access, by enhancing the depth of analysis of today's systems. Currently, we have only started exploring the possibilities and only begin to understand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use.ESAIR'13 focuses on two of the most challenging aspects to address in the coming years. First, there is a need to include the currently emerging knowledge resources (such as DBpedia, Freebase) as underlying semantic model giving access to an unprecedented scope and detail of factual information. Second, there is a need to include annotations beyond the topical dimension (think of sentiment, reading level, prerequisite level, etc) that contain vital cues for matching the specific needs and profile of the searcher at hand.There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. Specifically, the discussion contributed to our understanding of the way forward. First, emerging large scale knowledge bases form a crucial component for semantic search, providing a unified framework with zillions of entities and relations. Second, in addition to low level factual annotation, non-topical annotation of larger chunks of text can provide powerful cues on the expertise of the search and (un)suitability of information. Third, novel user interfaces are key to unleash powerful structured querying enabled by semantic annotation|the potential of rich document annotations can only be realized if matched by more articulate queries exploiting these powerful retrieval cues|and a more dynamic approach is emerging by exploiting new forms of query autosuggest.},

However, many grand challenges remain. Recently, more and more attention has been paid to the research in domain specific IR applications, as evidenced by the organization of Genomics and Legal tracks in the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). Now it is the right time to carry out large scale evaluations on chemical datasets in order to promote the research in chemical IR in general and chemical Patent IR in particular. Accordingly, we organize a chemical IR track in TREC (TREC-CHEM) in order to address the challenges in chemical and patent IR.

In this essay, I argue that these definitions are inaccurate, fail to capture major threads of activity in IR research, and in particular are flawed because they omit the element of human participation in the retrieval process. After outlining some perspectives to consider in formulating better definitions, I offer an option, as an illustration of how the field might be presented; this option is centred on the purpose of IR, namely, support of cognition. There is an obvious need for a clear statement of the purpose of the discipline: information access is recognized as a human right and IR is the basis of a critical technology for providing that access -- one that is deeply intertwined with daily life and is changing human psychology. Well-grounded descriptions can encourage IR researchers to embrace a view of the field that enables richer connection with other disciplines, and should embody a vision of what IR research can accomplish.},

Second, an oral presentation session in which four papers were presented. Third, a discussion based on three seed research questions: (1) In what ways is collaborative search evaluation more challenging than individual interactive information retrieval (IIIR) evaluation? (2) Would it be possible and/or useful to standardise experimental designs and data for collaborative search evaluation? and (3) For evaluating collaborative search, can we leverage ideas from other tasks such as diversified search, subtopic mining and/or e-discovery? The discussion was intense and raised many points and issues, leading to the proposition that a new evaluation track focused on collaborative information retrieval/seeking tasks, would be worthwhile.},

abstract = {The practical goal of information retrieval (IR) research is to create ways to support humans to better access information in order to better carry out their tasks. Because of this, IR research has a primarily technological interest in knowledge creation -- how to interact with information (better)? IR research therefore has a constructive aspect (to create novel systems) and an evaluative aspect (are they any good?). Evaluation of IR effectiveness is guided by a theory on factors that affect effectiveness. True science is about theory development, i.e., understanding and explaining, making hypotheses and testing them. Theories express structured explanatory relationships between variables such as "type of document indexing" and "quality of ranking measured by MAP". Theories are the better, the wider range of phenomena they are able cover accurately. The paper argues that most existing theories of IR are focused on a narrow scope, theories of ranking. To fulfill its task of supporting human information access, theories that go beyond the evaluation of ranking are highly desired but face many challenges. We discuss three additional types of IR theories: theories of searching, theories of information access, and theories of information interaction.},

abstract = {We present a non-traditional retrieval problem we call subtopic retrieval. The subtopic retrieval problem is concerned with finding documents that cover many different subtopics of a query topic. In such a problem, the utility of a document in a ranking is dependent on other documents in the ranking, violating the assumption of independent relevance which is assumed in most traditional retrieval methods. Subtopic retrieval poses challenges for evaluating performance, as well as for developing effective algorithms. We propose a framework for evaluating subtopic retrieval which generalizes the traditional precision and recall metrics by accounting for intrinsic topic difficulty as well as redundancy in documents. We propose and systematically evaluate several methods for performing subtopic retrieval using statistical language models and a maximal marginal relevance (MMR) ranking strategy. A mixture model combined with query likelihood relevance ranking is shown to modestly outperform a baseline relevance ranking on a data set used in the TREC interactive track.},

The event was composed of a mix and blend of academics, experts and students wanting to learn, share and create evaluation resources for the community. The hacking was intense and the discussions lively creating the basis of many useful tools but also raising numerous issues. It was clear that by adopting and contributing to most widely used and supported Open Source IR toolkit, there were many benefits for academics, students, researchers, developers and practitioners - providing a basis for stronger evaluation practices, increased reproducibility, more efficient knowledge transfer, greater collaboration between academia and industry, and shared teaching and training resources.},

In particular, it is suggested that different test statistics should be used for providing additional information about the experiments other that the one provided by statistical significance testing. Kendall's τ is often used for testing-rank correlation, yet it is little appropriate if the objective of the test is different from what τ was designed for. In particular, attention should be paid to the null hypothesis. Other measures for rank correlation are described. If one test statistic suggests to reject a hypothesis, other test statistics should be used to support or to revise the decision. The paper then focuses on rank correlation between webpage lists ordered by PageRank for applying the general reflections on these test statistics. An interpretation of PageRank behaviour is provided on the basis of the discussion of the test statistics for rank correlation.},

This article includes a description of the motivations and goals of the workshop and syntheses of major workshop activities including pre- workshop identification of challenges by each participant and discussion breakout groups. Major themes of the workshop included the development of domain-neutral modeling techniques to represent tasks, task properties and task-related search behaviors, interface support tools to assist with a variety of task-related information behaviors and the identification of techniques and tools to evaluate task-based search systems. The most critical need identified was the development of task models; this was viewed as essential for addressing the challenges of tools and evaluation measures.},

When an experiment is repeated by a different researcher and exactly the same result is obtained, we can say the experiment has been replicated. When the results are not exactly the same but the conclusions are compatible with the prior ones, we have a reproduction of the experiment. Reproducibility and replication involve recommendation algorithm implementations, experimental protocols, and evaluation metrics. While the problem of reproducibility and replication has been recognized in the Recommender Systems community, the need for a clear solution remains largely unmet, which motivates the main questions addressed in the present workshop.},

In this essay, we review those questions and explore several further issues that affect the usefulness of recall. In particular, we ask whether it is reasonable to expect to be able to measure recall; whether some researchers are conflating the concepts of recall and answer set cardinality; and whether it is plausible that a user would rely on a belief that a system is "high recall" to deeply explore an answer list. Combined with earlier observations about the unknowability of recall, and the lack of a plausible user model in which recall is a measure of satisfaction, we conclude that use of recall as a measure of the effectiveness of ranked querying is indefensible.},

However, effective personalized search requires collecting and aggregating user information, which often raise serious concerns of privacy infringement for many users. Indeed, these concerns have become one of the main barriers for deploying personalized search applications, and how to do privacy-preserving personalization is a great challenge. In this paper, we systematically examine the issue of privacy preservation in personalized search. We distinguish and define four levels of privacy protection, and analyze various software architectures for personalized search. We show that client-side personalization has advantages over the existing server-side personalized search services in preserving privacy, and envision possible future strategies to fully protect user privacy.},

abstract = {There is an increasing amount of structure on the Web as a result of modern Web languages, user tagging and annotation, and emerging robust NLP tools. These meaningful, semantic, annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information access, by enhancing the depth of analysis of today's systems. Currently, we have only started exploring the possibilities and only begin to understand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use. The workshop had an interactive format consisting of keynotes, boasters and posters, breakout groups and reports, and a final discussion, which was prolonged into the evening. There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. Specifically, each of the breakout groups contributed to our understanding of the way forward. First, annotations and use cases come in many different shapes and forms depending on the domain at hand, but at a higher level there are commonalities in annotation tools, indexing methods, user interfaces, and general methodology. Second, there is a framework emerging to view annotation as (1) a linking procedure, connecting (2) an analysis of information objects with (3) a semantic model of some sort, expressing relations that contribute to (4) a task of interest to end users. Third, we should look at complex tasks that cannot be comprehensible articulated in a few keywords, and embrace interaction both to incrementally refine the search request and to explore the results at various stages, guided by the semantic structure.},

Recent years have witnessed the emergence of large scale human-curated knowledge bases as well as a growing array of techniques that identify or extract information automatically from unstructured and semi-structured sources. The ESAIR workshop series aims to advance the general research agenda on the problem of creating and exploiting semantic annotations. The eighth edition of ESAIR took place at CIKM 2015 in Melbourne, Australia, on the 23rd of October. Having a special focus on applications, we dedicated an "annotations in action" track to demonstrations that showcase innovative prototype systems, in addition to the regular research and position paper contributions. The workshop also featured invited talks from leaders in the field. This report presents an overview of the event and its major outcomes.},

They do not take full account of inflectional semantics nor, for example, diacritics or the use of capitals. Our main aim was to discuss the additional problems faced in non-English Web queries and to suggest techniques to improve the response of searching systems. Papers related to Arabic, Basque, Farsi (Persian), Greek, Spanish, Swedish, Hindi, Bengali and other south asian languages were accepted. Conclusions were that search engines would be more effective if they took more account of the properties of individual languages, and that there is a need for more studies of real user behaviour in practical situations.},

The goal of the ESAIR'14 workshop remained to advance the general research agenda on this core problem, with an explicit focus on one of the most challenging aspects to address in the coming years. The main remaining challenge is on the user's side---the potential of rich document annotations can only be realized if matched by more articulate queries exploiting these powerful retrieval cues---and a more dynamic approach is emerging by exploiting new forms of query autosuggest. How can the query suggestion paradigm be used to encourage searcher to articulate longer queries, with concepts and relations linking their statement of request to existing semantic models? How do entity results and social network data in "graph search" change the classic division between searchers and information and lead to extreme personalization---are you the query? How to leverage transaction logs and recommendation, and how adaptive should we make the system? What are the privacy ramifications and the UX aspects---how to not creep out users.There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. Specifically, the discussion contributed to our understanding of the way forward. First, for notable (head, shoulder, but not tail) entities in semantic search we have reached the level of quality at minimal costs allowing for deployment in major web search engines---the dream has become a reality. Second, entity detection is moving fast into domain specific, personal, and business domains, and has become a vital component for a range of applications. Third, semantic web has exchanged logic for machine learning approaches, and machine learning is the natural unification of semantic web and information retrieval approaches.},

What are essential features of work tasks and search tasks to take into account? And how do these evolve over time? With a multitude of information, varying from introductory to specialized, and from authoritative to speculative or opinionated, when to show what sources of information? How does the information seeking process evolve and what are relevant differences between different stages? With complex task and search process management, blending searching, browsing, and recommendations, and supporting exploratory search to sensemaking and analytics, UI and UX design pose an overconstrained challenge. How do we know that our approach is any good? Supporting complex search tasks requires new collaborations across the whole field of IR, and the proposed workshop brought together a diverse group of researchers to work together on one of the greatest challenges of our field.The workshop featured three main elements. First, a keynote on an emerging theory of task difficulty by Diane Kelly. Second, a lively boaster and poster session in which seven contributed papers were presented. Third, three breakout groups on: 1) user interfaces and user experience, 2) tasks and users, and 3) information needs on controversial topics. There was an general feeling that the discussion made progress, and built new connections between related strands of research in IR.},

abstract = {There is an increasing amount of structure on the web as a result of modern web languages, user tagging and annotation, emerging robust NLP tools, and an ever growing volume of linked data. These meaningful, semantic, annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information access, by enhancing the depth of analysis of today's systems. Currently, we have only started exploring the possibilities and only begin to understand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use. To complicate matters, standard text search excels at shallow information needs expressed by short keyword queries, and here semantic annotation contributes very little, if anything. The main questions for the workshop are how to leverage the rich context currently available, especially in a mobile search scenario, giving powerful new handles to exploit semantic annotations. And how can we fruitfully combine information retrieval and knowledge intensive approaches, and for the first time work actively toward a unified view on exploiting semantic annotations.There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. Specifically, each of the breakout groups contributed to our understanding of the way forward. First, there is a need for further integration of symbolic and statistical methods with each adopting parts of the other's strengths, by focusing on types of annotations that are informed by and meaningful for the task at hand, and relying on automatic information extraction and annotation based on web scale observations. Second, the discussion contributed to the creation of a concrete shared corpus with state of the art semantic annotation--in particular a web crawl annotated with Freebase concepts--that will benefit research in this area for years to come.},

abstract = {One of the primary ways researchers have characterized engagement is by an increase in search actions. Another possibility is that instead of experiencing increased engagement, people who click and query frequently are actually frustrated; several studies have shown that frustration is also characterized by increases in clicking and querying behaviors. This research seeks to illuminate the differences in search behavior between participants who are engaged and frustrated, as well as investigate the effect of task interest on engagement and frustration. To accomplish this, a laboratory experiment was conducted with 40 participants. Participants completed four tasks, and responded to questionnaires that measured their engagement, frustration, and stress. Participants were asked to rank eight topics based on interest, and were given their two most interesting and two least interesting tasks. Poor search result quality was introduced to induce frustration during their most interesting and least interesting tasks.This study found that physiological signals hold some promise for disambiguating engagement and frustration, but this depends on the time frame and manner in which they are examined. Frustrated participants had significantly more skin conductance responses during the task, while engaged participants had greater increases in skin conductance during the first 60 seconds of the task. Significant main and interaction effects for interest and frustration were found for heart rate in the window analysis, indicating that heart rate fluctuations over time can be most effective in distinguishing engagement from frustration. The multilevel modeling of engagement and frustration confirmed this, showing that interest contributed significantly to the model of skin conductance, while frustration contributed significantly to the model of heart rate.This study also found that interest had a significant effect on engagement, while the frustrator effectively created frustration. Frustration also had a significant effect on selfreported stress. Participants exhibited increases in search actions such as clicks and scrolls during periods of both engagement and frustration, but a regression analyses showed that scrolls, clicks on documents, and SERP clicks were most predictive of a frustrating episode. A significant main effect for interest was found for time between queries, indicating that this could be a useful signal of engagement. A model including the physiological signals and search behaviors showed that physiological signals aided in the prediction of engagement and frustration.Findings of this research have provided insight into the utility of physiological signals in distinguishing emotional states as well as provided evidence about the relationship among search actions, engagement and frustration. These findings have also increased our understanding of the role emotions play in search behavior and how information about a searcher's emotional state can be used to improve the search experience.},

abstract = {In information retrieval, federated search is the problem of automatically searching across multiple distributed collections or resources. It is typically decomposed into two subsequent steps: deciding which resources to search (resource selection) and deciding how to combine results from multiple resources into a single presentation (results merging). Federated search occurs in different environments. This dissertation focuses on an environment that has not been deeply investigated in prior work.The growing heterogeneity of digital media and the broad range of user information needs that occur in today's world have given rise to a multitude of systems that specialize on a specific type of search task. Examples include search for news, images, video, local businesses, items for sale, and even social-media interactions. In the Web search domain, these specialized systems are called verticals and one important task for the Web search engine is the prediction and integration of relevant vertical content into the Web search results. This is known as aggregated web search and is the main focus on this dissertation.Providing a single-point of access to all these diverse systems requires federated search solutions that can support result-type and retrieval-algorithm heterogeneity. This type of heterogeneity violates major assumptions made by state-of-the-art resource selection and results merging methods and motivates the development of new techniques.While existing resource selection methods derive evidence exclusively from sampled resource content, the approaches proposed in this dissertation draw on machine learning as a means to easily integrate various different types of evidence. These include, for example, evidence derived from (sampled) vertical content, vertical query-traffic, click-through information, and properties of the query string. In order to operate in a heterogeneous environment, we focus on methods that can learn a vertical-specific relationship between features and relevance. We also present methods that reduce the need for human-produced training data. In particular, we focus on the situation where we have vertical-relevance judgments for some verticals and want to learn a predictive model for a vertical associated with no training data.Existing results merging methods formulate the task as score normalization. In a more heterogeneous environment, however, combining results into a single presentation requires satisfying a number of layout constraints. The dissertation proposes a novel formulation of the task: block ranking. During block-ranking, the objective is to rank sequences of results that must appear grouped together (vertically or horizontally) in the final presentation. Based on this formulation, the dissertation proposes and empirically validates a cost-effective methodology for evaluating aggregated web search results. Finally, it proposes the use of machine learning methods for the task of block-ranking.This dissertation was completed at School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University under the advise of Dr. Jamie Callan (dissertation committee chair). Dr. Jaime Carbonell, Dr. Yiming Yang, and Dr. Fernando Diaz served as dissertation committee members. For the full dissertation, visit: http://ils.unc.edu/~jarguell.},

abstract = {Verifiability is one of the core editing principles in Wikipedia, where editors are encouraged to provide citations for the added statements. Statements can be any arbitrary piece of text, ranging from a sentence up to a paragraph. However, in many cases, citations are either outdated, missing, or link to non-existing references (e.g. dead URL, moved content etc.). In total, 20% of the cases such citations refer to news articles and represent the second most cited source. Even in cases where citations are provided, there are no explicit indicators for the span of a citation for a given piece of text. In addition to issues related with the verifiability principle, many Wikipedia entity pages are incomplete, with relevant information that is already available in online news sources missing. Even for the already existing citations, there is often a delay between the news publication time and the reference time. In this thesis, we address the aforementioned issues and propose automated approaches that enforce the verifiability principle in Wikipedia, and suggest relevant and missing news references for further enriching Wikipedia entity pages. To this end we make the following contributions as part of this thesis [1, 2, 3, 4]},

This is not an idle question; characteristics of the web, such as power law relationships, diameter, and connected components have all been observed within the scope of general web crawls, constructed by blindly following links. The .GOV collection is a fairly straightforward 18GB crawl of sites in the .gov domain. In contrast, WT10g was carved out from a much larger crawl specifically to be a web search test collection within the reach of university researchers. Do such collections retain the properties of the larger web? In the case of WT10g and .GOV, yes.},

Inter-disciplinary research across these tracks encourages advances in the development of databases, the extraction of information and the discovery of knowledge. This is precisely the focus of our article. We explain the research issues addressed in a Ph.D. workshop recently held at the ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management. This workshop had presentations on novel ideas addressing challenges in information and knowledge management. It covered a broad range of topics such as XML architectures, sensor data streams, personal information managers and text pre-processing. In this article, we provide an overview of the research problems and solutions discussed in the Ph.D. workshop. Our article thus describes the latest technological developments in information and knowledge management as seen by academia. This cutting edge technology also finds practical applications in the corporate world.},

abstract = {Document understanding for the purpose of assessing the relevance of a document or passage to a query based only on the document content appears to be a familiar goal for information retrieval community, however, this problem has remained largely intractable, despite repeated attacks over many years. This is while people are able to assess the relevance quite well, though unfamiliar topics and complex documents can defeat them. This assessment may require the ability to understand language, images, document structure, videos, audio, and functional elements. In turn, understanding of these elements is built on background information about the world, such as human behavior patterns, and even more fundamental truths such as the existence of time, space, and people. All this comes naturally to people, but not to computers.Recently, large-scale machine learning has altered the landscape. Deep learning has greatly advanced machine understanding of images and language. Since document and query understanding incorporate these elements, deep learning can hold great promise. But it comes with a drawback: general purpose representations (like CNNs for images) have proved somewhat elusive for text. In particular, embeddings act as a distributed representation not just of semantic information but also application-specific learning, which are hard to transfer. In short, conditions seem right for a renewed attempt on the fundamental document understanding problem.},

abstract = {Past decade witnessed an explosive growth in the amount of unstructured data, especially in the public domain, mainly due to Web 2.0 and social media. This led to the creation of applications, called information extractors, that extract structured information from unstruc- tured data. The extracted information is stored in a Knowledge Base (KB). KB stores facts about entities like name, type and other attributes. My PhD thesis entitled 'Named Entity Extraction for Knowledgebase Enhancement' deals with information extraction on named entities with the purpose of enhancing a KB. The enhanced KB is in turn used by the information extraction task to refine the extraction process. Thus, KB provides structure and guidance to the extraction task, and gets enhanced by the results of the extraction task. Here we see that the tasks of entity extraction and KB enhancement are mutually dependent and mutually beneficial. Hence in my research I propose methods to enhance both the tasks, in an effort to build a strong and sound named entity extraction system. Named Entity Extraction, also known as Entity Linking (EL) in scientific literature, is the task of determining the identity of entities mentioned in text. EL helps automatic extraction of structured information about entities from unstructured data, which is stored in the KB. EL consists of Mention Detection and Entity Disambiguation. In my research, I propose methods to enhance mention detection, entity disambiguation and KB enhancement.},

abstract = {Research in Information Retrieval has traditionally focused on serving the best results for a single query. Real users, however, often begin an interaction with a search engine with a sufficiently under-specified information need that they will need to reformulate before they find either the one thing or every thing they are looking for. We define a session as the sequence of queries and interactions that a user performs in service of an information need. The first workshop on Information Retrieval Over Query Sessions was held at ECIR 2011 in Dublin, Ireland, with the purpose of investigating questions of measuring, analyzing, and optimizing IR system behavior over a session of reformulations.},

abstract = {Due to the dramatically increasing amount of available data, effective and scalable solutions for data organization and search are essential. Distributed solutions naturally provide promising alternatives to standard centralized approaches. With the computational power of thousands or millions of computers in clusters or peer-to-peer systems, the challenges that arise are manifold, ranging from efficient resource discovery to issues in load balancing and distributed query processing.The 2008 edition of the Workshop on Large-Scale Distributed Systems for Information Retrieval (LSDS-IR'08) provided a forum for researchers to discuss these problems and to define new directions for the work on Distributed Information Retrieval. The Workshop program featured research contributions in the areas of similarity search, resource selection, network organization schemes, issues of data quality, result ranking techniques and query routing algorithms.},

The seminar title was interpreted in an IR-style "andish" sense (it covered also subsets of {Ranking, XML, Querying}, with larger sets being favored) rather than the DB-style strictly conjunctive manner. So in essence, the seminar really addressed the integration of DB and IR technologies with Web 2.0 being an important target area.},

abstract = {The news industry has gone through seismic shifts in the past decade with digital content and social media completely redefining how people consume news. Readers check for accurate fresh news from multiple sources throughout the day using dedicated apps or social media on their smartphones and tablets. At the same time, news publishers rely more and more on social networks and citizen journalism as a frontline to breaking news. In this new era of fastflowing instant news delivery and consumption, publishers and aggregators have to overcomea great number of challenges. These include the verification or assessment of a source's reliability; the integration of news with other sources of information; real-time processing of both news content and social streams in multiple languages, in different formats and in high volumes; deduplication; entity detection and disambiguation; automatic summarization; and news recommendation. Although Information Retrieval (IR) applied to news has been a popular research area for decades, fresh approaches are needed due to the changing type and volume of media content available and the way people consume this content. Hence, the first international workshop on recent trends in News Information Retrieval (NewsIR) was held in conjunction with ECIR 2016. As part of the workshop, we released a new dataset consisting of one million news articles to the research community. The workshop was very well attended with around 70 registered participants. We received a healthy number of 19 submissions in total of which 12 were accepted for presentation. In addition to that, we were pleased to have two keynote talks by well-known experts in the field - on with an industry background (Jochen Leidner) and one from academia (Julio Gonzalo). The workshop also included a breakout session to discuss ideas for a future data challenge in news IR and closed with a focused panel discussion to reflect on the day. Throughout the day the workshop stimulated discussions around new and powerful uses of IR applied to news sources and the intersection of multiple IR tasks to solve real user problems. In particular, several ideas were presented on solving complex information needs for media monitoring, event detection and summarisation. Moreover, and going forward, the workshop concluded with a long list of suggestions for shared tasks, and dataset requirements.},

For reaching this goal, we need a well-balanced interplay between theory building, hypothesis generation and testing via experimentation.},

New advances in biotechnologies have changed the face of biological research, particularly "high-throughput" techniques such as gene microarrays (Mobasheri, Airley et al., 2004). These not only generate massive amounts of data but also have led to an explosion of new scientific knowledge. As a result, this domain is ripe for improved information access and management.},

abstract = {Since the middle of last century, information retrieval has gained an increasing interest. Since its inception, much research has been devoted to finding optimal ways of representingboth documents and queries, as well as improving ways of matching one with the other. In cases where document annotations or explicit semantics are available, matching algorithms can be informed using the concept languages in which such semantics are usually defined. These algorithms are able to match queries and documents based on textual and semantic evidence.Recent advances have enabled the use of rich query representations in the form of query language models. This, in turn, allows us to account for the language associated with concepts within the retrieval model, in a principled and transparent manner. Developments in the semantic web community, such as the Linked Open Data cloud, have enabled the association of texts with concepts on a large scale. Taken together, these developments facilitate a move beyond manually assigned concepts in domain-specific contexts into the general domain.This thesis investigates how one can improve information access by employing the actual use of concepts as measured by the language that people use when they discuss them. The main contribution is a set of models and methods that enable users to retrieve and access information on a conceptual level. Through extensive evaluations, a systematic exploration and thorough analysis of the experimental results of the proposed models is performed. Our empirical results show that a combination of top-down conceptual information and bottom-up statistical information obtains optimal performance on a variety of tasks and test collections.The dissertation is available online at http://phdthes.is/.},

abstract = {With XML information retrieval, like in traditional IR, the user's information need is loosely defined, linguistic variations are frequent, and answers are a ranked list of relevant elements. Like in database querying, structure is of importance and a simple list of keywords may not be sufficient to define an XML query. Structured query languages for XML have been developed, but appear to be difficult to use even by system-level users, let alone end-users. Therefore developing natural language interfaces for XML-IR requires innovative solutions.INEX provides a framework (documents, topics and relevance assessments) for independent evaluation of XML-IR systems and approaches. In 2002 and 2003 systems in the Ad-hoc task accepted formal language queries (i.e. <title> elements) and produced results lists of relevant XML elements (usually well below the document root). In 2004 INEX introduced a Natural Language Processing task that operated in parallel with the Ad-hoc task (using the same topics and assessments) except that systems operated on XML natural language queries (i.e. &lt;description&gt; elements).In this report we describe the motivation for using NLP in XML IR, the general approaches that were tested at INEX 2005, and comment on the results.},

abstract = {Modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems, such as search engines, recommender systems, and conversational agents, are best thought of as interactive systems. And their development is best thought of as a two-stage development process: offline development followed by continued online adaptation and development based on interactions with users. In this opinion paper, we take a closer look at existing IR textbooks and teaching materials, and examine to which degree they cover the offline and online stages of the IR system development process. We notice that current teaching materials in IR focus mostly on search and on the offline development phase. Other scenarios of interacting with information are largely absent from current IR teaching materials, as is the (interactive) online development phase. We identify a list of scenarios and a list of topics that we believe are essential to any modern set of IR teaching materials that claims to fully cover IR system development. In particular, we argue for more attention, in basic IR teaching materials, to scenarios such as recommender systems, and to topics such as query and interaction mining and understanding, online evaluation, and online learning to rank.},

abstract = {In this thesis we study thoroughly sentence retrieval and novelty detection. We analyze the strengths and weaknesses of current state of the art methods and, subsequently, new mechanisms to address sentence retrieval and novelty detection are proposed.Retrieval and novelty detection are related tasks: usually, we initially apply a retrieval model that estimates properly the relevance of passages (e.g. sentences) and generates a ranking of passages sorted by their relevance. Next, this ranking is used as the input of a novelty detection module, which tries to filter out redundant passages in the ranking.The estimation of relevance at sentence level is difficult. Standard methods used to estimate relevance are simply based on matching query and sentence terms. However, queries usually contain two or three terms and sentences are also short. Therefore, the matching between query and sentences is poor. In order to address this problem, we study in this thesis how to enrich this process with additional information: the context. The context refers to the information provided by the surrounding sentences or the document where the sentence is located. Such context reduces ambiguity and supplies additional information not included in the sentence itself. Additionally, it is important to estimate how important or central a sentence is within the document. These two components, the context and the centrality of the sentences, are studied in this thesis following a formal framework based on Statistical Language Models. In this respect, we demonstrate that these components yield to improvements in current sentence retrieval methods.In this thesis we work with collections of sentences that were extracted from news. News not only explain facts but also express opinions that people have about a particular event or topic. Therefore, the proper estimation of which passages are opinionated may help to further improve the estimation of relevance for sentences. We apply a formal methodology that helps us to incorporate opinions into standard sentence retrieval methods. Additionally, we propose simple empirical alternatives to incorporate query-independent features into sentence retrieval models. We demonstrate that the incorporation of opinions to estimate relevance is an important factor that makes sentence retrieval methods more effective. In the course of our study, we also analyze query-independent features based on sentence length and named entities.The combination of the context-based approach with the incorporation of opinion-based features is straightforward. We study how to combine these two approaches and the impact of such combination. We demonstrate that context-based models are implicitly promoting sentences with opinions and, therefore, opinion-based features do not help to further improve context-based methods.The second part of this thesis is dedicated to novelty detection at sentence level. Because novelty is actually dependent on a retrieval ranking, we consider here two approaches: a) the perfect-relevance approach, which consists of using a ranking where all sentences are relevant (this is an ideal approach); and b) the non-perfect relevance approach, which consists of applying first a sentence retrieval method (therefore, the ranking may contain sentences that are not relevant).We first study which baseline performs the best and, next, we propose a number of variations. One of the mechanisms proposed is based on vocabulary pruning. We demonstrate that considering terms from the top ranked sentences in the original ranking helps to guide the estimation of novelty. The application of Language Models to support novelty detection is another challenge that we face in this thesis. We apply different smoothing methods (Dirichlet and Jelinek-Mercer) in the context of alternative mechanisms to detect novelty (Aggregate and Non-Aggregate Models). Additionally, we test a mechanism based on mixture models that uses the Expectation-Maximization algorithm to obtain automatically the novelty score of a sentence.In the last part of this work we demonstrate that most novelty methods lead to a strong re-ordering of the initial ranking. However, we show that the top ranked sentences in the initial list are usually novel and re-ordering them is often harmful. Therefore, we propose different mechanisms that determine the position threshold where novelty detection should be initiated. In this respect, we consider query-independent (a fixed position for all queries) and query-dependent approaches (cluster-based and normalized-score approaches).Summing up, we identify important limitations of current sentence retrieval and novelty methods and, along this thesis, we propose alternative methods that are novel and effective.The thesis is available for download at http://www.gsi.dec.usc.es/ir/.},

Rather than relying on the unrealistic assumption that people will precisely specify their intent when searching, we pursue techniques that leverage implicit information about the user's interests. This information is used to re-rank Web search results within a relevance feedback framework. We explore rich models of user interests, built from both search-related information, such as previously issued queries and previously visited Web pages, and other information about the user such as documents and email the user has read and created. Our research suggests that rich representations of the user and the corpus are important for personalization, but that it is possible to approximate these representations and provide efficient client-side algorithms for personalizing search. We show that such personalization algorithms can significantly improve on current Web search.},

These meaningful, semantic, annotations hold the promise to significantly enhance information access, by increasing the depth of analysis of today's systems. Currently, we have only started to explore the possibilities and only begun to understand how these valuable semantic cues can be put to fruitful use. The workshop had an interactive format consisting of keynotes, boasters and posters, breakout groups and reports, and a final discussion, which was prolonged into the evening. There was a strong feeling that we made substantial progress. Specifically, each of the breakout groups contributed to our understanding of the way forward. First, annotations and use cases come in many different shapes and forms depending on the domain at hand, but at a higher level there are remarkable commonalities in annotation tools, indexing methods, user interfaces, and general methodology. Second, we got insights in the "exploitation" aspects, leading to a clear separation between the low-level annotations giving context or meaning to small units of information (e.g., NLP, sentiments, entities), and annotations bringing out the structure inherent in the data (e.g., sources, data schema's, document genres). Third, the plan to enrich ClueWeb with various document level (e.g., pagerank and spam scores, but also reading level) and lower level (e.g., named entities or sentiments) annotations was embraced by the workshop as a concrete next step to promote research in semantic annotations.},

abstract = {Recent recognition in IR that people engage in information seeking sessions; attempts to formally model search sessions; and, the move toward evaluation of IR systems over entire search sessions, are evidence of a new, broader understanding of IR's goals. This move takes IR's goal beyond identification of relevant information objects, to supporting people in achievement of the goal or task which led them to engage in information seeking. The emergence of the term, interactive information retrieval, the amount of research conducted under that rubric, and the lack of agreement about how to conduct and evaluate such research, testify to both the significance and the difficulty of addressing this new goal. In this new context, IR faces daunting challenges, including: understanding why people engage in information seeking; identifying aspects of that condition that need to be considered in supporting them in achieving their goals; designing support for evolving user goals and knowledge; and, perhaps most daunting, how to evaluate, in ways as rigorous and successful as IR evaluation has been to date, IR systems which attempt to address this broader goal. I, and others, have proposed that moving from relevance to usefulness as the main criterion for evaluation of IR system performance, could provide a basis for addressing many of these challenges. In this paper, I discuss how such a move might be implemented, some possible alternative means for addressing this broader goal for IR, and what serious attention to users of IR systems, and their interactions with information objects and systems, could mean for research and practice of IR.},

The workshop, organised by Franciska de Jong (Utwente/TNO, NL), Arjen de Vries (CWI, NL) and Thijs Westerveld (CWI, NL) was an informal half-day meeting without papers or proceedings. Because the workshop was co-located with Thijs Westerveld's PhD defence, we were able to invite Alex Hauptmann (CMU, PA, USA) to give a talk. In total six speakers were invited to present their work related to the evaluation of multimedia retrieval. The workshop started with a talk presenting multimedia retrieval in practise. Then, three talks discussed experiments in the laboratory context of the TRECVID video retrieval benchmark. The afternoon ended with a presentation of a study of interactive experiments and a talk discussing metrics for measuring multimedia retrieval effectiveness.},

[13] wrote: "We observe that the rate of empirical advancement may not have been matched by consistent increase in the level of empirical rigor across the field as a whole." Their primary complaint is the development of a "research and publication culture that emphasizes wins" (emphasis in original), which typically means "demonstrating that a new method beats previous methods on a given task or benchmark". An apt description might be "leaderboard chasing"-and for many vision and NLP tasks, this isn't a metaphor. There are literally centralized leaderboards1 that track incremental progress, down to the fifth decimal point, some persisting over years, accumulating dozens of entries.Sculley et al. remind us that "the goal of science is not wins, but knowledge". The structure of the scientific enterprise today (pressure to publish, pace of progress, etc.) means that "winning" and "doing good science" are often not fully aligned. To wit, they cite a number of papers showing that recent advances in neural networks could very well be attributed to mundane issues like better hyperparameter optimization. Many results can't be reproduced, and some observed improvements might just be noise.},

abstract = {Literature-based discovery (LBD) research aims at finding effective computational methods for retrieving previously unknown information connections between clusters of research papers from disparate research areas. Existing methods encompass two general approaches. The first approach searches for these unknown connections by examining the textual contents of research papers. In addition to the existing textual features, the second approach incorporates structural features of scientific literatures, such as citation structures. These approaches, however, have not considered research papers' latent bibliographic metadata structures as important features that can be used for predicting previously unknown relationships between themThis thesis investigates a new graph-based LBD method that exploits the latent bibliographic metadata connections between pairs of research papers. The heterogeneous bibliographic information network is proposed as an efficient graph-based data structure for modeling the complex relationships between these metadata. In contrast to previous approaches, this method seamlessly combines textual and citation information in the form of path-based metadata features for predicting future co-citation links between research papers from disparate research fields. The results reported in this thesis provide evidence that the method is effective for reconstructing the historical literature-based discovery hypothesesThis thesis also investigates the effects of semantic modeling and topic modeling on the performance of the proposed method. For semantic modeling, a general-purpose word sense disambiguation technique is proposed to reduce the lexical ambiguity in the title and abstract of research papers. The experimental results suggest that the reduced lexical ambiguity did not necessarily lead to a better performance of the method. This thesis discusses some of the possible contributing factors to these results.Finally, topic modeling is used for learning the latent topical relations between research papers. The learned topic model is incorporated into the heterogeneous bibliographic information network graph and allows new predictive features to be learned. The results in this thesis suggest that topic modeling improves the performance of the proposed method by increasing the overall accuracy for predicting the future co-citation links between disparate research papers.},

abstract = {The online news landscape has been greatly affected by the emergence of user-generated content, as the general public summarise, discuss and comment upon news stories in real-time. Meanwhile, Web search engines serve millions of queries relating to news events each day, which could benefit from this new content. In this thesis, we investigate how user-generated content can enhance the news vertical aspect of a universal Web search engine, such that news-related queries can be satisfied more accurately, comprehensively and in a more timely manner. The aim is to provide end-users with an aggregate search result ranking that provides increased relevance and coverage of events for news-related queries. In particular, we focus on improving the search result ranking for those news-related queries that cannot be easily satisfied by newswire articles, either because the event that the user is searching for has just broken and hence no news articles have yet been published, or because current newswire articles are insufficiently detailed or out-of-date.To do so, we propose a news search framework to describe the news vertical aspect of a universal web search engine, comprised of four components, each providing a different piece of functionality. The top events identification component identifies the most important events that are happening at any given moment using discussion in user-generated content streams. The news query classification component classifies incoming queries as news-related or not in real-time. The ranking news-related content component finds and ranks relevant content for news-related user queries from multiple streams of news and user-generated content. Finally, the news-related content integration component aggregates the previously ranked content for the user query into the Web search ranking.For each component, we propose novel approaches that use user-generated content to enhance each. In particular, for top events identification, we propose a fully automatic real-time approach for the identification of currently important news-related events based upon voting theory. For news query classification, we propose a real-time classification approach that leverages recent discussions from multiple parallel news and user-generated content sources. To rank news-related content, we experiment with novel machine learned approaches that leverage the unique characteristics of the different user-generated sources used when ranking. Meanwhile, for news-related content integration, we adapt resource selection techniques to select and integrate the content ranked from different news and user-generated sources into an enhanced ranking to display to the end-user.We thoroughly evaluate these proposed approaches using standard TREC test collections (where possible) in addition to new evaluation datasets developed using crowdsourcing. Indeed, to facilitate our evaluation, we generated over 60,000 individual crowdsourced assessments. Moreover, we also performed a large-scale crowdsourced user-study examining whether users prefer the aggregate rankings produced by our news search framework in comparison to traditional Web search results. We show that user-generated content-enhanced approaches can effectively rank events by their current importance/newsworthiness; improve news-query classification accuracy; return additional relevant content for news-related queries in real-time (facilitating more comprehensive coverage of events); and enhance Web search rankings with additional content that end-users find useful. We conclude that user-generated content is indeed a very useful source of information to use in order to enhance a news vertical.This thesis opens up multiple promising directions for future research in the fields of news/social search, real-time classification and vertical integration, while providing new viable crowdsourced methodologies to evaluate approaches in these fields.Available Online at http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3813.},

abstract = {In the context of creating large scale test collections, the present paper discusses methods of constructing a patent test collection for evaluation of prior art search. In particular, it addresses criteria for topic selection and identification of recall bases. These issues arose while organizing the CLEF-IP evaluation track and were the subject of an online discussion among the track's organizers and its steering committee. Most literature on building test collections is concerned with minimizing the costs of obtaining relevance assessments. CLEF-IP can afford to have large topics sets since relevance assessments are generated by exploiting existing manually created information. In a cost-benefit analysis, the only issue seems to be the computing time required by participants to run (tens or hundreds of) thousands of queries. This document describes the data sets and decisions leading to the creation of the CLEF-IP collection.},

abstract = {XML is increasingly used to mark up content in present day information repositories. Over the last decade or so, retrieval from XML document collections has emerged as an area of active research. For the Information Retrieval community, XML retrieval poses a two-fold problem: finding effective techniques to retrieve appropriate or the most useful XML elements in response to a user query; anddevising an appropriate evaluation methodology to measure the effectivity of such retrieval techniques..This study examines both these issues. First, we revisited the pivoted length normalization scheme in the Vector Space Model using standard benchmark collections for XML retrieval. We reduced two parameters used in pivoted length normalization to a single combined parameter and experimentally found its optimum value, which works well at both the element and document levels for XML retrieval.We observed that a substantial number of focused queries used in XML retrieval clearly state, besides the information need, what the user does not want. We demonstrated that this negative information, if not handled properly, degrades retrieval performance. We proposed a solution for automatically removing negative information from XML queries. This led to significant improvements in retrieval results.On the evaluation of XML retrieval, we first studied the sensitivity &amp; robustness of various evaluation metrics and reliability and reusability of the assessment pool that has been used at INEX Ad Hoc track since 2007. Specifically we investigated the behaviour of the metrics when assessments are incomplete, or when query sets are small. We observed that early precision metrics are more error-prone and less stable under both these conditions. Average metric, however, performs comparatively better in this respect. System rankings remain largely unaffected even when assessment effort is substantially (but systematically) reduced. We also found that the INEX collections remain usable when evaluating non-participating systems.For a fixed amount of assessment effort, judging shallow pools for many queries is found to be better than judging deep pools for a smaller set of queries. However, when judging only a random sample of a pool, it is better to completely judge fewer topics than to partially judge many topics.We also proposed a simple and pragmatic approach of creating assessment pool for evaluation of retrieval systems. Instead of using an apriori-fixed pool depth for all topics, the pool is incrementally built and judged interactively on a per query basis. When no new relevant document is found for a reasonably long run of pool-depths, pooling was stopped for the topic. Our proposed approach offers a trade-off between the available effort and required level of performance. Moreover, it is flexible to deep pooling for potential topics in order to ensure better estimate of recall. We demonstrated the effectivity of the technique by substantially reducing the assessment effort without seriously compromising on the reliability of evaluation. The approach provided good results in the evaluation of XML retrieval as well as traditional document retrieval.This doctoral work was done at and submitted to the Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, under the supervision of Dr. Mandar Mitra. Dr. Ellen Voorhees and Dr. Tetsuya Sakai served as reviewers; Dr. Soumen Chakrabarti was the examiner at the defence of the thesis.Available online at http://www.isical.ac.in/?mandar/sukomal-thesis.pdf.},

abstract = {The proliferation of Web- and social media-based photo-sharing applications have not only opened many possibilities but also resulted in new needs and challenges. They have resulted in a large amount of personal photos being available for public access. One of the most interesting characteristics of these data is that they are surrounded by 1) textual annotations, also called tags, which are intended to describe and categorize, by collective user efforts, the uploaded resources 2) temporal information referring to when a pictures has been taken and often by 3) a locational information describing where the picture has been taken. Despite the recent developments and technological advances in Web-based mediasharing applications, the continuously increasing amount of available information has made the access to the photos a demanding task. In general, we can address this challenge by allowing photo collections to be organized and browsed through the concept of events. We also believe most users are familiar with searching photo collections using events as starting points.Aiming at supporting the detection and search of event-related photos, this thesis proposes a novel framework for extracting pictures related to real-life events from a collection of Web-images by leveraging on their temporal geographical and textual annotations and comparing the proposed approach with existing related state-of-the-art approaches. Second, a set of geographical features is proposed describing the characteristics of the geographical profile of query terms deriving concepts from exploratory analysis. Third, the thesis provides two different tag-based search framework to improve the effectiveness of searching images related to events. The first framework is based on temporal and geographical proximity of query terms to the temporal neighbours of a given timestamped query, while the second framework is based on a novel machine-learning based query expansion method combining the heterogeneous textual, temporal and geographical similarity between query terms and candidate expansion terms for the selection of the expansion terms given a free text textual query.All the proposed methods have been evaluated by performing extensive experiments on real data gathered from media-sharing applications on the Web. Where possible, comparison with related techniques has been performed to reinforce the validity of the presented approaches. The proposed methods have shown promising results in both the extraction and clustering of event-related images and searching event-related pictures by using metrics from the state of the art.This doctoral work has been performed at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) under advise of Associate Professor Heri Ramampiaro and with co-supervisors Associate Professor Roger Midtstraum and Associate Professor Randi Karlsen.

abstract = {This thesis has developed a theoretical framework to evaluate XML retrieval. XML retrieval deals with retrieving those document parts that specifically answer a query. It is concerned with using the document structure to improve the retrieval of information from documents by only delivering those parts of a document an information need is about. We define a theoretical evaluation methodology based on the idea of 'aboutness' and apply it to XML retrieval models.Situation Theory is used to express the aboutness proprieties of XML retrieval models. We propose a Situation Theory framework to evaluate XML retrieval, which is based on the basic and most general information retrieval question how a document (or in our case an XML element) can be about a query. This framework allows us to compare and analyze the reasoning behaviour of XML retrieval models experimented within INEX evaluation campaigns. We develop a dedicated methodology for the evaluation of XML retrieval and apply this methodology to five XML retrieval models from INEX. For each model we derive functional and qualitative properties that qualify its formal behaviour. We compare this behaviour with the underlying flat document retrieval model as well as with a model we specially design to determine how much an XML retrieval model includes XML structure in its reasoning behaviour.More INEX specific, this thesis further investigates the use of our theoretical evaluation methodology to describe the INEX evaluation methodology. We exemplify theoretical models of user agents and assessment procedures in INEX and derive reasoning assumptions that are included in the specific XML retrieval experimental evaluation, its scales and the ways assessments are done. We point to potential inconsistencies and make suggestions for alternative views on the experimental evaluation dimensions for XML retrieval. Further INEX specifics are discussed when we theoretically analyse filters, as they are used in INEX to deliver only specific answers to an information need. We introduce our theoretical methodology to analyse filters as special aboutness decisions, before applying it to the XML retrieval filtering models.We finally use the theoretical properties of XML retrieval models and their filters to explain experimental results obtained with some of the XML retrieval models within INEX and draw upon all our previous results to demonstrate how theoretical evaluation insights can be used to explain results from mainstream experimental evaluations. We relate our theoretical evaluation results with the experimental ones for XML retrieval to find out how the adjustment of existing flat document retrieval models compares to the creation of completely new ones, especially designed to meet the requirements of XML retrieval. For each of the XML retrieval experimental evaluation tasks, we shall determine the reasoning properties that support a good performance and discuss on this basis the experimental performance of the XML retrieval models.An updated version of the thesis will appear with IOS-Press: Tobias Blanke, Using Situation Theory to evaluate XML Retrieval, IOS-Press: Amsterdam, 2012.},

abstract = {This thesis presents research towards a core aim of information retrieval (IR): providing users with easy access to information. Three research themes guide the research presented in this thesis, contributing to three aspects of IR research: the domain in which an IR system is used, the users interacting with the system, and the different access scenarios in which these users engage with an IR system. Central to these research themes is the aim to gain insights into the behavior of searchers and develop algorithms to support them in their quest, whether it is a researcher exploring or studying a large collection, a web searcher struggling to find something, or a television viewer searching for related content.The first research theme is motivated by the information seeking tasks of researchers exploring and studying large collections. To enable their search on a larger scale, we propose computational methods to connect collections and to infer the perspective offered in a news story. Motivated by how historians select documents for close reading, we propose novel methods for connecting collections using automatically extracted temporal references. To illustrate how these algorithms can be used to automatically create connections between collections, we introduce a novel search interface to explore and analyze the connected collections. The interface highlights different perspectives and requires little domain knowledge. Based on how communication scientists study framing in news, we propose an automatic thematic content analysis approach.The second research theme is addressed in a mixed-methods study on how web searchers behave when they cannot find what they are looking for. Based on large-scale log analysis, crowd-sourced labeling, and predictive modeling we show behavioral differences given task success and failure. Based on these findings we propose ways in which systems can reduce struggling in search. To support searchers, we propose and evaluate algorithms that accurately predict the nature of future actions and their anticipated impact on search outcomes. Our findings have implications for the design of search systems that help searchers struggle less and succeed more.In the third and final research theme, we consider a pro-active search scenario, specifically in a live television setting. We propose algorithms that leverage contextual information to retrieve diverse related content for a leaned-back TV viewer. While watching television, people increasingly consume additional content related to what they are watching. Two methods to automatically retrieve content based on subtitles are introduced, one using entity linking, and one that uses reinforcement learning to generate effective queries for finding related content. Both methods are highly efficient and are currently used in a live television setting in near real time.Each research chapter in this thesis provides insights and algorithms that help searchers when using IR applications. For varying domains, users, and access scenarios, the research presented in this thesis improves the ease of access to information.},

abstract = {Selective search is a modern distributed search architecture designed to reduce the computational cost of large-scale search. Selective search creates topical shards that are deliberately content-skewed, placing highly similar documents together in the same shard. During query time, rather than searching the entire corpus, a resource selection algorithm selects a subset of the topic shards likely to contain documents relevant to the query and search is only performed on these shards. This substantially reduces total computational costs of search while maintaining accuracy comparable to exhaustive distributed search.},

abstract = {A concept hierarchy is a set of concepts and relations between those concepts. Since ancient times, concept hierarchies have been used to organize and access information. In some situations, task-specific and user-specific concept hierarchies are necessary to allow an overview and easy access a large set of documents. For example, in regulatory reforms, rule-makers in government regulatory agencies must quickly identify and respond to issues raised in public comments. A concept hierarchy constructed for a set of public comments hierarchically organizes the comments and a user is able to easily "drill down" into documents that discuss a specific topic.Particularly, this dissertation addresses how to construct concept hierarchies from text collections automatically or with a-human-in-the-loop. The novel metric-based concept hierarchy construction framework transforms concept hierarchy construction into a multicriterion optimization problem. It incrementally clusters concepts based on minimum evolution of hierarchy structure, as well as optimization derived from the modeling of concept abstractness and concept coherence. Moreover, this dissertation represents the semantic distance between concepts as a wide range of features, each of which corresponds to a state-ofthe- art concept hierarchy construction technique, such as lexico-syntactic pattern, contextual information, and co-occurrence. The use of multiple features allows a further study of the interaction between features and different types of semantic relations as well as the interaction between features and concepts at different abstraction levels.Besides the automatic framework for concept hierarchy construction, this dissertation also proposes an effective human-guided concept hierarchy construction framework to address personalization by learning from periodic manual guidance and directing the learned models towards personal preferences. Through human-computer interactions, the human and the machine work together to organize concepts into hierarchies. The machine's predictions not only save the user's effort but also make sensible suggestions to assist the user. This is one of the first works of real-time machine learning for organizing personalized information in an interactive paradigm.This dissertation also studies user behaviors during concept hierarchy construction. It explores whether people create concept hierarchies more quickly or more consistently using the proposed frameworks, whether there are consistent dataset-specific or user-specific differences in the hierarchies that people construct, whether people are self-consistent, and how these factors interact with different construction methods. The user study elaborates that dataset difficulty is a major factor affecting how people organize information into concept hierarchies. It also reveals that people are quite self-consistent in building hierarchies. This novel finding provides foundations to study the differences in concept hierarchy construction behaviors between individuals.Last but not least, the dissertation proposes a novel similarity metric for measuring hierarchy similarity. Fragment-based Similarity (FBS) employs a unique bag-of-word representation for hierarchies and takes a fragment-based view to calculate hierarchy similarity. FBS well approximates tree edit distance and greatly improves tree edit distance's efficiency from NP-hard to only O(n3) and O(n) if pairwise node similarities are pre-calculated.The research in this dissertation is an important step forward of concept hierarchy construction. It addresses important problems of concept hierarchy construction, especially considers how to better model these problems with good theoretical foundations, to study these problems via extensive empirical experiments and user studies, and to solve these problems by developing practical applications for constructing personal concept hierarchies.

abstract = {Modern cities are increasingly becoming smart where a digital knowledge infrastructure is deployed by local authorities (e.g. City councils and municipalities) to better serve the information needs of their citizens, and to ensure the sustainability and efficient use of power and resources. This knowledge infrastructure consists of a wide range of systems from lowlevel physical sensors to advanced sensing devices through social sensors. The i-ASC 2014 workshop was the first international event, within the Information Retrieval (IR) community, that is dedicated to research on smart/future cities. In particular, the workshop was a venue for research on digesting the city's data streams and knowledge databases in order to serve the information needs of citizens and support decision making for local authorities. Possible use cases include helping tourists to find interesting places to go or activities to do while visiting a city, or assisting journalists in reporting local incidents. Indeed, the workshop was intended to foster the development of new information access and retrieval models that can harness effectively and efficiently the large number of heterogeneous big data streams in a city to provide a new generation of information services. The workshop was well attended, where more than 45 participants were officially registered. It featured two keynote talks from industry (IBM andWaag Society) and two invited talks from academia (Pisa and Edinburgh). In addition, seven refereed papers were presented before breakout groups considered questions and issues identified from a panel discussion.},

abstract = {Daily amount of news reporting real-world events is growing exponentially. At the same time, Organizations are looking for information about current and past events that affects them, such as mergers and acquisitions of companies. The Organizations need to obtain event information in a fast and summarized form to make decisions. Event-based retrieval and summarization systems offer an efficient solution to this problem. Most summarization research work uses news stories. Although this type of documents is characterized by conveying information about events, almost all work concentrates on approaches that do not take into account this aspect.The proposed multi-document summarization methods are based on the hierarchical combination of single-document summaries. We improved our multi-document summarization methods using event information. Our approach is based on a two-stage single-document method that extracts a collection of key phrases, which are then used in a centrality-asrelevance passage retrieval model. To adapt centrality-as-relevance single-document summarization for multi-document summarization that is able to use event information, we needed a good and adaptable baseline system. Because the key phrase extraction play a significant role in the summarization, we improved a state-of-the-art key phrase extraction toolkit using four additional sets of semantic features. The event detection method is based on Fuzzy Fingerprint, which is a supervised method trained on documents with annotated event tags. We explored three different ways to integrate event information, achieving state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-document summarization using filtering and event-based features. To cope with the possible usage of different terms to describe the same event, we explored distributed representations of text in the form of word embeddings, which contributed to improve the multi-document summarization results.The automatic evaluation and user study performed show that these methods improve upon current state-of-the-art multi-document summarization systems on two mainstream evaluation datasets, DUC 2007 and TAC 2009. We show a relative improvement in ROUGE- 1 scores of 16% for TAC 2009 and of 17% for DUC 2007. We have also obtained improvements in ROUGE-1 upon current state-of-the-art single-document summarization systems of between 32% in clean data and 19% in noisy data. These improvements derived from the inclusion of key phrases and event information. The extraction of key phrases was also refined with additional pre-processing steps and features, which lead to a relative improvement in NDCG scores of 9%. The introduction of Fuzzy Fingerprints for event detection enabled the detection of all event types, while the best competitor, an SVM with enhanced features, only detects roughly 85% of the different types of events. This lead to a large increase in the G-Mean and variants results when using the Fuzzy Fingerprints method.This doctoral work was carried under the Dual Ph.D. program in Languages and Information Technologies of Carnegie Mellon Portugal Program. The program took place at both the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and at the Department of Computer of Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior T\'{e}cnico (IST).

In information retrieval, visualization is still perceived as a front-end or user facing feature while, at the same time, it can be very effective in the back-end for data analysis. Currently, the research community does not sufficiently analyze the reasons underlying the assessments they use for evaluation, which may lead to bias or error when reporting system performance. In this paper we examine the integration of information visualization techniques for visually exploring and analyzing relevance assessments. We argue that visual tools should be integrated as a core component of the infrastructure for relevance assessment and evaluation.},

abstract = {In the modern world, networked sensor technology makes it possible to capture the world around us in real-time. In the security domain cameras are an important source of information. Cameras in public places, bodycams, drones and recordings with smart phones are used for real time monitoring of the environment to prevent crime (monitoring case); and/or for investigation and retrieval of crimes, for example in evidence forensics (forensic case). In both cases it is required to quickly obtain the right information, without having to manually search through the data. Currently, many algorithms are available to index a video with some pre-trained concepts, such as people, objects and actions. These algorithms require a representative and large enough set of examples (training data) to recognize the concept. This training data is, however, not always present. In this thesis, we aim to assist an analyst in their work on video stream data by providing a search capability that handles ad-hoc textual queries, i.e. queries that include concepts or events that are not pre-trained. We use the security domain as inspiration for our work, but the analyst can be working in any application domain that uses video stream data, or even indexed data. Additionally, we do only consider the technical aspects of the search capability and not on the legal, ethical or privacy issues related to video stream data. We focus on the retrieval of high-level events, such as birthday parties. We assume that these events can be composed of smaller pre-trained concepts, such as a group of people, a cake and decorations and relations between those concepts, to capture the essence of that unseen event (decompositionality assumption). Additionally, we hold the open world assumption, i.e. the system does not have complete world knowledge. Although current state of the art systems are able to detect an increasingly large number of concepts, this number still falls far behind the near infinite number of possible (textual) queries that a system needs to be able to handle. In our aim to assist the analyst, we focus on the improvement of the visual search effectiveness (e.g. performance) by a semantic query-to-concept mapping: the mapping from the user query to the set of pre-trained concepts. We use the TRECVID Multimedia Event Detection benchmark, as it contains high-level events inspired by the security domain. In this thesis, we show that the main improvements can be achieved by using a combination of i) queryto- concept mapping based on semantic word embeddings (+12%), ii) exploiting user feedback (+26%) and iii) fusion of different modalities (data sources) (+17%). First, we propose an incremental word2vec (i-w2v) method [1], which uses word2vec trained on GoogleNews items as a semantic embedding model and incrementally adds concepts to the set of selected concepts for a query in order to deal with query drift. This method improve performance in terms of MAP compared to the state of the art word2vec method and knowledge based techniques. In combination with a state of the art video event retrieval pipeline, we achieve top performance on the TRECVID MED benchmark regarding the zero-example task (MED14Test results). This improvement is, however, dependent on the availability of the concepts in the Concept Bank: without concepts related to or occurring in the event, we cannot detect the event. We, thus, need a properly composed Concept Bank to properly index videos. Second, we propose an Adaptive Relevance Feedback interpretation method named ARF [2] that not only achieves high retrieval performance, but is also theoretically founded through the Rocchio algorithm from the text retrieval field. This algorithm is adjusted to the event retrieval domain in a way that the weights for the concepts are changed based on the positive and negative annotations on videos. The ARF method has higher visual search effectiveness compared to k-NN based methods on video level annotations and methods based on concept level annotations. Third, we propose blind late fusion methods that are based on state of the art methods [3], such as average fusion or fusion based on probabilities. Especially the combination of a Joint Ratio (ratio of probabilities) and Extreme Ratio (ratio of minimum and maximum) method (JRER) achieves high performance in cases with reliable detectors, i.e. enough training examples. This method is not only applicable to the video retrieval field, but also in sensor fusion in general. Although future work can be done in the direction of implicit query-to-concept mapping through deep learning methods, smartly combining the concepts and the usage of spatial and temporal information, we have shown that our proposed methods can improve the visual search effectiveness by a semantic query-to-concept mapping which brings us a step closer to a search capability that handles ad-hoc textual queries for analysts.},

abstract = {Although there has been a great deal of research into Collaborative Information Retrieval/Seeking (CIR/S), the majority has assumed that team members in a collaborative search team always have the same level of unrestricted access to information. However, observations from different domains such as healthcare, business, government, etc. have suggested that collaboration sometimes involves people with differing levels of access to information. This type of scenario has been referred to as Multi-Level Collaborative Information Retrieval (MLCIR). As well as a support for collaboration, MLCIR must consider information flow, security and shareability between collaborators. Therefore, existing CIR/S interface components and concepts (e.g. awareness, division of labour, persistence, etc.) may not be directly applicable to MLCIR. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any systematic evaluations to investigate the impact of MLCIR on search outcomes and to provide user-centred design recommendations for MLCIR interfaces. To address this gap, a number of studies were conducted using real-world MLCIR examples as scenarios. This thesis highlights four research objectives; these are: 1) to investigate the impact of different collaborative search strategies and MLCIR scenarios on search outcomes using a user simulation approach, 2) to develop a preliminary MLCIR interface and investigate the impact of MLCIR scenarios on search outcomes using a user study, 3) to investigate the impact of existing CIR concepts on MLCIR search outcomes using a user study, and 4) to develop and evaluate a working prototype of an MLCIR interface that supports users for asynchronous collaboration. These investigations followed an iterative approach until a final MLCIR interface could be produced. The first study was a user simulated study which allowed us to test a large number of variables and to pick prominent ones for further user studies. It was found that when relevance feedback search strategies were used, search performance of non-full access (where team members had 90% access to collection) outperformed full access (where team members had 100% access to collection). This simulated study also fulfilled the first research objective. Next, a preliminary user study was conducted using variables selected based on the findings of the simulated study. This study uncovered a number of interface components, and awareness concepts such as query awareness, result awareness and team awareness that could be used to support users in MLCIR scenarios. This user study addressed the second research objective. Based on findings from this user study, two further user studies were conducted where we evaluated a number of interface components implemented to support query awareness, result awareness and team awareness. Results suggested that having access to query properties and result properties in MLCIR scenarios can leverage team members? search performance. These two user studies addressed the third research objective. Finally, a working MLCIR interface was built based on the findings elicited from our previous user studies. The interface was then evaluated using the web and non-uniform information access scenarios. The results showed that blacklisting search terms had a significant negative impact on search outcome than blacklisting documents (f-measure: 0.04 vs 0.197). This study fulfilled the final research objective. All five studies presented in this thesis provided us with an increasing understanding of how to develop an MLCIR interface that is usable and helpful for users. As a final product, a working MLCIR interface was produced which could provide collaborating users with useful awareness information without disclosing any sensitive data. Overall, this thesis provided important new design suggestions and showed reusability of CIR components for MLCIR interfaces, something that has never been demonstrated before. The interfaces, experimental designs and findings including design suggestions that are presented in this thesis serve as novel guidelines for further investigations into MLCIR.},

abstract = {At the beginning of the twenty-first century, the web entered a phase of explosive growth. Since then, a multitude of platforms has become available for users to publish information, communicate with others, connect to like-minded individuals, and share anything that they want to share. These platforms are commonly known as social media. Social media enables many-to-many communication: many people can create content, which in turn can be read by many others. To make interesting content findable for many people, machines need to be able to identify the "right" pieces of content or the "appropriate" content creators. That is, we need ways to intelligently access information in social media.The main motivation for the research in my thesis is that we want to enable intelligent access to, and analysis of, the information contained in social media. To this end, we must determine the topical relevance of social media documents, while countering the specific challenges posed by their noisy and creative nature. We identify two entry points for accessing information in social media: (i) the people creating the social media and (ii) their individual utterances (e.g., blog posts, tweets). These entry points act as a doorway to the information in social media. The aim of the thesis is to improve searching for people and their utterances in social media, thereby offering intelligent access to the information it contains.In the thesis we explore ways to improve retrieval effectiveness, for both people and their utterances, in five research chapters. We start with an extensive analysis of the query logs of a people search engine and show that users are mainly interested in finding social media profiles of people for whom they search. We continue with our focus on searching for people in the second chapter, but adopt a more technical perspective. We use blog posts as representation of bloggers' interests and show that for blogger finding a combination of two models, one based on individual blog posts and one on aggregated blogger models, is both effective and efficient.In the remaining three chapters we move away from finding people and focus on individual utterances. Specifically, we look at blog post retrieval in two chapters and email retrieval in mailing lists in the last chapter. For blog post retrieval we explore the use of indicators obtained from a credibility framework. We propose ways of estimating these indicators and rerank an initial list of blog posts based on these (combined) indicator scores. We find that incorporating these indicators leads to improvements and our analysis determines indicators that are most influential.The second chapter on blog post retrieval and the chapter on email search both use a notion of "context" to help improve retrieval effectiveness. For blog post retrieval we observe that much of what is written in blog posts is based on things happening the bloggers' environments. To use this observation we propose a generative retrieval model that uses information from a set of external sources. We test our model using a news collection, Wikipedia, and a web collection as external sources. We find that our model is capable of improving retrieval performance on most topics and that the per-topic collection importance is a very useful component of the model. Finally, the last research chapter uses the direct context of emails to refine queries; we explore the use of threads, the entire mailing list, and the pages from within the same community as sources for query expansion terms. Besides that, we also incorporate the previously mentioned credibility-inspired indicators in this setting. We find that context helps in improving retrieval performance, as do the credibilityinspired indicators.Concluding, my thesis provides new insights into search behavior in social media and shows that a diverse set of methods can help improve retrieval effectiveness for multiple information access tasks within social media.Available online at http://wouter.weerkamp.com/.},

The retrieval task in the track is a traditional ad hoc retrieval task where the evaluation methodology emphasizes a system's least effective topics. The most promising approach to improving poorly performing topics is exploiting text collections other than the target collection such as the web.The track has also investigated appropriate evaluation measures to support the focus on ineffective topics. Traditional measure are dominated by the better-performing topics, and the first two measures used in the track that do emphasize the poorly performing topics are unstable in practice. A third measure, a variant of the traditional MAP measure that uses a geometric mean rather than an arithmetic mean to average individual topic results, shows promise of giving appropriate emphasis to poorly performing topics while being more stable at equal topic set sizes.},

abstract = {The Web has profoundly changed the way we access information. The increase in the amount of information available and the easy access to the Web have contributed to the popularity of search in this medium. While this is true in several domains, it is particularly significant in the health domain. In fact, search for health information is the third most popular online activity and it is performed by almost 3 out of 4 American Internet users. Besides its popularity, health web search is particularly important to inform health consumers, encouraging them to become more participatory in their health management. In the health domain, the context surrounding the search is extremely rich and we believe it can contribute to improve system's performance. Although information retrieval has made significant progresses supporting its retrieval methods solely on the query and document collection, it has been recognized that context should be explored. Context can, for example, be used to disambiguate a query, to retrieve documents adjusted to the expertise of the searcher or to adjust documents to the patient's medical record.In this dissertation we investigate the effects of context features in consumer health information retrieval. In addition, we propose and evaluate strategies to use context features in query formulation support. The popularity of web search on the health domain made us focus on Web retrieval. We opt to concentrate on health consumers due to the lack of research focusing on this specific public. The thesis behind our work is that consumer health information retrieval is affected by context features, which can be used in query formulation support to improve retrieval performance.In three exploratory studies, we analyze how a large number of features affect different outcomes of the retrieval process. Based on findings from these studies and on the importance of query formulation support in a domain where terminology can be a barrier and translations to other languages are not always obvious, we explored the impact of query translations in users with different characteristics. Based on the assumption that a query using a language that is popular on the Web may easily reach high-quality contents, one study analyzes the effects of translating a query to the English language in users with different levels of English proficiency. Findings show that users having, at least, elementary English proficiency benefit from English query suggestions. The other studies focus on query terminology translation, that is, translation between lay and medico-scientific terminology, considering users' health literacy and topic familiarity. Although several strategies have been previously proposed to overcome the terminology gap between health consumers and web documents, none considers users health literacy and topic familiarity. Findings suggest that users with inadequate health literacy and users who are unfamiliar with the topic should be provided with recommendations of lay queries. On the other hand, users with higher health literacy or higher topic familiarity should be given alternative queries using medico-scientific terminology.Based on the above findings, we developed a query suggestion system that, using domain information gathered from an existing consumer health vocabulary, identifies the medical concepts included in the query and returns four types of suggestions combining the Portuguese or English languages with the lay or medico-scientific terminologies. We found that suggestions offered by the system had a good acceptance, with English suggestions being preferred to Portuguese ones in basic and proficient users and medico-scientific suggestions being preferred to lay ones in higher levels of health literacy. We concluded that a retrieval system including the implemented suggestion strategy without any kind of personalization tends to be better than a system without suggestions with respect to precision, correctness of the resulting knowledge and also of its incorrectness. We also concluded that this system tends to be slightly worse in terms of motivational relevance. Of these, only the incorrectness difference is significant. This is extremely relevant in the health domain where incorrect information can have serious consequences. Moreover, we also found that the personalization of this system to users' English proficiency and health literacy, biasing users towards the suggestions more beneficial to them, outperforms the system without personalization, in terms of medical accuracy of the obtained knowledge.},

abstract = {Question Answering (QA) is the task of searching a large text collection for specific answers to questions posed in natural language. Though they often have access to rich linguistic and semantic analyses of their input questions, QA systems often rely on off-theshelf bag-of-words Information Retrieval (IR) solutions to retrieve passages matching a set of terms extracted from the question.There is a fundamental disconnect between the capabilities of the bag-of-words retrieval model and the retrieval needs of the QA system. Bag-of-words IR retrieves documents matching a query, but the QA system really needs documents that contain answers. Through question analysis, the QA system has compiled a sophisticated information need representation for what constitutes an answer to the question. This representation is composed of a set of linguistic and semantic constraints satisfied by answer-bearing passages. Unfortunately, off-the-shelf IR libraries commonly used in QA systems can not, in general, check these types of constraints at query-time. Poor quality retrieval can cause a QA system to fail if no answer-bearing text is retrieved, if it is not ranked highly enough, or if it is outranked or overwhelmed by false positives, text that matches the query well, yet supports a wrong answer.This thesis proposes two linguistic and semantic passage retrieval methods for QA, one based on structured retrieval and the other on rank-learning techniques. In addition, a methodology is proposed for mapping annotated text consisting of labeled spans and typed relations between them into an annotation graph representation. The annotation graph supports query-time linguistic and semantic constraint-checking, and serves as a unifying formalism for the QA system's information need and for retrieved passages. The proposed methods rely only on the relatively weak assumption that the QA system's information need can be represented as an annotation graph. The two approaches are shown to retrieve more answer-bearing text, more highly ranked, compared to a bag-of-words baseline for two different QA tasks. Linguistic and semantic passage retrieval methods are also shown to improve end-to-end QA system accuracy and answer MRR.Available online at: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mbilotti/thesis.pdf.},

abstract = {This thesis focuses on enhancing the search of electronic medical records (EMRs), with the aim of identifying patients with medical histories relevant to the medical conditions stated in a text query. During retrieval, a healthcare practitioner indicates a number of inclusion criteria describing the medical conditions of the patients of interest. However, finding patients with particular medical conditions is challenging, due to the implicit knowledge inherent within the patients' medical records and queries - such knowledge may be known by medical practitioners, but may be hidden from an information retrieval (IR) system. For instance, the mention of a treatment such as a drug may indicate to a practitioner that a particular diagnosis has been made for the patient, but this diagnosis may not be explicitly mentioned in the patient's medical records. Moreover, the use of negated language (e.g. 'without', 'no') to describe a medical condition of a patient (e.g. the patient has no fever) may cause a search system to erroneously retrieve that patient for a query when searching for patients with that medical condition (e.g. find patients with fever). To attain effective retrieval performance, we hypothesise that, in a patient search system, both the information needs and patients' histories should be represented based upon the medical decision process. In particular, this thesis argues that since the medical decision process typically encompasses four aspects (symptom, diagnostic test, diagnosis and treatment), a patient search system should take into account these aspects and apply inferences to recover the possible implicit knowledge. We postulate that considering these aspects and their derived implicit knowledge at three different levels of the retrieval process (namely, sentence, medical record and interrecord levels) enhances the retrieval performance. Indeed, we propose a novel framework that can gain insights from EMRs and queries, by modelling and reasoning upon informationduring retrieval in terms of the four aforementioned aspects at the three levels of the retrieval process, and can use these insights to enhance patient search.Firstly, at the sentence level, we extract the medical conditions in the medical records and queries. In particular, we propose to represent only the medical conditions related to the four medical aspects in order to improve the accuracy of our search system. In addition, we identify the context (negative/positive) of terms, which leads to an accurate representation of the medical conditions both in the EMRs and queries. In particular, we aim to prevent patients whose EMRs state the medical conditions in the contexts different from the query from being ranked highly. For example, preventing patients whose EMRs state "no history of dementia" from being retrieved for a query searching for patients with dementia.Secondly, at the medical record level, using external knowledge-based resources (e.g. ontologies and health-related websites), we leverage the relationships between medical terms to infer the wider medical history of the patient in terms of the four medical aspects. In particular, we estimate the relevance of a patient to the query by exploiting association rules that we extract from the semantic relationships between medical terms using the four aspects of the medical process. For example, patients with a medical history involving a CABG surgery (treatment) can be inferred as relevant to a query searching for a patient suffering from heart disease (diagnosis), since a CABG surgery is a treatment of heart disease.Thirdly, at the inter-record level, we enhance the retrieval of patients in two different manners. First, we exploit knowledge about how the four medical aspects are handled by different hospital departments to gain a better understanding about the appropriateness of EMRs created by different departments for a given query. We propose to aggregate EMRs at the department level (i.e. inter-record level) to extract implicit knowledge (i.e. the expertise of each department) and model this department's expertise, while ranking patients. For instance, patients having EMRs from the cardiology department are likely to be relevant to a query searching for patients who suffered from a heart attack. Second, as a medical query typically contains several medical conditions that the relevant patients should satisfy, we propose to explicitly model the relevance towards multiple query medical conditions in the EMRs related to a particular patient during retrieval. In particular, we rank highly those patients that match all the stated medical conditions in the query by adapting coverage-based diversification approaches originally proposed for the web search domain.Finally, we examine the combination of our aforementioned approaches that exploit the implicit knowledge at the three levels of the retrieval process to further improve the retrieval performance by adapting techniques from the fields of data fusion and machine learning. In particular, data fusion techniques, such as CombSUM and CombMNZ, are used to combine the relevance scores computed by the different approaches of the proposed framework. On the other hand, we deploy state-of-the-art learning to rank approaches (e.g. LambdaMART and AdaRank) to learn from a set of training data an effective combination of the relevance scores computed by the approaches of the framework. In addition, we introduce a novel selective ranking approach that uses a classifier to effectively apply one of the approaches of the framework on a per-query basis.This thesis draws insights from a thorough evaluation and analysis of the proposed framework using a standard test collection provided by the TREC Medical Records track. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the framework. In particular, the results demonstrate the importance of dealing with the implicit knowledge in patient search by focusing on the medical decision criteria aspects at the three levels of the retrieval process.},

abstract = {Data analysis requires new approaches in many domains for evaluating tools and techniques, particularly when the data sets grow large and more complex. Evaluation-as-service (EaaS) was coined as a term to represent evaluation approaches based on APIs, virtual machines or source code submission, different from the common paradigm of evaluating techniques on a distributed test collection, tasks and submitted results files. Such new approaches become necessary when data sets become extremely large, contain confidential information or might change quickly over time. The workshop on cloud-based evaluation (CBE) took place in Boston, MA, USA on November 5, 2015 and explored several approaches for data analysis evaluation and frameworks in this field. The objective was to include several stakeholders from academic partners, companies to funding agencies to cover various interests and viewpoints in the discussion of evaluation infrastructures. The workshop focused on the biomedical domain but the results are easily applicable to many domains of information analysis and retrieval.},

abstract = {In their daily lives people constantly interact with a wide range of electronically stored information objects; email messages, web pages, digital images, video samples, etc. These objects come from different sources, are in different formats and can be stored in different locations, including on distributed devices such as mobile phones, PDAs and MP3 players. The wealth and diversity of digital information that people access and use makes it incredibly difficult for an individual to organise his / her information in such a way that it can be re-accessed and re-used when it is needed in the future. Personal information management (PIM) as a research field covers attempts to understand PIM behaviour and develop systems to help people manage and re-find their information effectively.Our research investigates PIM from the perspective of the psychology of memory. Re-finding information is different from finding information that has not been accessed before and involves different psychological processes. Whereas finding involves understanding an information need and recognising information that is relevant, re-finding relies on memory. When re-finding information, the user knows that the information they are looking for exists because they have seen it before. The details remembered are clues to help re-access the information, while the details forgotten represent the barrier to re-finding. However, current PIM tools require specific attributes of information objects to be remembered and consequently make it difficult to re-access and re-use information. This means that the problems associated with managing and re-finding personal information are related both to the limitations of human memory and to the failure of PIM tools to account for these limitations.Our research is based on the premise that PIM tools should support the function of memory and has three objectives: 1) To develop an increased understanding of the role memory plays in the management of personal information. What do people remember about their information objects, how do they use these recollections when re-finding, and what factors influence what people remember and use? 2) To design, implement and evaluate PIM tools that have been specifically designed to support characteristics of human memory. 3) To address the difficulties involved in performing PIM evaluations.The work is grounded by the theoretical understanding of how memory works. A review of appropriate cognitive psychology literature offers a means to critique existing PIM tools and a basis from which to start designing novel tools that support the function of memory. Building on this, our early experimental work compares PIM behaviour to everyday memory problems, examining the problems people encounter and the strategies they employ to prevent and recover from memory lapses. We uncover a range of memory problems and solutions and relate these to the memory difficulties experienced in a PIM context. By combining the psychology findings with the particpants' explanations for the behavioural changes they make to prevent and recover from memory lapses, we develop a set of design principles for PIM tools that are hypothesized to assist the user when re-finding. Using these principles we develop two novel re-finding interfaces - one for personal photographs and one for personal email messages and evaluate these using current tools as benchmarks.The evaluation work not only allows the interfaces themselves to be evaluated, but also offers the chance to learn about what the experimental participants remember about the information they need to re-find. In this respect, we discover that for both email messages and personal photographs, what people tend to remember is the context surrounding previous interactions with the sought after photograph(s) / email message(s). However, our findings suggest that people tend to have fuller recollections of the emails they need to re-find, with recollections for photographs being more fragmented. Another important finding from the email study is that people tend to remember different attributes of email messages in different situations and that the attributes remembered will depend on a number of factors, including the time that has elapsed since the information was last accessed, the amount of experience the participant has with re-finding, the number of email messages in their collection, the way that they file their email messages, and their preferred means of re-finding.The evaluation of the interfaces also allows several discoveries to be made regarding which features of the evaluated interfaces are supportive and which are restrictive, as well as the reasons why. The main finding, however, is that, like recollections, the interface features that help participants re-find change in different situations. Therefore, flexibility is crucial to PIM interfaces. It is important that PIM interfaces support multiple varieties of memory so that different memories can be used in different situations. The evaluations also highlight the usefulness of supporting visual memory, which few existing PIM tools and research prototypes support. Another finding is that it can be helpful when PIM interfaces supply cues to help people remember more about the information they need to find. However, again the evaluations reveal that different types of memory cues are useful in different situations. Therefore, it is important that the PIM tool designers consider the factors that our studies show to affect this: the type of information object being re-found, the tasks that cause people to re-find this type of object, and re-finding strategies that the participants may already have.The method of evaluation used is in itself a contribution to the field of PIM. A major limitation of the PIM research performed to date is that few tool evaluations have been performed. Several scholars have proposed that this situation stems from the difficulties involved in conducting evaluations. The difficulties include incorporating the personal connections people have with their own information in evaluations, creating balanced experimental designs, preparing experimental tasks, and protecting the privacy of participants. Based on a study of the types of task that cause people to re-find email messages and web pages, we propose, evaluate and then use a methodology for performing PIM evaluations that overcomes difficulties outlined above.Our work, therefore, offers contributions associated with each of our three objectives. We offer an increased understanding of the role of memory in PIM, provide insight into how PIM tools can be designed to support human memory, and propose a method of evaluation that allows PIM behaviour and interfaces to be studied with a laboratory-based approach.},

abstract = {The workshop on Information Access to Cultural Heritage (IACH 2008) was held during the ECDL conference in Aarhus on the 18th September 2008. The workshop provided a venue to bring together academics carrying out research in the area of information access and practitioners working in the cultural heritage field. The aim was to encourage the exchange of ideas concerning the creation, curation, storage, retrieval and use of cultural heritage information. The day began with a keynote paper by Chris Batt, who looked to the future, challenging the audience to think of uses of technology to make sense of the landscape for users, shifting focus of information access to cultural heritage from search to find. The keynote was followed by a session on the European Digital Library with invited papers by Stefan Gradmann on the infrastructure of Europeana and by Rob Davies on work to develop the content of the Library in the EuropeanaLocal project. The proceedings continued with a series of papers on services being developed to provide access to cultural heritage collections and a wide range of media -- images, text, music and speech. A lively series of poster boasters followed and the day concluded with the poster session and a panel discussion on future directions. Given the attendance at the workshop and the good level of discussion throughout the day, we conclude that Information Access to Cultural Heritage is a growing area of research and promising area for exchange and collaboration between researchers and practitioners.},

abstract = {In recent years we have witnessed an explosion in publishing data on the Web, mostly in the form of Linked Data. An important question is how typical users, who mainly use keyword search queries, can access and exploit this constantly increasing body of knowledge. Although existing interaction paradigms in Semantic Search hide their complexity behind easy-to-use interfaces, they have not managed to cover common search needs. At the same time, according to several studies, a large number of search tasks are of exploratory nature. However, in such tasks the traditional "ranked list" approach for interacting with the retrieved results is often inadequate.The objective of this thesis is to enable effective exploratory search services which can bridge the gap between the classic responses of non-semantic search systems (e.g., Professional Search Systems, Web Search Engines) and semantic information expressed in the form of Linked Open Data (LOD). Towards this direction, we introduce an approach in which named entities (like names of persons, locations, chemical substances, etc.) are exploited as the glue for automatically connecting documents (search results) with data and knowledge. We study an approach where this entity-based integration is performed at real-time, without any human intervention and without the need of prebuilt indexes. This allows the provision of "fresh" information, the easy configuration of this functionality according to the needs of the underlying search application, as well as its easy exploitation by existing search systems.The provision of the aforementioned functionality is challenging. At first, the LOD that are available on the Web are big, are distributed in many knowledge bases, are increased and updated continuously, and also cover many domains. Consequently, there is the need of an interoperability model that will allow the specification of the entities of interest as well as of the related and useful semantic data. In addition, the number of extractable entities from the search results can be very high and the same is true for the amount of semantic information that can be retrieved from the LOD for these entities (i.e., the number of their attributes and of their associations with other entities). Thus, there is also the need of methods that can estimate the important (for the search context) entities, attributes and associations.To cope with the above challenges, this thesis proposes a semantic analysis process in which the search results are connected with data and knowledge at real-time without any human intervention. For describing the entities of interest, as well as the related (and useful for the application context) semantic information, we propose a generic model for configuring a Named Entity Extraction (NEE) system, while for specifying the semantics of this model, we introduce an RDF/S vocabulary, called "Open NEE Configuration Model", which allows a NEE system to describe (and publish as LOD) its entity-mining capabilities. To enable associating the result of a NEE process with an applied configuration, we propose an extension of the Open Annotation Data Model which also allows publishing the annotation results as LOD. To examine the feasibility of this model, we developed the system X-Link which, contrary to existing NEE systems, allows its easy configuration by exploiting one or more semantic Knowledge Bases. To identify the important semantic information related to the search results, we introduce and study a ranking method that is based on the Random Walk model and which exploits the extracted entities and their connectivity. The exploitation of the selected semantic information is achieved either through the visualization of the related semantic graph and/or in the context of a faceted interaction model that allows the user to gradually restrict the search space. Besides, this thesis studied the exploitation of such graphs for re-ranking the list of retrieved results aiming to promote relevant but low-ranked hits.The dissertation reports extensive evaluation results of the proposed functionalities and methods. Regarding the system X-Link, a task-based evaluation with users showed its ease of configuration, while a case study illustrated the efficiency of the supported operations. The comparative evaluation of the proposed probabilistic scheme for ranking entities and semantic data showed that the proposed approach is more effective compared to other ranking approaches (producing a more than 20% better ranking). Regarding the presentation of the important entities (and of their associations), the conducted survey in a marine-related search context demonstrated that the majority of participants (more than 70%) prefer to see a graph representation of entities related to the retrieved results regardless of the type of the submitted query. The evaluation of the proposed probabilistic algorithm for re-ranking the retrieved search results (using TREC datasets related to the medical domain) showed that this approach can notably improve the list of results by promoting relevant hits in higher positions. Finally, the implementation and the experimental results of the proposed search process demonstrated its feasibility and efficiency, and also enabled us to reveal its limitations.},

abstract = {Improving the effectiveness of general retrieval models has been a long-standing difficult challenge in information retrieval research, yet is also a fundamentally important task, because an improved general retrieval model would benefit every search engine. The language modeling approach to information retrieval has recently attracted much attention. In the language modeling approach, we assume that a query is a sample drawn from a language model: given a query Q and a document D, we compute the likelihood of "generating" query Q with a document language model estimated based on document D. We can then rank documents based on the likelihood of generating the query, i.e., query likelihood. On the one hand, with sound statistical foundation, the language modeling approach makes it easier to set and optimize retrieval parameters, and often outperforms traditional retrieval models. On the other hand, however, after more than one decade of research, the basic language modeling approach to retrieval still remains the same, mainly because the difficulty in accurately modeling the highly empirical notion of relevance within a standard statistical model has led to slow progress in optimizing language modeling approaches; this suggests that the theoretical framework of language models has a clear gap from what is needed to make a retrieval model empirically effective, a general problem we refer to as the "theory-effectiveness gap". We have identified the following theory-effectiveness gaps in current language modeling approaches.First, one critical common component in any language modeling approach is the document language model. Traditional document language models follow the bag-of-words assumption that assumes term independence and ignores the positions of the query terms in a document. For example, in a query "computer virus", the occurrences of two query terms may be close to each other in one document (likely to mean computer virus) while far apart in another document (not necessarily about computer virus), which makes a huge difference for indicating relevance but is largely underexplored, suggesting the existence of a theoryeffectiveness in standard document language models.Second, accurate estimation of query language models plays a critical role in the language modeling approach to information retrieval. Pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) has proven very effective for improving query language models. The basic idea of PRF is to assume that a small number of top-ranked documents in the initial retrieval results are relevant and select from these documents useful terms to improve the query language model. However, existing PRF algorithms simply assume that all terms in a feedback document are equally useful, again ignoring term occurrence positions. They are often non-optimal, as a feedback document may cover multiple incoherent topics and thus contain many useless or even harmful terms. This shows a theory-effectiveness gap in estimating query language models based on PRF.Third, although pseudo-relevance feedback approaches to the estimation of query language models can help improve the average retrieval precision, many experiments have shown that PRF often hurts many individual queries; the risk of PRF limits its usefulness in real search engines -- another theory-effectiveness gap in query language models.Fourth, the language modeling approach scores a document mainly based on the query likelihood score. A previously unknown deficiency of the query likelihood scoring function is that it is not properly lower-bounded for long documents. As a result of this deficiency, long documents which do match the query term can often be scored unfairly as having a lower relevancy than shorter documents that do not contain the query term at all. For example, for the aforementioned query "computer virus", a long document matching both "computer" and "virus" can easily be ranked lower than a short document matching only "computer". This reveals a clear theory-effectiveness gap between the standard query likelihood scoring function and the optimal way of scoring documents.Fifth, the justification of using the basic query likelihood score for retrieval requires an unrealistic assumption, which states that the probability that a user who dislikes a document would use a query does not depend on the particular document. In reality, however, this assumption does not hold because a user who dislikes a document would more likely avoid using words in the document when posing a query. This theoretical gap between the basic query likelihood retrieval function and the notion of relevance suggests that the basic query likelihood function is a potentially non-optimal retrieval function.To bridge the above theory-effectiveness gaps between the theoretical framework of standard language models and the empirical application of information retrieval, in this dissertation, we clearly identified the causes of these gaps, and developed general methodologies to remove the causes from language models without destroying the statistical foundation and any other desirable properties of language models. Our explorations have delivered several more effective and robust general language modeling approaches, which can all be applied immediately to search engines to improve their ranking accuracy. Although this dissertation focuses on language models, most of the proposed methodologies are actually more general, and can also be applied to retrieval models other than language models to bridge their theory-effectiveness gap as well.This dissertation was completed at the Department of Computer Science at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign under the advise of Dr. ChengXiang Zhai. Dr. ChengXiang Zhai, Dr. Jiawei Han, Dr. Evgeniy Gabrilovich, and Dr. Miles Efron served as dissertation committee members. Available online at: https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/handle/2142/34306.},

abstract = {Geographical information retrieval (GIR) is concerned with the problems of finding information resources that relate to particular geographical locations. Until recently most web search engines have treated geographical terminology within user queries in the same way as other terminology. This can often result in failure to find relevant documents and in the retrieval of irrelevant documents. There are several reasons for this. For example, there are many different places with the same name, so unless the query contains a unique set of geographical terms, documents referring to the wrong place may be retrieved. There are many uses of place names in the names of people and organisations with the consequence that search depending on naive exact matching of terms may retrieve such documents even though they may not relate to the named place. It is also the case that queries may include spatial prepositions, such as near or outside, which will not be interpreted intelligently by the search engine. Thus relevant documents may not be found because the user's query did not contain explicit references to the places that match the query expression, in the sense of being, for example, near, inside or north of a named place. It is also the case that conventional search engines lack other desirable facilities for geographical search such as relevance ranking that takes account of geographical proximity and the ability to use interactive maps to specify a query and to visualise the results.},

abstract = {For a query submitted by a user, the goal of an information retrieval system is to return a list of documents which are highly relevant with respect to that query. Traditionally different scoring methods, ranging from simple heuristic models to probabilistic models, have been used for this task. Recently researchers have started to use supervised machine learning techniques for solving this problem which is then called the learning-to-rank (LtR) problem. Many supervised learning methods have been tested so far with empirical success over conventional methods [4]The random forest is a relatively simple but effective and efficient learning algorithm which aggregates the predictions of a large number of independent and variant base learners, namely decision trees. Its major benefits over other state-of-the-art methods include inherent parallelizability, ease of tuning and competitive performance. These benefits attract researchers across various disciplines where a random forest is a very popular choice. However, for LtR task, the random forest has not been thoroughly investigated. In this research, we investigate the random forest based LtR algorithms. We aim at improving the efficiency, effectiveness, and understanding of these algorithms. With respect to the first goal, we employ undersampling techniques and leverage the inherent structure of a random forest to achieve better scalability, especially for highly imbalanced datasets [2]. We also reduce the correlation among the trees to reduce learning time and to improve performance [3]. With respect to the second goal, we investigate various objective functions ranging from completely randomized splitting criterion to so-called listwise splitting [1]. We also conduct a thorough study on random forest based pointwise algorithms. With respect to the third goal, we develop methods for estimating the bias and variance of rank-learning algorithms, and examine their empirical behavior against parameters of the learning algorithm},

abstract = {In this thesis we investigate the possibility to integrate domain-specific knowledge into biomedical information retrieval (IR). Recent decades have shown a fast growing interest in biomedical research, reflected by an exponential growth in scientific literature. An important problem for biomedical IR is dealing with the complex and inconsistent terminology encountered in biomedical publications. Dealing with the terminology problem requires domain knowledge stored in terminological resources: controlled indexing vocabularies and thesauri. The integration of this knowledge is, however, far from trivial.The first research theme investigates heuristics for obtaining word-based representations from biomedical text for robust retrieval. We investigated the effect of choices in document preprocessing heuristics on retrieval effectiveness. Document preprocessing heuristics such as stop word removal, stemming, and breakpoint identification and normalization were shown to strongly affect retrieval performance. An effective combination of heuristics was identified to obtain a word-based representation from text for the remainder of this thesis.The second research theme deals with concept-based retrieval. We compared a word-based to a concept-based representation and determined to what extent a manual concept-based representation can be automatically obtained from text. Retrieval based on only concepts was demonstrated to be significantly less effective than word-based retrieval. This deteriorated performance could be explained by errors in the classification process, limitations of the concept vocabularies and limited exhaustiveness of the concept-based document representations. Retrieval based on a combination of word-based and automatically obtained concept-based query representations did significantly improve word-only retrieval.In the third and last research theme we propose a cross-lingual framework for monolingual biomedical IR. In this framework, the integration of a concept-based representation is viewed as a cross-lingual matching problem involving a word-based and concept-based representation language. This framework gives us the opportunity to adopt a large set of established crosslingual information retrieval methods and techniques for this domain. Experiments with basic term-to-term translation models demonstrate that this approach can significantly improve word-based retrieval.Directions for future work are using these concepts for communication between user and retrieval system, extending upon the translation models and extending CLIR-enhanced concept-based retrieval outside the biomedical domain.Available online from http://purl.utwente.nl/publications/72481.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a technique to generate personalised recommendations for a user from a collection of correlated preferences in the past. In general, the effectiveness of CF greatly depends on the amount of available information about the target user and the target item. The cold-start problem, which describes the difficulty of making recommendations when the users or the items are new, remains a great challenge for CF. Traditionally, this problem is tackled by resorting to an additional interview process to establish the user (item) profile before making any recommendations. During this process the user's information need is not addressed. In this thesis, however, we argue that recommendations would be preferably provided right from the beginning. And the goal of solving the cold-start problem should be maximising the overall recommendation utility during all interactions with the recommender system. In other words, we should not distinguish between the informationgathering and recommendation-making phases, but seamlessly integrate them together. This mechanism naturally addresses the cold-start problem as any user (item) can immediately receive sequential recommendations without providing extra information beforehand.This thesis solves the cold-start problem in an interactive setting by focusing on four interconnected aspects. First, we consider a continuous sequential recommendation process with CF and relate it to the exploitation-exploration (EE) trade-off. By employing probabilistic matrix factorization, we obtain a structured decision space and are thus able to leverage several EE algorithms, such as Thompson sampling and upper confidence bounds, to select items. Second, we extend the sequential recommendation process to a batch mode where multiple recommendations are made at each interaction stage. We specifically discuss the case of two consecutive interaction stages, and model it with the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) to obtain its exact theoretical solution. Through an indepth analysis of the POMDP value iteration solution, we identify that an exact solution can be abstracted as selecting users (items) that are not only highly relevant to the target according to the initial-stage information, but also highly correlated with other potential users (items) for the next stage. Third, we consider the intra-stage recommendation optimisation and focus on the problem of personalised item diversification. We reformulate the latent factor models using the mean-variance analysis from the portfolio theory in economics. The resulting portfolio ranking algorithm naturally captures the user's interest range and the uncertainty of the user preference by employing the variance of the learned user latent factors, leading to a diversified item list adapted to the individual user. And, finally, we relate the diversification algorithm back to the interactive process by considering inter-stage joint portfolio diversification, where the recommendations are optimised jointly with the user's past preference records.The pdf version of my thesis is available for download at http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1474118/.},

abstract = {Traditional semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques consider the missing labels of unlabeled datapoints as latent/unobserved variables, and model these variables, and the parameters of the model, using techniques like Expectation Maximization (EM). Such semisupervised learning techniques are widely used for Automatic Knowledge Base Construction (AKBC) tasks.We consider two extensions to traditional SSL methods which make it more suitable for a variety of AKBC tasks. First, we consider jointly assigning multiple labels to each instance, with a flexible scheme for encoding constraints between assigned labels: this makes it possible, for instance, to assign labels at multiple levels from a hierarchy. Second, we account for another type of latent variable, in the form of unobserved classes. In open-domain webscale information extraction problems, it is an unrealistic assumption that the class ontology or topic hierarchy we are using is complete. Our proposed framework combines structural search for the best class hierarchy with SSL, reducing the semantic drift associated with erroneously grouping unanticipated classes with expected classes. Together, these extensions allow a single framework to handle a large number of knowledge extraction tasks, including macro-reading, noun-phrase classification, word sense disambiguation, alignment of KBs to wikipedia or on-line glossaries, and ontology extension.To summarize, this thesis argues that many AKBC tasks which have previously been addressed separately can be viewed as instances of single abstract problem: multiview semisupervised learning with an incomplete class hierarchy. In this thesis we present a generic EM framework for solving this abstract task.},

abstract = {Since time is an omnipresent feature of our existence, many elements of time are embedded in information itself, and related behaviours such as creation, seeking and utilisation. In IR, time can distinguish the interpretation of information, and influence the intentions and expectations of users' information seeking activity. Many time-based patterns and trends - namely temporal dynamics - are evident in streams of information behaviour by individuals and crowds. A temporal dynamic refers to a periodic regularity, or, a one-off or irregular past, present or future of a particular element (e.g., word, topic or query popularity) - driven by predictable and unpredictable time-based events and phenomena.Several challenges and opportunities related to temporal dynamics emerge in IR. This thesis explores temporal dynamics from the perspective of (i) query popularity and meaning, and (ii) word use and relationships over time. In particular, I consider how real-time temporal dynamics in information seeking should be supported for consistent user satisfaction over time, and moreover, how previously observed temporal dynamics offer a complementary dimension which can be exploited to inform more effective IR systems.Uncertainty about user expectations is a perennial problem for IR systems, further confounded by changes over time. Addressing this, IR systems can either assist the user to submit an effective query (e.g., error-free and descriptive), or better anticipate what the user is most likely to want in relevance ranking. I first explore methods to always help users formulate queries with time-aware query auto-completion capable of suggesting both recent and always popular queries. I propose and evaluate several novel approaches, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of up to +9.2% improvement above existing baselines for diverse search scenarios in different languages. Furthermore, I explore the impact of temporal dynamics on the motives behind users' information seeking, and thus how relevance itself is subject to temporal dynamics. I find the most likely meaning of ambiguous queries is affected over short and long-term periods (e.g., hours to months) by several periodic and oneoff event-driven temporal dynamics. Finally, I find that for many event-driven multi-faceted queries, relevance can often be inferred by modelling the temporal dynamics of changes in related information.IR approaches are typically based on methods which characterize the nature of information through the statistical distributions of words and phrases. I model and exploit the temporal dimension of the collection, captured by temporal dynamics, in these established IR approaches. I explore how the temporal dynamic similarity of word and phrase use in a collection can be exploited to infer temporal semantic relationships between the terms. I propose an approach to uncover a query topic's "chronotype" terms -- that is, its most distinctive and temporally interdependent terms, based on a mix of temporal and non-temporal evidence. Experiments demonstrate that exploiting chronotype terms in temporal query expansion leads to significantly improved retrieval performance in several time-based collections.Temporal dynamics provide both a challenge and an opportunity for IR systems. Overall, this thesis demonstrates that temporal dynamics can be used to derive tacit structure and meaning of information and information behaviour, which is valuable for improving timeaware IR system effectiveness.},

abstract = {More than half the world's population uses web search engines, resulting in over half a billion queries every single day. For many people, web search engines such as Baidu, Bing, Google, and Yandex are among the first resources they go to when a question arises. Moreover, for many search engines have become the most trusted route to information, more so even than traditional media such as newspapers, news websites or news channels on television. What web search engines present people with greatly influences what they believe to be true and consequently it influences their thoughts, opinions, decisions, and the actions they take. With this in mind two things are important, from an information retrieval research perspective. First, it is important to understand how well search engines (rankers) perform and secondly this knowledge should be used to improve them. This thesis is about these two topics: evaluation of search engines and learning search engines.In the first part of this thesis we investigate how user interactions with search engines can be used to evaluate search engines. In particular, we introduce a new online evaluation paradigm called multileaving that extends upon interleaving. With multileaving, many rankers can be compared at once by combining document lists from these rankers into a single result list and attributing user interactions with this list to the rankers. Then we investigate the relation between A/B testing and interleaved comparison methods. Both studies lead to much higher sensitivity of the evaluation methods, meaning that fewer user interactions are required to arrive at reliable conclusions. This has the important implication that fewer users need to be exposed to the results from possibly inferior search engines.In the second part of this thesis we turn to online learning to rank. We learn from the evaluation methods introduced and extended upon in the first part. We learn the parameters of base rankers based on user interactions. Then we use the multileaving methods as feedback in our learning method, leading to much faster convergence than existing methods. Again, the important implication is that fewer users need to be exposed to possibly inferior search engines as they adapt more quickly to changes in user preferences. The last part of this thesis is of a different nature than the earlier two parts. As opposed to the earlier chapters, we no longer study algorithms. Progress in information retrieval research has always been driven by a combination of algorithms, shared resources, and evaluation.In the last part we focus on the latter two. We introduce a new shared resource and a new evaluation paradigm. Firstly, we propose Lerot. Lerot is an online evaluation framework that allows us to simulate users interacting with a search engine. Our implementation has been released as open source software and is currently being used by researchers around the world. Secondly we introduce OpenSearch, a new evaluation paradigm involving real users of real search engines. We describe an implementation of this paradigm that has already been widely adopted by the research community through challenges at CLEF and TREC.},

abstract = {Web search engines have to deal with a rapidly increasing amount of information, high query loads and tight performance constraints. The success of a search engine depends on the speed with which it answers queries (efficiency) and the quality of its answers (effectiveness). These two metrics have a large impact on the operational costs of the search engine and the overall user satisfaction, which determine the revenue of the search engine. In this context, any improvement in query processing efficiency can reduce the operational costs and improve user satisfaction, hence improve the overall benefit.In this thesis, we elaborate on query processing efficiency, address several problems within partitioned query processing, pruning and caching and propose several novel techniques:First, we look at term-wise partitioned indexes and address the main limitations of the state-of-the-art query processing methods. Our first approach combines the advantage of pipelined and traditional (non-pipelined) query processing. This approach assumes one disk access per posting list and traditional term-at-a-time processing. For the second approach, we follow an alternative direction and look at document-at-a-time processing of sub-queries and skipping. Subsequently, we present several skipping extensions to pipelined query processing, which as we show can improve the query processing performance and/or the quality of results. Then, we extend one of these methods with intra-query parallelism, which as we show can improve the performance at low query loads.Second, we look at skipping and pruning optimizations designed for a monolithic index. We present an efficient self-skipping inverted index designed for modern index compression methods and several query processing optimizations. We show that these optimizations can provide a significant speed-up compared to a full (non-pruned) evaluation and reduce the performance gap between disjunctive (OR) and conjunctive (AND) queries. We also propose a linear programming optimization that can further improve the I/O, decompression and computation efficiency of Max-Score.Third, we elaborate on caching in Web search engines in two independent contributions. First, we present an analytical model that finds the optimal split in a static memory-based two-level cache. Second, we present several strategies for selecting, ordering and scheduling prefetch queries and demonstrate that these can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Web search engines.We carefully evaluate our ideas either using a real implementation or by simulation using real-world text collections and query logs. Most of the proposed techniques are found to improve the state-of-the-art in the conducted empirical studies. However, the implications and applicability of these techniques in practice need further evaluation in real-life settings.This dissertation was completed at the Department of Computer and Information Science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) under advise of Prof. Svein Erik Bratsberg, Dr. \O{}ystein Torbj\o{}rnsen and Dr. Magnus Lie Hetland.

abstract = {In Information Extraction (IE), processing of named entities in text has traditionally been seen as a two-step process comprising a flat text span recognition sub-task and an atomic classification sub-task; relating the text span to a model of the world has been ignored by evaluations such as DARPA/NIST's MUC or ACE. However, spatial and temporal expressions refer to events in space-time, and the grounding of events is a precondition for accurate reasoning. Thus, automatic grounding can improve many applications such as automatic map drawing (e.g. for choosing a focus) and question answering (e.g., for questions like How far is London from Edinburgh, given a story in which both occur and can be resolved). Whereas temporal grounding has received considerable attention in the recent Past [2, 3], robust spatial grounding has long been neglected. Concentrating on geographic names for populated places, I define the task of automatic Toponym Resolution (TR) as computing the mapping from occurrences of names for places as found in a text to a representation of the extensional semantics of the location referred to (its referent), such as a geographic latitude/longitude footprint. The task of mapping from names to locations is hard due to insufficient and noisy databases, and a large degree of ambiguity: common words need to be distinguished from proper names (geo/non-geo ambiguity), and the mapping between names and locations is ambiguous London can refer to the capital of the UK or to London, Ontario, Canada, or to about forty other Londons on earth). In addition, names of places and the boundaries referred to change over time, and databases are incomplete.},

abstract = {A challenging problem in the user profiling domain is to create profiles of users of retrieval systems. This problem even exacerbates in the multimedia domain. Due to the Semantic Gap, the difference between low-level data representation of videos and the higher concepts users associate with videos, it is not trivial to understand the content of multimedia documents and to find other documents that the users might be interested in. A promising approach to ease this problem is to set multimedia documents into their semantic contexts. The semantic context can lead to a better understanding of the personal interests. Knowing the context of a video is useful for recommending users videos that match their information need. By exploiting these contexts, videos can also be linked to other, contextually related videos. From a user profiling point of view, these links can be of high value to recommend semantically related videos, hence creating a semantic-based user profile. This thesis introduces a semantic user profiling approach for news video retrieval, which exploits a generic ontology to put news stories into its context.Major challenges which inhibit the creation of such semantic user profiles are the identification of user's long-term interests and the adaptation of retrieval results based on these personal interests. Most personalisation services rely on users explicitly specifying preferences, a common approach in the text retrieval domain. By giving explicit feedback, users are forced to update their need, which can be problematic when their information need is vague. Furthermore, users tend not to provide enough feedback on which to base an adaptive retrieval algorithm. Deviating from the method of explicitly asking the user to rate the relevance of retrieval results, the use of implicit feedback techniques helps by learning user interests unobtrusively. The main advantage is that users are relieved from providing feedback. A disadvantage is that information gathered using implicit techniques is less accurate than information based on explicit feedback.},

abstract = {The process whereby inferences are made from textual data is broadly referred to as text mining. In order to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the derived inferences, several approaches have been proposed for different text mining applications. Among these applications, classifying a piece of text into pre-defined classes through the utilisation of training data falls into supervised approaches while arranging related documents or terms into clusters falls into unsupervised approaches. In both these approaches, processing is undertaken at the level of documents to make sense of text within those documents. Recent research efforts have begun exploring the role of knowledge bases in solving the various problems that arise in the domain of text mining. Of all the knowledge bases, Wikipedia on account of being one of the largest human-curated, online encyclopaedia has proven to be one of the most valuable resources in dealing with various problems in the domain of text mining. However, previous Wikipedia-based research efforts have not taken both Wikipedia categories and Wikipedia articles together as a source of information.This thesis serves as a first step in eliminating this gap and throughout the contributions made in this thesis, we have shown the effectiveness of Wikipedia category-article structure for various text mining tasks. Wikipedia categories are organized in a taxonomical manner serving as semantic tags for Wikipedia articles and this provides a strong abstraction and expressive mode of knowledge representation. In this thesis, we explore the effectiveness of this mode of Wikipedia's expression (i.e., the category-article structure) via its application in the domains of text classification, subjectivity analysis (via a notion of "perspective" in news search), and keyword extraction.First, we show the effectiveness of exploiting Wikipedia for two classification tasks i.e., 1- classifying the tweets1 being relevant/irrelevant to an entity or brand, 2- classifying the tweets into different topical dimensions such as tweets related with workplace, innovation, etc. To do so, we define the notion of relatedness between the text in tweet and the information embedded within the Wikipedia category-article structure. Then, we present an application in the area of news search by using the same notion of relatedness to show more information related to each search result highlighting the amount perspective or subjective bias in each returned result towards a certain opinion, topical drift, etc. Finally, we present a keyword extraction strategy using community detection over the Wikipedia categories to discover related keywords arranged in different communities.The relationship between Wikipedia categories and articles is explored via a textual phrase matching framework whereby the starting point is textual phrases that match Wikipedia articles' titles/redirects. The Wikipedia articles for which a match occurs are then utilised by extraction of their associated categories, and these Wikipedia categories are used to derive various structural measures such as those relating to taxonomical depth and Wikipedia articles they contain. These measures are utilised in our proposed text classification, subjectivity analysis, and keyword extraction framework and the performance is analysed via extensive experimental evaluations. These experimental evaluations undertake comparisons with standard text mining approaches in the literature and our Wikipedia framework based on its category-article structure outperforms the standard text mining techniques.},

abstract = {In this thesis we investigate the use of quantum probability theory for ranking documents. Quantum probability theory is used to estimate the probability of relevance of a document given a user's query. We posit that quantum probability theory can lead to a better estimation of the probability of a document being relevant to a user's query than the common IR approach, i. e. the Probability Ranking Principle (PRP), which is based upon Kolmogorovian probability theory. Following our hypothesis, we formulate an analogy between the document retrieval scenario and a physical scenario, that of the double slit experiment. Through the analogy, we propose a novel ranking approach, the quantum probability ranking principle (qPRP). Key to our proposal is the presence of quantum interference. Mathematically, this is the statistical deviation between empirical observations and expected values predicted by the Kolmogorovian rule of additivity of probabilities of disjoint events in configurations such that of the double slit experiment. While PRP explicitly assumes that the relevancy of a document is independent of that of other documents, we suggest that qPRP implicitly models interdependent document relevance through quantum interference and thus is suited to those document ranking tasks where the independence assumption fails. Throughout the thesis, we also suggest how quantum interference can be estimated for effective document ranking.To validate our proposal and to gain more insights about approaches for document ranking, we (1) analyse PRP, qPRP and other ranking approaches, exposing the assumptions underlying their ranking criteria and formulating the conditions for the optimality of the two ranking principles, (2) empirically compare three ranking principles (i. e. PRP, interactive PRP, and qPRP) and two state-of-the-art ranking strategies in two retrieval scenarios, those of ad-hoc retrieval and diversity retrieval, (3) analytically contrast the ranking criteria of the examined approaches, exposing similarities and differences, (4) study the ranking behaviours of approaches alternative to PRP in terms of the kinematics they impose on relevant documents, i. e. by considering the extent and direction of the movements of relevant documents across the ranking recorded when comparing PRP against its alternatives.Our findings show that the effectiveness of the examined ranking approaches strongly depends upon the evaluation context. In the traditional evaluation context of ad-hoc retrieval, PRP is empirically shown to be better than or comparable to alternative ranking approaches. However, when evaluation contexts that account for interdependent document relevance are examined (i. e. when the relevance of a document is assessed also with respect to other retrieved documents, as it is the case in the diversity retrieval scenario), the use of quantum probability theory and thus of qPRP is shown to improve retrieval and ranking effectiveness over the traditional PRP and alternative ranking strategies, such as Maximal Marginal Relevance, Portfolio theory, and Interactive PRP.This work represents a significant step forward regarding the use of quantum theory in information retrieval. It demonstrates that the application of quantum theory to problems within information retrieval can lead to improvements both in modelling power and retrieval effectiveness, allowing the constructions of models that capture the complexity of information retrieval situations.Furthermore, the thesis opens up a number of lines of future research. These include investigating estimations and approximations of quantum interference in qPRP, exploiting complex numbers for the representation of documents and queries, and applying the concepts underlying qPRP to tasks other than document ranking.

abstract = {The Relational Associative Processor (RAP) is an experimental "backend" cellular processor for implementing data base management systems. RAP is particularly well suited to supporting Codd's relational model of data. The capacity of a RAP device implemented with current IC and memory technology can be estimated to contain 10E8 to 10E9 bits of associatively processable data. Because many data bases are larger, a virtual memory environment for RAP has been proposed and its performance simulated. The environment incorporates conventional memories for bulk storage and a single RAP processor - both controlled by a general purpose front-end computer. The system requires that the entire relational data base be divided into pages of size equal to one RAP cell memory. A buffer memory is added to RAP to permit the overlap of paging with processing. It has been found that user environments containing small relations or queries exhibiting either long processing times relative to paging requirements or some "locality" (defined as the degree to which sequences of queries reference some relations more than others) can efficiently page data between large data bases and data base machines without significant losses in performance.},

Existing systems are designed to retrieve information that is relevant to the query, but are not capable of identifying information that is well-suited to the context and situation of a search. This is a problem for professionals who often are searching for a small amount of useful information that can be applied to a problem or task, and have limited time to browse through large sets of results. This inability of search systems to discriminate between topically relevant and useful documents is one of the core problems in information retrieval.},

abstract = {Sentence Retrieval is the task of retrieving a relevant sentence in response to a query, a question, or a reference sentence. Tasks such as question answering, summarization, novelty detection, and information provenance make use of a sentence-retrieval module as a preprocessing step. The performance of these systems is dependent on the quality of the sentence-retrieval module. Other tasks such as information extraction and machine translation operate on sentences, either using them as training data, or as the unit of input or output (or both), and may benefit from sentence retrieval to build a training corpus, or as a post-processing step.},

abstract = {There is an increase in stress during the job. This can lead to health issues such as burn-out for employees. In the SWELL project (http://www.swell-project.net) we investigate intelligent ICT solutions that can support knowledge workers to achieve a healthy way of living at work and at home.One of the causes of stress at work is the problem of 'information overload'. The availability of smartphones and tables with continuous internet access causes individuals to become overwhelmed with information. It becomes more difficult to separate work and home, but also to find the information you need to execute your work properly.A possible solution to this problem is to make application more 'context-aware'. This means that the application understands what a person is doing, such that it can provide the optimal support at the optimal time. This is the underlying motivation for this thesis.This thesis consists of three parts. In the first part we discuss the question "How can we design, develop and evaluate context-aware methods that make knowledge work more effective and efficient?" To answer this question, we have observed knowledge workers during their activities and collected data about their behavior. From these we can conclude that many intentions and goals of the knowledge worker are implicit, and cannot be recognized easily [1,4]. We can, however, get a feeling of the knowledge worker's intentions by observing his interactions with the computer (i.e. key presses and mouse activity). The challenge in this type of data is that it contains a significant amount of noise.In the second part of the thesis we model the context that is necessary to support the knowledge worker in a context-aware manner. The context model is dynamic and driven by events in the surroundings of the knowledge worker. The knowledge worker is in the center of the model, but the context also influences the knowledge worker himself. The context can be observed with sensors that are independent from the knowledge worker, but the interpretation of the context can only be achieved in combination with the knowledge worker.In this part we also describe the Contextual Interactive Activation Model (CIA) that can recognize the context of the knowledge worker automatically based on his or her interactions with the computer [2]. Based purely on data, without intervention by a user, it can already recognize the user's context. Enhanced with only a few example it can also identify the context, meaning that it can put a label on it, for example project 'Dissertation'.In the final part of the thesis we describe algorithms that support knowledge workers while requiring little user input. One of the application is the categorization of e-mail messages, for example based on whether they need to be replied to or not, or based on which project the message belongs to. For this later categorization problem, we use an adapted version of CIA [2]. The advantage of CIA is that it requires less training examples than existing methods. In another application we use CIA to find documents without the need for a query [5]. We describe the requirements for evaluation of these kind of recommendation systems and conclude that a multidimensional evaluation is important. Each method has its own benefits and issues and the best method is dependent on the user's priorities.The main limitation of the thesis is that it is explorative in nature. Little data was available to test our methods and hypotheses; therefore, the conclusions cannot be generalized easily. This illustrates the need to collect more datasets that reflect the complexity of the knowledge worker, his tasks and his context. Future research need to investigate the effect of using context-aware applications on the knowledge worker's well-being. One of the remaining question is which supporting application to use at which time. In an ideal case we can combine these methods and application to support the knowledge worker in such a way that he or she is not required to put in a lot of effort.},

abstract = {Information retrieval methods, especially considering multimedia data, have evolved towards the integration of multiple sources of evidence in the analysis of the relevance of the items considering a given user search task. In this context, for attenuating the semantic gap between low-level features extracted from the content of the digital objects and high-level semantic concepts (objects, categories, etc.) and making the systems adaptive to different user needs, interactive models have brought the user closer to the retrieval loop allowing user-system interaction mainly through implicit or explicit relevance feedback. Analogously, diversity promotion has emerged as an alternative for tackling ambiguous or underspecified queries. Additionally, several works have addressed the issue of minimizing the required user effort on providing relevance assessments while keeping an acceptable overall effectivenessThis thesis discusses, proposes, and experimentally analyzes multimodal and interactive diversity-oriented information retrieval methods. This work, comprehensively covers the interactive information retrieval literature and also discusses about recent advances, the great research challenges, and promising research opportunities. We have proposed and evaluated two relevancediversity trade-off enhancement work-flows, which integrate multiple information from images, such as: visual features, textual metadata, geographic information, and user credibility descriptors. In turn, as an integration of interactive retrieval and diversity promotion techniques, for maximizing the coverage of multiple query interpretations/aspects and speeding up the information transfer between the user and the system, we have proposed and evaluated a multimodal online learning-to-rank method trained with relevance feedback over diversified resultsOur experimental analysis shows that the joint usage of multiple information sources positively impacted the relevance-diversity balancing algorithms. Our results also suggest that the integration of multimodal-relevance-based filtering and reranking is effective on improving result relevance and also boosts diversity promotion methods. Beyond it, with a thorough experimental analysis we have investigated several research questions related to the possibility of improving result diversity and keeping or even improving relevance in interactive search sessions. Moreover, we analyze how much the diversification effort affects overall search session results and how different diversification approaches behave for the different data modalities. By analyzing the overall and per feedback iteration effectiveness, we show that introducing diversity may harm initial results whereas it significantly enhances the overall session effectiveness not only considering the relevance and diversity, but also how early the user is exposed to the same amount of relevant items and diversity},

abstract = {Searchers can find the construction of query statements for submission to Information Retrieval (IR) systems a problematic activity. These problems are confounded by uncertainty about the information they are searching for, or an unfamiliarity with the retrieval system being used or collection being searched. On the World Wide Web these problems are potentially more acute as searchers receive little or no training in how to search effectively. Relevance feedback (RF) techniques allow searchers to directly communicate what information is relevant and help them construct improved query statements. However, the techniques require explicit relevance assessments that intrude on searchers' primary lines of activity and as such, searchers may be unwilling to provide this feedback. Implicit feedback systems are unobtrusive and make inferences of what is relevant based on searcher interaction. They gather information to better represent searcher needs whilst minimising the burden of explicitly reformulating queries or directly providing relevance information.},

abstract = {How do archives provide access to their records and let users search? The answer is archival description. Encoded Archival Description (EAD) in Extensible Markup Language (XML) is the de facto technical standard for "electronic" archival descriptions. It is now used to bridge the gulf between tangible records in archives and digital objects on the World WideWeb. These descriptions are finding aids, which are tools to search and find information about, or references to, archival records. The archival finding aids in EAD are left to searchers (out of sight and contact) to explore in unknown ways: how do searchers interact with these finding aids, and what type of retrieval system is needed to support them.The approach is to apply XML retrieval techniques to the EAD finding aids, develop system evaluation of EAD retrieval, and study information seeking behavior of archival search. The main information retrieval (IR) contributions are the system evaluation of an important "real" and domain-specific search task, a study on the usage of transaction logs for deriving domain-specific test collections, an analysis of search behavior in yet unexplored structured documents, and tailoring IR evaluation to specific searcher stereotypes.The first study involves the design and implementation of the archival search engine README. The README system attempts to incorporate current technologies with the archival structure in finding aids---such as XML retrieval---and simultaneously to uphold the archival principles where this structure is based upon. The system is the proof of concept. Having established this baseline, the next study explores and tests the construction of an IR test collection. A test collection is a key component in IR evaluation. The basis of this test collection are the queries and clicks on archival descriptions that can be found in the search log files of the National Archives of the Netherlands. There is no readily-available test collection for evaluating the accuracy of the retrieval of archival descriptions of records by an archival search engine. Manually creating such a collection is expensive. The study shows that automatically creating a test collection seems viable.Archival principles---such as provenance and original order---are deeply rooted in the arrangement and subsequent description of archival records. These principles have been cast on EAD finding aids as well. The investigation continues by shedding new light on them in a system evaluation. Additionally, the experiments probe XML retrieval-specific issues, such as the retrieval of certain elements. The study concludes by reflecting on the README archival search engine, which is the baseline of the probes in this dissertation. How effective are certain archival principles for archival access in this digital age.Using the archival search log files, the research focus shifts to the arrangement of records in EAD and user search behaviors using this arrangement. The sub-document clicks within the finding aids point to the online interaction of users within "electronic" archival descriptions of records. The analysis of the interactions comprises of quantifying the search behavior. This results in a state diagram that captures different information search behaviors of different people. By analyzing real-world interaction, the discussion on the use of the finding aid in this digital age as access tool becomes more complete. The result is more understanding of online archival search behavior within EAD finding aids, which can be used to improve a search system adapted to existing "electronic" archival description.Finally, the system evaluation deals with tailoring a search engine to the different user stereotypes, namely "expert" and 'novice' groups based on the number of times that a user re-uses the system. The results show that although there are significant differences in terms of search behavior, this does not necessarily mean that for more effective retrieval of archival descriptions, the system needs to be adapted to improve access for these different user groups.The doctoral dissertation is available online at http://dare.uva.nl/record/395154.},

abstract = {Amid the rapid growth of information today is the increasing challenge for people to survive and navigate its magnitude. Dynamics and heterogeneity of large information spaces such as the Web challenge information retrieval in these environments. Collection of information in advance and centralization of IR operations are hardly possible because systems are dynamic and information is distributed.While monolithic search systems continue to struggle with scalability problems of today, the future of search likely requires a decentralized architecture where many information systems can participate. As individual systems interconnect to form a global structure, finding relevant information in distributed environments transforms into a problem concerning not only information retrieval but also complex networks. Understanding network connectivity will provide guidance on how decentralized search and retrieval methods can function in these information spaces.The dissertation studies one aspect of scalability challenges facing classic information retrieval models and presents a decentralized, organic view of information systems pertaining to search in large scale networks. It focuses on the impact of network structure on search performance and investigates a phenomenon we refer to as the Clustering Paradox, in which the topology of interconnected systems imposes a scalability limit. Experiments involving large scale benchmark collections provide evidence on the Clustering Paradox in the IR context. In an increasingly large, distributed environment, decentralized searches for relevant information can continue to function well only when systems interconnect in certain ways. Relying on partial indexes of distributed systems, some level of network clustering enables very efficient and effective discovery of relevant information in large scale networks. Increasing or reducing network clustering degrades search performances. Given this specific level of network clustering, search time is well explained by a poly-logarithmic relation to network size, indicating a high scalability potential for searching in a continuously growing information space.},

abstract = {Representing multimedia documents by means of concepts labels attached to parts of these documents has great potential for improving retrieval performance. The reason is that concepts are independent from how users refer to them and from the modality in which they occur. For example, a Flower and une Fleur refers to the same concept and a singing bird can appear in an image or an audio recording. The question whether a concept occurs in a multimedia document is answered by a concept detector. However, as building concept detectors is difficult the current detection performance is low which causes the retrieval engine to be uncertain about the actual document representation.This thesis proposes the Uncertain Document Representation Ranking (URR) Framework which deals with this uncertainty by transferring the principles of the Portfolio Selection Theory in finance where the future win of a share is uncertain to the concept-based retrieval problem. Similarly to the distribution of future wins, the retrieval framework considers multiple possible concept-based document representations for each document resulting in multiple possible scores, which is the main scientific contribution of this thesis. Given an existing retrieval function for a certain representation, documents are ranked by the expected score plus an expression of the score's variance.From the general URR framework, we derive ranking models for shot and video segment retrieval. The shot retrieval and the video segment model re-use the probability of relevance and a language modeling ranking function respectively, basing themselves on decades of text retrieval research. We show in experiments that the models significantly improve performance over several strong baselines in five TRECVid collections.Furthermore, current performance of concept-based multimedia retrieval is low. A major reason for this is the performance of the concept detectors on which the simulation is based. Therefore, we predict the influence of improved concept detectors on general concept-based retrieval performance using Monte Carlo simulations. We find that more effort is needed to improve concept detectors, but it is realistic for concept-based retrieval to reach performance suitable for large-scale, real-life applications in the future.Available at http://doc.utwente.nl/72019/ (or http://robin.aly.de, with errata).},

In this overload of information, Information Retrieval (IR) has been playing a prominent role by developing systems capable of separating relevant information from the rest. This separation, however, is a difficult task rooted in the complexity of understanding of what is and what is not relevant. To manage this complexity, IR has developed a strong empirical nature, which has led to the development of grounded retrieval models, resulting in the development of retrieval systems empirically designed to be biased towards relevant information. However, other biases have been observed, which counteract retrieval performance. In this thesis, the reduction of retrieval systems to filters of information, or sampling processes, has allowed us to systematically investigate these biases.},

abstract = {Web search engines are large scale information retrieval systems, which provide easy access to information on the Web. High performance query processing is fundamental for the success of such systems. In fact, web search engines can receive billions of queries per day. Additionally, the issuing users are often impatient and expect sub-second response times to their queries (e.g., 500 ms). For such reasons, search companies adopt distributed query processing strategies to cope with huge volumes of incoming queries and to provide sub-second response times. Web search engines perform distributed query processing on computer clusters composed by thousands of computers and hosted in large data centers. While data center facilities enable large-scale online services, they also raise economical and environmental concerns. Therefore, an important problem to address is how to reduce the energy expenditure of data centers. Moreover, another problem to tackle is how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and the negative impact of the data centers on the environment. A large part of the energy consumption of a data center could be accounted to inefficiencies in its cooling and power supply systems. However, search companies already adopt state-of-the art techniques to reduce the energy wastage of such systems, leaving little room for more improvements in those areas. Therefore, new approaches are necessary to mitigate the environmental impact and the energy expenditure of web search engines. One option is to reduce the energy consumption of computing resources to mitigate the energy expenditure and carbon footprint of a search company. In particular, reducing the energy consumption of CPUs represents an attractive venue for web search engines. Currently, CPU cores frequencies are typically managed by operating system components, called frequency governors. We propose to delegate the CPU power management from the OS frequency governors to the query processing application [2]. Such search engine-specific governors can reduce up to 24% a server power consumption, with only limited (but uncontrollable) drawbacks in the quality of search results with respect to a system running at maximum CPU frequency. Since users can hardly notice response times that are faster than their expectations we advise that web search engine should not process queries faster than user expectations and, consequently, we propose the Predictive Energy Saving Online Scheduling (PESOS) algorithm, to select the most appropriate CPU frequency to process a query by its deadline, on a per-core basis [3]. PESOS can reduce the CPU energy consumption of a query processing server from 24% up to 48% when compared to a high performance system running at maximum CPU core frequency. To reduce the carbon footprint of web search engines, another option consists in using green energy to partially power their data centers. Stemming from these observations, we propose a new query forwarding algorithm that exploits both the green energy sources available at different data centers and the differences in market energy prices [1]. The proposed solution maintains a high query throughput, while reducing by up to 25% the energy operational costs of multi-center search engines.},

abstract = {Queries submitted to a web search engine are typically short and often ambiguous. With the enormous size of the Web, a misunderstanding of the information need underlying an ambiguous query can misguide the search engine, ultimately leading the user to abandon the originally submitted query. In order to overcome this problem, a sensible approach is to diversify the documents retrieved for the user's query. As a result, the likelihood that at least one of these documents will satisfy the user's actual information need is increased.In this thesis, we argue that an ambiguous query should be seen as representing not one, but multiple information needs. Based upon this premise, we propose xQuAD---Explicit Query Aspect Diversification, a novel probabilistic framework for search result diversification. In particular, the xQuAD framework naturally models several dimensions of the search result diversification problem in a principled yet practical manner. To this end, the framework represents the possible information needs underlying a query as a set of keyword-based sub-queries. Moreover, xQuAD accounts for the overall coverage of each retrieved document with respect to the identified sub-queries, so as to rank highly diverse documents first. In addition, it accounts for how well each sub-query is covered by the other retrieved documents, so as to promote novelty--and hence penalise redundancy---in the ranking. The framework also models the importance of each of the identified sub-queries, so as to appropriately cater for the interests of the user population when diversifying the retrieved documents. Finally, since not all queries are equally ambiguous, the xQuAD framework caters for the ambiguity level of different queries, so as to appropriately trade-off relevance for diversity on a per-query basis.The xQuAD framework is general and can be used to instantiate several diversification models, including the most prominent models described in the literature. In particular, within xQuAD, each of the aforementioned dimensions of the search result diversification problem can be tackled in a variety of ways. In this thesis, as additional contributions besides the xQuAD framework, we introduce novel machine learning approaches for addressing each of these dimensions. These include a learning to rank approach for identifying effective subqueries as query suggestions mined from a query log, an intent-aware approach for choosing the ranking models most likely to be effective for estimating the coverage and novelty of multiple documents with respect to a sub-query, and a selective approach for automatically predicting how much to diversify the documents retrieved for each individual query. In addition, we perform the first empirical analysis of the role of novelty as a diversification strategy for web search.As demonstrated throughout this thesis, the principles underlying the xQuAD framework are general, sound, and effective. In particular, to validate the contributions of this thesis, we thoroughly assess the effectiveness of xQuAD under the standard experimentation paradigm provided by the diversity task of the TREC 2009, 2010, and 2011 Web tracks. The results of this investigation demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Indeed, xQuAD attains consistent and significant improvements in comparison to the most effective diversification approaches in the literature, and across a range of experimental conditions, comprising multiple input rankings, multiple sub-query generation and coverage estimation mechanisms, as well as queries with multiple levels of ambiguity. Altogether, these results corroborate the state-of-the-art diversification performance of xQuAD.Available online at http://theses.gla.ac.uk/4106/.},

abstract = {The problem of automatically answering natural language questions by pinpointing exact answers in a large text (web) corpus has been studied since the mid 1990s. Most research has been directed at answering factoid questions: questions that expect a short, clearly identifiable answer; usually a named entity such as a person name, location or year. In this dissertation, we have focused on the problem of answering why-questions (why-QA). Whyquestions require a different approach than factoid questions because their answers tend to be longer and more complex. Our main research question was: "What are the possibilities and limitations of an approach to why-QA that uses linguistic information in addition to text retrieval techniques?We first experimented with a simple bag-of-words approach on a set of open-domain whyquestions and Wikipedia as answer corpus. With Lemur as retrieval engine and TF-IDF as ranking model, we were able to retrieve a correct answer passage in the top-10 for 45% of the questions. The most important limitation of the bag-of-words approach for why-QA is that the structure of the questions and the candidate answers is not taken into account. We studied a number of levels of linguistic information on both the side of the question and the side of the answer passage in order to find out which type of information is the most important for answering why-questions.We implemented a re-ranking module that incorporates knowledge about the syntactic structure of why-questions and the document context of the answers. With this module, we were able to improve significantly over the already quite reasonable bag-of-words baseline. After we optimized the feature combination in a learning-to-rank set-up, our system reached an MRR of 0.35 with a success@10 score of 57%. These scores were reached with only eight overlap features, one of which was the baseline ranker TF-IDF and the others were based on linguistic information (e.g. question focus, cue words and WordNet Similarity) and document structure (e.g. document title and the position of the answer passage in the document).For solving the remaining 43% of the questions, we found that more is needed than classic NLP. Our conclusion is that why-QA deserves renewed attention from the field of artificial intelligence.The dissertation is available online at http://lands.let.ru.nl/~sverbern/.},

abstract = {Mark Twain famously said that "the past does not repeat itself, but it rhymes." In the spirit of this reflection, we present novel algorithms and methods for leveraging large-scale digital histories and human knowledge mined from the Web to make real-time predictions about the likelihoods of future human and natural events of interest.The Web is a dynamic being, with constantly updating content, which is entangled with sophisticated user behaviors and interactions. Some of these behaviors have the ability to convey current trends in the present, e.g., economical growth (predicting automobile sales based on query volume [6]), popular movies [4], and political unrest [1, 3, 5]. We mine the ever-changing Web content and user Web behavior. We show that, not only the dynamics itself can be predicted, but also that it can be used for future real-world event prediction. We mine decades of news reports (1851 - 2010) from the New York Times (NYT), and describe how we can learn to predict the future by generalizing sets of concrete transitions in sequences of reported news events. In addition to the news corpora, we leverage data from freely available Web resources, including Wikipedia, FreeBase, OpenCyc, and GeoNames, via the LinkedData platform [2]. The goal is to build predictive models that generalize from specific sets of sequences of events to provide likelihoods of future outcomes, based on patterns of evidence observed in near-term Web activities. We propose the methods as a means of generating actionable forecasts in advance of the occurrence of target events in the world.This thesis is one of the first works to demonstrate general, unrestricted artificial-intelligence prediction capacity. We present methods derived from heterogeneous Web sources to make knowledge-intensive reasoning about causality and future event prediction, using both automatic feature extraction and novel algorithms for generalizing over historical examples.},

abstract = {Faceted search enables users to navigate a multi-dimensional information space by combining keyword search with drill-down options in each facets. For example, when searching "computer monitor" in an e-commerce site, users can select brands and monitor types from the the provided facets {"Samsung", "Dell", "Acer", ...} and {"LET-Lit", "LCD", "OLED",...}. It has been used successfully for many vertical applications, including e-commerce and digital libraries. However, this idea is not well explored for general web search in an opendomain setting, even though it holds great potential for assisting multi-faceted queries and exploratory search.The goal of this work is to explore this potential by extending faceted search into the opendomain web setting, which we call Faceted Web Search. We address three fundamental issues in Faceted Web Search, namely: how to automatically generate facets (facet generation); how to re-organize search results with users' selections on facets (facet feedback); and how to evaluate generated facets and entire Faceted Web Search systems.In conventional faceted search, facets are generated in advance for an entire corpus either manually or semi-automatically, and then recommended for particular queries in most of the previous work. However, this approach is difficult to extend to the entire web due to the web's large and heterogeneous nature. We instead propose a query-dependent approach, which extracts facets for queries from their web search results. We further improve our facet generation model under a more practical scenario, where users care more about precision of presented facets than recall.The dominant facet feedback method in conventional faceted search is Boolean filtering, which filters search results by users' selections on facets. However, our investigation shows Boolean filtering is too strict when extended to the open-domain setting. Thus, we propose soft ranking models for Faceted Web Search, which expand original queries with users' selections on facets to re-rank search results. Our experiments show that the soft ranking models are more effective than Boolean filtering models for Faceted Web Search.To evaluate Faceted Web Search, we propose both intrinsic evaluation, which evaluates facet generation on its own, and extrinsic evaluation, which evaluates an entire Faceted Web Search system by its utility in assisting search clarification. We also design a method for building reusable test collections for such evaluations. Our experiments show that using the Faceted Web Search interface can significantly improve the original ranking if allowed sufficient time for user feedback on facets.},

abstract = {The two basic requirements for achieving software reuse are: (1) to provide a sufficient number of components over a spectrum of domains that can be reused as is (black-box reuse) or easily adapted (white-box reuse), and (2) to organize components such that code close to the users' needs is easy to locate. Many attempts have been made at addressing the first issue, (e.g. UNIX) however, as far as the second requirement is concerned very few library systems are available or attractive enough to make actual reuse faster than rewriting from scratch.With the increasing size of natural-language documentation in modern software component collections, there is a growing interest in applying IR techniques to the construction of software libraries. For instance recent tools such as INFoEXPLORER for the IBM RS/6000 series, or ANSWERBOOK for Sun Sparc workstations, provide standard IR techniques for searching on-line documentation. However, due to the nature of software documentation and of reuse requirements, some specific IR techniques can be devised to significantly enhance retrieval effectiveness.In this paper, we identify the necessary requirements to be met by the software collection in order to apply an IR approach, and we describe the specificity of reuse as compared to other applications. As an example, we describe GuRu, an information storage and retrieval system for reuse. This system is only briefly described as it has already presented elsewhere, and we rather concentrate on showing how GuRu satisfies the specific needs of reuse. GURU is currently used at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center by a growing pool of users. We also provide an experimental test collection with relevance judgments for the AIx 3 command set to be used as a starting ground for evaluating retrieval effectiveness in reuse applications. Finally, we compare GURU's indexing scheme to two other schemes using this test collection.},

abstract = {"Searching" on web has become an integral part of today's world, and many people rely on it when looking for information. The amount and the diversity of information available on the Web have also increased dramatically. Due to which, search engine companies are making constant efforts in order to make this information accessible to the people effectively. Not only there is an increase in the amount and diversity of information available online, users are now often seeking information on broader topics. Users seeking information on broad topics, gather information from various information sources (e.g., image, video, news, blog, etc). For such information requests, not only web results but results from different document genre and multimedia contents are also becoming relevant. For instance, users' looking for information on "Glasgow" might be interested in web results about Glasgow, Map of Glasgow, Images of Glasgow, News of Glasgow, and so on.Aggregated search aims to provide access to this diverse information in a unified manner by aggregating results from different information sources on a single result page; hence making information gathering process easier for broad topics. This thesis aimed to explore aggregated search from the users perspective.The thesis first and foremost focused on understanding and describing the phenomena related to the users' search process in the context of aggregated search. The goal was to participate in building theories and in understanding constraints, as well as providing insights into the interface design.While the thematic (or topical) relevance of documents is important, this thesis argued that the "source type" (source-orientation) might also be an important dimension in the relevance space for investigating aggregated search. Therefore, relevance is multi-dimensional (topical and sourceorientated) within the context of aggregated search. Results from the study suggested that the effect of the source-orientation was a significant factor in an aggregated search scenario, hence adding another dimension to the relevance space within the aggregated search scenario. The thesis further presented a method, which combines rule base and machine learning techniques to identify source-orientation behind a user query.Furthermore, after analyzing log data from a search engine company and conducting user study experiments, several design issues that may arise with respect to the aggregated search interface were identified. In order to address these issues, suitable design guidelines that can be beneficial from the interface perspective were also suggested.Overall, the thesis aimed to explore the emerging aggregated search from users' perspective, since it is a very important for front-end technologies. An additional goal was to provide empirical evidence regarding how aggregated search influence users searching behavior, and identified some of the key challenges in aggregated search.Available online at: http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3289/.},

abstract = {How can search engines use the hyperlinks between documents to determine which documents are the most relevant for a search query? Some search engines use links to determine popularity, where the underlying idea is that the number of links pointing to a document (Web page) is a measure of its popularity. Another aspect of links is they provide a signal that two documents have related content. After all, a link is a reference. If a document A is relevant for a search query, then documents linked to A are possibly also relevant. Link information could possibly contain evidence for the topical relevance of a document.The value of link evidence for ir was investigated through the trec Web Tracks of 1999--2004. First through the traditional ad hoc search methodology, with disappointing results. When ad hoc search was considered an inappropriate model for Web search, attention moved to moreWeb-centric search tasks such as navigational search, with great success. Home pages and other importantWeb pages tend to be pages with many incoming links, and link evidence such as indegree counts and PageRank proved highly effective.The question of why links are not useful for measuring topical relevance was never answered. The goal of this thesis is to give a more precise and complete account of the value of link evidence for information retrieval. This is first investigated using the English Wikipedia, because it is available in its entirety, including all the links, and comes with a large, highquality test collection in the form of the inex Ad Hoc collection of 2006--2007. As an encyclopedia, Wikipedia is a natural collection to study topical relevance search tasks.Link information can be derived from the link graph of the entire collection--giving global, query-independent information--or from a subset of the link graph derived from the top results for a given query produced by a text-based retrieval system, giving local, queryindependent link information. PageRank is often computed on the global link graph, while algorithms like hits are typically used on the local links of the top-ranked results.We find that for ad hoc search on the inex 2006 Wikipedia collection, local link evidence leads to significant performance improvements. Incoming and outgoing link information is equally effective; the direction of the links does not affect their value for ad hoc search. We compare this to Web-centric search tasks on the trec 2004 Web track collection and to the ad hoc task on the trec 2009 Web track collection. For Web-centric search tasks, such as home page and named page finding, incoming link evidence is more effective than outgoing link evidence, and global link evidence is more effective than local link evidence. The value of link evidence for Web-centric search is to identify popular and authoritative pages, and the link direction determines the value. For ad hoc search on the more recent ClueWeb09 collection, global outgoing link evidence is very effective, but turns out to favour Wikipedia pages, which are densely interlinked. If we remove Wikipedia from the ClueWeb09 collection, local link evidence is more effective than global link evidence, and incoming and outgoing link evidence are equally effective. We also find that site-internal links are more effective for ad hoc search than site-external links. To determine the impact of link density, we conduct filtering experiments, which show that link density has a minimal impact on the effectiveness of global link evidence. For local link evidence, removing links gradually reduces the impact of link evidence, but even with a small number of links, link evidence is still effective. We also experiment with filtering links based on the semantic relatedness of the link documents and find that links between semantically related pages are more effective for identifying topically relevant documents than links between unrelated pages.Further experiments on the inex Wikipedia collection show that the amount of local link evidence is related to the amount of relevant text in documents, and the fraction of local link evidence (the percentage of the global links incident to a document that are present in the local link graph) is related to the fraction of text in a document that is relevant.With these findings, the value of link information for ranking search results has become clearer and more complete. Link information can be evidence for both popularity and topical relevance. The meaning of information derived from the link structure is determined by the direction of the links, the topical relation between the linked documents and the selection of links that is used as evidence.Available at http://staff.science.uva.nl/~mhakoole/2011/kool:mean11.pdf.},

abstract = {In this thesis, we present models for semantic search: Information Retrieval (IR) models that elicit the meaning behind the words found in documents and queries rather than simply matching keywords. This is achieved by the integration of structured domain knowledge and data-driven information retrieval methods.The research is set within health informatics to tackle the unique challenges within this domain; specifically, how to bridge the 'semantic gap'; that is, how to overcome the mismatch between raw medical data and the way human beings interpret it. Bridging the semantic gap involves addressing two issues: semantics; that is, aligning the meaning or concepts behind words found in documents and queries; and leveraging inference, which utilises semantics to infer relevant information.Three semantic search models -- all utilising concept-based rather than term-based representations---are developed; these include: the Bag-of-concepts model, which utilises concepts from the SNOMED CT medical ontology as its underlying representation; the Graph-based Concept Weighting model, which captures concept dependence and importance in a novel weighting function; and the core contribution of the thesis, the Graph INference model (GIN): a unified theoretical model of semantic search as inference, achieved by the integration of structured domain knowledge (ontologies) and statistical, information retrieval methods. It is the GIN that provides the necessary mechanism for inference to bridge the semantic gap. All three models are empirically evaluated using clinical queries and a real-world collection of clinical records taken from the TREC Medical Records Track (MedTrack).Our evaluation shows that the use of concept-based representations in the Bag-of-concepts model leads to improved retrieval effectiveness. When concepts are combined within the Graph-based ConceptWeighting model, further improvements are possible. The evaluation of GIN highlighted that its inference mechanism is suited to hard queries -- those that perform poorly on a term-based system. In-depth analysis also revealed that the GIN returned many new documents not retrieved by term-based systems and therefore never evaluated for relevance as part of the TREC MedTrack. This highlights that using current IR test collections, where semantic search systems did not contribute to the pool, may underestimate the effectiveness of semantic search systems.This work represents a significant step forward in the integration of structured domain knowledge and data-driven information retrieval methods. Furthermore, the thesis provides an understanding of inference -- when and how it should be applied for effective semantic search. It shows that queries with certain characteristics benefit from inference, while others do not. The detailed investigation into the evaluation of semantic search systems shows how current IR test collections may underestimate effectiveness of such systems and new techniques for evaluation are suggested. The Graph Inference model, although developed within the medical domain, is generally defined and has implications in other areas, including web search, where an emerging research trend is to utilise structured knowledge resources for more effective semantic search.},

We observed four different kinds of searchers using an experimental information retrieval (IR) system: (1) search novices; (2) domain experts; (3) search experts and (4) medical librarians. The information needs were a subset of the relatively difficult topics originally created for the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). By experimental design, we used 20 search topics in an IR user experiment to alleviate search topic variability. Effectiveness of retrieval was based on the relevance judgments set provided by TREC. Thirty-two participants searched either using a version of the system in which abstracts and MeSH terms were displayed or another version in which they had to formulate their own terms based only on the display of abstracts. We found that MeSH terms were more useful for domain experts than for search experts in terms of the precision measure, even though domain experts did not perceive that MeSH terms were useful. We speculate that because of the technical topics, only the domain experts had the knowledge to understand and therefore make use of the MeSH terms. The primary contributions of this research are: (1) assessment of relative impact of searchers characteristics of domain knowledge and search training on search effectiveness and (2) design and methodology for assessing the usefulness of controlled vocabulary. The effort to create MeSH terms is worthwhile for domain experts' searches on technical topics.},

abstract = {Content-oriented XML retrieval systems support access to XML repositories by retrieving, in response to user queries, XML document components (XML elements) instead of whole documents. The retrieved XML elements should not only contain information relevant to the query, but also should be specific to the given query (i.e. do not discuss other irrelevant topics).To score XML elements according to how relevant and specific they are given a query, the content and logical structure of XML documents have been widely used. This thesis aims to examine a new source of evidence deriving from the semantic decomposition of XML documents. We consider that XML documents can be semantically decomposed through the application of a topic segmentation algorithm. Using the semantic decomposition and the logical structure of XML documents, we define the notion of topic shifts in an XML element. We then formalise the number of topic shifts to reflect the element's relevance, and more particularly its specificness, to the given user's query.This thesis investigates the use of topic shifts in content-oriented XML retrieval, which is mainly involved in retrieving information from semi-structured (XML) documents. First, we examine the characteristics of XML elements reflected by their number of topic shifts. Second, we use the number of topic shifts to estimate the relevance of the elements in the collection. Finally, we use topic shifts to provide a focused access to XML documents, which aims to determine not only relevant elements, but those at the right level of granularity.The main contributions of this thesis are the introduction of topic shifts in the context of content-oriented XML retrieval and the extensive evaluation of the ways this evidence can be employed in retrieving XML elements. This thesis demonstrates that topic shifts in XML elements constitute a useful source of evidence for both improving the ranking of XML elements, and determining elements at the right level of granularity in content-oriented XML retrieval.The thesis is available online at http://elham.ashoori.org/publications/phd-thesis.pdf.},

abstract = {The recent popularity of social media is changing the way people share and acquire knowledge. Companies started using intra-organizational social media applications in order to improve the communication and collaboration among employees. In addition to their professional use, people have been using these sites in their personal lives for information acquisition purposes, such as community question answering (CQA) sites for their questions. In such environments the interactions do not always occur between users who know each other well enough to assess expertise of one another or trust the accuracy of their created content. This dissertation solves this problem by estimating topic-specific expertise scores of users which can be also used to improve the expertise related applications in social medi.Expert retrieval has been widely studied using organizational documents; however, theadditional structure and information available in social media provide the opportunity to improve the developed expert finding approaches. Such additional information includes the availability of different types of user created content, the underlying social network structure constructed from the interactions among users, such as commenting or replying, and the available temporal information coming from the timestamped user interactions. This available information is explored and approaches which use this information for more effective expertise estimation have been proposed. In particular, the main contributions of this dissertation can be summarized as follows: Content-based Retrieval: What to search for and where to search are two important factors in retrieval tasks. This dissertation focused on these questions for the expert finding task in CQA sites. Available and different types of content-based evidence are explored to find effective and also approach independent representations for both the information need (query) and user expertise. The proposed representations returned statistically significant improvements when tested with different expert retrieval algorithms.Authority Estimation: Web page authority estimation approaches have been widely adapted to user interaction networks which are constructed by using the interactions between users. Understanding the interaction and structure behind these user graphs showed us some of the limitations of these adaptations when applied to these networks. Based on these analyses, more topic-specific authority graph construction and estimation approaches, which provided consistent improvements in both accuracy and efficiency, are proposed.Temporal Modeling: Humans are dynamic in nature with changing levels of interest, expertise and availability. In order to model this dynamic nature of users, we explored the available timestamp information within social media. With using that information, a more dynamic expert identification approach, which takes into account the recent topic-specific interest of users as well as their availability, is proposed. This move from static to dynamic modeling of expertise returned statistically significant improvements, due to more effective modeling of expertise of the constantly changing users.These proposed approaches are combined in an expert identification system which has been tested on an intra-organizational blog data and a popular community question answering site's data, for three expertise estimation related tasks: identification of topic-specific expert bloggers, routing questions to users who can provide accurate and timely replies, and ranking replies based on responders question specific expertise. Statistically significant improvements are observed in all three tasks. In addition to improving the effectiveness of expert identification applications in social media, the proposed approaches are also more efficient which makes the proposed expert finding system applicable to real time environments.},

abstract = {Enlightened by the cognitive psychology literature demonstrating that multitasking behavior is correlated closely to humans' cognitive processing and coordinationcapabilities, this doctoral thesis explores the nature and relationship of multitasking, cognitive coordination, and cognitive shifts during Web searching. A combination of data collection techniques including pre- and post-questionnaires, think-aloud protocols, search logs, observations and semi-structured interviews were employed to observe how 42 postgraduate students cognitively coordinated Web searches when multitasking across 126 real-life information problems.Results show that Web searching is a dynamic interaction between users and Web search systems during which multiple information problems ordering, evolving information problems generating, searching task switching, task and mental coordinating occur, and at a deeper level, cognitive shifts take place. The explicit task level coordination is closely linked to multitasking behavior. The implicit cognitive level coordination is related to the task coordination process; this includes the evolution of information problem development and search task switching. Coordination mechanisms directly result in the shifts of cognitive states including strategy, evaluation, and view states which further affect users' holistic shifts in information problem understanding and knowledge contribution.Based on the findings, a Web search model integrating multitasking, cognitive coordination and cognitive shifts (MCC model) is presented. Cognitive coordination as humans' vital capability under conscious control plays a nexus role in supporting multitasking Web searches and invoking the occurrence of shifts in cognition. The results extend multitasking research and Web search models in the field by examining and integrating underlying cognitive and coordination support mechanisms. Design recommendations for adaptive search systems are also put forward based on the characteristics and relationship of users' behaviors in multitasking, cognitive coordination and shifting.},

The main thrust of our approach is to use several metrics to estimate the relevance of every automatically discovered document by a crawler regarding a topic of interest. This type of search resulted in two important findings. First, the time required for manual analysis of document content by the crawler was significantly reduced; second, the content quality of selected documents was improved.

abstract = {In recent years, various recommendation algorithms have been proposed to support learners in technology-enhanced learning environments. Such algorithms have proven to be quite effective in big-data learning settings (massive open online courses), yet successful applications in other informal and formal learning settings are rare. Common challenges include data sparsity, the lack of sufficiently flexible learner and domain models, and the difficulty of including pedagogical goals into recommendation strategies. Computational models of human cognition and learning are, in principle, well positioned to help meet these challenges, yet the effectiveness of cognitive models in educational recommender systems remains poorly understood to this date. This thesis contributes to this strand of research by investigating i) two cognitive learner models (CbKST and SUSTAIN) for resource recommendations that qualify for sparse user data by following theory-driven top down approaches, and ii) two tag recommendation strategies based on models of human cognition (BLL and MINERVA2) that support the creation of learning content meta-data. The results of four online and offline experiments in different learning contexts indicate that a recommendation approach based on the CbKST, a well-founded structural model of knowledge representation, can improve the users? perceived learning experience in formal learning settings. In informal settings, SUSTAIN, a human category learning model, is shown to succeed in representing dynamic, interest based learning interactions and to improve Collaborative Filtering for resource recommendations. The investigation of the two proposed tag recommender strategies underlined their ability to generate accurate suggestions (BLL) and in collaborative settings, their potential to promote the development of shared vocabulary (MINERVA2). This thesis shows that the application of computational models of human cognition holds promise for the design of recommender mechanisms and, at the same time, for gaining a deeper understanding of interaction dynamics in virtual learning systems.},

abstract = {A substantial fraction of web search queries contain references to entities, such as persons, organizations, and locations. This signi cant presence of named entities in queries provides an opportunity for web search engines to improve their understanding of the user's information need.In this thesis, we investigate the entity-oriented query expansion process. Particularly, we propose two novel and effective query expansion approaches that exploit semantic sources of evidence to devise discriminative term features, and machine learning techniques to effectively combine these features in order to rank candidate expansion terms. As a result, not only do we select effective expansion terms, but we also weigh these terms according to their predicted effectiveness. In addition, since our query expansion approaches consider Wikipedia infoboxes as a source of candidate expansion terms, a frequent obstacle is that only about 20% of Wikipedia articles have an infobox. To overcome this problem we propose WAVE, a self-supervised approach to autonomously generate infoboxes for Wikipedia articles.First, we propose UQEE, an unsupervised entity-oriented query expansion approach, which effectively selects expansion terms using taxonomic features devised by the semantic structure implicitly provided by infobox templates. We show that query expansion using infoboxes presents a better trade-off between retrieval performance and query latency. Moreover, we demonstrate that the automatically generated infoboxes provided by WAVE are as effective as manually generated infoboxes for query expansion. Lastly, we propose L2EE, a learning to rank approach for entity-oriented query expansion, which considers semantic evidence encoded in the content of Wikipedia article fields, and automatically labels training examples proportionally to their observed retrieval effectiveness.Experiments on three TREC web test collections attest the effectiveness of L2EE, with significant gains compared to UQEE and state-of-the-art pseudo-relevance feedback and entity-oriented pseudo-relevance feedback approaches.},

abstract = {Information Extraction (IE) is a field at the crossroads of IR and NLP that studies methods for extracting information from text in such a way that this information can be used to populate a structured information repository. The main methods by means of which IE has been tackled rely on supervised learning;the best-performing such methods belong to the class of probabilistic graphical models, and, in particular, to the class of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs). In this thesis we investigate two major aspects related to textual IE via CRFs: (a) the creation of CRFs models that can outperform the commonly adopted linear- chain CRFs, and the creation of methods for ensuring the quality of training data and for assessing the impact of training data quality on the accuracy of CRFs systems for IE.We start by facing the task of IE from medical documents written in the Italian language. We propose two novel approaches: (i) a cascaded, two-stage method composed by two layers of CRFs, and (ii) a confidence-weighted ensemble method that combines standard linear-chain CRFs and the proposed two-stage method. Both the proposed models are shown to outperform a standard linear-chain CRFs system.We then investigate aspect-oriented sentence-level opinion mining from product reviews, that consists in predicting, for all sentences in the review, whether the sentence expresses a positive, neutral, or negative opinion (or no opinion at all) about a specific aspect of the product. We propose a set of increasingly powerful models based on CRFs, including a hierarchical multi-label CRFs scheme that jointly models the overall opinion expressed in a product review and the set of aspect-specific opinions expressed in each of its sentences. The proposed CRFs models are shown to obtain better results than linear-chain CRFs.We then study the impact that the quality of training data has on the accuracy of an IE system via experiments performed on a dataset in which inter-coder agreement data are available. Finally, we investigate active learning techniques for a type of semi-supervised CRFs specifically devised for partially labeled sequences. We show that margin-based strategies always obtain the best results on the four tasks we have tested them on.},

abstract = {In this thesis, we address major challenges in searching temporal document collections. In such collections, documents are created and/or edited over time. Examples of temporal document collections are web archives, news archives, blogs, personal emails and enterprise documents. Unfortunately, traditional IR approaches based on term-matching only can give unsatisfactory results when searching temporal document collections. The reason for this is twofold: the contents of documents are strongly time-dependent, i.e., documents are about events happened at particular time periods, and a query representing an information need can be time-dependent as well, i.e., a temporal query.Our contributions in this thesis are different time-aware approaches within three topics in IR: content analysis, query analysis, and retrieval and ranking models. In particular, we aim at improving the retrieval effectiveness by 1) analyzing the contents of temporal document collections, 2) performing an analysis of temporal queries, and 3) explicitly modeling the time dimension into retrieval and ranking.Leveraging the time dimension in ranking can improve the retrieval effectiveness if information about the creation or publication time of documents is available. In this thesis, we analyze the contents of documents in order to determine the time of non-timestamped documents using temporal language models. We subsequently employ the temporal language models for determining the time of implicit temporal queries, and the determined time is used for re-ranking search results in order to improve the retrieval effectiveness.We study the effect of terminology changes over time and propose an approach to handling terminology changes using time-based synonyms. In addition, we propose different methods for predicting the effectiveness of temporal queries, so that a particular query enhancement technique can be performed to improve the overall performance. When the time dimension is incorporated into ranking, documents will be ranked according to both textual and temporal similarity. In this case, time uncertainty should also be taken into account. Thus, we propose a ranking model that considers the time uncertainty, and improve ranking by combining multiple features using learning-to-rank techniques.Through extensive evaluation, we show that our proposed time-aware approaches outperform traditional retrieval methods and improve the retrieval effectiveness in searching temporal document collections.Available online at: http://www.idi.ntnu.no/research/doctor_theses/nattiya.pdf.},

abstract = {Web search engines have to deal with a huge increase of information, demanded by high incoming query traffic. This situation has driven companies to build large, geographically distributed data centres housing thousands of servers and consuming enormous amounts of electricity. At this scale, even minor efficiency improvements may result in large financial and power savings.This thesis represents a novel contribution to the state-of-the-art of Query Scheduling and Green Information Retrieval (Green IR), by assisting large-scale data centres to build more efficient and environmentally-friendly search engines.The main contributions of this work are the following: Query Scheduling. We introduce query efficiency predictors as suitable estimators to improve Query Scheduling. We estimate the processing time of the queries waiting in each query server and we calculate an approximate time that a new query must spend in each queue. Based on this estimation, the fastest query server is selected.Green IR. Once we have developed new methods to improve the average response time of a search engine, we focus on reducing the power consumption of the whole system. This thesis proposes a mathematical model that establishes a trade-off between latency and power consumption. This model attempts to automatically adapt the number of active servers in the system based on the fluctuations of a daily query traffic flow.Queueing Theory. We prove the limitation of Queueing Theory models for estimating the latency in search engines. As a consequence, we develop our trade-off model by predicting the latency using historical data. Results show the good performance of this approach.IR evaluation. We attest that Simulation platforms are suitable for IR experimentation. We support this conclusion by establishing an exhaustive analysis of the current IR evaluation platforms..},

abstract = {The collective effervescence of social media production has been enjoying a great deal of success in recent years. The hundred of millions of users who are actively participating in the Social Web are exposed to ever-growing amounts of sites, relationships, and information.This work contributes state-of-the-art methods and techniques to the emerging field of Living Analytics, whose main goal is to capture people interactions in real-time and to analyze these data in order to relieve information overload. We introduce intelligent filtering approaches that exploit social interactions, multidimensional relationships, metadata, and other data becoming ubiquitous in the social web, in order to discover and recommend the most relevant and attractive information that meets users' individual needs. In particular, the contributions of this work fall into mainly two categories.(i) Recommender Systems: We present novel algorithms that advance the state-of-the-art in Online Collaborative Filtering. Moreover, we propose an approach based on Swarm Intelligence to directly optimize ranking functions for item recommendations. New approaches to address the cold-start problem in social recommender systems are also part of our contributions. In addition, we also offer a personalized ranking algorithm for Epidemic Intelligence.(ii) Collective Intelligence: Our contributions in the field of computational social science are twofold. First, we explore how social media streams can be exploited for Epidemic Intelligence and show its potential for early warning detection and outbreak analysis and control. Second, we show how the real-time nature of social media streams can be leveraged to take the pulse of political emotions.In total, the methods and studies included in this work constitute an analytics toolbox to help understand and analyze the social web.},

abstract = {As the availability of structured documents is constantly increasing, retrieval systems able to return document portions are being developed. Structured documents, usually formatted in XML, may consist of large numbers of document portions, often organised into a hierarchical logical structure. With the high number of document portions, it is necessary to direct the attention of users of retrieval systems towards the most important document portions, and also, to give overviews of the structure of documents, in other words, to show document portions in context. This thesis investigates summarisation as a means to help searchers of XML retrieval systems in the process of accessing the contents of document portions. Two types of summarisation are investigated.First, summaries of the textual contents of document portions, called XML elements, are studied in a user-based environment. Traditionally, summarisation is associated with whole documents or document sets, but rarely with document portions. As summaries of documents have been proved to be useful in whole document retrieval, it is considered worthwhile to investigate summaries of document portions in XML element retrieval. Summaries of elements are presented to searchers in the context of other elements from the document. The textual summaries of elements also reflect the searchers' information needs: they are query based.The second type of summarisation investigated in this thesis is called structure summarisation. The automatic generation of tables of contents, as structure summaries, is described and examined. ToC generation is studied either when searchers' queries are available (query based structure summarisation) or otherwise (query independent structure summarisation).The work presented in this thesis has made several contributions to the fields of summarisation and interactive XML retrieval.The thesis is available online at http://www.dcs.qmul.ac.uk/~zolley/thesis.html.},

abstract = {Users access large amounts of information resources mainly through search functions, where they type a few keywords and the web search or query engine returns a linear list of hits. While this is often satisfactory for focalized search, it does not provide enough support for exploratory information needs. Faceted and Dynamic Taxonomies (FDT) is a highly prevalent model for exploratory search, which allows users to get an overview of the information space and offer them various groupings of the results based on their attributes, metadata, or other dynamically mined information, enabling them to gradually restrict their focus through clicks and locate low ranked resources. The enrichment of such mechanisms with preferences could be proven useful for exploratory tasks. However, the current preference-based approaches seem to ignore the fact that users should be acquainted with the information space and the available choices for describing effectively their preferences.In this dissertation we extend the interaction model of FDT with preference actions that allow users to express their preferences interactively, gradually, and in a simple way. We introduce a preference framework appropriate for information spaces comprising resources described by attributes whose values can be hierarchically valued and/or multi-valued. We define the language, its semantics and the required algorithms. The framework supports preference inheritance in the hierarchies, automatic conflict resolution, as well as preference composition. Subsequently, we enrich the FDT model with preference actions and we propose logical optimizations and methods for exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of the FDT-based interaction, aiming at making it applicable to large amounts of information. We present the design and the implementation of the web-based system Hippalus, which realizes the extended interaction model. Regarding user benefits, we theoretically analyze user gain in terms of the number and difficulty of choices, and we describe and analyze three user-based evaluations. The first investigates the degree of effectiveness of preferences when users are not aware of the available choices. We found that only 20% of the users managed to express effective preferences without knowing the available choices. The second comparatively evaluates FDT with other exploratory models, and shows that the majority of users preferred FDT, was more satisfied by FDT and achieved higher rates of task completion with FDT. The last one evaluates the preference-enriched FDT as realized by Hippalus. The results were impressive. Even in a very small dataset, with the preference-enriched FDT all users successfully completed all tasks in 1/3 of the time and with 1/3 of the actions in comparison to the plain FDT. Moreover all of the users preferred the preference-enriched interfac.Available: http://www.ics.forth.gr/_publications/Papadakos_Dissertation.pdf.},

Some of this new attention has fallen on a subset of IR tasks, in particular on entity retrieval tasks. This emerging area differs from traditional document retrieval in a number of ways. Entities are not represented directly (as retrievable units such as documents), and we need to identify them "indirectly" through occurrences in documents. This brings new, exciting challenges to the fields of Information Retrieval and Information Extraction. In this thesis we focus on one particular type of entity: people.},

abstract = {Children are a fast growing user group on the Internet. Among different online activities, children use web search engines in order to gather information related to their personal interests and school activities. Children's knowledge, cognitive abilities and fine motor skills are different from those of adults. Therefore, they may experience difficulties with search engines that are built using standard information retrieval algorithms and search interfaces for adults. Special or targeted search engines for children are essential in order to better support children in their search tasks. Therefore, the goal of this thesis is to design appropriate search engines for children with a focus on the search user interface. However, this is not an easy task to accomplish. Not only are children's abilities different from the abilities of adults, children also undergo relatively fast changes in their abilities.The specific and dynamically changing characteristics of young users pose a great challenge. In order to address this challenge, first, the specifics of information retrieval for young users are analysed. Second, open issues are identified in user studies with children using logfile analysis and eye-tracking. The conceptual challenges in the design of user interfaces regarding search engines for children are derived based on the findings of one's own and previous user studies as well as theories of human development. Third, user interfaces of search engines that address these conceptual challenges are designed, prototypically implemented and evaluated in user studies with children following a user-centered design. Specifically, the proposed user interfaces of the search engine address the changing characteristics of the users by providing a means of adaptation. Furthermore, a novel type of search result visualisation for children with cartoon style characters is developed which takes the children's preference for visual information into account. Both approaches were very positively received by children during evaluation. Children rated different user interface aspects of the search user interface prototypes as good, e.g., the adaptation of the search user interface towards user wishes and the helpfulness of the cartoon style characters during search. Finally, this thesis provides criteria and guidelines on how to design user interfaces of search engines for children.},

abstract = {Text-Based Ephemeral Clustering for Web Image Retrieval on Mobile Devices.Our specific contributions in this dissertation are: two algorithms, two datasets and an evaluation tool. The Dual C-means algorithm is the main product of these. Dual C-means can be seen as a generalization of our previous proposal the AGK-means. Both algorithms are based on word-word similarity metrics and on the classical K-means algorithm. A new dataset for a complete evaluation of search results clustering (SRC) algorithms is developed and presented. Similarly, a new Web image dataset is developed and used together with a new metric to measure the users' effort when a set of Web images is explored. Finally, we developed an evaluation tool for the SRC problem, in which we have implemented several classical and recent SRC metrics.In order to validate our hypothesis, we performed a great deal of different experiments with the datasets mentioned above. Three valuable characteristics are evaluated in the proposed algorithms. First, clustering quality, in which classical and recent evaluation metrics are considered. Secondly, the labelling quality of each cluster is evaluated to make sure that all possible query intents are covered. Thirdly and finally, we evaluate the user's effort in exploring the clustered results presented as horizontal image strips. For these three, we use several datasets- some of which are built to evaluate individual or combinations of these characteristics.We have made our conclusions on the numerous factors discussed in this dissertation. In essence, the proposed Dual C-means algorithm, is capable of obtaining proper clustering partitions and simultaneously ensuring high quality labels. When images are displayed on a mobile device's interface, our results indicate that the users' effort to explore the Web image results is reduced.},

abstract = {The classic IR model of the search process consists of three elements: query, documents and search results. A user looking to fulfil an information need formulates a query usually consisting of a small set of keywords summarising the information need. The goal of an IR system is to retrieve documents containing information which might be useful or relevant to the user. Throughout the search process there is a loss of focus, because keyword queries entered by users often do not suitably summarise their complex information needs, and IR systems do not sufficiently interpret the contents of documents, leading to result lists containing irrelevant and redundant information. The main research objective of this thesis is to exploit query context and document structure to provide for more focused retrieval.The short keyword query used as input to the retrieval system can be supplemented with topic categories from structured Web resources such as DMOZ and Wikipedia. Topic categories can be used as query context to retrieve documents that are not only relevant to the query but also belong to a relevant topic category. Category information is especially useful for the task of entity ranking where the user is searching for a certain type of entity such as companies or persons. Category information can help to improve the search results by promoting in the ranking pages belonging to relevant topic categories, or categories similar to the relevant categories. By following external links and searching for the retrieved Wikipedia entities in a general Web collection, we can also exploit the structure of Wikipedia to rank entities on the general Web. Wikipedia, in contrast to the general Web, does not contain much redundant information. This absence of redundant information can be exploited by using Wikipedia as a pivot to search the general Web.A typical query returns thousands or millions of documents, but searchers hardly ever look beyond the first result page. Since space on the result page is limited, we can show only a few documents in the result list. Word clouds can be used to summarise groups of documents into a set of keywords which allows users to quickly get a grasp on the underlying data. Instead of using user-assigned tags we generate word clouds from the textual contents of documents themselves as well as the anchor text ofWeb documents. Improvements over word clouds that are created using simple term frequency counting include using a parsimonious term weighting scheme, including bigrams and biasing the word cloud towards the query. We find that word clouds can to a certain degree quickly convey the topic and relevance of a set of search results. Available online at: http://dare.uva.nl/record/39569.},

abstract = {There is currently a high demand for information systems that automatically analyze textual data, since many organizations, both private and public, need to process large amounts of such data as part of their daily routine, an activity that cannot be performed by means of human work only. One of the answers to this need is text classification (TC), the task of automatically labelling textual documents from a domain D with thematic categories from a predefined set C. Modern text classification systems have reached high efficiency standards, but cannot always guarantee the labelling accuracy that applications demand. When the level of accuracy that can be obtained is insufficient, one may revert to processes in which classification is performed via a combination of automated activity and human effort.One such process is semi-automated text classification (SATC), which we define as the task of ranking a set D of automatically labelled textual documents in such a way that, if a human annotator validates (i.e., inspects and corrects where appropriate) the documents in a top-ranked portion of D with the goal of increasing the overall labelling accuracy of D, the expected such increase is maximized. An obvious strategy is to rank D so that the documents that the classifier has labelled with the lowest confidence are top-ranked. In this dissertation we show that this strategy is suboptimal. We develop new utility-theoretic ranking methods based on the notion of validation gain, defined as the improvement in classification efectiveness that would derive by validating a given automatically labelled document. We also propose new effectiveness measures for SATC-oriented ranking methods, based on the expected reduction in classification error brought about by partially validating a ranked list generated by a given ranking method. We report the results of experiments showing that, with respect to the baseline method above, and according to the proposed measures, our utility-theoretic ranking methods can achieve substantially higher expected reductions in classification error. We therefore explore the task of SATC and the potential of our methods, in multiple text classification contexts.This dissertation is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to systematically address the task of semi-automated text classification.},

abstract = {Both the growth and ubiquitous character of the Internet have had a profound effect on how we access and consume data and information. More recently, the Semantic Web, an extension of the current Web has come increasingly relevant due to its widespread adoption.The Web of Data (WoD) is an extension of the current web, where not only documents are interlinked by means of hyperlinks but also data in terms of predicates. Specifically, it describes objects, entities or "things" in terms of their attributes and their relationships, using RDF data (and often is used equivalently to Linked Data). Given its growth, there is a strong need for making this wealth of knowledge accessible by keyword search (the de-facto standard paradigm for accessing information online).The goal of this thesis is to provide new techniques for accessing this data, i.e., to leverage its full potential to end users. We therefore address the following four main issues: a) how can the Web of Data be searched by means of keyword search?, b) what sets apart search in the WoD from traditional web search?, c) how can these elements be used in a sound and effective way?, and d) How can the techniques be adapted to a distributed environment?To this end, we develop techniques for effectively searching WoD sources. We build upon and formalise existing entity modelling approaches within a generative language modelling framework, and compare them experimentally using standard test collections. We show that these models outperform the current state-of-the-art in terms of retrieval effectiveness, however, this is done at the cost of abandoning a large part of the semantics behind the data. We propose a novel entity model capable of preserving the semantics associated with entities, without sacrificing retrieval effectiveness. We further show how these approaches can be applied in the distributed context, both with low (federated search) and high numbers (Peer-to-peer or P2P) of independent repositories, collections, or nodes.The main contributions are as follows: We develop a hybrid approach to search in the Web of Data, using elements from traditional information retrieval and structured retrieval alike.We formalise our approaches in a language model setting.We discuss and analyse based on our empirical evaluation and provide insights into the entity search problem..},

abstract = {Research in Information Retrieval has progressed against a background of rapidly increasing corpus size and heterogeneity, with every advance in technology quickly followed by a desire to organize and search more unstructured, more heterogeneous, and even bigger corpora. But as retrieval problems get larger and more complicated, evaluating the ranking performance of a retrieval engine gets harder: evaluation requires human judgments of the relevance of documents to queries, and for very large corpora the cost of acquiring these judgments may be insurmountable. This cost limits the types of problems researchers can study as well as the data they can be studied on.We present methods for understanding performance differences between retrieval engines in the presence of missing and noisy relevance judgments. The work introduces a model of the cost of experimentation that incorporates the cost of human judgments as well as the cost of drawing incorrect conclusions about differences between engines in both the training and testing phases of engine development. Through adopting a view of evaluation that is more concerned with distributions over performance differences rather than estimates of absolute performance, the expected cost can be minimized so as to reliably differentiate between engines with less than 1% of the human effort that has been used in past experiments.},

abstract = {In the past decade, the prosperity of the World Wide Web has led to fast explosion of information, and there is a long-standing demand on how to access such a huge volume of information effectively and efficiently. Information Retrieval (IR) aims to tackle the challenge by exploring approaches to obtain relevant information items (e.g., documents) relevant to a given information need (e.g., query) from a huge collection of textual data (e.g., the Web). Named entity (e.g., person, location, product, event, organization) is a type of term compound widely existing in textual data. Recent advances in Information Extraction make it possible to extract entities from large volume of free text efficiently, and the research community are actively exploring whether entities would contribute to the retrieval effectiveness.In this thesis, we investigate how to leverage entities to improve retrieval in several directions. We start with finding entities with certain semantic relation, which aims at retrieving entities and their associated attributes to meet user's information need directly. This is different from traditional search paradigm in which only documents are retrieved. Entity retrieval is performed by first retrieving a list of documents and then extracting entities from those documents. We propose a novel probabilistic framework which leverages supporting documents as bridge to model the relevance between query and entities and rank entities accordingly.On the other side, we also explore how to leverage entities to improve effectiveness of ad hoc document retrieval in two directions. The first direction is entity-centric query expansion. We find related entities of query, and perform query expansion using the names and relations of related entities. Significant improvements over several state-of-the-art feedback models could be observed on multiple data collections. Besides, we explore another direction: entity-centric relevance modeling. We propose a novel retrieval approach, i.e., Latent Entity Space (LES), which models the relevance by leveraging entity profiles to represent semantic content of documents and queries. Experimental results over several TREC collections show that LES is effective on capturing latent semantic content and can significantly improve the search accuracy of several state-of-the-art retrieval models for entity-bearing queries.This thesis presents a series of research efforts on entity centric information retrieval in several directions, and reveals promising potential of entities on improving the retrieval effectiveness. With the fast curation of high-quality knowledge base, more information about entities could be easily accessed and integrated into retrieval models. We hope our work could serve as guideline for future work on leveraging entities to improve information retrieval in more applications.},

abstract = {The use of topical information has long been studied in the context of information retrieval. For example, grouping search results into topical categories enables more effective information presentation to users, while grouping documents in a collection can lead to efficient information access. We define a topic as the main theme or subject contained in a (set of) document(s). While topics provide information about the subjects contained in a document, the structure of topics provides information such as the degree to which a set of documents is focused on certain topic (or set of topics), topical diversity among documents, and semantic relatedness of topics.The work of this thesis focuses on modeling the structure of topics present in a (set of) document(s), with the goal of effectively using it in information retrieval. In particular, we consider a number of IR tasks where the notion of relevance is beyond "aboutness" and topic structure plays an important role in satisfying users' information need. The following research themes are addressed, in three parts: (1) topic coherence, (2) diversity and the cluster hypothesis, and (3) relating topics present in different representations.With respect to the first research theme, we develop a coherence measure that effectively captures topical coherence of a set of documents. The proposed measure is applied to two IR tasks, namely, blog feed retrieval and query performance prediction.In the second part of the thesis, we explore the impact of topic structure on effectively presenting retrieval results, with a focus on the scenario of result diversification. We re-visit the cluster hypothesis with respect to ambiguous or multi-faceted queries and investigate the effectiveness of query-specific clustering in result diversification.Topics can be represented in different ways, e.g., using clusters, using definitions from a thesaurus, using statistics of term frequencies, etc. In the third part of the thesis, we study the problem of relating topics represented in different forms within the context of automatic link generation. We identify a set of significant terms from a source text, link those terms to their corresponding entries in a knowledge base in such a way that the source text is annotated with background information available in the knowledge base. We conduct a case study in automatically generating links from narrative radiology reports to Wikipedia. Such links are expected to help users understand the medical terminology and thereby increase the value of the reports. Here we evaluate state-of-the-art link generation systems and propose an approach that improves over state-of-the-art systems on radiology data.Available online at http://dare.uva.nl/record/377895.},

abstract = {Evaluation is the main driving force in research, development and applications related to information retrieval (IR). In the traditional IR evaluation paradigm a list of query topics along with their relevance judgments are given. The main limitation of this kind of evaluation paradigm is that it focuses almost exclusively on a small set of judged documents and does not consider what influence the given retrieval models have on accessing all the relevant information in the collection. This is particularly important for recall oriented retrieval applications where we want to ensure that that everything relevant has been found.In this thesis we analyze the effectiveness of retrieval models from the documents retrievability point of view. We focus particularly on the retrieval bias of different retrieval models, and try to examine to what extent this bias restricts the users in retrieving relevant information. We explore this research with the help of three factors. First, we analyze the relationship between different characteristics of queries and retrievability. This is important from the query generation point of view, since in case of exhaustive queries, it is practically infeasible to complete retrievability approximation in reasonable time. The strong correlation between retrievability and query characteristics allows us to approximate the retrievability score accurately with the help of a query subset without processing an exhaustive number of queries. After this, we examine to what extent the retrievability and other IR effectiveness measures are related to each other. This specifically helps us to understand to what extent it is possible to automatically rank the effectiveness of retrieval models on the basis of their retrieval bias. This also offers a basis for optimizing retrieval systems for specific collections without the need to provide manually annotated ground truth. This is particularly useful for those retrieval domains where it is difficult to obtain a sufficient amount of relevance judgments. At the end we investigate and devise different retrieval strategies for mitigating the effect of low retrievability of documents. These include collection partitioning and query expansion on the basis of improved pseudo relevance feedback selection.The work present in this thesis provides an a novel approach for the evaluation and optimization of retrieval models particularly for recall oriented retrieval domains, where the focus is on retrieving all relevant information but not just retrieving a subset of relevant information.

abstract = {With the explosive growth of information, it is becoming increasingly difficult to retrieve the relevant documents with statistical means only. This begets new challenges to IR community and motivates researchers to look for intelligent Information Retrieval (IR) systems that search and/or filter information automatically based on some higher level of understanding are required. This higher level of understanding can only be achieved through processing of text based on semantics, which is not possible by considering a document as a "bag of words". We make a humble effort in this direction by investigating techniques that attempt to utilize semantics to improve effectiveness in IR. The hypothesis is that with an improved representation of documents and by incorporating limited semantic knowledge, it is possible to improve the effectiveness of an IR system.We propose the use of Conceptual Graph (CG) formalism for representing text. The level of semantic details to be captured within conceptual graphs and the type of relations used to relate concepts depend on the nature of the application and the domain in which it is to be used. The objective of any IR system is to classify documents as relevant and non-relevant with respect to a standing query. A detailed and accurate semantic analysis is not required for this task. This fact distinguishes IR from other natural language processing related tasks such as machine translation, question answering, text summarization, etc. Further, the amount of text with which an IR system has to deal with is so huge that it becomes impractical to carry out such analysis. So we take a middle ground by investigating techniques that make use of limited semantic knowledge that can be easily exacted from the text in the CG representation. The techniques investigated in this thesis make use of CG-based model in conjunction with the statistical vector space model. The two models thus complement each other allowing us to take the benefits of the long and established research efforts in the statistical models and versatility of semantic models.The statistical model used in the experimental work is the most widely followed vector space model. We investigate performance of this model with different combinations of term weighting schemes for documents and queries, yielding seven different retrieval models, on the CACM-3204 collection. The best performing case, we achieved was with 'augmented normalized tem frequency' and 'raw term frequency with length normalization' components for document and query terms respectively, where inverse document frequency component is incorporated in both. The eleven-point average precision score (11-AvgP) score for the base model was 0.2961 (averaged over 64 queries).To get CG-based representation of a document, we build conceptual graph for each sentence in the document. A small subset of basic relations has been used for constructing conceptual graphs. These relations have been extracted based on syntactic patterns. A manually constructed partial concept type hierarchy has been used. This restricts us from performing large-scale experimentation automatically. As an alternative to this, we maintain a set of terms replaceable for each other and use some simple heuristics to capture structural variations. Queries undergo more detailed processing as compared to documents. The conceptual graphs obtained thus are stored in the form of triplets. The CG representation used is easily scalable and lends itself for fine-tuning easily according to the needs of many different NLP applications.This thesis argues that conceptual graphs can be used as a precision tool. A hybrid information retrieval model is proposed to back up this argument. This model is essentially a two-stage retrieval model that first uses vector space model to quickly downsize the document collection and then uses CG-based model to do the final ranking. A manually constructed partial concept type hierarchy has been used. The experimental investigations have been made on CACM-3204, a collection called CGDOC, which is a small document collection designed by us and on the top ten results retrieved from LYCOS search engine. A significant improvement over the baseline performance has been observed for a subset of CACM queries.Next, a query expansion technique based on relevance feedback has been presented. This technique attempts to reduce the 'query drift' through the use of conceptual graph based representation of document in the expansion process. Two relevance feedback strategies have been proposed and evaluated. Both the strategies resulted in a significant improvement over the baseline performance for a subset of CACM queries.The motivation for the next technique evaluated by us lies in our belief that relation matching can be used to improve retrieval effectiveness. The roots of this belief lie in the fact that the semantics of terms can only be understood in the context they are being used. Relation matching provides a means to capture this context. To investigate the effectiveness of our technique we propose a retrieval model that integrates relation and keyword matching. There can be no better way to capture the relationships than the use of conceptual graphs and hence the CG based model, with certain enhancements and modification, remains an integral part of this work. A set of replaceable terms instead of type hierarchy has been used. Some simple heuristics along with the transitivity of relations have been used to capture structural variations. For identifying relational similarity between the query and the document, we propose new CG similarity measures. These measures have been used in the retrieval process along with the usual term similarity measures. The results obtained have shown a significant improvement (7.37%) in retrieval performance.The results of this thesis demonstrate that by improving document/query representation and by incorporating more information from within the document and the query into the retrieval process, the effectiveness of the information retrieval is enhanced. The major findings can be summarizes as:• The use of conceptual graphs as a knowledge representation formalism offers many advantages in IR. The general model, presented in this thesis, for creating conceptual graph from natural language text can be easily extended to capture more semantics if domain specific information is available.• Two stage retrieval models can be quite effective in improving retrieval performance.• Relation matching can be integrated successfully with existing statistical retrieval model to improve retrieval effectiveness.• New CG similarity measures proposed in the thesis offer flexibility in defining textual units that make them useful for many different applications.• Simple heuristics can be used to capture structural variations.• Queries, instead of documents can be targeted for semantic interpretation.},

abstract = {Documentary makers, journalists, news editors, and other media professionals routinely require previously recorded audiovisual material for new productions. For example, a news editor might wish to reuse footage shot by overseas services for the evening news, or a documentary maker might require shots of Christmas trees recorded over the decades. Important sources for reusable broadcasts are audiovisual broadcast archives, which preserve and manage audiovisual material. With digitization, media professional can be given online access to video. This increases ease of access, but increases the need for search capabilities tailored for the media professional. Search in audiovisual broadcast archives, then, is the subject of this thesis.We begin by investigating the search behavior of media professionals in current daily practice. To this end we perform a large-scale log analysis of their search actions at a national audiovisual broadcast archive. Our analysis characterizes not only the searches of media professionals, but also their purchasing behavior. In order to model the observed behavior we follow our log analysis with a simulation experiment. Here we investigate simulation methods for recreating the searches and purchases recorded in the archive to create evaluation testbeds.In the second half of the thesis we turn to investigate the use of state-of-art methods for retrieval with automatically generated content metadata from video, Specifically we focus on their application for improving audiovisual fragment search in the audiovisual broadcast archive. We use logged searches and purchases to define new test collections for retrieval evaluation. These are used as the basis for experiments aimed at solving specific problems that are faced when searching with automatically generated descriptions of video content. Finally, we combine state-of-the-art methods with the current daily practice of the archive, and investigate their potential combined impact on search in audiovisual broadcast archives.The contributions of this thesis include the characterization of searching and purchasing behaviour of media professionals at a large audiovisual broadcast archive, and a framework for simulating their logged queries and purchases. Contributions in the second half of the thesis include an in-depth user study of how text queries should be mapped to visual concepts, a retrieval model that accounts for the temporal mismatch between the speech and visual tracks in audiovisual material, and a set of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of automatically generated content metadata for improving retrieval in the audiovisual broadcast archive.The thesis can be accessed at http://dare.uva.nl/record/358972.},

The nature of the available information and its role in our lives have changed significantly, but the methods and tools that are used to access and share that information in collaboration have remained largely unaltered. This dissertation is an attempt to develop a new framework for collaborative information seeking (CIS) with a focus on user-centric system designs. To develop this framework, existing practices for doing collaboration, along with motivations and methods, are studied. This initial investigation and a review of literature are followed by a series of carefully created design studies, helping us develop a prototype CIS system, Coagmento. This system is then used for a large-scale laboratory experiment with a focus on studying the role and the impact of awareness in CIS projects. Through this study, it is shown that appropriate support for group awareness can help collaborators be more productive, engaged, and aware in collaboration without burdening them with additional load. Using the lessons derived from the literature as well as the set of studies presented in this dissertation, a novel framework for CIS is proposed. Such a framework could help us develop, study, and evaluate CIS systems with a more comprehensive understanding of various CIS processes, and the users of these systems.Dissertation available online at: http://comminfo.rutgers.edu/~chirags/papers/Shah_Dissertation.pdf.},

abstract = {Social tagging systems enable users to collaboratively assign freely chosen keywords (i.e., tags) to resources (e.g., Web links). In order to support users in finding descriptive tags, tag recommendation algorithms have been proposed. One issue of current state-of-the-art tag recommendation algorithms is that they are often designed in a purely data-driven way and thus, lack a thorough understanding of the cognitive processes that play a role when people assign tags to resources. A prominent example is the activation equation of the cognitive architecture ACT-R, which formalizes activation processes in human memory to determine if a specific memory unit (e.g., a word or tag) will be needed in a specific context. It is the aim of this thesis to investigate if a cognitive-inspired approach, which models activation processes in human memory, can improve tag recommendations. For this, the relation between activation processes in human memory and usage practices of tags is studied, which reveals that (i) past usage frequency, (ii) recency, and (iii) semantic context cues are important factors when people reuse tags. Based on this, a cognitive-inspired tag recommendation approach termed BLLAC+MPr is developed based on the activation equation of ACT-R. An extensive evaluation using six real-world folksonomy datasets shows that BLLAC+MPr outperforms current state-of-the-art tag recommendation algorithms with respect to various evaluation metrics. Finally, BLLAC+MPr is utilized for hashtag recommendations in Twitter to demonstrate its generalizability in related areas of tag-based recommender systems. The findings of this thesis demonstrate that activation processes in human memory can be utilized to improve not only social tag recommendations but also hashtag recommendations. This opens up a number of possible research strands for future work, such as the design of cognitive-inspired resource recommender systems.},

abstract = {Current state of the art information retrieval models treat documents and queries as bags of words. There have been many attempts to go beyond this simple representation. Unfortunately, few have shown consistent improvements in retrieval effectiveness across a wide range of tasks and data sets. Here, we propose a new statistical model for information retrieval based on Markov random fields. The proposed model goes beyond the bag of words assumption by allowing dependencies between terms to be incorporated into the model. This allows for a variety of textual and non-textual features to be easily combined under the umbrella of a single model. Within this framework, we explore the theoretical issues involved, parameter estimation, feature selection, and query expansion. We give experimental results from a number of information retrieval tasks, such as ad hoc retrieval and web search.},

abstract = {The exponential growth of digital information available in Enterprises and on the Web creates the need for search tools that can respond to the most sophisticated informational needs. Retrieving relevant documents is not enough anymore and finding entities rather than textual resources provides great support to the user both on the Web and in Enterprises. Many user tasks would be simplified if Search Engines would support typed search, and return entities instead of just Web pages. For example, an executive who tries to solve a problem needs to find people in the company who are knowledgeable about a certain topic. Aggregation of information spread over different documents is a key aspect in this process.Finding experts is a problem mostly considered in the Enterprise setting where teams for new projects need to be built and problems need to be solved by the right persons. In the first part of the thesis, we propose a model for expert finding based on the well consolidated vector space model for Information Retrieval and investigate its effectiveness.We can define Entity Retrieval by generalizing the expert finding problem to any entity. In Entity Retrieval the goal is to rank entities according to their relevance to a query (e.g., "Countries where I can pay in Euro"); the set of entities to be ranked is assumed to be loosely defined by a generic category, given in the query itself (e.g., countries), or by some example entities (e.g., Italy, Germany, France). In the second part of the thesis, we investigate different methods based on Semantic Web and Natural Language Processing techniques for solving these tasks both in Wikipedia and, generally, on the Web. Evaluation is a critical aspect of Information Retrieval. We contributed to the field of Information Retrieval evaluation by organizing an evaluation initiative for Entity Retrieval.Opinions and other relevant information about entities can be provided by different sources in different contexts. News articles report about events where entities are involved. In such setting the temporal dimension is critical as news stories develop over time and new entities appear in the story and others are not relevant anymore. In the third part of this thesis, we study the problem of Entity Retrieval for news applications and the importance of the news trail history (i.e., past related articles) to determine the relevant entities in current articles. We also study opinion evolution about entities. In the last years, the blogosphere has become a vital part of the Web, covering a variety of different points of view and opinions on political and event-related topics such as immigration, election campaigns, or economic developments. We propose a method for automatically extracting public opinion about specific entities from the blogosphere.Available online at http://www.gianlucademartini.net/research/phd/.},

abstract = {Modern search engines employ a number of interactive features to assist users in exploring the document collection and expressing their information needs. Providing these features require knowledge about the document collection in the domain, i.e. a domain model. These models may be difficult to obtain and even if they are available, they may become out of date when the document collection changes or the users start to view the domain differently. In this thesis we propose to use implicit feedback left by users while they interact with search engines to build domain models that evolve over time. These models can adapt to changes in the domain as reflected in the search trend of the user population.We validate these models in two different IR tasks. The major application is query recommendation where previous studies focused on Web search in general or did not consider the temporal aspect of recommendations. Our models address these issues as they are targeted to specific domains such as enterprise search or digital libraries. We furthermore devise an automatic evaluation methodology that allows us to perform extensive evaluation of our adaptive models and observe their performance over time. Using query logs collected from two academic institutions, the evaluation framework assesses the impact of different factors on their performance.The second application of these models is query session retrieval. The query session retrieval problem extends the traditional ad-hoc retrieval by taking into account the previous user interactions with the retrieval system within the same session when answering the query. In this context rather than explicitly providing the user with relevant queries to their information needs, our adaptive models implicitly derive query expansions relevant to the user information needs as identified in the sessions by mapping the session to similar sessions inferred from the models.},

abstract = {Personalization of information retrieval tailors search towards individual users to meet their particular information needs by taking into account information about users and their contexts, often through implicit sources of evidence such as user behaviors and contextual factors. The current study looks particularly at users' dwelling behavior, measured by the time that they spend on documents; and several contextual factors: the stage of users' work tasks, task type, users' knowledge of task topics, to explore whether or not taking account of task stage, task type, and topic knowledge could help predict document usefulness from the time that users spend on the documents. This study also investigates whether or not expanding queries with important terms extracted from task products and useful pages improves search performance. To these ends, a controlled lab experiment was conducted with 24 student participants, each coming three times in a two-week period to work on three subtasks in a general work task. Data were collected by logging software that recorded user-system interaction and questionnaires that elicited users' background information and perceptions on a number of aspects. Observations in the study and examinations of the data found that the time users spent on documents could have three different types: total display time, total dwell time, and decision time, which had different roles in working as a reliable indicator of document usefulness. Task stage was found to help interpret certain types of time as reliable indicators of document usefulness in certain task types, so was topic knowledge, and the latter played a more significant role when both were available. This study contributes to a better understanding of how information seeking behaviors, specifically, time that users spend on documents, can be used as implicit evidence of document usefulness, as well as how contextual factors of task stage, topic knowledge, and task type can help interpret time as an indicator of usefulness. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for using behaviors and contextual factors in the development of personalization systems. Future studies are suggested on making use of these findings as well as research on related issues.},

abstract = {This dissertation research, PanAnthropon FilmWorld, aims to demonstrate direct retrieval of entities and related facts by exploiting Wikipedia as a semantic knowledge source, with the film domain as its proof-of-concept domain of application. To this end, a semantic knowledge base concerning the film domain has been constructed with the data extracted/derived from 10,640 Wikipedia pages on films and additional pages on film awards. The knowledge base currently contains 209,266 entities and 2,345,931 entity-centric facts. Both the knowledge base and the corresponding semantic search interface are based on the coherent classification of entities. Entity-centric facts are also consistently represented as <entity, attribute, value, note> tuples. The semantic search interface (http://dlib.ischool.drexel.edu:8080/sofia/PA/) supports multiple types of semantic search functions, which go beyond the traditional keyword-based search function, including the main General Entity Retrieval Query (GERQ) function, which is concerned with retrieving all entities that match the specified entity type, subtype, and semantic conditions and thus corresponds to the main research problem. Two types of evaluation have been performed in order to evaluate (1) the quality of information extraction and (2) the effectiveness of information retrieval using the semantic interface. The first type of evaluation has been performed by inspecting 11,495 film-centric facts concerning 100 films. The results have confirmed high data quality with 99.96% average precision and 99.84% average recall. The second type of evaluation has been performed by conducting an experiment with human subjects. The experiment involved having the subjects perform a retrieval task by using both the PanAnthropon interface and the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) interface and comparing their task performance between the two interfaces. The results have confirmed higher effectiveness of the PanAnthropon interface vs. the IMDb interface (83.11% vs. 40.78% average precision; 83.55% vs. 40.26% average recall). Moreover, the subjects' responses to the post-task questionnaire indicate that the subjects found the PanAnthropon interface to be highly usable and easily understandable as well as highly effective. The main contribution from this research therefore consists in achieving the set research goal, namely, demonstrating the utility and feasibility of semantics-based direct entity retrieval.},

The Data Base Management System (DBMS) is responsible for retrieval of the data that satisfy these conditions.2. Navigation or browsing can be used to investigate the content of the database by following links between related data.We will start with a discussion of these paradigms in the first two sections. We will then explore how both approaches can be combined. Finally, a practical implementation of the advocated approach will be presented. The implemented prototype supports access to a database on multimedia material. A more elaborated discussion of our ideas and results in this area can be found in [16].},

There are many technical and non-technical problems to be solved, however, before widespread reuse of software lifecycle objects becomes a reality. One class of problem concerns the classification, storage, and retrieval of reusable components. Panel members will discuss these problems and some approaches to solving them.},

abstract = {In multimedia database applications, a major class of users' requests require retrieving those images in the database that are spatially similar to the query image. To process such queries, a spatial similarity algorithm is required. A spatial similarity algorithm assesses the degree to which the spatial relationships among the domain objects in a database image conform to those specified in the query image. The recent ubiquitous interest in multimedia information systems has spurred a great interest in spatial similarity algorithms. A standard testbed of images is required not only to systematically evaluate these algorithms but also to compare and contrast them. However, there is no such testbed of images available for this purpose.In this paper, we describe a collection of images, referred to as TESSA, as a testbed for investigating the robustness of spatial similarity algorithms and their further use in evaluating the retrieval effectiveness of these algorithms. The TESSA collection comprises 160 images and are produced by generating 15 variants of each of the 10 original images. Image variants are produced by scale, rotation, and translation, and by an arbitrary composition of these three transformations. The variants are designed to inquire into the robustness of spatial similarity algorithms. To facilitate their further use in evaluating the retrieval effectiveness, each image in TESSA is considered as a query in turn, and an expert is asked to provide a rank ordering of the TESSA images with respect to the query image vis-a-vis expert provided rank ordering. System provided rank ordering for a query image is the rank ordering of TESSA images induced by a spatial similarity algorithm with respect to the query. Retrieval effectiveness of spatial similarity algorithms is then characterized by using Rnorm measure. This measure is based on both the expert and system provided rank orderings.},

abstract = {This informal note was prompted by discussions and questions at the 1990 AAAI Spring Symposium on Text-Based Intelligent Systems (cf Jacobs 1990). There is a growing interest in access to, and the use of, large scale full-text databases for a variety of purposes, and in the application of classification methods to organise the mass of data involved (see e.g. Church and Hanks 1990). A good deal of work has been done in this field in the past, but it is little known, and some of the early research literature is not very accessible. Classification is an area in which it is easy to make plausible but mistaken assumptions, and as this certainly holds for classification in retrieval, there is a good deal that can be usefully learnt from past experience, most of which was hard won from careful thought and grinding experiment. This paper is intended as an introduction to this initial work on automatic classification, to help those now becoming interested in classification to avoid unnecessarily repeating heavy effort or, more especially, reinventing square wheels. It should also be noted that automatic classification and related (e.g. seriation) methods have been extensively developed for biological applications in particular, but have been more variously applied, and that much of this work may be relevant in the broad area of machine learning.It must be emphasised that as this paper is focussed on early work on automatic classification, particularly for information retrieval, and is designed primarily to lead into this research and its literature, it does not attempt a critical evaluation of the overall results established by now, or of the current state of the art. However it should be pointed out that in the retrieval context in general, as opposed to the wider one of classification as a whole, there has been comparatively little work since the seventies, largely for the reasons indicated in the paper. More recent work in any case refers heavily to earlier research, so this note can be taken as an entry point to the research of the last decade for which some references are given at the end of the note.},

This represents almost 285 million user sessions, each an attempt to fill a single information need. We present an analysis of individual queries, query duplication, and query sessions. We also present results of a correlation analysis of the log entries, studying the interaction of terms within queries. Our data supports the conjecture that web users differ significantly from the user assumed in the standard information retrieval literature. Specifically, we show that web users type in short queries, mostly look at the first 10 results only, and seldom modify the query. This suggests that traditional information retrieval techniques may not work well for answering web search requests. The correlation analysis showed that the most highly correlated items are constituents of phrases. This result indicates it may be useful for search engines to consider search terms as parts of phrases even if the user did not explicitly specify them as such.},

abstract = {An important step in building up the document database of a full-text retrieval system is to classify each document under one or more classes according to the topical domains that the document discusses. This is commonly referred to as classification. Automatic classification attempts to replace human classifiers by using computers to automate this process. Automatic classification has two major components: (1) the classification scheme which defines the available classes under which a document can be classified and their inter-relationships; and (2) the classification algorithm which defines the rules and procedures for assigning one or more classes defined in the classification scheme to a document.In this paper, we present an automatic classification approach called ACTION. The design goal of ACTION is to achieve the appropriate balance between specificity and exhaustivity, which are important metrics for assessing an automatic classification approach. The key idea of ACTION is a scheme for measuring the significance of each keyword in a given document. The scheme not only takes into account the occurrence frequency of a keyword, but also the logical relationships between the available classes.},

abstract = {Conventional information retrieval systems use Boolean query formulations and inverted file technologies for search and retrieval purposes. The need to construct complex Boolean queries in order to obtain the benefit of the existing retrieval operations constitutes a substantial burden for the users. In most environments trained search intermediaries are used to facilitate the communication between system and user.In this note a new Boolean retrieval environment is outlined in which the queries are automatically constructed from the original natural language query formulations provided by the users. Any available <u>Boolean</u> query formulations can also be improved automatically by using the natural language text of previously retrieved documents identified as relevant during previous searches. The automatic queries can be formulated in a standard Boolean system, or in an extended system in which the interpretation of the Boolean operators <u>and</u> and <u>or</u> is relaxed. In either case. the automatic Boolean manipulations produce better retrieval output than conventional retrieval operations based on manually prepared query statements.},

Results indicate that the vector space model is comparable to RUBRIC for relevant documents, while RUBRIC performs better at retrieving marginally relevant documents.},

These goals are realized with a simple hardware arrangement called INDY, which uses inexpensive memory technologies (such as charge coupled devices, magnetic bubbles, or discs). This paper first discusses the data definition and editing requirements of data languages. Then the implementation of these requirements on the INDY backend kernel is described.

These goals are accomplished with a simple hardware arrangement within a one-dimensional cellular storage system called INDY. The INDY backend kernel is intended as a powerful tool for implementing all data models. The INDY cellular storage array is intended to provide functionality that is difficult to implement efficiently using a conventional hardware arrangement. It allows a simple implementation of improved data independence at high speeds. INDY simultaneously satisfies the time windows of future hardware technologies and user requirements.The importance of strings as a mechanism for defining abstract data types for data base languages is discussed in more detail in another paper. In that paper, a language called STRING is introduced which allows names of data objects to be semantically defined as variable-length strings and compared based on string pattern membership. This paper is concerned with the implementation of string storage and searching required by the STRING language. Implementation of higher level structures and searching requirements (such as sets, rows, tables and hierarchies) on the INDY kernel is treated elsewhere.},

It is shown that a greater degree of concurrent activity will result in better overall performance. An operating system executive to support this high level of concurrency is proposed and modelled using simulation techniques.

The objects in a view are described in terms of so called index expressions which are a powerful object characterization mechanism. These characterizations are manipulated by a calculus, which allows quantification of notions such as cohesion and relevance. These latter are useful criteria for judging the quality of a view.},

abstract = {In this article, a general mathematical framework for information retrieval models is presented, giving more insight into the evaluation mechanisms that may be used in IR. In this framework a number of requirements for operators improving recall and precision are investigated. It is shown that these requirements can be satisfied by using descriptor weights and one combination operator only. Moreover, information items and queries - virtual items - can be treated in exactly the same way, reflecting the fact, that they both are descriptions of a number of concepts. Evaluation is performed by formulating similarity homomorphisms from query descriptions to retrieval status values that allow ranking items accordingly. For good comparisons, however, ranking must be done by the achieved proportion of perfect similarity rather than by similary itself. In term independence models, this normalization process may satisfy the homomorphism requirement of algebra under certain conditions, but it contradicts the requirement in the term dependence case. Nevertheless, by demanding separability for the unnormalized part of the evaluation measure, it can be guaranteed that the query is evaluated to each item descriptor by descriptor, and the normalization value must be calculated only once for the whole query, using the query as a whole. Also, for each real item, the normalization value must have been calculated only once, using the item as a whole.},

abstract = {There are significant advantages to tailoring hardware storage devices to support high level data models in very large data bases. A storage device that can assume some of the data selection functions traditionally performed by the CPU can substantially reduce the amount of data to be transferred to the CPU. This reduction together with increased concurrency of CPU and device operation result in increased data rates and lower response times. By designing the device to support one specific data model, greater efficiency can be achieved than in devices designed to be a compromise in their support of several different models. The number and complexity of the functions performed by the device can be drastically reduced, along with its development and production costs. In this paper we describe the design and usage of an associative array memory using a rotating storage device which is tailored to support the relational model of E.F. Codd.},

Hogben (1) describes the evolution of the language of several sciences. Of particular interest is his description of the evolution of the language of chemistry. The clarity of thinking in chemistry, and the progress in the field took a sharp upturn after Lavoisier introduced revolutionary changes in the system of chemical nomenclature. Before Lavoisier, substances were generally known by names that might be called recipes or histories; somebody's notion or recollection of how they first encountered the substance. Methane was known as marsh gas, because it was first found bubbling up through the mud of marshes, as a result of the decay of organic materials under the mud. Hydrochloric acid was known as muriatic acid, from muria, the Latin name for brine, a common source of hydrochloric acid. Muria, in turn, comes from mare, Latin for sea. Chlorine was known to sixteenth century chemists and alchemists as dephlogisticated muriatic acid. The original process by which chlorine was manufactured, and still a common process, is by oxidation of the hydrogen in hydrochloric acid. Since oxidation was not yet understood at that time, it was called dephlogistication -- removal of the phlogiston. Lavoisier's new nomenclature describes substances not by their surmised origin, but by their present content, structure and condition.},

It is intended to provide the reader with an understanding of the inherent limitations of existing vocabulary collection methods and the need for greater attention to multi-word phrases as the building blocks of text. Additionally, while traditional reference books define many proper nouns, they appear to be very limited in their coverage of the new proper nouns appearing daily in newspapers. Proper nouns appear to require a grammar and lexicon of components much the way general parsing of text requires syntactic rules and a lexicon of common nouns.},

Until recently there has been more interest for the technology of storing and retrieving data in mass memory than for the problem of accessing data in main memory. Semiconductor technology improvements have lowered main memory cost and increased speed, therefore opening new application areas (e.g. image and speech understanding, graphics) to low cost systems. Some of the tasks in these areas are data intensive and require complex data structures. In these cases, most of the computing power is used to access data rather than to perform operations on them. The performance of such applications can be improved if the memories are tailored to the data structures they contain and to the access operations that can be performed on those data structures.

It is also perhaps the first database machine to have a built-in security mechanism for access control.At the outset, the security mechanism was made an integral part of the DBC design. This design philosophy not only allowed us to construct a system that has no “backdoors”, but also ensured that all access requests are, in fact, controlled by DBC's security mechanism. The DBC security mechanism is based on the concept of security atoms, aggregates of data units being definable by the user in terms of conjunctions of query predicates. The fundamental gain in utilizing query conjunctions for the purpose of access control is that any data that is accessible or updateable is also protectable.It is believed that the DBC security mechanism is less cumbersome than the view mechanism of some database systems and more efficient than the query modification mechanism used by some other systems. This is demonstrated at three levels of access control, namely the subfile, record and field (attribute) levels.},

The DBC security mechanism is based on the concept of security atoms, aggregates of data units being definable by the user in terms of conjunctions of query predicates. The fundamental gain in utilizing query conjunctions for the purpose of access control is that any data that is accessible or updateable is also protectable.It is believed that the DBC security mechanism is less cumbersome than the view mechanism of some database systems and more efficient than the query modification mechanism used by some other systems. This is demonstrated at three levels of access control, namely the subfile, record and field (attribute) levels.},

In addition, although neither used Web data, both the Cross-Lingual track and the Question &amp; Answer track studied issues of considerable importance to everyday Web search.In TREC-9, the main Web track task will use a larger set of Web documents than last year and will use search topics derived from search engine logs. This task will be the closest approximation in TREC-9 to the traditional TREC Ad Hoc retrieval task.},

abstract = {Text retrieval systems have historically been refined through experimentation on test collections. In 1990 NIST was asked to build a very large test collection for use in evaluation of text retrieval technology in the DARPA TIPSTER project. This collection was to be on the order of 1 million full-text documents: a magnitude about 100 times larger than any existing non-proprietary test collection. The following year NIST proposed that this collection be made available to the full research community by the formation of the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC). The first conference took place in September, 1992 with 25 participating groups including most of the leading text retrieval research groups. Although scaling their research algorithms to handle this near-operational amount of text (for 1992) was a Herculean task, groups joined TREC to get the test data and to take part in the first major cross-system search engine evaluation. Participation in TREC has since increased each year. The most recent TREC (TREC-8 held in November, 1999) had 66 participating groups representing 16 different countries.This paper serves as a general introduction to TREC. Detailed information about TREC including the complete Proceedings for each workshop, instructions for obtaining test collections, and the Call for Participation for TREC-9 can be found on the TREC web site at http://trec.nist.gov. Task descriptions for some of the tasks to be done in TREC-9 follow in this issue. To participate in TREC-9, follow the instructions given in the Call for Participation.},

abstract = {A stop list, or negative dictionary is a device used in automatic indexing to filter out words that would make poor index terms. Traditionally stop lists are supposed to have included only the most frequently occurring words. In practice, however, stop lists have tended to include infrequently occurring words, and have not included many frequently occurring words. Infrequently occurring words seem to have been included because stop list compilers have not, for whatever reason, consulted empirical studies of word frequencies. Frequently occurring words seem to have been left out for the same reason, and also because many of them might still be important as index terms.This paper reports an exercise in generating a stop list for general text based on the Brown corpus of 1,014,000 words drawn from a broad range of literature in English. We start with a list of tokens occurring more than 300 times in the Brown corpus. From this list of 278 words, 32 are culled on the grounds that they are too important as potential index terms. Twenty-six words are then added to the list in the belief that they may occur very frequently in certain kinds of literature. Finally, 149 words are added to the list because the finite state machine based filter in which this list is intended to be used is able to filter them at almost no cost. The final product is a list of 421 stop words that should be maximally efficient and effective in filtering the most frequently occurring and semantically neutral words in general literature in English.},

Complex information systems are defined as those "functioning within a multipurpose, multiuser environment - whether they are relatively simple data banks, more involved accounting or banking/credit systems, documentation systems, or middle or higher level management decision systems." Though the definition includes "management decision systems," the book focuses upon information storage and retrieval systems. Four of the five case studies presented are on the computerization of documentation systems. No mention has been made of simulation, modelling, optimization packages, etc., which are essential components of any information support system for managerial decision making, nor is the general problem of management information system design covered.},

The common example carried through these chapters was a well chosen and effective vehicle for showing the commonalities, differences, strengths, and weaknesses of the approaches. The fundamentals of file organization and data base concepts (chapters 2 and 3), built upon some of the author's previously published work, preceed a short economic and architectual tabulation of marketed systems (chapter 4).

Wessel offers theoretical and practical grounds for choosing a methodology centered on people supported by computers rather than a fully automated approach. In particular he advocates development and use of well structured thesauri stored in computers to assist in both indexing and search of documents.},

abstract = {The data base organization and information retrieval techniques described in this paper are used by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation's Large Turbine Division at Lester, Pa. to store and retrieve engineering and descriptive information pertaining to the entire life of a steam turbine from the original design of the unit through the latest overhaul.The large volume of data generated during the design, manufacture and subsequent operation of a steam turbine requires the use of a computer for effective data management. Manual record keeping has become increasingly inadequate to cope with the task of relating this ever growing data to sound management and engineering decisions.An operational computer oriented data bank system has been installed to fulfill the following data storage and retrieval needs:1. Quicker and more comprehensive retrieval of failure data to assist in service work.2. Organized and efficient feedback of failure information to the Engineering Department.3. An integrated data reference source for turbine history.4. Greater insight into reliability problems to provide statistics for design guidance and manpower allocation.5. Greater insight into proper turbine operating techniques and maintenance schedules.The system is built upon a master "Generic Profile" data base; all other files and reports are derived from it. Indexed sequential data sets are used throughout providing complete random access to any information in the data base. A substantial number of types of retrieval are available, and within each type the user is able to request any combination of data he may require. In some instances, retrieval requests of the same type are processed simultaneously, thereby reducing file access and overall execution time.Topics covered in the paper include:Data Base content.Data base organization and access methods.Types of retrieval available.Retrieval techniques.The system employs an IBM 360 Model 50 computer operating under MVT and OS. The largest program requires approximately 150 K of core storage for execution. All programs are written in ANS Cobol.},

abstract = {LISP is the second oldest computer-programming language still in active use. Our implementation is based on a powerful microprogrammed processor designed specifically for LISP. This processor supports a tagged macro-architecture; it manipulates items which have a built-in data-type field.The system supports several important new storage-management features, including a real-time garbage collector with hardware assist (using the basic algorithm of Baker).The software itself is written in LISP to a much larger extent than in previous systems. In fact, there are only two levels in which code is written: LISP and microcode.

abstract = {LISP is the second oldest computer-programming language still in active use. Our implementation is based on a powerful microprogrammed processor designed specifically for LISP. This processor supports a tagged macro-architecture; it manipulates items which have a built-in data-type field.The system supports several important new storage-management features, including a real-time garbage collector with hardware assist (using the basic algorithm of Baker).The software itself is written in LISP to a much larger extent than in previous systems. In fact, there are only two levels in which code is written: LISP and microcode. Among other things this improves the consistancy of system interfaces.The system design incorporates the personal computer philosophy.

abstract = {Many authors (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7) have suggested that overall performance of a document retrieval system is improved by relevance feedback. Relevance feedback denotes the last three steps in the following process: 1) the searcher enters a query, 2) the system prepares a ranked list of suggested documents, 3) the searcher judges some of the documents for relevancy, 4) the searcher informs the system of these documents judged and of the judgement, 5) the system constructs a new query based on the descriptors used in the original query and the descriptors used in the documents judged, 6) the system prepares a second ranked list of suggested documents.The presumption is that the second list is better than the first. By all performance measures (e.g. “fluid ranking” and “frozen ranking”), the second list is better than the first. However, if one reranks documents in the original list so as to reflect the searcher's efforts (step 3), the corresponding performance measures are comparable to those for the second list. The marginal difference between the performance measures for the ”reranked original” list (searcher's efforts alone) and the second list (which includes computer efforts) makes it unclear if the cost of steps 4 through 6 above can be justified. It is hoped that advocates of relevance feedback will present “reranked original” performance measures as a basis for any performance improvement claims.This paper also presents three reasonable, easily understood retrieval procedures for which the frozen ranking, the fluid ranking, and the reranked original evaluations are “obviously” the pertinent way to evaluate. Relevance feedback techniques as implemented in Salton's SMART DRS appear to show that it is worthwhile for user's to read abstracts prior to evaluation of full texts. The last indication presented in this paper is that the relevance feedback performance improvements noted using SMART are due mostly to the user making assessments; subsequent computer efforts appear to be most likely to result in no further change. For a query for which there is a subsequent change, the change is as likely to be harmful as helpful.},

abstract = {InQuisiX is an interactive system supporting the development and use of an electronic catalog. Features are provided for organizing the catalog, classifying and describing items, and searching and browsing catalog descriptions. Items described in the catalog are stored elsewhere and are accessed for display or retrieval through end-user tools integrated with InQuisiX. InQuisiX provides public interfaces for loading data, exchanging catalog data with other tools, invoking end-user tools, and making searchable any information stored outside the catalog, such as documents or graphics.Although InQuisiX is being marketed for use in cataloguing reusable software assets, there is nothing inherent in the design or functionality which restricts its use to this domain. Certain features, particularly the ability to invoke and work cooperatively with other automated tools in the development environment, are particularly useful to software developers. Hexible classification and description features are also important for the emerging software reuse market because best practices in classifying and describing software are still a research topic.InQuisiX runs on UNIX/X Window based environments and is currently hosted on both Sun SPARCstations and IBM RISC 6000 workstations. The system has been developed entirely in Classic-Ada, an object-oriented preprocessor for Ada, and uses a custom, automatically generated persistent object base for storing all information, including both the organization and the contents of the catalog, inverted indexes used to support searching, saved queries, and interfaces to end-user tools. The object base is implemented as a single binary file.},

With the growing complexity of information, and with the advent of distributed systems, it has become necessary to process any retrieval request coming from any system which is a part of the distributed environment. This calls for a generic retrieval system supporting interoperability which can formulate the request on the fly. Interoperability is the ability to interconnect software products irrespective of their suppliers and vintages, to provide access to corporate data by any authorized user, and to maintain that interconnection and access over changes in suppliers and vintages. This paper describes such a system which is generic in nature, and at the same time provides a mechanism which supports the mapping of the logical view to physical database implementation supporting interoperability.},

abstract = {Recently we have been investigating various methods for improving the retrieval of documents. One frequently used context for such studies is to work with a known database and set of queries, where sufficient work has previously been done to establish an "official" set of relevant documents for each query. Working within such a context, we have discovered at least one instance wherein the combination of the document descriptions in the database, the query, and the set of documents deemed relevant foredooms our attempts at retrieval improvement to failure. This note is to caution other researchers against such possibilities, and to recommend that the database in question, that of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), as represented on Virginia Disk 1, be retired from use.},

abstract = {Information retrieval can be defined as the extraction of specific information out of a great number of stored information items. Information retrieval systems, used for the retrieval of documents, try to answer more or less precise questions about interesting topics with a number of suitable documents or references to documents. Such systems should contain 'knowledge' about the meaning of questions, about the content of the stored information and the particular user's needs for information.Knowledge-bases systems claim to be able to store knowledge an draw conclusions from it. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the use of knowledge-based methods and technologies for information retrieval. A knowledge-based information retrieval system should represent its Information Structures, as well as knowledge in a common knowledge representation formalism. The retrieval process of the system should employ the inferential methods of the used knowledge representation formalism.A subset of first order logic is chosen for this thesis to represent knowledge. Specially designed retrieval rules represent knowledge for the purpose of retrieval. Retrieval rules capture knowledge about the user's vocabulary, his working domain and his way to perform the retrieval of documents. The problem of recall and precision of the answers of an information retrieval system is approached by an explicit representation of control knowledge.A theoretical model of a knowledge-based information retrieval system developed in this thesis specifies the requirements and properties, of such a system. In particular a novel term-similarity function could be defined. Properties like completeness and termination could be derived and boundaries for the amount of overhead of false control strategies could be investigated.The proposed model is implemented in a prototype of a knowledge-based information retrieval system, called KIR. KIR is a single-user system for personal document- and knowledge retrieval running on computer workstations. It is implemented using Prolog and Modula-2.},

abstract = {In the past, several mathematical models for document retrieval systems have been developed [C82, S83, S83a, T76, WO84]. These models are used to formally represent the basic characteristics, functional components, and the retrieval processes of document retrieval systems. Two basic categories of models that have been employed in information retrieval are the vector processing models and the Boolean retrieval models.In the conventional vector space model (VSM), proposed by Salton [S71, S83] index terms are basic vectors in a vector space. Each document or query is represented as a linear combination of these basic term vectors. The retrieval operation consists of computing the cosine similarity function between a given query vector and the set of document vectors and then ranking documents accordingly. In this approach, the interpretation that the occurrence frequency of a term in a document represents the component of the document vector along the corresponding basic term vectors is made.The advantages of this model are that it is simple and yet powerful. The vector operations can be performed efficiently enough to handle very large collections. Furthermore, it has been shown that the retrieval effectiveness is significantly higher compared to that of the Boolean retrieval models. However, this vector model has been incorporated into very few commercial systems.In the strict Boolean retrieval systems [BU81, P84] the user query normally consists of index terms that are connected by Boolean operators AND, OR and NOT. The advantage of using Boolean connectives is to provide a better structure to formulate the user query. The major problem in such a system is that there is no provision for associating weights of importance to the terms which are assigned either to the documents or to the queries. In other words, the representation is binary, indicating either the presence or the absence of the various index terms. The output obtained in response to a query is not ranked in any order of presumed importance to the user. In most cases, the AND connectives tend to be too restrictive [BU81]. Mose commercially available retrieval systems essentially conform to this model.One of the challenges for researchers in information retrieval has been to achieve greater acceptance of the vector processing models in commercial systems. The main difficulty in this connection is due to the inability of the vector processing systems to handle Boolean queries. In recent years some progress has been made in expressing Boolean queries as vectors [S83a, S83b]. If attractive ways to achieve this are advanced, it would then be possible to modify existing systems to use vector processing techniques without a great deal of cost and effort.Another problem in the conventional vector space model is that it assumes that term vectors are orthogonal. It is generally agreed that terms are correlated and it is necessary to generalize the model to incorporate term correlations. A vector processing model termed the GVSM [WO84a, WO85] was proposed in response to this need. In the GVSM, the queries are assumed to be presented as a list of terms and corresponding weights. Thus, no provision is made for processing Boolean queries. However, the premises of the model naturally lead to a scheme for handling Boolean queries. In this paper we present the details of this scheme. This result will help achieve the aim of integrating vector processing capabilities into existing systems which use Boolean retrieval models.},

Studies of cluster membership and of the effectiveness of cluster searches support previous findings that suggest that the single linkage classifications are rather different from those produced by the other three methods. These latter methods all produce large numbers of small clusters containing just pairs of documents. This finding motivates the work reported in the second part of the paper, which considers the use of clusters consisting of a document together with that document with which it is most similar. A comparison of the use of such clusters with conventional best match searches using seven documents test collections suggest that the two types of search are of comparable effectiveness, but they retrieve noticeably different sets of relevant documents.},

The reduction of the interfunctional overhead activity, which is the main contributor to poor system performance, results in a corresponding increase in system performance. In addition it is shown that in a functionally distributed system organization there exists a sequential job-shop or pipeline like flow of information (data and supervisory overhead) within the computer system which is essentially application independent. It is this type of flow that introduces a basic structure into the system which is practically non-existent in a centralized system architecture.In summary, the functionally distributed computer architecture proposed in this paper is based on a structured flow of blocks of information with a minimum of supervisory overhead through functionally independent but sequentially cooperating nodes. It is shown that this type of organization produces optimal system performance, i.e., response time, throughput and system availability.},

Threats to the encipherment of B-trees, especially relating to updating, are examined, and counter-measures proposed for each. In addition, the effect of encipherment on file access and update, on paging mechanisms, and on files related to the enciphered index are discussed. Many of the concepts presented here may be readily transferred to other forms of multiway index trees and to binary search trees.},

abstract = {In this informal paper, we present what we believe is one of the major problems in computer science of the 70's and several approaches to the solution of this problem that are being studied by our group and by others. (A formal paper that includes a detailed bibliography on this topic is in preparation. Therefore, we are writing this paper in an informal style without references). A very large part of the computational load throughout the world is essentially business computation. Perhaps it is the majority of computation. Business computation is heavily oriented to data base management and information retrieval. We will refer to this type of computation as non-numeric processing. The main primitive operation here is the search. However, we are using standard von Neumann computers whose main primitive operation is addition. What is good for numeric problems like inverting large matrices is not necessarily good for non-numeric problems like searching large data bases. The hardware limitations of conventional von Neumann computers tend to straightjacket our approach to non-numeric processing.},

abstract = {Ranked queries are used to locate relevant documents in text databases. In a ranked query a list of terms is specified, then the documents that most closely match the query are returned---in decreasing order of similarity---as answers. Crucial to the efficacy of ranked querying is the use of a similarity heuristic, a mechanism that assigns a numeric score indicating how closely a document and the query match. In this note we explore and categorise a range of similarity heuristics described in the literature. We have implemented all of these measures in a structured way, and have carried out retrieval experiments with a substantial subset of these measures.Our purpose with this work is threefold: first, in enumerating the various measures in an orthogonal framework we make it straightforward for other researchers to describe and discuss similarity measures; second, by experimenting with a wide range of the measures, we hope to observe which features yield good retrieval behaviour in a variety of retrieval environments; and third, by describing our results so far, to gather feedback on the issues we have uncovered. We demonstrate that it is surprisingly difficult to identify which techniques work best, and comment on the experimental methodology required to support any claims as to the superiority of one method over another.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an automatic selection method for key search algorithms. The methodology has been implemented in a system called KEALASE (KEy-search Algorithm SElection). Key search algorithms are selected according to the user's requirements through interaction with KEALSE which bases its inferences on an evaluation table. The evaluation table contains values rating the performance of each key search algorithm for the different searching properties. The proposed selection algorithm is based on a step by step reduction of key search algorithms and searching properties. The paper also proposes assistance facilities that consist of both a support function and a program synthesis function. Experimental results show that the appropriate key search algorithms are effectively selected, and that the necessary number of questions asked, to select the appropriate algorithm, is reduced to less than half of the total number of possible questions. The support function is useful for the user during the selection process, and the program synthesis function fully translates a selected key search algorithm into high level language in an average of less than 1 hour.},

A specific database machine, known as the DBC, is intended to support several existing data models. Although the DBC supports many data models, we single out the relational data model for this discussion. In particular, we have tried to concentrate mainly on the subject of database representation and query translation of System R-like database management systems. Some estimates of the storage requirements and performance gains are given in this paper. However, due to limited space, the detailed analysis is shown elsewhere in [22].},

abstract = {In the past few years there has been increased emphasis in the use of new and different hardware in the data base management field. This has given rise to an interesting area of research called data base machines. The objectives are to implement many of the traditional software data base management functions in hardware in order to increase performance and capability.The reasons for increased research activity in data base machines are many fold. The modern digital computer with all its power still executes only a single instruction at a time al beit with a few exceptions. Since the digital computer was primarily designed for numeric applications, the ratio of useful instructions to overhead instructions tends to be very low in non-numeric applications such as data base management. There is an increasing body of knowledge that indicates that parallelism and addressing by content can be used to advantage in such data base management functions as retrieval and update. The above reasons coupled with the fact that software and personnel costs continued to rise while hardware costs continue to decrease makes it imperative that researchers find new solutions to the data base management problem that take maximum advantage of hardware architecture and technology.In this paper a brief review of current efforts in data base machines is presented. A review of the more important functions performed in data base management is given first. This is followed by a brief discussion of mini computer implementations. Then a review of some of the current efforts in data base machines is given. Finally, a few thoughts are presented on future trends.},

abstract = {The context-addressed SIMD architecture is being examined as a means to provide suitable processing capabilities for non-numeric applications. This paper considers techniques which are being applied to realize this architecture in a segment sequential fashion.A fixed head disc provides a large amount of sequential storage already segmented into tracks. Economical bit-serial microprocessors are employed one per track to process the instructions and data sequentially as the disc rotates. A microprocessor and its track are here called a cell. A chain of cells can search a file consisting of fixed length words organized into variable length records in one revolution or cycle of the disc. Intercell communication in the chain as a pipeline allows files and records which overlap segment boundaries to be processed as an intact file or record, with all segments processed in parallel. Transfers of words and bits in pipeline fashion between cells allows the file to change size dynamically without regard for its cellular segmentation, as words may be either inserted or deleted within a record.Instruction execution in this architecture is also pipelined. The next instruction is preprocessed in one cycle along with its operand while the current instruction is executing, and the previous one is finishing up its operation or post-processing. This instruction pipelining is performed in order to minimize the execution time for a sequential instruction by overlapping the instruction fetch and execute of two consecutive cycles. The segment sequential organization also demands that the instruction execution continue into the next cycle in order to process the elements of a record that may overlap segments. Again by overlapping this instruction clean-up with the next instruction's execution, we may minimize the instruction execution time.A hardware realization of this pipeline of cells which pipelines its instruction execution becomes another pipeline. Each bit serial microprocessor is in fact a pipeline of modules each performing some phase of instruction execution or segment support such as garbage word deletion or new data insertion. The segment sequential architecture lends itself very nicely to this pipeline3 approach.Although they provide a powerful architecture, these three pipeline constructs also develope new problems in their control and timing. Such problems include that the words which are pipelined between cells are not processed twice, missed entirely, or only partially processed by the instruction pipeline. A solution to these and to other problems related to this architecture are presented in this paper.},

abstract = {A large and important class of optical disc technology are CLV format discs such as CD ROM and WORM. In this paper, we examine the issues related to the implementation and performance of several different file organizations on CLV format optical discs such as CD ROM and WORM. The organizations examined are based on hashing and trees.The CLV recording scheme is shown to be a good environment for efficiently implementing hashing. Single seek access and storage utilization levels approaching 100% can be achieved for CD ROM's. It is shown that a B-tree organization is not a good choice for WORM discs (both CAV and CLV), but a modified ISAM approach can be appropriate for WORM discs. We describe clustered BIM's, a class of tree organizations appropriate for CD ROMS. Expressions for the expected retrieval performance of both hashing and trees are also given.The paper concludes by outlining recent results and future directions on buffered implementations of access methods for WORM discs, as well as advantages of signature based access methods for text retrieval in WORM disc architectures.},

We give experimental results for the application of this approach to documents with weighted indexing as well as to documents with complex representations. In contrast to other probabilistic models, our approach yields estimates of the actual probabilities, it can handle very complex representations of documents and requests, and it can be easily applied to multi-valued relevance scales. On the other hand, this approach is not suited to log-linear probabilistic models, and it needs large samples of relevance feedback data for its application.},

abstract = {We consider users' attempts to express their information needs through queries, or search requests and try to predict whether those requests will be of high or low quality. The second type of methods under investigation are those which attempt to estimate the quality of search systems themselves. Given a number of search systems to consider, these methods estimate how well or how poorly the systems will perform in comparison to each other.First, pre-retrieval predictors are investigated, which predict a query's effectiveness before the retrieval step and are thus independent of the ranked list of results. Such predictors base their predictions solely on query terms, collection statistics and possibly external sources. Twenty-two prediction algorithms are categorized and their quality is assessed on three different TREC test collections. A number of newly applied methods for combining various predictors are examined to obtain a better prediction of a query's effectiveness.Building on the analysis of pre-retrieval predictors, post-retrieval approaches are then investigated, which estimate a query's effectiveness on the basis of the retrieved results. The thesis focuses in particular on the Clarity Score approach and provides an analysis of its sensitivity towards different variables such as the collection, the query set and the retrieval approach. Adaptations to Clarity Score are introduced which improve the estimation accuracy of the original algorithm.The utility of query effectiveness prediction methods is commonly evaluated by reporting correlation coefficients, such as Kendall's Tau. Largely unexplored though is the question of the relationship between the current evaluation methodology for query effectiveness prediction and the change in effectiveness of retrieval systems that employ a predictor. We investigate this question by examining how the observed quality of predictors (with respect to Kendall's Tau) affects the retrieval effectiveness in two adaptive system settings: selective query expansion and meta-search.The last part of the thesis is concerned with the task of estimating the ranking of retrieval systems according to their retrieval effectiveness without relying on costly relevance judgments. Five different system ranking estimation approaches are evaluated on a wide range of data sets which cover a variety of retrieval tasks and test collections. It is shown that under certain conditions, automatic methods yield a highly accurate ranking of systems.Available online at http://www.cs.utwente.nl/~hauffc/phd/thesis.pdf.},

abstract = {It is not completely clear what the Semantic Web (SW) is meant to be. Statements about it differ or, rather, the interpretations of statements about it differ. The grand view is that the SW is the core model of the way the world is, expressed in a manner that supports reasoning about this world. The modest view is that the SW is the minimal apparatus of shared generic terminology that can be used to send some carrier pigeon messages from one universe of discourse to another. The 'authorised' view presented in Berners-Lee, Hendler and Lassila (2001) might be regarded as intermediate. It treats the key notion of ontology as a structure of well-defined, i.e. unambiguous, concepts standing for objects, properties, relations etc, which has an accompanying logic allowing inference about the concepts. This is much like the terminological and assertional components familiar from AI knowledge representation. There is indeed no claim that everything that users may want to talk about (or all information) can be captured in this way, either descriptively or inferentially, But the belief is that, even with restricted conceptual coverage and limited inference, it will be possible to throw a large semantic net over the Web, that does far more to catch the information fish than purely syntactic hooks and with much less effort for the human fisherman. This large net can, conveniently, be made by combining many little nets with a few well-made loops. The whole rests upon a proper formal language syntactic apparatus (XML, RDF).},

Less often remarked, however, are the social and political debates that it will engender, if and when the technologies become widely accepted. As the SW is a technology for transferring information and knowledge efficiently and effectively, then many of these questions have an epistemological base. In this paper I want to focus especially on the epistemological underpinnings of these social issues, to think about the interaction between the epistemological and the political. How does technology affect the social networks in which it is embedded? How can technology be successfully transplanted into a new context? And, perhaps most importantly for us, how is technology affected by its context? In particular, I want to look at how our decisions about how we treat knowledge can impact quite dramatically on the technologies we produce.},

The extended indexing proposed in [LYNC88a] is intended to support applications that require indexes on computed values. This paper reports on an implementation of this type of indexing using the POSTGRES extensible database management system [STON86a], focusing on two issues: general problems, and the features in POSTGRES that proved helpful in the solution of these problems.},

For example, during a document indexing process or when a program is trying to spell a text, a dictionary has to be used in an efficient way. A solution to that problem resides in using a hash table. However, if we known many algorithms for manipulating or accessing hash tables [Knuth 73], [Standish 80], [Wiederhold 87], the main problem is to define a "good" hash function for a variable-length string. In order to answer that question our main goals are to present some concrete algorithms and to study their statistical behavior.},

The conclusion is reached that electronic interlibrary resource-sharing networks are ideally suited to situations where there are high frequency occurrences of internode requests for information contained in serials, where nodal separation distances do not exceed a few tens of miles and where copy is in six-point type or larger. A three-node network is examined in detail. Specifications for each element of the network are given, with emphasis placed on a highly critical element, the bound-document scanner.

Items in the space are located according to their "meaning", which is their proximity to all other items in the data base as measured by co-occurrence frequencies. This is done without manipulating large matrices. The dimensions of the space are not used to define relations; items are defined solely by their position relative to the other items. Retrieval is determined by Euclidean distance from the plotted query. In the first section of the paper the basic characteristics of WEIRD are described. Second, the results of a preliminary evaluation are reported. Alternatives for further development of WEIRD are then considered.},

abstract = {Efforts to automate the handling of information concerning the Catalog of the Italian cultural and artistic heritage have been made in the past by the Institute for the Catalog and Documentation (ICCD) of the Ministry of Cultural and Environmental Heritage.A feasibility study for the realization of a data base of the national cultural heritage has been conducted by CNUCE, the scientific computing center of the Italian National Research Council and ICCD. This study led to the determination of the caracteristics of data contained on the record cards, to the location of some samples areas, sufficiently representative of the Italian situation, for the setting up of a model of information system and to the implementation of a data bank on CNUCE computers using the IBM STAIRS information retrieval system.Following this study, a project is presently conducted by the two institutions, with the aim of setting up a distributed structure for the preparation, acquisition, access to and dissemination of the information concerning the Italian cultural and artistic heritage.This paper describes the functions of this proposed structure, with reference to the results of the first experiences and implementations.},

The proposed machine architecture is a parallel array of independent processors connected to a common bus. Each processor consists of a microprocessor, a high-speed block-access memory for storage of a part of the data base, read-only memory for control software, and random-access memory for storage of programs and working storage. The processors are connected by a common high-speed bus that is used for communication of data, programs, commands and results. The benefits claimed for this architecture are design simplicity, high speed for suitable applications, ease of software development, reliability and reasonable cost. This machine architecture is under consideration as a means for providing high-speed text searching capabilities.},

This facility, called IRUS for Information Retrieval using the RUS parsing system, allows users who are unfamiliar with the technical characteristics of the underlying database system to query databases using typed English input. This system can be thought of as a stand-alone query system or as part of a management information system (MIS) or a decision support system (DSS).Many systems boast of having a "user-friendly" or "English-like" or even "English" interface so that users require a minimum of special training to use the system, but most such systems use shallow, relatively ad hoc techniques that are not robust or linguistically sound. We are using a large, well-tested, theoretically-based, general parser of English that has been developed and extended in a variety of research projects for over a decade.One of the primary emphases of IRUS is transportability, which includes three types of changes: (1) changing the domain, (2) changing data bases within the same domain, and (3) changing data base systems. The use of a general parser for English is an important part of the solution to the transportability problem, but there are other parts as well, since portions of the system beyond the parser must know the conceptual content of the domain, the way in which this is reflected in a collection of datasets, and the operating characteristics of the dbms being used to access these datasets.Other researchers have investigated similar issues [8, 5, 6, 12]. We have attacked this problem by building a knowledge-based system, with procedural components independent of domain and data base structure, directed by domain and database dependent knowledge structures. We are also building tools for conveniently creating and maintaining these knowledge structures, with an eventual goal of allowing end-users to extend and modify these knowledge structures to suit their own needs. Given this set of goals, and these tools, we consider the current implementation, which uses the System 1022 dbms on the DEC KL-2060, to be only one of a set of possible implementations, and are not constraining IRUS on the basis of 1022's strengths and weaknesses.This paper presents an overview of the IRUS system, emphasizing those aspects of the design that are critical to transportability. We describe the parsing system, which is a completely independent module that has been interfaced to a variety of different applications, and then discuss the other modules which bridge the gap between the parser and the dbms.},

abstract = {As databases become very large, conventional digital computers cannot provide satisfactory response time. This is particularly true for text databases, which must often be several orders of magnitude larger than formatted databases to store a useful amount of information. Even the standard techniques for improving system performance (such as inverted files) may not be sufficient to give the desired performance, and the use of an unconventional hardware organization may become necessary.A variety of different organizations has been proposed to enhance processing of text retrieval operations. Most of these have concentrated on the design of fast, efficient search engines. These can be divided into three classes: associative memories, cellular pattern matchers, and finite state automata. The advantages and disadvantages inherent in each of these approaches are discussed, along with a number of proposed implementations. Finally, the text retrieval system under development at the University of Utah is discussed in more detail.},

abstract = {As databases become very large, conventional digital computers cannot provide satisfactory response time. This is particularly true for text databases, which must often be several orders of magnitude larger than formatted databases to store a useful amount of information. Even the standard techniques for improving system performance (such as inverted files) may not be sufficient to give the desired performance, and the use of an unconventional hardware organization may become necessary.A variety of different organizations has been proposed to enhance processing of text retrieval operations. Most of these have concentrated on the design of fast, efficient search engines. These can be divided into three classes: associative memories, cellular pattern matchers, and finite state automata. The advantages and disadvantages inherent in each of these approaches are discussed, along with a number of proposed implementations. Finally, the text retrieval system under development at the University of Utah is discussed in more detail.},

The system's objective is to perform the information consultant's job in assisting a user to select the right vocabulary terms for his query. It is particularly useful for a novice user of a controlled-vocabulary, index-based retrieval system, who is not familiar with the vocabulary and the system Thesaurus. The user will enter his terms/keywords, that represent his information need, and the system will apply search procedures on its knowledge-base, and will find relevant concepts to be used as query-terms. The system is interactive; it can explain to the user why/how a concept was discovered/suggested, and it can back-track and try to find alternatives in case the user rejects a suggested concept. Two versions of the system were developed, utilizing two search and interaction strategies. Experiments will be conducted with the two alternatives in order to find out user preference and to compare performance. Performance will also be compard with an alternative "conventional" approach, which is an On-Line-Thesarus - developed as part of this study.},

abstract = {Effective methods for information access are of the greatest importance for our modern lives -- particularly with respect to handheld devices. Personalisation is one such method which models a user's characteristics to deliver content more focused to the user's needs. The emerging area of sophisticated mobile computing devices has started to inspire new forms of personalised systems that include aspects of the person's contextual environment. This thesis seeks to understand the role of personalisation and context, to evaluate the effectiveness of context for content personalisation and to investigate the event and map content domain for mobile usage. The work presented in this thesis has three parts.The first part is a user experiment on context that investigated the contextual attributes of time, location and interest, with respect to participants' perception of their usefulness. Results show highly dynamic and interconnected effects of context on participants' usefulness ratings.In the second part, these results were applied to create a predictive model of context that was related to attribution theory and then combined with an information retrieval score to create a weighted personalisation model.In the third part of this work, the personalisation model was applied in a mobile experiment. Participants solved situational search tasks using a (i) non-personalized and a (ii) personalized mobile information system, and rating entertainment events based on usefulness. Results showed that the personalised system delivered about 20% more useful content to the mobile user than the non-personalised system, with some indication for reduced search effort in terms of time and the amount of queries per task.The work presented provides evidence for the promising potential of context to facilitate personalised information delivery to users of mobile devices. Overall, it serves as an example of an investigation into the effectiveness of context from multiple angles and provides a potential link to some of the aspects of psychology as a potential source for a deeper understanding of contextual processes in humans.},

abstract = {Personal information agents monitor ongoing user information accesses in order to provide users with context-relevant information. Providing the needed information requires effective methods for identifying the user's task context, based on available information. For user browsing tasks, one approach to context identification is to extract context-determining terms from the documents that the user consults. The thesis of this article is (1) that term extraction for personal information agents can be done by learning terms whose occurrence frequencies have a large variance over time, (2) that indexing and retrieval based on these terms can be at least as effective as standard information retrieval techniques, and (3) that this information can be learned without comprehensive corpus analysis, making it suitable for use in personal information retrieval.We have developed an unsupervised term extraction algorithm, WordSieve, that learns individualized context-differentiating terms for document indexing and retrieval. This article presents a new version of WordSieve, compares its design and performance to our initial approach, and assesses its effectiveness for a controlled personal information retrieval task, compared to three common indexing techniques requiring statistics about the global corpus. In the experiments, the new version of WordSieve generates task-relevant indices of comparable or better quality to common indexing techniques, using only local information.},

abstract = {The RIAO 94 Conference provided a strong collection of presentations giving an excellent panorama of the best in current IR R&amp;D. This review briefly summarizes most of those presentations as a basis for characterizing the current state of research and development in information retrieval. The theme of this characterization is that a great number of exciting developments are bubbling just below (and even into) the operational system status but that these developments could be accelerated by an attention to a number of verities. For example, there are multiple paradigms for improving current operational systems and these need to be carefully evaluated through objective scientific experimentation and analysis so that the best techniques from each can be properly integrated into new, improved systems which will go beyond any one paradigm. Not only must current researchers be aware of competing new paradigms but they need to be aware of the work of past generations in Information Science. In particular, the standard structured, contextual, interactive Boolean techniques of modern retrieval systems do work well under intelligent human control and new attempts to add intelligent computer techniques and aides to this paradigm possibly serve as a better basis for optimized information retrieval than the competing paradigms based on statistics, advanced linguistics, or thesaural/classification development and browsing.},

This is because information is divided into sections and each section is stored in a node; the nodes are connected by links. Nodes may have more than one incoming and outgoing link. Using links, the readers have the freedom of reading a hypertext in any way that they want to read. By definition, hypertext is a network of nodes and links. In hypermedia, nodes may contain text, images, animation, video, sound, graphics, programs, etc. In general, the term hypertext is used to indicate nonlinear organization of information.},

Such a controller is also supposed to resolve the conflicts between concurrent requests, if any, such that deadlock situations never arise.In this paper, some architectures for distributed access controllers of distributed databases are investigated. In particular, three controllers with hierarchical architectures are considered. The controllers are evaluated based on three criteria: (i) freedom of deadlocks, (ii) robustness, and (iii) parallelism. The third criterion implies that the added redundancy to increase the controller robustness against failure conditions should also contribute to the amount of achieved parallelism during the no-failure periods. We then define a controller architecture which satisfies all the three criteria.},

abstract = {This paper describes a specialized computer architecture for text retrieval that provides a wide range of query capabilities, without the use of indexes of the material retrieved. A distributed approach is employed, with direct search processors. Each search processor is closely associated with one or more disk drives that store the data to be searched and each consists of a comparator for matching query terms, logic elements to combine query terms, a disk controller and a control minicomputer.The key element of the architecture is the comparator, which can store over 64,000 characters of query terms and compare all of these terms simultaneously with data arriving from a disk continuously at more than one million bytes per second. Exact match, partical match, numeric comparison and context limitation are among the capabilities provided. The comparator is implemented as three similar universal finite-state automata, with special features to facilitate text retrieval and reduce hardware costs.A breadboard version of the system with one searcher is operational and has undergone detailed evaluation. A prototype system with two searchers is being implemented and will be placed into regularly scheduled use.},

abstract = {Current implementations were found to be impractical for airborne use due to LISP's incompatability with conventional computer architectures. Direct execution of LISP with tasks distributed between three processors, seemed to be a workable solution. The language was analyzed, and a special token was devised, using a descriptor with a single pointer. Through careful distribution of responsibilities, control and data flow between the processors was minimized. Significant memory savings resulted from ASCII storage and real time garbage collection. A simulation was used to help estimate execution times and showed a factor of 50 to 100 increase in speed. Thus, through the direct execution of LISP by a multiprocessing system, Computer-Aided Decision-Making could be implimented to enhance the safety of flight operations.},

abstract = {The Relational Associative Processor (RAP) is an experimental "backend" cellular processor for implementing a data base management system which supports Codd's relational model of data. The capacity of a RAP device implemented with current IC and memory technology can be estimated to contain 108 to 109 bits of associatively processable data. Because of this limitation, a virtual memory environment for RAP has been proposed and its performance simulated. The environment incorporates conventional memories for bulk storage and a single RAP processor both controlled by a front-end computer. An entire relational data base is divided into pages of size equal to one RAP cell memory. A buffer memory is added to RAP to permit the overlap of paging with processing. It has been found that environments which process user queries that exhibit long processing times relative to paging time or some "locality", that is, a better than random probability of referencing the same relations over some interval of time, can efficiently page data from large data bases without significant losses in performance.},

They are characterized by their repetitious, homogeneous treatment of fields within records within files. Present computer organizations generally require several instructions imbedded in a loop to process each source-operand pair. This paper outlines a computer organization (called a streaming processor) which operates on long data streams with considerably less instruction processing overhead: fetching and decoding. Thus a greater percentage of the storage bandwidth is used for data and consequently the streaming processor is more efficient for such file operations.},

abstract = {The development of a powerful restructuring function involves two important components - the unambiguous specification of the restructuring operations and the realization of these operations in a software system. We direct our efforts to the first component in the belief that a precise specification will provide a firm foundation for restructuring algorithms and implementations. This paper defines completely the semantics of the restructuring of tree structured data bases.The delineation of the restructuring function is accomplished by formulating three different levels of abstraction, with each level of abstraction representing successively more detailed semantics of the function.At the first level of abstraction, the schema modification, three types are identified: naming, combining and relating, and are further divided into eight schema operations. The second level of abstraction, the instance operations, constitutes the transformations on the data instances. They are divided into group operations such as replication, factoring, union and group relation operations such as collapsing, refinement, fusion etc. The final level, the item values operations, includes the actual item operations such as copy value, delete value, or create a null value.},

First, it permits the employment of ranking strategies which cannot be easily implemented using signature files, specifically methods which depend on document-term weighting. Second, it permits the interactive searching of databases resident on secondary storage. The algorithm is evaluated via a mixture of analytic and simulation techniques, with a particular focus on how cost-effectiveness and efficiency change as the size of the database, number of processors, and cost of memory are altered. In particular, we find that if the ratio of the number of processors and/or disks to the size of the database is held constant, then the cost-effectiveness of the resulting system remains constant. Furthermore, for a given size of database, there is a number of processors which optimizes cost-effectiveness. Estimated response times are also presented. Using these methods, it appears that cost-effective interactive access to databases in the 100-1000 GB range can be achieved using current technology.},

The retrieval task in the track is a traditional ad hoc retrieval task where the evaluation methodology emphasizes a system's least effective topics. The 2005 edition of the track used 50 topics that had been demonstrated to be difficult on one document collection, and ran those topics on a different document collection. Relevance information from the first collection could be exploited in producing a query for the second collection, if desired. As in previous years, the most effective retrieval strategy was to expand queries using terms derived from additional corpora. The relative difficulty of topics differed across the two document sets.},

The note provides an overview of the project, and the next papers by three of the contractors involved in the project provide some details on the systems involved, and some of the initial results.The TIPSTER project is sponsored by the Software and Intelligent Systems Technology Office of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA/SISTO) in an effort to significantly advance the state of the art in effective document detection (information retrieval) and data extraction from large, real-world data collections. The first two-year phase of the program is concerned with the development of algorithms for document retrieval, document routing, and data extraction that are both domain and language independent. A call for proposals was made in June of 1990, and contracts for the six participating groups were let in the fall of 1991. Three meetings have been held so far, with the first results presented in September of 1992.There are two separate, but connected parts of TIPSTER. The first part of the project, document detection, is concerned with retrieving relevant documents" from very large (3 gigabyte) collections of documents, both in a routing environment, and in an adhoc retrieval environment. The routing environment is similar to the document filtering or profile searches currently done in libraries, where a query topic is constant, and the documents are viewed as the incoming stream of publications. The adhoc part of the project is similar to the standard search done against static collections.The second part of the TIPSTER project is concerned with data extraction. Here it is assumed that there is a much smaller set of documents, presumed to be mostly relevant to a topic, and the goal is to extract information to fill a database. This database could then be used for many applications, such as question-answering systems, report writing, or data analysis. The data extraction part of TIPSTER is being done by groups using natural language understanding techniques, and this part will not be described in this issue.},

However, for long-term durability of a software product, the user-interface is seen as a critical component to successful development. In order to explore the effort involved in developing a modern user interface to a text retrieval system, the authors chose to implement a limited X-Window interface to the Cornell University SMART system.The first section of this paper will briefly introduce the history of the SMART system, its command line interface, and the goal of this project; the second will discuss the scope of the project; the development and integration strategies will be covered in sections three and four; then some ideas on the desired enchancements  in section five.},

abstract = {In natural language processing, conflation is the process of merging or lumping together nonidentical words which refer to the same principal concept. This can relate both to words which are entirely different in form (e.g., "group" and "collection"), and to words which share some common root (e.g., "group", "grouping", "subgroups"). In the former case the words can only be mapped by referring to a dictionary or thesaurus, but in the latter case use can be made of the orthographic similarities between the forms. One popular approach is to remove affixes from the input words, thus reducing them to a stem; if this could be done correctly, all the variant forms of a word would be converted to the same standard form. Since the process is aimed at mapping for retrieval purposes, the stem need not be a linguistically correct lemma or root (see also Frakes 1982).},

This approach enables us to simplify the structures of a morphological dictionary and the representation of the knowledge base.},

In this way we can take advantage of the speed and parallelism of digital optical processing. Using the proposed configuration we show how one might implement a set of text processing operations using lasers, spatial light modulators and photodetectors.},

abstract = {Given a set of objects each of which is represented by a finite number of attributes or features and a clustering criterion that associates a value of utility to any classification, the objective of a clustering method is to identify that classification of the objects which optimizes the criterion. A new strategy to solve this problem is developed. The approach is, in essence, a modification of the reproductive plan, a type of adaptive procedure devised by Holland [2], which embodies many principles found in the adaptation of natural systems through evolution. The proposed approach differs from conventional methods in the sense that the search through the space of possible solutions proceeds in a parallel fashion.The adaptive clustering strategy requires the specification of methods for the generation of an initial population of classifications, the parent selection, the modifications and the replacement of current classifications with new ones. The effects of changing several of these features are investigated. Experimental results show that it is possible to devise clustering strategies based on the principles of adaptation in natural systems that are both effective and efficient.},

abstract = {Given a set of objects each of which is represented by a finite number of attributes or features and a clustering criterion that associates a value of utility to any classification, the objective of a clustering method is to identify that classification of the objects which optimizes the criterion. A new strategy to solve this problem is developed. The approach is, in essence, a modification of the reproductive plan, a type of adaptive procedure devised by Holland [2], which embodies many principles found in the adaptation of natural systems through evolution. The proposed approach differs from conventional methods in the sense that the search through the space of possible solutions proceeds in a parallel fashion.The adaptive clustering strategy requires the specification of methods for the generation of an initial population of classifications, the parent selection, the modifications and the replacement of current classifications with new ones. The effects of changing several of these features are investigated. Experimental results show that it is possible to devise clustering strategies based on the principles of adaptation in natural systems that are both effective and efficient.},

abstract = {This study investigated the dynamic process of people constructing mental models of an information-rich web space during their interactions with the system and the impact of task complexity on model construction. In the study, subjects' mental models of MedlinePlus were measured at three time points: after subjects freely explored the system for 5 minutes, after the first search session, and after the second search session. During the first search session, the 39 subjects were randomly divided into two groups; one group completed 12 simple search tasks and the other group completed 3 complex search tasks. During the second search session, all subjects completed a set of 4 simple tasks and 2 complex tasks. Measures of the subjects' mental models included a concept listing protocol, a semi-structured interview, and a drawing task.The analysis revealed that subjects' mental models were a rich representation of the cognitive and emotional processes involved in their interaction with information systems. The mental models consisted of three dimensions (structure, evaluation and emotion, and (expected) behaviors); the structure and evaluation/emotion dimensions consisted of four components each: system, content, information organization, and interface. The construction of mental models was a process coordinated by people's internal cognitive structure and the external sources (the system, system feedback, and tasks) and a process distributed through time, in the sense that earlier mental models impacted later ones. Task complexity also impacted the construction of mental models by influencing what objects in the system were perceived and represented by the user, the specificity of the representations, and the user's feelings about the objects.Based on the study results, recommendations for employing mental models as a tool to assist designers in constructing user models, eliciting user requirements, and performing usability evaluations are put forward.},

Computational algebra and computational logic are the two main pillars on which this discipline is based.Currently, the field experiences a new blossom by the integration and combination of new numeric, algebraic, geometric and logic algorithms made available in new, interactive and easy-to-use versions of these systems combined with web services. Spectacular new applications are reported in areas so different as elementary particle physics, cryptography, and automated software generation. One of the most outstanding outcomes of Symbolic Computation is the recently born Wolfram Alpha system, fully programmed in Mathematical.The goal of this writing is to remind the Information Retrieval community of the chances and capabilities offered by Symbolic Computation.},

Any representation scheme for the patterns in the database may be used as long as the user provides the system with the function that compares two patterns in the representation scheme and determines if one pattern is a subpattern of the other, if the patterns are identical or the patterns are incomparable.

A practical method is presented, that compresses the decimal codes while maintaining the fast determination of relations(e.g., ancestor, descendant, brother, etc.). A special node, called a kernel node, including many common subcodes of the other codes, is defined, and a compact data structure is presented using the kernel nodes. Let n(m) be the number of the total(kernel) nodes. It is theoretically proved that encoding a decimal code is a constant time, that the worst-case time complexity of compressing the decimal codes is O(n+ m2), and that the size of the data structure is proportional to m. From the experimental results of some hierarchical semantic primitives for natural language processing, it is shown that the ratio m/n becomes an extremely small value, ranging from 0.047 to 0.13.},

We call this the component descriptor frame. The paper describes the basic ideas which underlie our system and describes how it can be used for component information retrieval. An example of the system in use is presented. The version of the system described here has been fully implemented and is now being developed as part of a more general reuse support system.},

abstract = {The problem of retrieving documents from a large document database is an important problem that has been the subject of some controversy in the recent literature. See [1] and [2]. The basic question has been whether manual indexing is necessary to overcome the weaknesses of full-text retrieval. The problem with full-text retrieval is that in order to narrow down the number of documents selected to a reasonable size, it is necessary to choose a specialized set of keywords. This restrictive search means that relevant documents will often be missed due to misspellings, alternate terms, typing errors, etc.Manual indexing would seem to provide a solution to this problem by allowing a document to be retrieved using a human assigned index term or terms describing its content. Unfortunately, experiments have shown that manual indexing is often subject to the same problems as full-text retrieval due to the variation in index terms chosen by different people for the same document. An even more serious problem for a very large technical domain with many documents is the difficulty in creating and maintaining coherent indexes that can describe the whole domain.This paper will summarize the experience that has been gained from studying document retrieval in the domain of computer software support. The database is accessed by engineers searching to see if a current problem has occurred and been solved in the past. An extensive study of how documents are submitted and retrieved has brought to light some general principles that can improve the performance of the system. These principles which combine manual indexing and full-text retrieval will be discussed in the remainder of this paper.},

abstract = {This paper compares two different approaches for indexing archived text documents. The first approach is based on inversion of words in the text, the second on the content. A system reflecting the word inversion approach is compared against two systems reflecting the signature scanning approach and using, alternatively, superimposed coding and the concatenation of word signatures. Performances are estimated using analytical models of these systems. Characteristics are evaluated in function of office environment requirements. The evaluations derive from a model for estimating the statistical parameters of text archives.},

abstract = {One of the essential features of the "Meaning &lt;=&gt; Text" model (MTM) developed by I. A. Mel'chuk et. al. is the special lexicon or ECD ('explanatory and combinatory' dictionary). This component can be thought of as a collection independent thesaurus, and can be applied to improve the effectiveness of an information retrieval system.After outlining the MTM and related work, this paper briefly describes the SMART type of information retrieval system. Applicability of the above-mentioned lexicon to such a system is discussed. In particular, the list of lexical relations included in the ECD is expanded and organized to be more effective for retrieval, partially along the lines suggested by Evens and Smith.Finally, an experimental analysis of the utility of lexical relations in an information retrieval system is discussed. It is shown that lexical relations generally enhance system performance. When all lexical relations are considered in the comparison, the resulting performance is shown, by statistical methods, to make a significant improvement (up to 16.5% at a single recall level); when all lexical relations except for antonyms are considered, the improvement is even greater (up to 20.2% at a single recall level).},

abstract = {The second research colloquium organized for the informal presentation of research ideas in Information Retrieval was held at the University of Aston, Birmingham on 2-3 April 1979. Many of the talks were on aspects of bibliographic information retrieval systems but a large proportion were about data base management systems. Considering that the last colloquium contained virtually no mention of this topic, it was not surprising that this provoked quite a lively discussion about the relationship between the two types of systems. The main conclusions of this discussion were thata) A data base management system (DBMS) was a convenient tool with which a bibliographic information retrieval system could be implemented, butb) By considering the problems inherent with bibliographic data (large term vocabulary, non-exact matching), facilities may be provided on a DBMS to make this implementation more efficient.},

abstract = {This paper is the result of an effort to support and supplement the development of a specialized information retrieval computer, EUREKA, presently being built at the University of Illinois, Urbana. We begin by defining a basic machine architecture from which many text retrieval systems can be configured. This architecture includes two features that are designed to increase the efficiency and performance of these systems. First, a special processor is used to merge and coordinate postings lists obtained from an inverted file. Second, there are facilities for parallel data transfer which will allow the postings lists to be moved rapidly through the memory hierarchy. Our next step is to identify the design variables that exist within this basic architecture. These are the parameters that can be varied to configure specific retrieval machines. Finally, simulation results are, studied to evaluate the effect the design variables have on each other as well as on the architecture as a whole. From these results we will develop an understanding of how to construct a retrieval machine using information on the various speeds and capacities of its components.},

abstract = {With the widespread application of microprocessors and the consequent decrease in prices with volume, the possibility has arisen that it may be cost effective to replace large computers with networks of microcomputers in many applications. That this is an obvious idea whose time has come may be adjudged from the quantity of scientific papers read on the subject during 1975. A small apology for adding to their number should be prefaced with the assurance that this is written after a reading of many of them and that it is at least not the same. So saying, we choose to start with a discussion of alternative multiprocessor organizations as they compare for the stated purpose, that is, a potentially large number of microprocessors co-coperating on a single high performance application.},

abstract = {The problems of file allocation and capacity assignment in a fixed topology distributed computer network are examined. These two aspects of the design are tightly coupled through an average message delay constraint. The objective is to allocate copies of information files to network nodes and capacities to network links so that a minimum cost is achieved subject to network delay and file availability constraints. A model for solving the problem is formulated and the resulting optimization problem is shown to fall into a class of non-linear integer programming problems. Deterministic techniques for solving this class of problems are computationally cumbersome even for small sized problems. A new heuristic algorithm is developed, based on a decomposition technique which greatly reduces the computational complexity of the problem. Numerical results for a variety of network configurations indicate that the heuristic algorithm, while not theoretically convergent, yields practicable low cost solutions with substantial savings in computer processing time and storage requirements. Moreover, it is shown that this algorithm is capable of solving realistic network problems whose solution using deterministic techniques is computationally intractable.},

abstract = {The widespread development of large shared data bases has proceeded mainly on empirical notions. Only in the past few years have there been attempts at formalizing the underlying concepts into a theory of data structures. The present models have been founded on the well-established mathematical theories of sets, relations and graphs, but few descriptions have been sufficiently developed to meet the needs of a complete theory of data structures. The set theoretic formalism offered by Childs(1) or Schwartz(2) or the relational model by Codd(3) are useful but fail to give a complete description of the complex structures found in modern data bases. The graph theoretic concepts found in papers by Harary and Hsiao(4) and Earley(5) are more appealing but need further elaboration. This paper is an attempt to develop a graph theoretic model into a useful formalism for describing and manipulating data structures.},

For example, if the index terms are assumed to be independently distributed over both the set of relevant and non-relevant documents then the matching function will in general be linear, whereas an assumption of dependence will lead to a non-linear function.Irrespective of the form that the matching function may take it is always assumed that the search terms in the query are known. In this paper I wish to address the problem of the choice of search terms and how this choice may be affected by an independence assumption.},

abstract = {This paper describes an approach to solving a major problem in the information processing sciences— that of searching very large (5-50 billion characters) data bases of unstructured free-text for random queries within a reasonable time and at an affordable price.The need by information specialists and knowledge workers for large, fast low-cost text and document retrieval systems is growing rapidly. Conventional approaches to the problem have usually depended upon expensive, general purpose computers, upon special pre-preprocessing of the textual data (e.g. file inverting, indexing, abstracting, etc.), and upon elaborate, costly software. The resulting retrieval systems often cost hundreds of dollars per query and the full scanning of an uninverted, unstructured billion byte textual data base could take hours of computer services. However, in spite of these restrictions, such full text search systems have proved useful and even indispensible for many applications.Computer technology of the late 1960's and the 1970's, in both hardware and software (e.g., minicomputers, low-cost, high density disk storage, “chip” electronics, natural language query systems, etc.), have made i t practical to build special purpose, low-cost text retrieval systems. Such a system has been built, tested, and is now in a production stage. The system called the Associative File Processor (AFP), utilizes a conventional minicomputer (DEC's PDP-11/45) for control, off-the-shelf high density disks for storage, a special purpose parallel search module as a text term detector, and query and retrieval software. The AFP is currently being field tested at two sites. Full text, parallel searches on un-preprocessed textual data bases are being performed at the effective matching rates of 4 billion bytes per second (8K byte key memory times 500 Kbyte/second data stream). Estimated costs are 10 to 25 cents per query for a one billion byte data base. The costs per query and the time for searching increase in a linear fashion as data base increases. A basic architecture for the AFP is described and an implemented version is discussed. A more powerful term detector module is also under development. This system is designed around a finite state automaton algorithm.},

abstract = {An algorithm to do pattern matching, a basic character string operation, is presented. The Programmable Algorithm Machine (PAM), a proposed special-purpose computer which will feature multiple processing elements and operate efficiently over a wide class of applications, is described. It is shown that the multiple processing elements of the PAM allow concurrent execution of independent operations both in a special case of the pattern matching algorithm, where the string sizes (lengths) are known at compile time, and in the general case, where the sizes are not known.},
