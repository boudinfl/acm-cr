abstract = {We explore bodily sensation maps (BSMs) as a novel way to detect emotions.We propose EmoPaint, a mobile app to collect BSMs and detect emotions from them.A user study reveals that the app is easy to use and able to detect emotions.The app improves accuracy over a traditional method: Affect Grid with Circumplex model. The ability of detecting emotions is essential in different fields such as user experience (UX), affective computing, and psychology. This paper explores the possibility of detecting emotions through user-generated bodily sensation maps (BSMs). The theoretical basis that inspires this work is the proposal by Nummenmaa et al. (2014) of BSMs for 14 emotions. To make it easy for users to create a BSM of how they feel, and convenient for researchers to acquire and classify users BSMs, we created a mobile app, called EmoPaint. The app includes an interface for BSM creation, and an automatic classifier that matches the created BSM with the BSMs for the 14 emotions. We conducted a user study aimed at evaluating both components of EmoPaint. First, it shows that the app is easy to use, and is able to classify BSMs consistently with the considered theoretical approach. Second, it shows that using EmoPaint increases accuracy of users emotion classification when compared with an adaptation of the well-known method of using the Affect Grid with the Circumplex Model, focused on the same set of 14 emotions of Nummenmaa et al. Overall, these results indicate that the novel approach of using BSMs in the context of automatic emotion detection is promising, and encourage further developments and studies of BSM-based methods.},

abstract = {Presents a novel phrase sampling method for multilingual text entry.The method uses knowledge graphs derived from BabelNet.The method has clear benefits over other sampling techniques in several scenarios. Text entry evaluations are typically conducted with English-only phrase sets. This calls into question the validity of the results when conducting evaluations with non-native English speakers. Automated phrase sampling methods alleviate this problem, however they are difficult to use in practice and do not take into account language semantics, which is an important attribute to optimize. To achieve this goal, we present Kaps, a phrase sampling method that uses the BabelNet multilingual semantic network as a common knowledge resource, aimed at both standardizing and simplifying the sampling procedure to a great extent. We analyze our method from several perspectives, namely the effect of sampled phrases on users foreign language proficiency, phrase set memorability and representativeness, and semantic coverage. We also conduct a large-scale evaluation involving native speakers of 10 different languages. Overall, we show that our method is an important step toward and provides unprecedented insight into multilingual text entry evaluations.},

User interfaces that display dynamic information have the ability to influence decision makers in networked settings where many individuals collaborate. To understand how varying levels of information support affects behavior (cooperation vs. defection) in a social dilemma, a user interface (UI) was developed and an online experiment (N=901) was conducted based on the iterated Diners Dilemma, a version of the n-player Prisoners Dilemma.There were 3 main findings: (1) as more UI support was given, participants became more likely to retaliate against defection than they were to initiate defection; (2) participant situation awareness (SA) increased as more UI support was given but decreased in the presence of forgiving co-actors; and (3) the need for UI support to make good decisions was diminished as co-actors became more likely to exploit. These results can inform the design of information support tools for collaborative settings.},

The rise of new technologies has brought new challenges regarding the protection of personal data, as a vast amount of personal information is being published and shared. Because personal data are extremely valuable for many digital businesses, it is crucial to understand to what extent individuals want to exert control over the disclosure of their personal data. This paper aims to assess the factors that affect web users predisposition to exert control over personal data flows, using a dataset collected in France in 2014 that targets online users and their privacy. Our results demonstrate that those who are more likely to disclose personal data express a greater propensity to use privacy controls. Additionally, our research results show that online users propensity to use privacy controls is likely to be driven by the type of personal information they are willing to share. Furthermore, our findings show clearly that compensation is a factor to motivate online users in using privacy controls over data flows.},

abstract = {An activity model for applications focused on creativity.Building blocks for constructing applications designed for creativity.By relying on our building blocks, applications were implemented in short time.Our building blocks prove the model's expressivity for describing creativity sessions. Whereas creativity tasks have traditionally been supported by conventional media and tools (such as paper, pens, scissors and glue); mobile phones, tablets and other devices based on interactive surfaces are increasingly been used as additional support. Large-sized multi-touch interactive surfaces appear as an interesting alternative for supporting creativity processes and for supporting synchronous collocated collaboration. However, they have mostly been usedfor visualization and navigation purposes. Their use as authoring means, which would be essential in creativity tasks, has only begun to be explored. Applications and platforms that have been developed in this area rely on low-level primitives for implementing representation of ideas and discussions. We have identified a significant gap between the level of development tools and the abstractions required by end-user applications that aim to support creativity processes using interactive surfaces. This gap makes it difficult for developers to build applications that provide richer, more flexible support for innovators working collaboratively around interactive surfaces. Based upon a thorough analysis of existing applications and user practices in the field, we have identified the key actions and interaction patterns that take place during collaborative creativity sessions. Thus, we propose ISCALI (Innovation Solutions Centered on Activities for Large-sized Interfaces), a model that can be used both for describing and for prescribing the role of multi-touch surfaces in collaborative creativity tasks. In accordance to Activity Centered Design, ISCALI comprises three major components: activities, actions and operations. The central activities within the processes of creativity comprise generation, organization and evaluation of ideas. Each of these activities encompasses sets of actions. Finally, several operation sets achieve the goal of each of the actions. Based upon our model, we designed a general architecture for collaborative creativity applications. This architecture addresses the development gap through a proposed set ofbuilding blocks. These building blocks implement the main interaction patterns needed for stimulating creativity tasks that rely on interactive surfaces. We have implemented prototypical versions of these building blocks, referred to as TOKAs (Touch Operations for Creative Activities), and have made them available to developers. Independent developers have implemented applications that facilitate the use of various methodologies that foster creativity and synchronous collocated collaboration. These developers have taken advantage of the availability of TOKAs. The implementation and use of TOKAs demonstrate ISCALI's expressivity for describing and guiding the development of applications that support collaborative creativity on top of interactive surfaces.},

abstract = {Accessing visual information becomes a central need for all kinds of tasks and users (from accessing graphics and charts in news articles, to viewing images of items on sale on e-commerce sites), especially for blind users. In this context, digital tools of assistance, using adapted software (screen readers, talking browsers, etc.), hardware (force feedback mouse, piezo-electric pins, etc.), and more recently touch-screen technology (using smart phones or smart tablets) have been increasingly helping blind persons access and manipulate information. While effective with textual information, yet existing solutions remain limited when handling visual information. In this context, the goal of our study is to shed light on how the vibration modality can be perceived by blind users when accessing simple contour-based images and visual graphics on a touch-screen. In this paper, we target the vibration-only modality, compared with audio-kinesthetic or multimodal vibro-audio solutions. Our main motivation is that the potentials and limitations of touch-screen vibration-only feedback need to be fully studied and understood prior to integrating other modalities (such as sound, human speech, or other forms of haptic feedback). This could prove very useful in a range of applications: allowing blind people to access geographic maps, to navigate autonomously inside and outside buildings, as well as to access graphs and mathematical charts (for blind students). To achieve our goal, we develop a dedicated experimental protocol, titled EVIAC, testing a blind user's capacity in learning, distinguishing, identifying, and recognizing basic shapes and geometric objects presented on a vibrating touch-screen. Extensive tests were conducted on blindfolded and blind candidates, using a battery of evaluation metrics including: i) accuracy of shape recognition, ii) testers average response time, iii) number and duration of finger strokes, iv) surface area covered by the testers finger path trails, as well as iv) finger path correlation with the surface of the target shape. Results show that blind users are generally capable of accessing simple shapes and graphics presented on a vibrating touch-screen. However, results also underline various issues, ranging over: prolonged response time (e.g., blind users require 1min and 22s on average to recognize a basic shape), reduced touch-screen surface coverage, and low correlation between the surface of the target shape and the tester's vibration trails. The latter issues need to be further investigated to produce optimal recipes for using touch-screen technology to support image accessibility for blind users.},

Throughout the study, we aim to understand and represent the web page visual structure as in the way people do by focusing on the layout similarity through the wireframe design. The conducted study is composed of two parts. In the first part, structural similarities are analyzed with the proposed concept of layout components along with visual inspection of DOM trees. In this way, five types of structural layout components are proposed and revealed. Moreover, whitespaces are also utilized since they are important visual cues in the visual perception of web pages. In the second part, a computer-vision based method named histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) is employed to reveal local visual cues in terms of edge orientations. Following the feature extraction phases, extracted feature histograms are mapped on spatial information preserving multilevel and multi-resolution bag of features representation method named spatial pyramid matching. In this way, three goals were achieved: (1) the visual layout of web pages were mapped and compared in a multi-resolution schema; (2) the intermediate process of visual segmentation was removed; and (3) efficient and easily comparable web page layout signatures were generated. We also conducted a questionnaire study covering 312 subjects. This helped us to create a benchmark dataset involving similarity scores collected from individuals. So far, there exists no web page layout similarity ranking oriented corpus in the literature. Our suggested approach achieved a remarkable ranking performance at top-5 and top-10 retrieval results. According to the findings of the comparative study, our approach outperforms some structure and vision-based studies in the literature. With this achievement, web pages could be employed as a query item to find other, similar web pages by taking into consideration that they are web pages, instead of images or anything else.

abstract = {A new interaction technique based on contextual information using a multimodal system for force pattern learning is proposed.Using the contextual information approach, the trainees obtain information about the evolution of their performance along the time (helping to correct the errors).The findings suggest that the contextual information provides a better trainee's performance than the punctual information.One drawback of the training strategies based on punctual feedback is the difficulty that users have in interpreting the information.The contextual approach could be used to extend the capabilities of haptic training procedures based on haptic guidance to provide information about the level of force to be applied during the execution of a specific task. Previous studies on learning force patterns (fine motor skills) have focused on providing punctual information, which means users only receive information about their performance at the current time step. This work proposes a new approach based on contextual information, in which users receive information not only about the current time step, but also about the past (how the target force has changed over time) and the future (how the target force will change). A test was run to compare the performance of the contextual approach in relation to the punctual information, in which each participant had to memorize and then reproduce a pattern of force after training with a multimodal system. The findings suggest that the contextual approach is a useful strategy for force pattern learning. The advantage of the contextual information approach over the punctual information approach is that users receive information about the evolution of their performance (helping to correct the errors), and they also receive information about the next forces to be exerted (providing them with a better understanding of the target force profile). Finally, the contextual approach could be implemented in medical training platforms or surgical robots to extend the capabilities of these systems.},

Design is driven by our understanding of users experiences. This understanding rests primarily upon users reports of their experiences, in the moment, after the fact, or ahead of time. In this paper we ask how the study of and design for experience might be better informed by attending more carefully to differences between these reports. Based on a broad and interdisciplinary literature review, we develop a conceptual framework of multiple selves, each representing a stage in the consolidation of experience accessed by self-report. We explore the use of this framework to support the interpretation of user experience, provide insight into users evaluations of their own experiences, and emphasise the importance of design for experience as lived and reflected upon. We discuss the implications of this framing of experience for design, particularly in the case of systems to support self-knowledge, wellbeing, behaviour change, reflection, and decision making.},

abstract = {First empirical evidence of in-vivo positive mood in gaming.Contextually-relevant paradigm for exploring gaming outcomes.Use of a custom-made Smartphone App to model context effects in gaming. Although research extols the positive effects of social gaming, the dynamic processes underlying these effects remain unclear. In a hitherto unused approach in this field, we utilised a Smartphone App to model the effect of in-vivo flow and gaming context on positive mood. We also explored individual-level factors including demographic gaming variables (average hours per week playing, gamer-type, preferred type of play) and Big-5 personality traits. Data was obtained from 41 gamers producing a total of 2796 data-points. Multi-level modelling revealed positive mood was associated with in-vivo reports of flow in gameplay, current context and individual-level variance in the number of hours typically spent engaged in playing per week. Specifically, in-vivo positive mood was higher for players when playing online with friends (relative to those playing solo). Higher reports of flow were, nonetheless, associated with decreases in positive mood. Finally, players who indicated playing less frequently experienced higher positive mood, relative to those who played more. These findings support and extend previous work which explores the emotional affordances of gaming and highlight the importance of obtaining situated measures of experiences. They demonstrate that positive mood in gaming is not static, but changeable depending on one's current gaming environment and flow.},

abstract = {Fingertip force control process obeyed Fitts law in each single sensory modality (visual/audio/haptic) when the difficulty level was within a specific range.The response time in the audio feedback mode was the shortest among the three feedback conditions while that in the haptic feedback mode was the longest.The Linear model has the best fit in all three feedback modes among all three models. Fitts law has been widely used in the human-computer interaction (HCI) field, especially for Graphical User Interface (GUI) design. However, most studies on Fitts law were performed with motion control tasks under visual feedback while only a few endeavor to measure human force control behavior. How quickly humans can exert a constant force with a required accuracy and whether this speed-accuracy tradeoff obeys Fitts law still needs to be explored. In this paper, human capabilities for controlling absolute magnitudes of fingertip force with discrete visual/audio/haptic feedback cues were observed and compared. Eighteen participants applied constant forces by pressing a force sensor with their index fingers in the three feedback modes respectively. Response time of 24 pairs (46) of Magnitude-Tolerance conditions were measured. The results showed that the response time obeyed Fitts law within a certain range of force accuracy in all the three feedback modes, while the Linear speed-accuracy tradeoff model was almost superior for the force control process than the Meyer formulation and the Shannon formulation. The response time in the audio feedback mode was the shortest among the three feedback conditions. The results may be used as guidelines for applications that rely on accurate and quick force control under different feedback conditions such as fast tapping tasks on a touch screen.},

Increasingly our digital traces are providing new opportunities for self-reflection. In particular, social media (SM) data can be used to support self-reflection, but to what extent is this affected by the form in which SM data is presented? Here, we present three studies where we work with individuals to transform or remediate their SM data into a physical book, a photographic triptych and a film. We describe the editorial decisions that take place as part of the remediation process and show how the transformations allow users to reflect on their digital identity in new ways. We discuss our findings in terms of the application of Goffman's (1959) self-presentation theories to the SM context, showing that a fluid rather than bounded interpretation of our social media spaces may be appropriate. We argue that remediation can contribute to the understanding of digital self and consider the design implications for new SM systems designed to support self-reflection.},

We demonstrate the capability of discriminating between affective states on the valence and arousal dimensions using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), a practical non-invasive device that benefits from its ability to localize activation in functional brain regions with spatial resolution superior to the Electroencephalograph (EEG). The high spatial resolution of fNIRS enables us to identify the neural correlates of emotion with spatial precision comparable to fMRI, but without requiring the use of the constricting and impractical fMRI scanner. We make these predictions across subjects, creating the capacity to generalize the model to new participants. We designed the experiment and evaluated our results in the context of a prior experimentbased on the same basic protocol and stimulus materialswhich used EEG to measure participants valence and arousal. The F1-scores achieved by our classifiers suggest that fNIRS is particularly useful at distinguishing between high and low levels of valence (F1-score of 0.739), which has proven to be difficult to measure with physiological sensors.},

Although Google Glass received only a marginal usability rating with an SUS score of 64.2 points, 60% of the participants rated the design as attractive, the handling as rather good and the complexity of the system as low. With a short training, even older adults with sensory and cognitive disabilities are able to use Google Glass.

Students who are visually impaired face unique challenges when learning mathematical concepts due to the visual nature of graphs, charts, tables, and plots. While touchscreens have been explored as a means to assist people with visual impairments in learning mathematical concepts, many devices are not standalone, were not developed with a user-centered design approach, and have not been tested with users who are visually impaired. This research details the user-centered design and analysis of an electrostatic touchscreen system for displaying graph-based visual information to individuals who are visually impaired. Feedback from users and experts within the visually-impaired community informed the iterative development of our software. We conducted a usability study consisting of locating haptic points in order to test the efficacy and efficiency of the system and to determine patterns of user interactions with the touchscreen. The results showed that: (1) participants correctly located haptic points with an accuracy rate of 69.83% and an average time of 15.34s out of 116 total trials, (2) accuracy increased across trials, (3) efficient patterns of user interaction involved either a systematic approach or a rapid exploration of the screen, and (4) haptic elements placed near the corners of the screen were more easily located. Our user-centered design approach resulted in an intuitive interface for people with visual impairments and laid the foundation for demonstrating this device's potential to depict mathematical data shown in graphs.},

Based on the system criteria, we also suggested suitable menu levels.We assessed the efficiency of MMM relatively to current smartphone accessibility menu, TalkBack.Users could perform menu selections with MMM than with TalkBack. Users were also receptive to the new menu system, MMM. Current smartphone accessibility for people with visual impairments relies largely on screen readers and voice commands. However, voice commands and screen readers are often not ideal because users with visual impairments rely mostly on hearing ambient sound from the environment for their safety in mobile situations. Recent research has shown that marking menus in mobile devices provide fast and eyes-free access for sighted users Francone etal., 2010; Oakley and Park, 2007, 2009. However, the literature is lacking design implications and adaptations that meet the needs of users with visual impairments. This paper investigates the capabilities of visually impaired people to invoke smartphone functions using marking menus via 3D motions. We explore and present the optimal numbers of menu items (breadth) and menu levels (depth) for marking menus that people with visual impairments can successfully adopt. We also compared a marking menu prototype to TalkBack which is an accessibility menu system in Android smartphones. The experimental results show that our participants could perform menu selections using marking menus faster than when using TalkBack.

Based on considerations that peoples need to belong can be temporarily satisfied by social snacking (Gardner etal., 2005) in the sense that in absence of social interactions which adequately satisfy belongingness needs surrogates can bridge lonely times, it was tested whether the interaction with a virtual agent can serve to ease the need for social contact. In a between subjects experimental setting, 79 participants interacted with a virtual agent who either displayed socially responsive nonverbal behavior or not. Results demonstrate that although there was no main effect of socially responsive behavior on participants subjective experience of rapport and on connectedness with the agent, those people with a high need to belong reported less willingness to engage in social activities after the interaction with a virtual agent but only if the agent displayed socially responsive behavior.},

User-generated content (UGC) projects involve large numbers of mostly unpaid contributors collaborating to create content. Motivation for such contributions has been an active area of research. In prior research, motivation for contribution to UGC has been considered a single, static and individual phenomenon. In this paper, we argue that it is instead three separate but interrelated phenomena. Using the theory of helping behaviour as a framework and integrating social movement theory, we propose a stage theory that distinguishes three separate sets (initial, sustained and meta) of motivations for participation in UGC. We test this theory using a data set from a Wikimedia Editor Survey (Wikimedia Foundation, 2011). The results suggest several opportunities for further refinement of the theory but provide support for the main hypothesis, that different stages of contribution have distinct motives. The theory has implications for both researchers and practitioners who manage UGC projects.},

Researchers are proposing many approaches to overcome the usability problem of a smartwatch owing to its small touchscreen. One of the promising approaches is to use touch-sensing edges to expand the control space of a smartwatch. We considered possible interaction techniques using touch-sensing edges in combination with the smartwatch touchscreen: single-edge, multi-edge, and edge screen (edge and touchscreen in combination). We call these techniques square watch interaction (SWI) techniques in this paper because they exploit the form factor of a square smartwatch. To explore the design space and evaluate the usability of the SWI techniques, we implemented a square smartwatch prototype with touch-sensitive edges, and conducted a series of user experiments. The experiment results showed that the SWI techniques enable precise 1D pointing and occlusion-free 2D pointing. The experiments also produced empirical data that reflect human manual skills for the edge screen techniques. The produced empirical data will provide a practical guideline for the application of the edge screen techniques.},

This paper provides a comparative performance analysis of a hands-on-throttle-and-stick (HOTAS) cursor control device (CCD) with other suitable CCDs for an aircraft cockpit: an isotonic thumbstick, a trackpad, a trackball, and touchscreen input. The performance and characteristics of these five CCDs were investigated in terms of throughput, movement accuracy, and error rate using the ISO 9241-9 standard task. Results show statistically significant differences (p&lt;0.001) between three groupings of the devices, with the HOTAS having the lowest throughput (0.7bits/s) and the touchscreen the highest (3.7bits/s). Errors for all devices were shown to increase with decreasing target size (p&lt;0.001) and, to a lesser effect, increasing target distance (p&lt;0.01). The trackpad was found to be the most accurate of the five devices, being significantly better than the HOTAS fingerstick and touchscreen (p&lt;0.05) with the touchscreen performing poorly on selecting smaller targets (p&lt;0.05). These results would be useful to cockpit human-machine interface designers and provides evidence of the need to move away from, or significantly augment the capabilities of, this type of HOTAS CCD in order to improve pilot task throughput in increasingly data-rich cockpits.},

In this paper, we describe the design and evaluation of a head-mounted tactile prototype and multi-parameter coding scheme to support situational awareness among users. The head has been selected as the location for the interaction because it has been relatively under-researched compared to the torso or hands, and offers potential for hands-free attention direction and integration with new head and eyewear technology. Two studies have been conducted. The first examined the user's ability to discern three-parameter tactile signals presented at sites on the head. Findings highlighted that while multi-parameter cues could be interpreted with low error, challenges were faced when interpreting specific combinations of waveform and interval type, and when performing identification of interval pattern and stimulation location while visually-distracted. A second study investigated how use of the three-parameter tactile coding scheme impacted participants situational awareness under several exertion conditions. Significant interaction was found between the exertion conditions and subjective cognitive workload. The relationship between situational awareness phases of participant SAGAT assessment scores were consistent between conditions, with perception and prediction phases outpacing comprehension. This suggests, pending further study of the suitability of situational awareness evaluation methods for tactile perception, that quickly trained participants may struggle to understand multi-parameter coding intended to convey changing events. Interpretations of coding schemes were found to vary, highlighting the importance of carefully selecting and mapping signals for presentation. Insights from our study can support interface designers aiming to heighten levels of spatial and situational awareness among their users through use of the tactile channel.},

We evaluate a 3-D virtual talking head on non-native Mandarin speaker pronunciation learning under three language presentation conditions audio only (AU), human face video (HF) and audio-visual animation of a three-dimensional talking head (3-D). An auto language tutor (ALT) configured with AU, HF and 3-D is developed as the computer-aided pronunciation training system. We apply both subjective and objective methods to study user acceptance of the 3-D talking head, user comparative impressions and pronunciation performance under different conditions. The subjective ratings show that the 3-D talking head achieved a high level of user acceptance, and both 3-D and HF were preferred to AU. The objective pronunciation learning improvements show that 3-D was more beneficial than AU with respect to blade-alveolar, blade-palatal, lingua-palatal, open-mouth, open-mouth(-i) and round-mouth. Learning with 3-D was better than learning with HF with respect to blade-alveolar, lingua-palatal and round-mouth, and the tones of falling-rising and falling. Learning with AU was better than learning with HF with respect to the falling-rising tone. Neither HF nor AU was superior to 3-D with respect to any of the initials, finals and tones.},

abstract = {We examine changes in product-related perceptions and emotions at early stages and for short-time usage.Before any interaction takes place, the visual aesthetics of the device influences perceived usability.Already after a short period of interacting with the product, this influence vanishes and system usability starts affecting perceived visual attractiveness and emotions.To account for both influences, we distinguish between a hedonic halo effect (beautiful is usable) and a pragmatic halo effect (usable gets beautiful).Based on the results, we propose that a heuristic may bias ratings of usability in the beginning while emotions may bias ratings of aesthetics at later stages. User Experience (UX) has emerged as a comprehensive concept which provides a holistic perspective on users interaction with technology. This concept can be characterized as a multidimensional phenomenon that comprises both, the perception of different product qualities as well as emotions that arise while using a product. The interrelations of these components are described in the Component Model of User Experience (CUE model), which serves as the theoretical basis for our experiment. UX can be investigated in different phases of usage. In our experiment, we examined product perceptions and emotions in early phases and for short-time usage. Sixty participants employed different versions of mobile digital audio players which were systematically varied with respect to visual aesthetics and usability. Essential aspects of UX, i.e., perceptions of visual attractiveness and usability, as well as emotional responses were measured at three stages: Before interacting with the device, after an exploration (2min) and after working with the system for a short time (15min) to solve a given set of tasks. Data was analysed using a 223 mixed MANCOVA. The results of the experiment show that influences of visual aesthetics and of usability on quality perceptions as well as emotions change during these early stages. Moreover, evidence for two different halo effects was found: On the one hand, visual aesthetics influenced perceived usability in the beginning. On the other hand, the usability of the device impacted the perceived visual attractiveness and emotional responses at later stages. To account for these findings, we suggest to distinguish a hedonic halo effect from a pragmatic one. Based on the results for both effects, we propose that two mechanisms may be responsible for the effects during short-time usage, one of them being cognitive in nature, the other emotional.},

abstract = {Presents results two studies into the influence of primacy and recency effects in interaction.Shows that recency effects significantly influence preferences.Primacy effects were not shown to influence preferences.Discusses factors influencing recency effects in interaction. Interactive computing tasks are composed of sequences of sub-interactions (or moments), each of which yields a slightly different user experience. Prior work, predominantly from the psychology literature, suggests that the order of these moments can affect people's retrospective evaluation of experiences. Several kinds of sequencing effects have been examined, including primacy, recency, and peak-end effects. We review previous research on sequencing effects and their potential application in Human-Computer Interaction, of which prior work has found mixed results regarding the influence of interaction sequence on preference possibly because the magnitude of experiential changes caused by interactive tasks are weaker than those studied in psychological experiments. However, sequencing effects are still of great importance to interface design, because when they occur, they have the potential to substantially change user preferences for common interactions. To explore the subtlety of sequencing effects in HCI, we describe two experiments that examined user preferences for series of interactions with different orderings that created positive and negative recency and primacy effects. Positive and negative experiences were created with simulated system assistance that either worked well (aiding the user in drag-and-drop tasks) or worked poorly (hindering the user). In both experiments, the series differed only in the order of positive and negative momentary experiences. Results of Experiment 1 were mixed: the study provided some support for recency effects, but without strong evidence. Experiment 2 modified the experimental method to better accentuate the positive and negative experiences, and produced results showing strong effects of recency, but not of primacy. We discuss reasons for these results, consider overall explanations for the subtle nature of sequencing effects on HCI tasks, and provide an agenda for further research and design lessons regarding recency effects. Overall, we contribute new understanding of a phenomenon that can have a substantial impact on user experience, but that is currently underexplored in HCI.},

Cerebral palsy (CP) describes a group of disorders affecting the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitation. Access to technology can alleviate some of these limitations. Many studies have used vision-based movement capture systems to overcome problems related to discomfort and fear of wearing devices. In contrast, there has been no research assessing the behavior of vision-based movement capture systems in people with involuntary movements. In this paper, we look at the potential of the Kinect sensor as an assistive technology for people with cerebral palsy. We developed a serious game, called KiSens Nmeros, to study the behavior of Kinect in this context and eighteen subjects with cerebral palsy used it to complete a set of sessions. The results of the experiments show that Kinect filters some of peoples involuntary movements, confirming the potential of Kinect as an assistive technology for people with motor disabilities.},

Research studies have shown that although the hedonic product feature is more valued by users it is the utilitarian that is favored in acquisition choice situations. Further, the hedonic is more favored in forfeiture choice situations than the utilitarian. In this longitudinal study we examine this phenomenon with actual users of software. The results of the study show that as expected in acquisition situations users explicitly prefer the utilitarian although their implicit choice as reflected by the feature's impact on their satisfaction is for the hedonic. However, in forfeiture situations the explicit-implicit user preference is not based on hedonicutilitarian considerations. The results also suggest the reason for this observed phenomenon. Unlike utilitarian features which consistently showed characteristics of Herzberg's hygiene factors in acquisition-forfeiture situations, hedonic features demonstrated characteristics of Herzberg's motivators only during acquisition, while demonstrating characteristics of hygiene factors during forfeiture. These findings offer interesting theoretical insights and have useful practical implications for product managers of software products.},

Web user experience is an important relatively new field of study. The impact of marketing content and its visual characteristics on perceived intrusiveness is one sub-field which remains under-explored. Effects such as vividness and intensive call-to-action messages are interrupting the cognitive processes and influence web user attitudes towards online environment. Our research contributes to the field of consumer responses to visual intrusive elements in advertising, using real and synthetic advertising content. The technical and quantitative characteristics considered in the current study include: flickering frequency rate, active area and animations. The results revealed an increased influence of connecting animations with other techniques, and identified its influence on cognitive process. The existence of a threshold of flickering frequency and active area size beyond which the content is perceived as intrusive was confirmed. Finally, we use experimental data to propose an objective metrics to evaluate the intrusiveness level of the elements analyzed. The approach can be used to evaluate the negative effect on web users cognitive processes by quantifying certain characteristics of the content. Moreover, it can be used as a reference for similar studies or as an aid for the design of visual content intended to attract web user attention.},

While goals can help people regulate and change behavior, they are less motivating when people no longer believe they can meet their goals. Previous literature suggests that having two goalsa primary goal and a backup goalmight help people continue striving even when the primary goal becomes unattainable. We evaluated this hypothesis and found no direct relationship between two goals and performance. However, people having two goals had higher self-appraisals of their performance than those with one goal. People in the two-goal condition also played more rounds or spent more time in games. However, a high percentage of people stopped playing after achieving their backup goal.

Unexpected, erroneous human interactions often contribute to failures in complex systems. Human factors engineers and researchers have developed taxonomies that allow engineers, designers, and practitioners to think about and model erroneous behavior to improve the safety of human-interactive systems. However, the two leading erroneous behavior taxonomies are based on incompatible phenomenological and genotypical perspectives. Further, neither of these are formulated in terms of task analytic methods, analysis and modeling techniques human factors engineers use for documenting how humans normatively achieve goals when interacting with a system. In this work, we introduce a new erroneous human behavior taxonomy based on where and how human behavior diverges from task analytic models of human behavior. By describing where a human diverges from a normative task, and by identifying what information the human failed to properly attend to that produced the divergence, this taxonomy seeks to unify the phenomenological and genotypical perspectives. We describe the theory behind this taxonomy and the different erroneous behavior classifications that result from it. We then show how it is compatible with the leading phenomenological and genotypical taxonomies. Finally, we discuss the implications of this new taxonomy and avenues of future research.},

This paper addresses a number of challenges HCI designers and researchers deal with when designing digital technologies for older people. We conducted a 5-year research-through-design study, which combined ethnography, participatory design and real-life evaluation, to explore the design and use of technologies aimed to enhance the social life of older people. The paper explores widespread assumptions about the social category of older people and the meaning of technologies for them. This paper argues that assuming that (i) older people have unique needs and interests that set them apart from other user groups and (ii) the meaning of technologies remains unaltered on completion of co-design activities are both problematic, because they do not consider carefully enough the sociocultural contexts in which older people interact and engage in their daily lives. The paper posits that the meaning of technologies for older people and their own identities as individuals of a certain age are shaped within situated communities. Thus, technologies designed for older people should be designed to meet situated and dynamic needs/interests of the communities (and not only of care) to which they belong. We draw upon our findings and other situated epistemological discourses in HCI to introduce a different perspective, a turn to community, in the design of technologies for an ever-increasing ageing population.},

abstract = {Multisensory experience design in the museum context, integrating sound and mid-air haptic.Description of the design and implementation of the multisensory stimuli for visual art (painting).Study of the multisensory experience in an art gallery through questionnaires (2500) and interviews (50).Summary of lessons and implications for future multisensory design and research within HCI. The use of the senses of vision and audition as interactive means has dominated the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) for decades, even though nature has provided us with many more senses for perceiving and interacting with the world around us. That said, it has become attractive for HCI researchers and designers to harness touch, taste, and smell in interactive tasks and experience design. In this paper, we present research and design insights gained throughout an interdisciplinary collaboration on a six-week multisensory display Tate Sensorium exhibited at the Tate Britain art gallery in London, UK. This is a unique and first time case study on how to design art experiences whilst considering all the senses (i.e., vision, sound, touch, smell, and taste), in particular touch, which we exploited by capitalizing on a novel haptic technology, namely, mid-air haptics. We first describe the overall set up of Tate Sensorium and then move on to describing in detail the design process of the mid-air haptic feedback and its integration with sound for the Full Stop painting by John Latham (1961). This was the first time that mid-air haptic technology was used in a museum context over a prolonged period of time and integrated with sound to enhance the experience of visual art. As part of an interdisciplinary team of curators, sensory designers, sound artists, we selected a total of three variations of the mid-air haptic experience (i.e., haptic patterns), which were alternated at dedicated times throughout the six-week exhibition. We collected questionnaire-based feedback from 2500 visitors and conducted 50 interviews to gain quantitative and qualitative insights on visitors experiences and emotional reactions. Whilst the questionnaire results are generally very positive with only a small variation of the visitors arousal ratings across the three tactile experiences designed for the Full Stop painting, the interview data shed light on the differences in the visitors subjective experiences. Our findings suggest multisensory designers and art curators can ensure a balance between surprising experiences versus the possibility of free exploration for visitors. In addition, participants expressed that experiencing art with the combination of mid-air haptic and sound was immersive and provided an up-lifting experience of touching without touch. We are convinced that the insights gained from this large-scale and real-world field exploration of multisensory experience design exploiting a new and emerging technology provide a solid starting point for the HCI community, creative industries, and art curators to think beyond conventional art experiences. Specifically, our work demonstrates how novel mid-air technology can make art more emotionally engaging and stimulating, especially abstract art that is often open to interpretation.},

In this paper we present a computational model of persuasion, which combines the emotional and rational modes. In the proposed approach we simulate the process used by human to persuade someone to perform a given action by combining rational strategies with emotional ones and to adapt them to some user's characteristics. In particular, the system reasons on the strength of alternative (rational and emotional) strategies of persuasion in order to select the most appropriate one. The persuasion model has been used to produce personalized persuasion dialogs in the well-being and healthy eating domains by reasoning on the user's personality traits and living habits.},

Many people are understandably excited by the suggestion that the chemical senses can be digitized; be it to deliver ambient fragrances (e.g., in virtual reality or health-related applications), or else to transmit flavour experiences via the internet. However, to date, progress in this area has been surprisingly slow. Furthermore, the majority of the attempts at successful commercialization have failed, often in the face of consumer ambivalence over the perceived benefits/utility. In this review, with the focus squarely on the domain of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), we summarize the state-of-the-art in the area. We highlight the key possibilities and pitfalls as far as stimulating the so-called lower senses of taste, smell, and the trigeminal system are concerned. Ultimately, we suggest that mixed reality solutions are currently the most plausible as far as delivering (or rather modulating) flavour experiences digitally is concerned. The key problems with digital fragrance delivery are related to attention and attribution. People often fail to detect fragrances when they are concentrating on something else; And even when they detect that their chemical senses have been stimulated, there is always a danger that they attribute their experience (e.g., pleasure) to one of the other senses this is what we call the fundamental attribution error. We conclude with an outlook on digitizing the chemical senses and summarize a set of open-ended questions that the HCI community has to address in future explorations of smell and taste as interaction modalities},

abstract = {From simple vibrations to roles in complex multisensory systems, haptic technology is often a critical, expected component of user experience one face of the rapid progression towards blended physical-digital interfaces. Haptic experience design, which is woven together with other multisensory design efforts, interfaces is now becoming part of many designers' jobs. We can expect it to present unique challenges, and yet we know almost nothing of what it looks like in the wild due to the field's relative youth, its technical complexity, the multisensory interactions between haptics, sight, and sound, and the difficulty of accessing practitioners in professional and proprietary environments. In this paper, we analyze interviews with six professional haptic designers to document and articulate haptic experience design by observing designers' goals and processes and finding themes at three levels of scope: the multisensory nature of haptic experiences, a map of the collaborative ecosystem, and the cultural context of haptics. Our findings are augmented by feedback obtained in a recent design workshop at an international haptics conference. We find that haptic designers follow a familiar design process, but face specific challenges when working with haptics. We capture and summarize these challenges, make concrete recommendations to conquer them, and present a vision for the future of haptic experience design.},

abstract = {Our poor understanding of the connection between haptic effect engineering using controllable parameters like frequency, amplitude and rhythm and how sensations are comprehended by end-users hinders effective design. Haptic facets (categories of attributes that characterize collection items in different ways) are a way to describe, navigate and analyze the cognitive frameworks by which users make sense of qualitative and affective characteristics of haptic sensations. Embedded in tools, they will provide designers and end-users interested in customization with a road-mapped perceptual and cognitive design space. We previously compiled five haptic facets based on how people describe vibrations: physical, sensory, emotional, metaphoric, and usage examples.Here, we report a study in which we deployed these facets to identify underlying dimensions and cross-linkages in participants' perception of a 120-item vibration library. We show that the facets are crosslinked in people's minds, and discuss three scenarios where the facet-based organizational schemes, their linkages and consequent redundancies can support design, evaluation and personalization of expressive vibrotactile effects. Finally, we report between-subject variation (individual differences) and within-subject consistency (reliability) in participants' rating and tagging patterns to inform future progress on haptic evaluation. This facet-based approach is also applicable to other kinds of haptic sensations and even other modalities, and can inform multimodal experience design through a descriptive design language shared between different modalities.

abstract = {Smartphone cameras are increasingly used for document capture in daily life. To understand user behaviors, we performed two studies: (1) an online survey (n=106) to understand general smartphone camera usage behaviors related to information capture, as well as participants' experiences of orientation errors, and (2) a controlled lab study (n=16) to understand detailed document capture behaviors and to identify patterns in orientation errors. According to our online survey, 79.30% of the respondents reported experiencing orientation errors during document capture. In addition, our lab study showed that more than 90% of landscape capture tasks result in incorrect orientation. To solve this problem, we systematically analyzed the user behavior during document capture (e.g., video sequences and photographs taken or hand grip used) and propose a novel solution called ScanShot, which detects document capture time to help users correct orientation errors. ScanShot tracks the direction of gravity during document capture and monitors the users rotational or tilting movements of to update changes in orientation automatically. Our results confirm that document capture with 93.44% accuracy; in addition, our orientation update mechanism can reduce orientation errors by 92.85% using a gyroscope (for rotation) and 81.60% using an accelerometer (for micro-tilts). HighlightsWe study user behavior of document capturing using mobile camera by online study (n=106) and in-lab experiment (n=16).We analyze the erroneous orientation problem during document photo capturing.We propose a technique devised for inferring the user's document capture intention.We device two methods for correcting orientation errors while document capturing.The proposed methods show that more than 80% of error are be corrected.},

abstract = {Virtual citizen science platforms allow non-scientists to take part in scientific research across a range of disciplines. What they ask of volunteers varies considerably in terms of task type, variety, user judgement required and user freedom, which has received little direct investigation. A study was performed with the Planet Four: Craters project to investigate the effect of task workflow design on both volunteer experience and the scientific results they produce. Participants' feedback through questionnaire responses indicated a preference for interfaces providing greater autonomy and variety, with free-text responses suggesting that autonomy was the more important. This did not translate into improved performance however, with the most autonomous interface not resulting in significantly better performance in data volume, agreement or accuracy compared to other less autonomous interfaces. The interface with the least number of task types, variety and autonomy resulted in the greatest data coverage. Agreement, both between participants and with the expert equivalent, was significantly improved when the interface most directly afforded tasks that captured the required underlying data (i.e. crater position or diameter). The implications for the designers of virtual citizen science platforms is that they have a balancing act to perform, weighing up the importance of user satisfaction, the data needs of the science case and the resources that can be committed both in terms of time and data reduction. Citizen science participants prefer task designs with greater variety and autonomy.This does not translate into better performance for either data quality or quantity.Simpler task designs led to a greater volume of data being produced.Interfaces that afforded the most direct capture of data led to better quality data.Trade-offs exist between data volume and accuracy and between preference and productivity.},

abstract = {Although high cognitive demand conditions can impair psychological, physical, and behavioral processes without appropriate management, current measurement methods are too cumbersome for continuous monitoring of cognitive demand, and do not account for individual differences. This research uses keystroke and linguistic markers of typed text to construct individualized models of cognitive demand response to discriminate high and low cognitive demand conditions, the results of which can have implications for design of cognitive demand monitoring systems for personalized health management. We constructed within-subject models of cognitive demand response for nine participants and one between-subjects model based on 20 participants. The AUCs for personalized models ranged from 0.679 to 0.953 (Mean=0.826, SD=0.085), significantly higher than chance (p&lt;0.0001) and the 0.714 AUC for the generic model (p=0.002). Although the features in each model were different, the most common features across models are rate of negative emotion, lexical diversity, rate of words over six letters, and word count. These results confirm significant individual differences in cognitive demand response and suggest that those developing measurement methods used in a monitoring system should consider adaptation to individual characteristics. Our research operationalizes the effects of cognitive demand on HCI and contributes a unique combination of text and keystroke features used to detect high cognitive demand situations. An unobtrusive approach is proposed for classifying high cognitive demand conditions using typing and language features.Individualized models of high cognitive demand response are significantly more accurate than a generic model.Individualized models show significant interpersonal differences in the response to high cognitive demand.},

abstract = {The use of desktop technologies, opposed to their mobile counterparts, is still predominant in the business domain and daily corporate activities. For complex business tasks, the usability of mobile applications is still perceived as inferior. Nevertheless, mobile computing could support work activities in different ways. This research seeks to explore whether mobile applications, especially sophisticated real-time groupware such as Group Decision Support Systems can match or even outperform their desktop-based counterparts regarding task performance and user satisfaction. To provide a more comprehensive comparison, two widely used web metric frameworks, HEART and PULSE (the former focusing on human behavior and the latter focusing on technology), have been used to evaluate and compare a web-based mobile group decision support app with its desktop counterpart on a chair-led multi-step decision-making process in lab settings and real-world contexts. Moreover, data from web tracking tools and system logs of these two apps have been analyzed to deepen the level of analysis. Therefore, an innovative methodology for usability research combining lab experiments with long-term web observations is proposed. The results have shown that users interacting with the mobile version of the system had a steeper learning curve than users interacting with the desktop one. After a short practice period, participants using the mobile version of the groupware could perform as efficiently as participants using its desktop counterpart. Not only both the mobile and the desktop version of the app were used effectively for the group decision tasks chosen for this study, but also the two versions of the application were rated similarly in terms of user satisfaction. Furthermore, the mobile version had a faster adoption, better engagement, and better retention than its desktop counterpart. Despite an additional groupware middleware layer and a sophisticated user interface rendering layer, both groupware versions have yielded a user-to-user response time sufficient for real-time group interactions. These results convey important implications: as society is quickly moving towards mobile computing, web-based mobile technologies can now support multi-step group decision-making tasks. A comprehensive comparative evaluation of mobile and desktop GDSS is presented.The mobile can match the desktop on task performance after brief practicing.The mobile performed better on user adoption, engagement, and retention.The integration of the mobile with popular social media systems is deemed useful.Web-based real-time mobile groupware can now support group decision-making tasks.},

Where Digital presentation of media are displayed during face-to-face encounters. Work has shown that displaying media when co-present with a stranger can help to support conversation. However, existing work considers social media as a raw resource, using algorithmic matching to identify shared topics between individuals, presenting these as text. Therefore, we do not know how users would choose digital media to represent themselves to others or how they would wish it to be displayed. This is important, as existing work fails to take into account the rich practices around how users choose to represent themselves on-line to others, and the implications if unwanted data are disclosed. Through a two-part study 32 participants designed a digital representation of themselves that could be presented to strangers in face-to-face interaction. We then studied how these were employed. Our results found that users prefer more social, rich and ambiguous content to present, the majority of which comes from outside existing social and digital media services. The use of ambiguous content helping to both sustain conversation, and being used as a way to control disclosure of information. By considering two display technologies (HMD and Smartwatch) we are also able to decouple the role of the visualisation from how it is displayed, identifying how showing the visualisation can help in the conversation. A study of face-to-face interaction augmented with user curated content.Individuals often choose media outside existing social media services.Ambiguity in media supports richer face-to-face interaction.Conversation is used to manage disclosure of ambiguous media.Augmentations are used throughout the conversation.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose several approaches for automatic annotation of natural science spreadsheets using a combination of structural properties of the tables and external vocabularies. During the design process of their spreadsheets, domain scientists implicitly include their domain model in the content and structure of the spreadsheet tables. However, this domain model is essential to unambiguously interpret the spreadsheet data. The overall objective of this research is to make the underlying domain model explicit, to facilitate evaluation and reuse of these data.We present our annotation approaches by describing five structural properties of natural science spreadsheets, that may pose challenges to annotation, and at the same time, provide additional information on the content. For example, the main property we describe is that, within a spreadsheet table, semantically related terms are grouped in rectangular blocks. For each of the five structural properties we suggest an annotation approach, that combines heuristics on the property with knowledge from external vocabularies. We evaluate our approaches in a case study, with a set of existing natural science spreadsheets, by comparing the annotation results with a baseline based on purely lexical matching.Our case study results show that combining information on structural properties of spreadsheet tables with lexical matching to external vocabularies results in higher precision and recall of annotation of individual terms. We show that the semantic characterization of blocks of spreadsheet terms is an essential first step in the identification of relations between cells in a table. As such, the annotation approaches presented in this study provide the basic information that is needed to construct the domain model of scientific spreadsheets. HighlightsWe describe five structural properties of scientific spreadsheet tables.Within a spreadsheet table, semantically related terms are grouped in blocks.We annotate tables using information on their structure and external vocabularies.Including information on table structure improves annotation of spreadsheet terms.We identify relations within a table by semantically categorizing blocks of terms.},

A two-way ANOVA test was conducted to analyze the effects of self-disclosure and reciprocity on user satisfaction with a conversational agent. The interactional effect of self-disclosure and reciprocity on user satisfaction was not significant, but the main effects proved to be both significant. PLS analysis results showed that perceived trust and interactional enjoyment are significant mediators in the relationship between communication variables and user satisfaction. In addition, reciprocity is a stronger variable than self-disclosure in predicting relationship building between an agent and a user. Finally, user satisfaction is an influential factor of intention to use. These findings have implications from both practical and theoretical perspective.},

It can help providing the right level of challenge and hence enhance engagement. However, there is a lack of understanding of game balancing design and how different game adjustments affect player engagement. This understanding is important for the design of balanced physical games. In this paper we report on how altering the game equipment in a digitally augmented table tennis game, such as the table size and bat-head size statically and dynamically, can affect game balancing and player engagement. We found these adjustments enhanced player engagement compared to the no-adjustment condition. The understanding of how the adjustments impacted on player engagement helped us to derive a set of balancing strategies to facilitate engaging game experiences. We hope that this understanding can contribute to improve physical activity experiences and encourage people to get engaged in physical activity. HighlightsWe study the effects of game adjustments on game balancing and player engagement.We study how digital technology can be used as a resource for game balancing.Dynamic adjustments enhance player engagement more than static ones.Game adjustments can moderate the influence of a player on the other's performance.Game balancing design strategies are outlined.},

In a first study we designed two sets of web pages, differing in layout style and content, to systematically and independently vary on both unity and variety via the design factors contrast and symmetry (for unity) and dissimilarity of elements and colourfulness (for variety). It was demonstrated that only the sets based on symmetry and colourfulness resulted in independent manipulations of unity and variety, respectively. These two sets of web pages were tested in Study 2 showing that, as predicted, both unity and variety independently and positively influence aesthetic appreciation. Following the principle of Unity-in-Variety, simultaneously maximizing unity and variety leads to an optimal balance where aesthetic appreciation is highest. Our research lends further support to the principle of Unity-in-Variety, extends it to the domain of HCI, and provides directions on how to purposefully design for an optimal balance between unity and variety. We experimentally tested the aesthetic principle of Unity-in-Variety.Webpages were manipulated in unity and variety through four design factors.Symmetry and colourfulness independently influence, respectively, unity and variety.Unity and variety both positively contribute to aesthetic appreciation.Websites simultaneously maximizing unity (i.e., symmetry) and variety (i.e., colourfulness) received highest aesthetic appreciation ratings.},

abstract = {Visual cues relating to an interrupted task can help people recover from workplace interruptions. However, it is unclear whether visual cues relating to their next steps in a primary task may help people manage interruptions. In a previous intensive care unit simulation study, Grundgeiger et al. (2013) found that nurses performing equipment checks were more likely to defer an interruption from a colleague if they could see the next steps of their task on the equipment screen. We abstracted some elements of the simulation study into a controlled laboratory study to test whether visual cues support interruption management. Participants' primary task was to verify a set of linked arithmetic equations presented on a computer page. From time to time, an animated virtual character interrupted the participant to mimic a social interruption, and the participant chose whether or not to defer a response to the interruptions until they finished their page of equations. In four experiments, the independent variable was visual cue (cue versus no cue) and the primary outcome was the proportion of interruptions from the character that the participant deferred so that she or he could complete the page of equations. Experiment 1 (in English) suggested that the visual cue made participants more likely to defer the interruption. However, a potential confound noted in Experiment 1 was eliminated in Experiment 2 (also in English) and the effect of the visual cue disappeared. Experiment 3 (in German) tested a different way to remove the confound and replicated the results of Experiment 2. Finally Experiment 4 (in German) restored the confound and replicated the results of Experiment 1. Participants decisions to defer interruptions can depend on apparently minor properties of their primary task. Visual cues about upcoming primary tasks may encourage people to defer interruptions.In four experiments we tested the role of cues vs. no cues during the interruption lag.Cues were confounded with a greater opportunity to make progress in the primary task.Deferrals were no more frequent with cues vs. no cues if confound was removed.Interruptionmanagement microstrategies revealed sensitivity to time or memory costs.},

abstract = {This paper describes an approach to using physical-digital appropriation for navigation, piggybacking off the humble, ubiquitous barcode to facilitate cheap, scalable indoor wayfinding. We illustrate the technique by describing a prototype interface for navigating to specific books within a library. Our designBookMarkprovides visitors to the library with a detailed map to any desired book by simply scanning the barcode on the back of any other book in the library. After describing in detail how our technique is achieved, we move on to show its effectiveness via an in-situ experiment in which we compare our design to standard methods of library navigation. We then present the results of a longitudinal evaluation where we deploy the BookMark application to library visitors for a period of 24 months. We conclude with a discussion of our overall results, what our design means for other pervasive infrastructures, and how best to design for the future of physical-digital appropriation. Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted HighlightsProvides a novel approach to indoor navigation by appropriating existing infrastructure.Demonstrates the viability of the approach via a two-year deployment.Discusses benefits of the technique, and implications for future designs.},

abstract = {This work introduces Smart-Pockets, a new set of whole-body gesture recognition techniques that enables users to access their personal digital content efficiently for visualization on ambient displays. Smart-Pockets works by recognizing users' body-deictic gestures entailing access to their pockets, for which associations between specific pockets and personal digital content anchored to those pockets has been managed a priori. The pocket metaphor that we explore in this work enables links to digital content using physical personal containers (i.e., pockets) placed at convenient locations on the user's body, containers that have been specifically devised over decades of fashion design to store and carry people's personal belongings comfortably and conveniently. Consequently, Smart-Pockets gestures are fast, require absolutely no precision to perform effectively, and are robustly recognized in user-independent scenarios with absolutely no training required from the user of the ambient display. Also, the Smart-Pockets technique is flexible and easily extensible to other physical containers, such as bags and hand-held objects, which we demonstrate in the form of Smart-Containers. We evaluate the accuracy of several techniques for recognizing Smart-Pockets access gestures, for which we report +99% accuracy for user-independent classification and explicit segmentation. We discuss users' kinematic performance with Smart-Pockets and Smart-Containers and show that the average pocket access time of 2.2s is comparable to the average production time of touch gestures on smart mobile devices and is much smaller than the time required to produce other whole-body gestures. Beyond their practical implications for advancing knowledge in gesture-based interface design for ambient interactions, we believe that the contributions introduced by the Smart-Pockets concept will also foster new developments by pointing the community attention toward (i) more examination of the potential of a new class of whole-body gestures, i.e., body-deictics, (ii) more attention toward how users access their personal digital content on public displays, an important preliminary step before actual interaction, and (iii) inspiring work in the community to examine new and creative associations between users' physical personal objects and their digital content visualized on ambient displays. HighlightsSmart-Pockets is a new technique to access personal digital content on ambient displays.The pocket metaphor creates the link between physical objects and personal digital content.Smart-Pockets employ a new type of hybrid deictic and body-deictic gestures.Smart-Pockets actions are fast to perform (2.2s) and robustly recognized (+99%).The Smart-Pockets concept is flexible and extendable to Smart-Containers.},

abstract = {The under-reporting of public safety incidents is a long-standing issue. In this paper, we propose a computational cognitive modeling approach to understand and design a mobile crowdsourcing system for improving campus safety reporting. In particular, we adopt drift-diffusion models (DDMs) from cognitive psychology to investigate the effect of various factors on users reporting tendency for public safety. Our lab experiment and online study show consistent results on how location context impacts people's reporting decisions. This finding informs the design of a novel location-based nudge mechanism, which is tested in another lab experiment with 84 participants and proved to be effective in changing users reporting decisions. Our follow-up interview study further suggests that the influence of people's mobility patterns (e.g., expected walking distance) could explain why the nudge design is effective. Our work not only informs the design of mobile crowdsourcing for public safety reporting but also demonstrates the value of applying a computational cognitive modeling approach to address HCI research questions more broadly. A computational cognitive modeling approach is used to study crowdsourcing decisions.Location context and crime severity impact people's safety reporting decisions.A novel location-based nudge mechanism is created and proved to be effective.},

abstract = {Collecting annotated activity data is vital to many forms of context-aware system development. Leveraging a crowd of smartphone users to collect annotated activity data in the wild is a promising direction because the data being collected are realistic and diverse. However, current research lacks a systematic analysis comparing different approaches for collecting such data and investigating how users use these approaches to collect activity data in real world settings. In this paper, we report results from a field study investigating the use of mobile crowdsourcing to collect annotated travel activity data through three approaches: Participatory, Context-Triggered In Situ, and Context-Triggered Post Hoc. In particular, we conducted two phases of analysis. In Phase One, we analyzed and compared the resulting data collected via the three approaches and user experience. In Phase Two, we analyzed users recording and annotation behavior as well as the annotation content in using each approach in the field. Our results suggested that although Context-Triggered approaches produced a larger number of recordings, they did not necessarily lead to a larger quantity of data than the Participatory approach. It was because many of the recordings were either not labeled, incomplete, and/or fragmented due to the imperfect context detection. In addition, recordings collected by the Participatory approach tended to be more complete and contain less noise. In terms of user experience, while users appreciated automated recording and reminders because of their convenience, they highly valued having the control over what and when to record and annotate that the Participatory approach provided. Finally, we showed that activity type (Driver, Riding as Passenger, Walking) influenced users behaviors in recording and annotating their activity data. It influenced the timing of recording and annotating using the Participatory approach, users receptivity using the Context-Triggered In Situ approach, and the characteristics of the content of annotations. Based on these findings, we provide design and methodological recommendations for future work that aims to leverage mobile crowdsourcing to collect annotated activity data. The Participatory approach produced high-quality annotated activity data.User burden and control are two crucial aspects for sustaining user compliance.Activity affects recording and annotation timing and characteristics of annotations.Activity affects users receptivity when using the Context-Triggered approach.We offer suggestions on the approaches, tools, and instructions to collect activity.},

abstract = {Reliable weather estimation traditionally requires a dense network of meteorological measurement stations. The concept of participatory sensing promises to alleviate this requirement by crowdsourcing weather data from an ideally very large set of participating users instead. Participation may involve nothing more than downloading a corresponding app to enable the collection of such data, given that modern smartphones contain a plethora of weather-related sensors. To understand the potential of participatory sensing for weather estimation, and how humans can be put in the loop to further improve such sensing, we created Atmos a crowdsourcing weather app that not only periodically samples smartphones sensors for weather measurements, but also allows users to enter their own estimates of both current and future weather conditions. We present the results of a 32-month public deployment of Atmos on the Google Play Store, showing that a combination of both types of sensing results in accurate temperature estimates, featuring an average error rate of 2.7C, whereas when using only user inputs, the average error rate drops to 1.86C. Sensor readings revealed significant variations during users commuting times.User inputs were more accurate in estimating actual temperature than sensor inputs.Bagged decision trees with user reported temperature achieved the lowest error rate.A 32-month public deployment on Google Play Store.},

abstract = {Although emergency services have already recognized the importance of citizen-initiated activities during disasters, still questions with regard to the coordination of spontaneous volunteers and their activities arise. Within our article, we will present a technological approach based on public displays which aims to foster situated crowdsourcing between affected citizens, spontaneous volunteers as well as official emergency services. We will address the research question: How can the situated tasks performed by spontaneous volunteers be supported by the use of public displays during disasters? First we will present the current state of the art with regard to the coordination practices of spontaneous volunteers and emergency services within disaster situations as well as related problems, potentials and specifics of situated crowdsourcing and public displays. To gain insight into actual coordination practices, we conducted an empirical study with 18 different stakeholders involved in disaster management. Based on the literature review and our empirical study, we have derived a technical concept that supports the task and activity management of spontaneous volunteers as well as the coordination both of the demands of affected people and the offers from spontaneous volunteers. We have implemented our concept as the public display application City-Share, which provides a robust communication infrastructure and encompasses situated crowdsourcing mechanisms for managing offers and demands of activities on-the-ground. Based on its evaluation with several users, we will discuss our findings with regard to the assignment of tasks on-the-ground and situated crowdsourcing during emergencies. We outline that City-Share can improve a community's disaster resilience, especially when focusing on the kind of collaborative resilience emerging between official stakeholders and spontaneous volunteers or affected citizens at a local level.

To this end, we propose a framework that extracts the potential contributors' expertise based on their social media activity and determines incentives for them within the constraint of a budget. This framework does so by preferentially targeting contributors who are likely to offer quality content. We evaluate our framework on Flickr data for the entire city of Barcelona and show that it ensures high levels of task quality and wide geographic coverage, all without compromising fairness.

abstract = {Incentive is crucial to the success of mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems. Over the different manners of incentives, providing monetary rewards has been proved quite useful. However, existing monetary-based incentive studies (e.g., the reverse auction based methods) mainly encourage user participation, whereas sensing quality is often neglected. First, the budget setting is static and may not meet the sensing contexts or user anticipation. Second, they do not measure the quality of data contributed. Third, the design of most incentive schemes is quantity- or cost-focused and not quality-oriented. To address these issues, we propose a novel MCS incentive mechanism called TaskMe. An LBSN (location-based social network)-powered model is leveraged for dynamic budgeting and proper worker selection, and a combination of multi-facet quality measurements and a multi-payment-enhanced reverse auction scheme are used to improve sensing quality. Experiments on several user studies and the crawled dataset validate TaskMe's effectiveness. HighlightsThe dynamic budgeting approach based on spatiotemporal contexts increases the successful completion of tasks.A multi-facet quality measurement method is proposed, where a combination of two factorscompletion ratio and quality indicatorare used for quality measurement.A novel reverse auction mechanism is proposed to enhance quality of sensing.},

We compared a virtual field environment (CAVE Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) and a real field environment (city center of Chemnitz, Germany) in a between-subject-design concerning presence, and evaluate its impact on the usability and the user experience of a geocaching game. The data of 60 participants was analyzed and shows significantly higher ecological validity for the real field environment but higher values for engagement and negative effects in the virtual field environment. Concerning usability, significant differences were verified between the two environments. All presence factors correlated significantly with usability in the CAVE, but did not correlate in the real-field environment. Concerning user experience, the CAVE showed significantly higher hedonic quality values, whereas the real field environment had higher pragmatic quality values. In both conditions presence and user experience factors were partly correlated.

Viewers see another persons actions through the display: gestures, gaze, body movements, and what one is manipulating on the display. Yet we can design even better collaborative transparent displays. First, collaborators on either side should be able to directly interact with workspace objects. Second, and more controversially, both sides should be capable of presenting different content. This affords: reversal of images/text in place (so that people on both sides see objects correctly); personal and private territories aligned atop each other; and GUI objects that provide different visuals for feedthrough vs. feedback. Third, the display should visually enhance the gestural actions of the person on the other side to better support workspace awareness.

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as a persuasive technology for attitude and behavior change. This paper considers Terror Management Theory (TMT), one of the notable theories that have not been considered so far in persuasive technology, and aims at exploring its use in VR experiences. First, we show that a VR experience can be used to effectively elicit mortality salience (MS), which makes TMT applicable. Then, we evaluate the effects of the VR experience on attitudes towards risk. Wearing a head-mounted display (HMD), participants explored one of two virtual environments (VEs). In a first group of participants, the VE represented a cemetery with MS cues like tombs and burial recesses. In a second group of participants, the MS cues were removed, and the VE looked like a public park. Results show that the MS cues manipulation changed the effects of the VR experience on users attitudes towards risk, as TMT would predict. Moreover, results revealed a relationship between MS elicited through VR and physiological correlates of arousal. Finally, we show that user's personality traits can moderate the effects of the VR experience on attitudes towards risk.

abstract = {Double-sided recommendations (DSR) have been recently introduced for an item and a group that the item is destined for. Herein we present an algorithm which takes inspiration from the Social Comparison Theory to recommend items that had an average positive evaluation from other users on the target user's social network. Other users' judgments are weighted according to the influence these users have on the target. Moreover, for each recommended item, we propose a group that encompasses all the target users' contacts who expressed a positive opinion on it.Our data show that users consider double-sided recommendations more useful than traditional recommendations which provide equivalent information. It was observed that our social DSR algorithm performs better in the event recommendation domain than a content-based one which has already been recognised as providing a good performance, in terms of precision, recall, accuracy and F1. This result is strengthened by our demonstrating that the good performance DSRs provide also depends on their peculiar structure and not only on the fact that they include social information. The item-recommendation part also performed better than a user-based collaborative filtering algorithm. Lastly, we found that users' scores for recommended item-group packages can be better predicted by considering only the system scores for the recommended groups, at least in the domain of social and cultural events. HighlightsDSR are suggestions made of an item and a group with whom that item can be consumed.We propose a DSR algorithm using information from the target user's social network.The DSR algorithm performs better than a user-based CF one in suggesting items.In the event domain our DSR algorithm outperforms a traditional, content-based one.Users seem to focus on the suggested group when assessing DSR in the event domain.},

abstract = {We propose a set of algorithms to detect navigation problems in real-time. To do so, we operationalise some navigation strategies suggested by the literature and investigate the extent to which the exhibition of these strategies is an indicator of navigation problems. Our Firefox extension senses behaviour indicative of a user experiencing interaction problems. Once these problems are detected we can suggest changes to these sites, and eventually adapt the site in real time to better accommodate the user. A remote longitudinal study monitored real website user behaviour, analysing every application event on the client side both individually and in combination. The study was conducted with 34 participants over 400 days totalling 567h of normal usage and with no task restriction. Our sensing algorithms detected 374 issues with a 85% precision for purposeful Web use, suggesting that, indeed, when users search for specific information the exhibition of these strategies indicates the presence of problems. This contribution is novel in that, as opposed to a post-hoc analysis of user interaction, real-time detection of navigation problems at the user end opens up new research avenues in the realm of adaptive interfaces and usability analysis.

abstract = {The Flooded Locations and Simulated Hydrographs (FLASH) project is a suite of tools that use weather radar-based rainfall estimates to force hydrologic models to predict flash floods in real-time. However, early evaluation of FLASH tools in a series of simulated forecasting operations, it was believed that the data aggregation and visualization methods might have contributed to forecasting a large number of false alarms. The present study addresses the question of how two alternative data aggregation and visualization methods affect signal detection of flash floods. A sample of 30 participants viewed a series of stimuli created from FLASH images and were asked to judge whether or not they predicted significant or insignificant amounts of flash flooding. Analyses revealed that choice of aggregation method did affect probability of detection. Additional visual indicators such as geographic scale of the stimuli and threat level affected the odds of interpreting the model predictions correctly as well as congruence in responses between national and local scale model outputs. We discuss the Flooded Locations and Simulated Hydrographs project, a set of models intended for flash flood forecasting.We evaluate the effects on user performance of two data aggregation methods for a flash flood visualization.We demonstrate that signal detection in the tool is related to display method, threat level, and scale of visual distractors.},

abstract = {This paper describes the use of Reinforcement Learning in Immersive Virtual Reality to make a person move to a specific location in a virtual environment. Reinforcement Learning is a sub-area of Machine Learning in which an active entity called an agent interacts with its environment and learns how to act in order to achieve a pre-determined goal. The Reinforcement Learning had no prior model of behaviour and the participants no prior knowledge that their task was to move to and stay in a specific place. The participants were placed in a virtual environment where they had to avoid collisions with virtual projectiles. Following each projectile the agent analysed the movement made by the participant to determine paths of future projectiles in order to increase the chance of driving participants to the goal position and make them stay there as long as possible. The experiment was carried out with 30 participants, 10 were guided towards the leftmost part of the environment, 10 to the rightmost area, and 10 were used as control group where the projectiles were shot randomly throughout the game. Our results show that people tended to stay close to the target area in both the Left and Right conditions, but not in the Random condition. HighlightsWe used of Reinforcement Learning in Immersive Virtual Reality to make a person move to a specific place.The Reinforcement Learning agent had no prior knowledge of human behaviour.People tended to stay near the target area.Reinforcement learning can be used to predict the movements of the people.},

abstract = {The Facebook News Feed prioritizes posts for display by ranking them more prominently in the News Feed, based on users' past interactions with the system. This study investigated constraints imposed on social interactions by the algorithm, by triggering participants' awareness of "missed posts" in their Friends' Timelines that they did not remember seeing before. If the algorithm prioritizes posts from people that users feel closer to and want to stay in touch with, participants should be less likely to report missed posts from close Friends. However, the results showed that relationship closeness had no effect on the likelihood of noticing a missed post, after controlling for how many Facebook Friends participants had and the accuracy of participants' memories for their Friends' Facebook activity. Also, missed posts from close Friends were more surprising, even when participants believed that the actions of the system caused the missed posts, indicating that these instances represent participants' unmet expectations for the behavior of their News Feeds. Because Facebook posts present opportunities for feedback important for social support and maintaining social ties, this could indicate bias in the way the algorithm promotes content that could affect users' ability to maintain relationships on Facebook. These findings have implications for approaches to improve user control and increase transparency in systems that use algorithmic filtering. HighlightsThe study examined how the Facebook News Feed algorithm constrains interaction.Facebook users were prompted to notice posts from Friends that they had missed.Relationship closeness did not affect the likelihood of noticing missed posts.Missed posts from close Friends were more surprising, indicating unmet expectations.Believing the algorithm caused missed posts was related to greater surprise.},

We were interested in how gaze gestures can be enhanced with vibrotactile feedback. We studied the effects of haptic feedback on the head and haptic prompting on the speed of completing gaze gestures. The vibrotactile stimulation was given to the skin of the head through actuators in a sun glass frame. The haptic feedback enabled about 10% faster gaze gestures with more consistent completion times. Longer duration of haptic prompts tended to result in longer duration of gestures. However, the magnitude of the increase was marginal. Our results can inform the design of efficient gaze gesture user interfaces and recognition algorithms.

abstract = {Social isolation, common in old age, leads to a decrease of both physical and psychological skills and, consequently, to a decreased quality of life and even to a higher mortality risk. Social Network Services, like Facebook, have the potential to increase the amount of online and offline social interactions of older adults. However, because of the huge diversity of characteristics of this user group, the lack of inclusive design principles concerning existing Social Network Services, and the inappropriate ways of interaction available, older adults still resist adopting these services. In this paper we present the "You, me &amp; TV", a television-based multimodal Facebook prototype enhanced with TV shows sharing functionalities, a new feature for sharing printed photos, and multiple interaction modalities - remote control, voice and gestures-. We present three in-depth case studies of the use of this prototype by three older adults aged between 65 and 73years with distinct levels of experience using Facebook, during a period between 3 and 6weeks. Results indicate that participants accepted the prototype, rated it highly in terms of usability, and that it improved their interaction with relatives, increasing both online and offline interactions. This was particularly visible for participants that were not Facebook users before the study. We also provide relevant conclusions about the relevancy of photos and how they can easily trigger interactions between older adults and their family, and how using TV as platform for deploying access to Facebook proved to be a contributing factor to their adoption. Finally, we show how adaptation and personalization concepts were perceived and received distinctly among participants. HighlightsWe report a longitudinal study with a TV enhanced Facebook prototype for older adults.TV, multimodal interaction and photos played an important role on adoption.Functionalities related with sharing TV content and printed photos trigger interactions.Preference for alternative modalities when remote control is difficult to use.Increase of online and offline interaction with family by previous non Facebook users.},

abstract = {Location-aware Augmented Reality (AR) applications are often argued to provide users with immersive experiences that are situated in the real world. Immersion, which can be seen as a form of cognitive and emotional absorption, has been asserted to promote enjoyment, engagement in a task and even learning. However, such claims remain largely unsubstantiated due to the lack of validated instruments for measuring users' immersion in location-based AR environments. Attempts to develop validated instruments for evaluating immersion have been few and non-systematic, while existing instruments are oriented towards measuring immersion in the context of non-AR digital games. At the same time, studies seeking to operationalize and measure immersion are still inconclusive; even though immersion is considered as a multi-level psychological construct, it is not yet clear whether there is multidimensionality in each level or not. The present study describes the development and validation of the ARI Augmented Reality Immersion questionnaire: an instrument for measuring immersion in AR location-aware settings. To achieve this goal, a multi-step process was employed to develop and validate a novel instrument; analyses included exploratory factor analysis with 202 high school students, followed by a confirmatory factor analysis with 162 high school students. This multi-step process resulted in a 21-item, seven-point Likert-type instrument with satisfactory construct validity, which is based on a multi-leveled model of immersion with multidimensionality in each level. We argue that the ARI questionnaire, as a validated and tested measurement, can be highly useful for researchers and designers in the field of location-based AR. A novel questionnaire for measuring immersion in location-based AR is presented.The ARI questionnaire has been shown to have satisfactory reliability and validity.The data suggest a hierarchical and multi-level model of immersion.The questionnaire can establish participants' immersion level in location-based AR.The ARI questionnaire can contribute to improved location-aware AR designs.},

abstract = {At present, there is a growing need for assisting living systems for the elderly. This type of technology must meet certain accessibility and usability requirements to be adopted successfully. Speech-based interfaces represent a very attractive option for improving the usability and acceptability of assistive technologies for elderly users because they provide a very easily accessible interface and also facilitate paralinguistic analysis of the user's voice to provide valuable information about their emotional and mental states while interacting with a computer system. This information can be used to improve the quality of the interaction between the assistive system and its user. In this study, we propose a method based on the automatic recognition of acoustic paralinguistic phenomena for estimating the quality of speech-based interactions. The proposed method automatically recognizes paralinguistic phenomena (e.g., shouting, hyper-articulation, and hesitation) during the interaction between the user and the system. The interaction is then characterized based on the occurrence of these phenomena. A model is trained using this characterization, which can estimate the quality of the interaction. Using this method, we obtained good recognition performance (F-measure around 70%) when classifying paralinguistic phenomena and there was also a strong correlation between the estimated quality of the interaction metrics and the quality of the interaction metrics reported by the users of an assistive system. The proposed method is useful for automatically estimating the quality of interactions perceived by users and it could support the construction of speech-based systems to adapt and personalize content as well as the style of the interaction with the user.

The results confirm the short-term influence of expectations on users' evaluations of both usability and enjoyment of the service after three weeks of real-life use. Users' evaluations of their experiences mediated the influence of expectations on behavioral intentions.

Using advanced Factor Analysis methods on the self-reported privacy behaviors and feature awareness of 308 Facebook users, we extrapolate six distinct privacy management strategies, including: Privacy Maximizers, Selective Sharers, Privacy Balancers, Self-Censors, Time Savers/Consumers, and Privacy Minimalists and six classes of privacy proficiency based on feature awareness, ranging from Novices to Experts. We then cluster users on these dimensions to form six distinct behavioral profiles of privacy management strategies and six awareness profiles for privacy proficiency. We further analyze these privacy profiles to suggest opportunities for training and education, interface redesign, and new approaches for personalized privacy recommendations. We show that Facebook users' privacy behaviors and awareness are multi-dimensional.Feature awareness is a significant predictor of Facebook users' privacy behaviors.Six unique user profiles emerged to reveal different privacy management strategies.Six privacy proficiency profiles emerged from the dimensions of feature awareness.The privacy profiles can be used to personalize user education and nudging.},

abstract = {Three experiments are reported in which objective measures and subjective ratings of schematic metro map usability were investigated. Experiment 1 used a within-subjects design to compare octolinear and curvilinear Paris Metro maps. This replicated and extended Roberts et al. (2013); the curvilinear map was associated with faster journey planning times, and yet preference between the two was unrelated to this measure. In Experiment 2, nine matched versions of the London Underground map were rated for usability and attractiveness, and a clear octolinear bias was displayed. It was also possible to identify individuals who held a simplicity theory of effective design, versus an octolinearity theory. Experiment 3 investigated the relationship between usability ratings and journey planning times for three Berlin network maps, all optimized for simplicity of line trajectories. No differences in times were found, and yet usability ratings after experience at using the maps differed significantly, in line with the findings for the London designs in Experiment 2. Overall, the dissociation between objective measures of performance and subjective ratings of usability is robust, and appears to reflect expectations and prejudices concerning effective design. The octolinearity as a gold standard conjecture for achieving optimum usability continues to be refuted. Dissociation between objective and subjective measures of usability is demonstrated.Octolinearity as a gold standard conjecture is refuted.Usability and attractiveness ratings are collected in a large scale usability study.Intuitive theories of design are identified.},

abstract = {Interactive technology for dogs is on the rise with there now being a whole TV channel supplying videos for dogs as well as several examples of interactive technology designed for the purpose of 'entertaining' dogs and other pet mammals. The Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) research field has moved into the study of such technologies having earlier focussed mainly on technologies for working animals where there are two main stakeholders, the dogs and the humans, and where there is an expectation often, that the dog is doing a certain task. In studies of what might be referred to as entertainment interaction, there is a need to understand what, if anything, attracts a dog's attention whilst being mindful that where the only real stakeholder is the dog, there may be some methodological considerations in regards to the level of control and the level of autonomy given to the dog in such studies. This paper presents a study of dogs' attention between three screens to explore the movement of attention between screens, and between videos in a relatively uncontrolled research environment. The study demonstrates that the method used, which was to be as 'dog-centred' as possible, yielded useful data. For the design community it is shown that the dogs were seen to attend mainly to a favoured screen (left and centre in this case) and three of the videos appeared to be preferred over the others. A method to test dogs viewing habits, favouring and following between three screens.When dogs are presented with three screens they do not have a media preference.Dogs have very low mean attention time to video demonstrating a preference to glance rather than focus.When confronted with three screens the dogs prefer to watch nothing over all of the videos shown.},

abstract = {The increased involvement of animals in digital technology and user-computer research opens up for new possibilities and forms of interaction. It also suggests that the emerging field of Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) needs to reconsider what should be counted as interaction. The most common already established forms of interaction are direct and dyadic, and limited to domesticated animals such as working dogs and pets. Drawing on an ethnography of the use of mobile proximity sensor cameras in ordinary wild boar hunting we emphasize a more complex, diffuse, and not directly observable form of interaction, which involves wild animals in a technological and naturalistic setting. Investigating human and boar activities related to the use of these cameras in the light of Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and Goffman's notion of strategic interaction reveals a gamelike interaction that is prolonged, networked and heterogeneous, in which members of each species is opposed the other in a mutual assessment acted out through a set of strategies and counter-strategies. We stress the role of theory for the field of ACI and how conceptualizations of interaction can be used to excite the imagination and be generative for design. Seeing interaction as strategies and acknowledging the existence of complex interdependencies could potentially inspire the design of more indirect and non-dyadic interactions where a priori simplifications of design challenges as either human or animal can be avoided. We present an ethnography of the use of mobile proximity sensor cameras in boar hunting.We stress the role of theory in Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) and discuss the concept of interaction.We show how Actor-Network Theory (ANT) and strategic interaction can be combined to reveal and account for interactions that are indirect, heterogeneous, prolonged, and networked.We introduce concepts such as ontological symmetry, delegation, and program and anti-program, and show how interaction can be understood as strategies.We discuss how the theoretical foundations offered by ANT and strategic interaction can be generative in ACI design.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate social dimensions of technology use in human-animal interactions, through a study of interactive systems at the zoo.Zoos are a familiar place for encounters between humans and non-domesticated animals. Accordingly, we examine zoos as a significant site to extend research into animal-computer interaction (ACI). We present a case study that examines the deployment and use of new digital technologies that intervene in, and influence, human-animal relationships.The paper reports on interactive systems in use at Melbourne Zoo. The study investigates the use and impact of technology in the course of human-animal encounters, including how human use of technology in this setting shapes encounters in subtle ways. We examine five interactive systems used by visitors (Digital Signs and the Zoopermarket), by zoo personnel with visitors (Educator Screens and Volunteer iPads), and by zoo personnel with animals (Apps for Apes).Our work draws broad insights for the design and understanding of animal-human-computer interaction at the zoo, as a catalyst for further research into this site of considerable significance to animal-computer interaction. We identified four key themes in the ways that interactive systems are intervening in human-animal encounters at the zoo. Firstly, interactive technology at the zoo risks distracting from visitors' encounters with animals. Secondly, the appearance and use of technology moreover runs counter to expectations of naturalistic zoo landscapes. Thirdly, interactive systems however offer opportunities to enhance important aspects of visitors' experience of animal encounters, and to widen the temporal and spatial dimensions of the encounter. Finally, we interpret these insights by examining how technology is used in the context of interactions between numerous human and animal actors, and in a setting impacted by complex social and organisational forces. From this, we identify the need for ACI to consider technology use by diverse people and animals; that multiple interactions may occur at once; the diverse social activities that may surround human-animal interactions; the distributed form of interactions between multiple participants; and the performative nature of some human-animal encounters. Zoos offer a site to study technology as part of complex human-animal interactions.Technology shapes human-animal encounters in subtle ways.Design needs to accommodate diverse human and animal participants.Human-animal interactions may be distributed or entail multiple interactions.Interactions occur as part of social activities and can involve performance.},

abstract = {This paper describes a canine posture detection system composed of wearable sensors and instrumented devices that detect the postures sit, stand, and eat. The system consists of a customized harness outfitted with wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and a base station for processing IMU data to classify canine postures. Research in operant conditioning, the science of behavior change, indicates that successful animal training requires consistent and accurate feedback on behavior. Properly designed computer systems excel at timeliness and accuracy, which are two characteristics most amateur trainers struggle with and professionals strive for. Therefore, in addition to the system being ergonomically designed to ensure the dog's comfort and well-being, it is engineered to provide posture detection with timing and accuracy on par with a professional trainer. We contend that providing a system with these characteristics will one day aid dogs in learning from humans by overcoming poor or ineffective timing during training. We present the initial steps in the development and validation of a computer-assisted training system designed to work outside of laboratory environments.The main contributions of this work are (a) to explore the trade-off between low-latency responses to changes in time-series IMU data representative of posture changes while maintaining accuracy and timing similar to a professional trainer, and (b) to provide a model for future ACI technologies by documenting the user-centered approach we followed to create a computer-assisted training system that met the criteria identified in (a). Accordingly, in addition to describing our system, we present the results of three experiments to characterize the performance of the system at capturing sit postures of dogs and providing timely reinforcement. These trade-offs are illustrated through the comparison of two algorithms. The first is Random Forest classification and the second is an algorithm which uses a Variance-based Threshold for classification of postures. Results indicate that with proper parameter tuning, our system can successfully capture and reinforce postures to provide computer-assisted training of dogs.},

abstract = {The emerging discipline of Animal-Computer Interaction (ACI) aims to take what in Interaction Design is known as a user-centred approach to the design of technology intended for animals, placing them at the centre of the design process as stakeholders, users, and contributors. However, current regulatory frameworks for the involvement of animals in research are not animal-centred, regarding them as research instruments, unable to consent to procedures that may harm them, rather than consenting research participants and design contributors. Such frameworks aim to minimise the impacts of research procedures on the welfare of individual animals, but this minimisation is subordinated to specific scientific and societal interests, and to the integrity of the procedures required to serve those interests. From this standpoint, the universally advocated principles of replacement, reduction and refinement aim to address the ethical conflicts arising from the assumed inability of individual animals to consent to potentially harmful procedures, but such principles in fact reflect a lack of individual centrality.This paper makes the case for moving beyond existing regulations and guidelines towards an animal-centred framework that can better support the development of ACI as a discipline. Firstly, recognising animal welfare as a fundamental requirement for users and research participants alike, the paper articulates the implications of a welfare-centred ethics framework. Secondly, recognising consent as an essential requirement of participation, the paper also defines criteria for obtaining animals' mediated and contingent consent to engaging with research procedures. Further, the paper argues for the methodological necessity, as well as the ethical desirability, of such an animal-centred framework, examining the boundaries of its applicability as well as the benefits of its application. Finally, the paper puts forward a series of practical principles for conducting ACI research, which imply but also essentially exceed the welfare and ethics requirements of current regulatory frameworks. Propose an animal-centred ethical framework to support ACI development.Articulate the implications of a welfare-centred ethical approach.Define criteria for obtaining animals' mediated and contingent consent.Put forward a series of practical principles for conducting ACI research.},

abstract = {Working dogs perform a variety of essential services for their human partners, from assisting people with disabilities, to Search and Rescue, police, and military work. Recent interest in the nascent field of Animal-Computer Interaction has prompted research in computer-mediated technology for communication between working dogs and their handlers. Haptic (touch) interfaces in the form of vibrating motors are a promising approach for handler-to-dog communication. Haptic interfaces can provide a silent, long-range method of sending commands to a dog, when voice or hand signals are inappropriate or impossible. However, evaluating haptic interfaces for dogs, who cannot self-report sensations, creates interesting challenges. This study draws on human-computer interaction concepts, such as Just Noticeable Difference, to explore methods and issues in evaluating haptic interfaces for working dogs. We created a haptic system and developed an evaluation method, reporting results for ten dogs of widely varying breeds, sizes, and coat types. Provides a new method to evaluate haptic interfaces, solving the inability of dogs to self-report.Addresses how to mitigate the "Clever Hans" effect through double blind and randomized studies.Stresses the importance of training "reporting" behavior to reliable haptic cues.},

Short links are often included on printed materials so that people using mobile devices can quickly enter URLs. Although mobile transcription is a common use-case, link-shortening services generate output that is poorly suited to entry on mobile devices: links often contain numbers and capital letters that require time consuming mode switches on touch screen keyboards. With the aid of computational modeling, we identified problems with the output of a link-shortening service, bit.ly. Based on the results of this modeling, we hypothesized that longer links that are optimized for input on mobile keyboards would improve link entry speeds compared to shorter links that required keyboard mode switches. We conducted a human performance study that confirmed this hypothesis. Finally, we applied our method to a selection of different non-word mobile data-entry tasks.

abstract = {Emerging augmented reality displays provide high fidelity overlays onto real-world environments to enable navigation efficiency. The accuracy of these systems, however, is highly contingent on monitoring and registering user orientations and landmark locations. No data exist, however, regarding ranges at which registration error reliably influences user behavior and trust. The present experiments examined the influence of directional error in a simulated navigation guidance system on path efficiency and user trust. In three experiments, participants (N=90) navigated an urban desktop virtual environment with the assistance of an overlaid beacon depicting the direction and distance of a target landmark. Directional error was introduced into the beacon across trials, manipulated in 15° increments from 0° to 60° (Experiment 1), 5° increments from 0° to 20° (Experiment 2), and 1° increments from 6° to 10° (Experiment 3). Users show tolerance for up to approximately 8° angular direction error without significantly reducing path efficiency or user trust in system reliability. They also show reduced path efficiency emerging at lower angular errors (approximately 9°) relative to influences on perceived trust (approximately 16-20°). Results provide some basic heuristics for error tolerance, demonstrate important dissociations between the objective versus perceived impact of error in navigation displays, and contribute to theoretical positions regarding the optimization of global awareness and spatial knowledge acquisition. Experiments examined how registration error impacts navigation performance and trust.A beacon-based aid supported navigation through a large urban virtual environment.The navigation aid displayed varying degrees of angular/registration error.Registration error differently impacts navigation performance versus user trust.Navigation impacted by 9° of angular error, trust impacted by 16° of angular error.},

abstract = {Exergames are videogames based on full-body interaction that foster physical exercise during gameplay. Much research has focused on whether exergames foster sufficient physical activity and with which intensity they do so. This is usually measured through energy expenditure and compared to traditional physical activities such as sports or physical education exercises. However, little research has been undertaken on the quality of the physical activity, understood not as how well the movement is done, but as the richness and diversity of physical activity defined by experts, such as diverse types of motor skills (jumps, turns, pivots, manipulative actions, etc) and diverse types of conditioning capabilities (endurance, stretch, general strength, coordination, etc.). Hence, exergames typically address only aerobic (cardiovascular) activity and other types tend to be ignored. In this paper we propose a method for analyzing the types of physical activity (quality) that an exertion interface elicits. We propose this method as an analytical tool which can provide key information to categorize exergames, aid to their design and help designers make sure they achieve game mechanics that elicit the desired types of physical activity. We describe the method through the analysis of two exergames that we developed in the past for our exertion interface for children, called the Interactive Slide. We present the results of a systematic observational method, until now used mainly in sports analysis, which is based on applying sequential body movement analysis to obtain the play characteristics of 48 children. These results -action events and time-based patterns- typify the movement found in the two aforementioned exergames for this platform. We have found significant movement differences between the two, as well as some differences associated to age. Moreover, we show that sequential body movement analysis, which has already been successfully used in the past to analyze sports, can also be effective in analyzing exergames and hence allow grounded discussion on health issues related to their use. We present the results of a systematic observational method to obtain the play characteristics.We give an interaction design strategy to improve the quality of physical activity with exergames.We show that sequential body movement analysis can be effective in analyzing exergames.},

abstract = {Virtual reality trainers are educational tools with great potential for laparoscopic surgery. They can provide basic skills training in a controlled environment and free of risks for patients. They can also offer objective performance assessment without the need for proctors. However, designing effective user interfaces that allow the acquisition of the appropriate technical skills on these systems remains a challenge. This paper aims to examine a process for achieving interface and environment fidelity during the development of the Virtual Basic Laparoscopic Surgical Trainer (VBLaST). Two iterations of the design process were conducted and evaluated. For that purpose, a total of 42 subjects participated in two experimental studies in which two versions of the VBLaST were compared to the accepted standard in the surgical community for training and assessing basic laparoscopic skills in North America, the FLS box-trainer. Participants performed 10 trials of the peg transfer task on each trainer. The assessment of task performance was based on the validated FLS scoring method. Moreover, a subjective evaluation questionnaire was used to assess the fidelity aspects of the VBLaST relative to the FLS trainer. Finally, a focus group session with expert surgeons was conducted as a comparative situated evaluation after the first design iteration. This session aimed to assess the fidelity aspects of the early VBLaST prototype as compared to the FLS trainer.The results indicate that user performance on the earlier version of the VBLaST resulting from the first design iteration was significantly lower than the performance on the standard FLS box-trainer. The comparative situated evaluation with domain experts permitted us to identify some issues related to the visual, haptic and interface fidelity on this early prototype. Results of the second experiment indicate that the performance on the second generation VBLaST was significantly improved as compared to the first generation and not significantly different from that of the standard FLS box-trainer. Furthermore, the subjects rated the fidelity features of the modified VBLaST version higher than the early version. These findings demonstrate the value of the comparative situated evaluation sessions entailing hands on reflection by domain experts to achieve the environment and interface fidelity and training objectives when designing a virtual reality laparoscopic trainer. This suggests that this method could be used successfully in the future to enhance the value of VR systems as an alternative to physical trainers for laparoscopic surgery skills. Some recommendations on how to use this method to achieve the environment and interface fidelity of a VR laparoscopic surgical trainer are identified. We design a VR laparoscopic trainer that mimics an existing physical box trainer.We compare two system prototypes to the accepted standard in training basic laparoscopic skills.We use comparative situated evaluation with domain experts to improve the system fidelity.System performance is not significantly different from the accepted standard.We provide design recommendations to achieve fidelity for a VR surgical trainer.},

abstract = {Computer-assisted navigation systems coupled with surgical interfaces (SIs) are providing doctors with tools that are safer for patients compared to traditional methods. Usability analysis of the SIs that guides their development is hence important. In this study, we record the eye movements of doctors and other people with no medical expertise during interaction with an SI that directs a simulated cryoablation task. There are two different arrangements for the layout of the same SI, and the goal is to evaluate whether one of these arrangements is ergonomically better than the other. We use several gaze related statistics some of which are employed in an SI design context for the first time. Even though the performance and gaze related analysis reveals that the two arrangements are comparable in many respects, there are also differences. Specifically, one arrangement leads to more saccades along the vertical and horizontal directions, lower saccade amplitudes in the crucial phase of the task, more locally clustered and yet globally spread viewing. Accordingly, that arrangement is selected for future use. The present study provides a proof of concept for the integration of novel gaze analysis tools developed for scene perception studies into the interface development process. Two arrangements for a surgical interface (SI) are developed using design principles.Doctors &amp; laypeople perform SI-guided simulated cryoablation while gaze is recorded.Saccades in cardinal directions are more likely with one arrangement.Spatial fixation distributions at different temporal scales support the same arrangement.Design and evaluation with eye movements measures produce better SIs.},

Currently this knowledge is not usually reported to players as feedback, although sometimes it is already used as an analysis tool. This paper presents a novel technology for automatically generating linguistic reports and immediate feedback from actions performed by players during play sessions. These reports allow developers to provide players with a more complete and personalized feedback about their behaviors, abilities, attitudes, skills or movements. In order to show and explore the possibilities of this new technology, we have incorporated it in the core of a computer game. We have evaluated positively that the incorporation of this kind of feedback into the core of YADY computer game allows us to improve the overall player experience. HighlightsThe new technology is based on monitoring and analyzing the actions of players in computer games.It provides to players and researchers with immediate and global linguistic reports.It is suited for understanding actions at different levels of user expertise and human-computer interaction.We present an application for the linguistic description of player activity in a simple 2D computer game.This application will be used for improving player experience in computer games.},

abstract = {As many users who are charged with process monitoring need to focus mainly on other work while performing monitoring as a secondary task, monitoring systems that purely rely on visual means are often not well suited for this purpose. Sonification, the presentation of data as (non-speech) sound, has proven in several studies that it can help in guiding the user's attention, especially in scenarios where process monitoring is performed in parallel with a different, main task. However, there are several aspects that have not been investigated in this area so far, for example if a continuous soundscape can guide the user's attention better than one that is based on auditory cues. We have developed a system that allows reproducible research to answer such questions. In this system, the participants' performance both for the main task (simulated by simple arithmetic problems) and for the secondary task (a simulation of a production process) can be measured in a more fine-grained manner than has been the case for existing research in this field. In a within-subject study (n=18), we compared three monitoring conditions - visual only, visual + auditory alerts and a condition combining the visual mode with continuous sonification of process events based on a forest soundscape. Participants showed significantly higher process monitoring performances in the continuous sonification condition, compared to the other two modes. The performance in the main task was at the same time not significantly affected by the continuous sonification. HighlightsWe present a system for reproducible research in sonification for process monitoring.We developed an experiment design to analyze effectiveness in monitoring as secondary task.We compared continuous sonification to visual-only and auditory alerts.Continuous sonification significantly enhances the adequacy of interactions.Participants find continuous sonification significantly more helpful and reassuring.},

abstract = {Animated pedagogical agents (APAs) have frequently been used as a powerful addition to learning environments, since APAs have been known to facilitate learning. APAs can present various features, such as voice, movements, gestures and pointing, and researchers have sought to verify specifically which features of agents effectively contribute to learning. Previous studies have studied these features by comparing different degrees of agent embodiment in the evaluation of the image effect (i.e., students learn more when learning systems have visual APAs), the embodied agent effect (i.e., fully embodied agents that deliver instruction aurally and use gestures to improve learning outcomes in text-only learning systems), the modality effect (i.e., oral instruction contributes to the learning process), and the expressiveness effect (i.e., fully embodied agents promote more effective learning than static ones). Some of these studies have investigated the image, embodied agent and modality effects in the same learning environment, but they were not the same studies that investigated the expressiveness effect. The expressiveness effect allows us to separate the movements of the agent from its other features, such as the agent's image, so investigating this effect is as important as investigating the other effects. We are not aware of any studies that investigated all of these four effects within the same learning system, nor that evaluated any of these effects in language learning environments. Accordingly, this paper describes the design, implementation, and analysis of an APA designed to evaluate the abovementioned effects. The APA was integrated into a computer-assisted language learning (CALL) system to teach English as a foreign language to Brazilian students. A total of 72 Brazilian undergraduate students were divided into four groups, each of which used a different version of the APA in the same CALL system: no agent, a voice-only agent, a static agent, or a fully embodied agent. We compared students' gain scores (i.e., difference between pre- and posttest scores) across groups to evaluate each of the four effects. Though the outcomes of our study supported the presence of the embodied agent and modality effects, we were not able to demonstrate the image or expressiveness effects in the experiment. Our results indicate that the voice of the agent might contribute more positively to learning than movements, gestures and pointing. HighlightsWe investigated degrees of APA embodiment in CALL systems.We implemented a CALL system and an Animated Pedagogical Agent for Brazilian students.Gain scores from using different APA versions were compared to analyze agent effects.Modality and Embodied Effects were found, Image and Expressiveness Effects were not.},

abstract = {Interactions in micro-neurosurgical operating rooms form a complex orchestration of labor and information flows. In the center, there is the focus on patient safety and outcome quality in shortest possible time, while a neurosurgeon is fully focused on the task using a surgical microscope. To guarantee a successful outcome, maintaining a high level of situation awareness (SA) is essential. Suspension of action due to instrument exchange, interaction with a device, or communication affects information flows and collaboration. Situation awareness underlies these interactions. To further understand the mechanisms of SA, we used observations and interviews to gain insight into interactions in micro-neurosurgical theaters. We describe behaviors and strategies exhibited to maintain the interaction flow, in particular, between the scrub nurse and the surgeon. Results show how interactions based on action prediction and active observation within the well-organized environment are influenced, both positively and negatively, by the reliance of the work on the microscope. From this understanding, we discuss the opportunities in future technologies and interfaces for supporting situation awareness maintenance in operating rooms. HighlightsSituation awareness in neurosurgery is influenced by extensive use of microscope.Nurses develop proactive strategies and roles to deal with challenging environment.Bottlenecks and potential weak links are discovered.The notion of situation awareness is expanded by proactive action beyond perception.Implications for new interactive technologies are presented.},

Situation awareness, and the design of systems to support it, has been a focus in recent emergency management research. In this paper, we introduce two interventions to the core processes of information processing and information sharing in emergency response teams to analyze their effect on the teams' situation awareness: (1) we enrich raw incoming information by adding a summary of the information received, and (2) we channel all incoming information to a central coordinator who then decides upon further distribution within the team. The effect of both interventions is investigated through a controlled experiment with experienced professional responders. Our results show distinctly different effects for information enrichment and centralization, both for the teams and for the coordinators within the team. While the interaction effects of both conditions cannot be discerned, it is apparent that processing non-enriched information and non-centralized information sharing leads to a worse overall team situation awareness.

abstract = {The ever more pervasive 'informationalization' of crisis management and response brings both unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Recent years have seen the emergence of attention to ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) in the field of Information and Communication Technology. However, disclosing (and addressing) ELSI issues in design is still a challenge because they are inherently relational, arising from interactions between people, the material and design of the artifact, and the context. In this article, we discuss approaches for addressing such 'deeper' and 'wider' political implications, values and ethical, legal and social implications that arise between practices, people and technology. Based on a case study from the BRIDGE project, which has provided the opportunity for deep engagement with these issues through the concrete exploration and experimentation with technologically augmented practices of emergency response, we present insights from our interdisciplinary work aiming to make design and innovation projects ELSI-aware. Crucially, we have seen in our study a need for a shift from privacy by design towards designing for privacy, collaboration, trust, accessibility, ownership, transparency etc., acknowledging that these are emergent practices that we cannot control by design, but rather that we can help to design for-calling for approaches that allow to make ELSI issues explicit and addressable in design-time.

The main aims of the survey were to explore the attitudes expressed by emergency service staff towards social media for private and organizational use as well as the levels and main factors influencing the current and likely future use of social media in their organizations. Based on our results, we discuss possible enhancements of the emergency management cycle using social media. We did a survey with 761 emergency service staff across 32 European countries.The majority of emergency services has positive attitudes towards social media.It is more used to share information (44%) than to receive messages (19%).A future increase is expected (74%), even more for organizations already using it.There is a huge gap between rhetoric (66%) and reality (23%) in social media use.},

abstract = {The spreading of devices and applications allowing people to collect personal information opens new opportunities for Personal Informatics. Although many of these tools are already effectively used by motivated people to gain self-knowledge and produce change in their behaviors, there is a great number of users that are potentially interested in Personal Informatics but do not know of its potentialities and criticalities. In order to investigate how users perceive and use self-tracking tools in everyday life, we conducted a diary study, requiring fourteen participants with no previous experience in Personal Informatics to use a variety of trackers. We discovered that they use and perceive these technologies differently from the ones experienced in self-tracking. Participants considered the act of collecting personal information burdensome, with no beneficial reward. We also uncovered a series of problems that they experienced while tracking, managing, visualizing, and using their data. Among them we found that the lack of suggestions on using data and the excess of abstract visualization in the apps prevented users to gain useful insights. As a result, their interest in self-tracking soon faded, despite their initial curiosity in exploring and "playing" with their data. Starting from the findings of this study, we identified seven design strategies to better Personal Informatics tools, supported by literature and examples that draw from different research fields, from tangible interfaces, to virtual environments and video games. These strategies are primarily addressed to satisfy the inexperienced users' needs, but their applicability can be reasonably extended to all the individuals curious and interested in Personal Informatics. We describe how new users curious in PI (na\"{\i}ve users) are different from experienced users.We explore how na\"{\i}ve users use, perceive, and integrate in their daily practices PI tools.We point to the barriers that na\"{\i}ve users may encounter when using PI tools.We identify a new tracking style characterized by discovery and playfulness.We propose new design strategies primarily addressed to satisfy na\"{\i}ve users' needs.},

abstract = {Few teachers include information and communication technology in the classroom, despite their potential for increasing attention and motivation for students. Educational authoring tools are intended to turn teachers into designers and deliverers of technology-enhanced educational content, and increasing the adoption of these tools is a key element for speeding up this transformation. This paper emphasizes the importance of learnability for preventing rejection or abandonment by of such an authoring tool, and how acceptance is deeply affected by the interaction paradigm and the creation metaphor used in the tool. We present an analysis comparing two design paradigms: the widespread menu-based and choice-guided interaction paradigm versus a consistent metaphor with direct manipulation. The latter was implemented in DEDOS-Editor, a novel authoring tool that allows the creation of diverse educational activities that can be performed on different devices, such as PCs, digital blackboards, tablets, and multitouch surfaces. An experimental study shows the tremendous impact that interface choices have on the tool's learning curve. The results provide the first mapping of the choice of a direct-manipulation interface and its effect on the learning curve's entry point, as well as a consistent interaction metaphor with smoother and fast-growing learning curves. This allows users to complete more tasks and gain more knowledge through experience, in contrast to menu-based interfaces. The initial use of the tool is thus made easier for users with no experience or information about the tool, and the advantages of experience and expertize in facing new challenges are facilitating. This work also highlights the appropriateness of learning curves as a tool for measuring learnability. We study the learnability of educational authoring tools for preventing teachers' rejection or abandonment.We evaluate two interaction paradigms of authoring educational tools: menu-based versus direct-manipulation.The interaction paradigm of the authoring tool has an important impact on the tool's learning curve's entry point.A consistent interaction metaphor allows teachers creating educational activities smooth and fast.},

abstract = {Human performance in selection tasks is frequently described by Fitts' law, which states that the average time needed to move to a target and select it is linearly related to the index of difficulty for the task, which is the logarithm of the task characteristic C=A/W, where A is the target distance and W is the target width. The coefficients in this linear relationship can vary across interaction conditions, such as when using distinct interaction devices, and can for instance be used to define throughput, which is a standardized measure to compare interaction conditions. Although Fitts' law has proven very useful in the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) over the past 50 years, there are several issues with Fitts' law that argue in favor of more advanced statistical modeling of experimental data. More specifically, we propose two generalizations of Fitts' law. The first generalization is not to limit the data analysis to average movement times, but to consider the distributions of the observed times instead. The second generalization is to extend Fitts' law to a more general relationship between task characteristics and index of difficulty and to use this generalized model to come up with additional measures that can be used alongside throughput.We use data from an experiment with both selection and tracing tasks to illustrate the proposed analysis method. The primary goal of the experiment is to compare the task performance in four experimental conditions, corresponding to all combinations of interaction device (mouse or pen) and target orientation (horzizontal/vertical versus oblique movements). First, we show that non-linear transformations on the measured task completion times are indeed advised to resolve problems with the normality and homoscedasticity of the data, especially in case of the tracing task. Second, we show that in case of the selection task the data supports a linear relationship between the logarithm of the task characteristic C and the logarithm of the movement time, which corresponds to a power-law between movement time and task characteristic, an alternative to Fitts' law that has previously been proposed by several authors. In case of the tracing task, the data supports a power-law function in between a linear and a logarithmic function. We conclude by demonstrating how multiple performance measures can be used simultaneously when comparing interaction conditions. HighlightsTwo generalizations of Fitts' law: modeling data distributions and modified index of difficultyMulti-model selection is used to compare alternative models for the observed data.Advanced data modeling accomplishes closer data approximation and higher contrasts between conditions.Performance rate measure includes the form of speed-accuracy relationship.},

abstract = {Participatory Design (PD) has been proposed as a useful strategy to address pitfalls in the design of serious games for children with special needs. Nonetheless, methodological weaknesses in the analysis of the results of PD workshops may hinder its effectiveness in providing useful and robust design contributions and facilitating communication in multidisciplinary teams. To address this issue we propose the use of multimodal analysis to evaluate participants' contributions during PD workshops. We present an analysis that was applied in an informant workshop with autistic children, aimed at refining the design of a serious game based on Full-Body Interaction. Results show that multimodal analysis constitutes an effective and coherent method to capture and analyze users' contributions across a wide range of semiotic resources, thus extending the richness of insights that can be derived from a PD workshop and communicated to the rest of the team. Furthermore, the analysis allowed the identification of fundamental design questions, thus offering a robust empirical ground for supporting dialogue and reflection between multiple stakeholders.

abstract = {Although participatory design (PD) is currently the most acceptable and respectful process we have for designing technology, recent discussions suggest that there may be two barriers to the successful application of PD to the design of digital games: First, the involvement of audiences with special needs can introduce new practical and ethical challenges to the design process. Second, the use of non-experts in game design roles has been criticised in that participants lack skills necessary to create games of appropriate quality. To explore how domain knowledge and user involvement influence game design, we present results from two projects that addressed the creation of movement-based wheelchair-controlled video games from different perspectives. The first project was carried out together with a local school that provides education for young people with special needs, where we invited students who use wheelchairs to take part in design sessions. The second project involved university students on a game development course, who do not use wheelchairs, taking on the role of expert designers. They were asked to design concepts for wheelchair-controlled games as part of a final-year course on game design. Our results show that concepts developed by both groups were generally suitable examples of wheelchair-controlled motion-based video games, but we observed differences regarding level of detail of game concepts, and ideas of disability. Additionally, our results show that the design exercise exposed vulnerabilities in both groups, outlining that the risk of practical and emotional vulnerability needs to be considered when working with the target audience as well as expert designers.

abstract = {Eye contact and gaze awareness play a significant role for conveying emotions and intentions during face-to-face conversation. Humans can perceive each other's gaze quite naturally and accurately. However, the gaze awareness/perception are ambiguous during video teleconferencing performed by computer-based devices (such as laptops, tablet, and smart-phones). The reasons for this ambiguity are the (i) camera position relative to the screen and (ii) 2D rendition of 3D human face i.e., the 2D screen is unable to deliver an accurate gaze during video teleconferencing. To solve this problem, researchers have proposed different hardware setups with complex software algorithms. The most recent solution for accurate gaze perception employs 3D interfaces, such as 3D screens and 3D face-masks. However, today commonly used video teleconferencing devices are smart devices with 2D screens. Therefore, there is a need to improve gaze awareness/perception in these smart devices. In this work, we have revisited the question; how to improve a remote user's gaze awareness among his/her collaborators. Our hypothesis is that 'an accurate gaze perception can be achieved bythe '3D embodiment' of a remote user's head gesture during video teleconferencing'. We have prototyped an embodied telepresence system (ETS) for the 3D embodiment of a remote user's head. Our ETS is based on a 3-DOF neck robot with a mounted smart device (tablet PC). The electromechanical platform in combination with a smart device is a novel setup that is used for studying gaze awareness/perception in 2D screen-based smart devices during video teleconferencing. Two important gaze-related issues are considered in this work; namely (i) 'Mona-Lisa Gaze Effect' - the gaze is always directed at the person independent of his position in the room, and (ii) 'Gaze Awareness/Faithfulness' - the ability to perceive an accurate spatial relationship between the observing person and the object by an actor. Our results confirm that the 3D embodiment of a remote user head not only mitigates the Mona Lisa gaze effect but also supports three levels of gaze faithfulness, hence, accurately projecting the human gaze in distant space.

abstract = {The challenge of moving past the classic Window Icons Menus Pointer (WIMP) interface, i.e. by turning it '3D', has resulted in much research and development. To evaluate the impact of 3D on the 'finding a target picture in a folder' task, we built a 3D WIMP interface that allowed the systematic manipulation of visual depth, visual aides, semantic category distribution of targets versus non-targets; and the detailed measurement of lower-level stimuli features. Across two separate experiments, one large sample web-based experiment, to understand associations, and one controlled lab environment, using eye tracking to understand user focus, we investigated how visual depth, use of visual aides, use of semantic categories, and lower-level stimuli features (i.e. contrast, colour and luminance) impact how successfully participants are able to search for, and detect, the target image. Moreover in the lab-based experiment, we captured pupillometry measurements to allow consideration of the influence of increasing cognitive load as a result of either an increasing number of items on the screen, or due to the inclusion of visual depth.Our findings showed that increasing the visible layers of depth, and inclusion of converging lines, did not impact target detection times, errors, or failure rates. Low-level features, including colour, luminance, and number of edges, did correlate with differences in target detection times, errors, and failure rates. Our results also revealed that semantic sorting algorithms significantly decreased target detection times. Increased semantic contrasts between a target and its neighbours correlated with an increase in detection errors. Finally, pupillometric data did not provide evidence of any correlation between the number of visible layers of depth and pupil size, however, using structural equation modelling, we demonstrated that cognitive load does influence detection failure rates when there is luminance contrasts between the target and its surrounding neighbours. Results suggest that WIMP interaction designers should consider stimulus-driven factors, which were shown to influence the efficiency with which a target icon can be found in a 3D WIMP interface. Bottom-up features impact visual search in a 3D pictures folder.Semantic sorting facilitates target detection.Depth and visual aides do not impact target detection.No more fixations in depth after three visible layers of items.},

abstract = {Dyslexia is a learning disability characterised by problems with accurate or fluent word recognition, poor decoding, and poor spelling abilities. Although several studies have addressed dyslexia and Web accessibility, less is known about how dyslexia affects information search. This study investigated whether the inclusion of icons in search user interfaces enhances performance among dyslexics. A total of 21 dyslexics and 21 controls completed 52 search tasks in 4 conditions: icons only, words only, and both icons and words in a grid layout and a list layout, while eye movements were recorded. Dyslexics took significantly longer than controls to locate targets in tasks containing text, but not in the icon-only condition. Dyslexics had longer fixation durations than controls in both icon and text based search arrays, suggesting higher mental load associated with search tasks generally. The addition of words to icon arrays led to faster search times within controls, but not dyslexics. Dyslexics also exhibited more fixations on dual-modality tasks, and longer scanpaths than controls in list layout. Both groups were fastest searching the list layout, with icons and words listed in columns. Results are discussed in terms of the design of accessible search interfaces for dyslexic users, taking into account mental load of dual-modality information display, and the arrangement of search items. Empirical data is provided for the design of accessible search results interfaces for dyslexics. HighlightsDyslexics are generally slower in visual search arrays containing text.Including icons in arrays seems distracting for both dyslexics and controls.Including icons in lists seems beneficial to performance generally.Content mode and layout interact to effect search performance in dyslexia.},

Clustering based on voice recordings resulted in stories that were perceived as most easy to read, and to make most sense, by parents in a quantitative evaluation. This method was implemented in the live system, which was developed and evaluated iteratively at a second special needs school with children with different usage profiles.

abstract = {Experiencing stress during training is a way to prepare professionals for real-life crises. With the help of feedback tools, professionals can train to recognize and overcome negative effects of stress on task performances. This paper reports two studies that empirically examined the effect of such a feedback system. The system, based on the COgnitive Performance and Error (COPE) model, provides its users with physiological, predicted performance and predicted error-chance feedback. The first experiment focussed on creating stressful scenarios and establishing the parameters for the predictive models for the feedback system. Participants (n=9) performed fire-extinguishing tasks on a virtual ship. By altering time pressure, information uncertainty and consequences of performance, stress was induced. COPE variables were measured and models were established that predicted performance and the chances on specific errors. In the second experiment a new group of participants (n=29) carried out the same tasks while receiving eight different combinations of the three feedback types in a counterbalanced order. Performance scores improved when feedback was provided during the task. The number of errors made did not decrease. The usability score for the system with physiological feedback was significantly higher than a system without physiological feedback, unless combined with error feedback.This paper shows effects of feedback on performances and usability. To improve the effectiveness of the feedback system it is suggested to provide more in-depth tutorial sessions. Design changes are recommended that would make the feedback system more effective in improving performances. A model-based feedback system is applied to a low-fidelity ship simulator.Three feedback types are provided separately or combined during a stressful simulator task.Performance on a stressful low-fidelity simulator task increases when feedback is provided.Participants prefer physiological feedback over non-physiological feedback.},

abstract = {While stereoscopic content can be compelling, it is not always comfortable for users to interact with on a regular basis. This is because the stereoscopic content on displays viewed at a short distance has been associated with different symptoms such as eye-strain, visual discomfort, and even nausea. Many of these symptoms have been attributed to cue conflict, for example between vergence and accommodation. To resolve those conflicts, volumetric and other displays have been proposed to improve the user's experience. However, these displays are expensive, unduly restrict viewing position, or provide poor image quality. As a result, commercial solutions are not readily available. We hypothesized that some of the discomfort and fatigue symptoms exhibited from viewing in stereoscopic displays may result from a mismatch between stereopsis and blur, rather than between sensed accommodation and vergence. To find factors that may support or disprove this claim, we built a real-time gaze-contingent system that simulates depth of field (DOF) that is associated with accommodation at the virtual depth of the point of regard (POR). Subsequently, a series of experiments evaluated the impact of DOF on people of different age groups (younger versus older adults). The difference between short duration discomfort and fatigue due to prolonged viewing was also examined. Results indicated that age may be a determining factor for a user's experience of DOF. There was also a major difference in a user's perception of viewing comfort during short-term exposure and prolonged viewing. Primarily, people did not find that the presence of DOF enhanced short-term viewing comfort, while DOF alleviated some symptoms of visual fatigue but not all. Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted HighlightsBuilt a gaze-contingent depth-of-field (DOF) simulation for virtual reality.DOF contributes to compelling depth for non-stereoscopic displays for young adults.DOF simulation did not improve visual comfort and reduced perceived image quality.Older adults were more tolerant to DOF than young adults in terms of viewing comfort.However, adding DOF to 3D displays improved subjective measures of visual fatigue.},

abstract = {Because users treat embodied agents (EAs) as social actors, users hold expectations about human-to-EA communication (HtEAC) similar to those in human-to-human communication. This study extends Expectancy Violations Theory (EVT) to examine how different forms of interfaces that confirm or violate user expectations affect the communication process, social judgments, ability to influence, and accuracy of recall associated with HtEAC. Positive violations of expectancy are acts or characteristics of the EA that are unexpected but evaluated favorably by the human partner. Results suggest that when the EA deviates from expectations, effects on the HtEAC process and related outcomes can be more pronounced. EAs evaluated as positive violations had more favorable effects on task attractiveness than other human or EA interaction partners. As predicted by EVT, EA interactions that were positively evaluated elicited more perceived connectedness, feelings of being understood/receptivity, and dependability than those EA interactions evaluated negatively. However, negative violations did not produce worse outcomes than negative confirmations. EVT offers a useful lens for examining the communication effects of HtEAC and points to benefits of creating EAs that evoke positive violations of expectancy.},

abstract = {Linking a symbol to the object it represents is a skill that develops gradually over the first few years of life. However, prior work shows that frequent use of this capacity makes it unintuitive for adults to recognize it as a challenge for young children. We hypothesized that this disconnect would manifest in software interfaces designed for young children, such that applications would embed symbols that the target audience would fail to understand. We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 34 preschoolers between the ages of 2 and 5 to assess their ability to work with user interface elements that require symbolic mappings. In particular, we assessed, (1) symbolic progress bars and (2) demonstrations of touch interactions by an on-screen cartoon hand. We found that these techniques are entirely inaccessible for children under 3 and that they require specific design choices to facilitate understanding in children between the ages of 3 and 5. Among a sample of 94 popular apps targeting children in this age range, we found that these symbolic techniques are incorporated into 44% of apps for preschoolers. We further found that embellishing symbolic elements with visual detail, a common practice in apps for preschoolers, increases children's cognitive burden and is an additional barrier to performing the symbolic mappings necessary to use these interfaces. We present design alternatives that make these prevalent user interface elements accessible to this user group. Display Omitted},

abstract = {In this study, we investigated the effects of context-sensitive distraction warnings on drivers' in-car glance behaviors and acceptance. The studied prototype warning application functions on a smart phone. The novelty of the application is its proactive and context-sensitive approach to the adjustment of warning thresholds according to the estimated visual demands of the driving situation ahead. In our study, novice and experienced drivers conducted in-car tasks with a smart phone on a test track with and without the warnings. The application gave a warning if the driver's gaze was recognized to remain on the smart phone over a situation-specific threshold time, or if the driver was approaching a high-demand part of the track (an intersection or a tight curve). Glance metrics indicated a significant increasing effect of the warnings on glance time on road while multitasking. The effect varied between 5% and 30% increase depending on the in-car task. A text message reading task was the most visually demanding activity and indicated the greatest effect of the warnings on glance time on road. Driving experience did not have an effect on the efficiency of the warnings. The proposed gaze tracking with current smart phone technology proved to be highly unreliable in varying lighting conditions. However, the findings suggest that location-based proactive distraction warnings of high-demanding driving situations ahead could help all drivers in overcoming the inability to evaluate situational demands while interacting with complex in-car tasks and to place more attention on the road. Furthermore, survey results indicate that it is possible to achieve high levels of trust, perceived usefulness, and acceptance with these kinds of context-sensitive distraction warnings for drivers. Context-sensitive distraction warnings had a positive effect on drivers' behaviors.The warnings significantly increased glance time on road, especially while reading a text message.The level of driving experience did not seem to affect the efficiency of the warnings.Location-based warnings worked more reliably than glance duration based warnings.The context-sensitive warning application was well accepted by the drivers.},

However, it becomes more difficult for a new-to-market e-store with no established familiarity. While extant literature suggests the use of interactivity and personalization features offered by e-stores to reduce consumers' risk perceptions and improve trustworthiness of such stores, there is little guidance on the level of feature provision required to enhance consumer satisfaction in making product selections from a new and unfamiliar e-store. The authors explore this issue in an online experiment with 273 subjects browsing 4 websites offering identical products but with variable levels of interactivity and personalization features. Findings reveal a positive association between the level of feature provision and browser decision-making outcomes. However, interactivity features are more effective for maximizers, whereas personalization ones are more effective for satisficers. We examine the case of first time visitors encountering a new e-store.It shows how website features of a new e-store shape their browsing outcomes.We test the impact of task-facilitative tools for utilitarian browsing purposes.Users respond differently to a fixed choice set when we change levels of the tools.Usage of tools also varies according to their individual maximizing tendencies.},

abstract = {One of robot designers' main goals is to make robots as sociable as possible. Aside from improving robots' actual social functions, a great deal of effort is devoted to making them appear lifelike. This is often achieved by endowing the robot with an anthropomorphic body. However, psychological research on the perception of animacy suggests another crucial factor that might also contribute to attributions of animacy: movement characteristics. In the current study, we investigated how the combination of bodily appearance and movement characteristics of a robot can alter people's attributions of animacy, likability, trustworthiness, and unpleasantness. Participants played games of Tic-Tac-Toe against a robot which (1) either possessed a human form or did not, and (2) either exhibited smooth, lifelike movement or did not. Naturalistic motion was judged to be more animate than mechanical motion, but only when the robot resembled a human form. Naturalistic motion improved likeability regardless of the robot's appearance. Finally, a robot with a human form was rated as more disturbing when it moved naturalistically. Robot designers should be aware that movement characteristics play an important role in promoting robots' apparent animacy. HighlightsMovement characteristics influenced the robot's animacy, likability, and unpleasantness.Baxter was considered to be more likeable when it exhibited naturalistic motion.A full-bodied robot executing mechanistic movement was considered particularly inanimate.A full-bodied robot executing naturalistic movements was particularly unpleasant.},

Using our experiences with these designs we highlight three key strategies to guide designers in the creation of richer exertion game experiences: designing a temporal trajectory through games with reference to the way exertion changes over time, designing for the inevitable and not necessarily negative effects of pain in exertion games, and designing for the highly socially situated nature of exertion gaming. Over-focus on health outcomes may lead to a narrow focus in exertion game design.Exertion game designers can learn from sports and entertainment to make better games.4 case studies of our sports and entertainment inspired exertion games.From these we present 3 design strategies for the creation of exertion games.(1) Design exertion trajectories (2) use pain (3) work with the social nature of exertion.},

abstract = {This research conceptualizes mobile application usability and develops and validates an instrument to measure the same. Mobile application usability has attracted widespread attention in the field of human-computer interaction because well-designed applications can enhance user experiences. To conceptualize mobile application usability, we analyzed Microsoft's mobile usability guidelines and defined 10 constructs representing mobile application usability. Next, we conducted a pilot study followed by a quantitative assessment of the content validity of the scales. We then sequentially applied exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis to two samples (n=404; n=501) consisting of German consumers using mobile social media applications on their smartphones. To evaluate the confirmatory factor model, we followed a step-by-step process assessing unidimensionality, discriminant validity and reliability. To assess the nomological validity of our instrument, we examined the impact of mobile application usability on two outcomes: continued intention to use and brand loyalty. The results confirmed that mobile application usability was a good predictor of both outcomes. The constructs and scales associated with mobile application usability validated in this paper can be used to guide future research in human-computer interaction and aid in the effective design of mobile applications. We created a new instrument to measure mobile usability.The instrument has been adapted from Microsoft's usability guidelines.The instrument can be used in future research and practitioner studies.},

abstract = {Visual and auditory stimuli are frequently used for information communication on mobile devices. These feedback modalities, however, are less suitable for emerging wearable devices that are intended to support multitasking with minimum interruption. Use of vibrotactile stimuli is great alternatives due to their low disruption and high ability to attract attention.Currently, effective vibration notifications are still elusive. In the present study, we explored a vibration notification mechanism by using a singular vibration motor to generate various vibration stimuli. This solution is appropriate for existing wearable devices that have a small form factor, limited internal space, and low battery capacity. Our first experiment investigated individuals' vibration perception in order to select a set of vibration stimuli that were detectable and discriminable. In our second experiment, we mapped the 5 vibration stimuli that were identified in the first experiment to various mobile application events and evaluated user performance using a wrist mounted prototype device. Results indicate that our vibration notification design achieved an average response accuracy rate of 82.3% (SD=18.0%) and an average response time of 2.83 (SD=0.83)s. Moreover, results of the post-test questionnaire revealed that the average perceived usefulness towards the vibration notification design was rated 5.5 (SD=1.18) and the average perceived ease of use was rated 5.0 (SD=1.36) when using a 7-point rating scale. Overall, results indicated the present vibration notification design was perceived as useful and highlighted opportunities for improving perceptions of ease of use. Our findings inform the design of future vibration notifications on wearable devices and highlight the importance of increasing pair-wise dissimilarities, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use in designing effective vibration notifications. We investigated the critical factors of and their effects on human vibration perception.We evaluated empirical vibration designs for information communication and compared user performance across designs.We developed a vibration notification mechanism on a wrist mounted prototype for novice users.We conducted an experiment to measure pair-wise discriminability of a larger set of vibration stimuli, and based on this experiment, selected a smaller set of vibration stimuli with the highest discriminability for our design.Based on survey responses, we selected the 5 mobile applications that were ranked as having the highest priorities for receiving notification events, and then we associated specific vibration stimuli for alerting events to the selected mobile applications.We conducted another experiment to evaluate user performance when using our final vibration notification design on a wrist mounted prototype device.Most individuals discriminated 4-5 vibrations based on perceived intensity and perceived durationIncreasing vibration discriminability can increase the accuracy in recognizing vibration-coded information},

Such applications have the potential to influence the likelihood of individuals experiencing 'serendipity', through a combination of information, context, insight and activity. This study reports the deployment of a system that sends push text suggestions to users throughout the day, where the content of those messages is informed by users' experience and interests. We investigated the responses to and interactions with messages that varied in format and relevance, and which were received at different times throughout the day. Sixteen participants were asked to use a mobile diary application to record their experiences and thoughts regarding information that was received over a period of five consecutive days. Results suggest that participants' perception of the received suggestions was influenced by the relevance of the suggestion to their interests, but that there were also positive attitudes towards seemingly irrelevant information. Qualitative data indicates that participants, if in an appropriate time and place, are willing to accept and act upon push suggestions as long as the number of suggestions that they receive is not overwhelming. This study contributes towards an understanding of how mobile users make connections with new information, furthering our understanding of how serendipitous connections and insightful thinking could be accommodated using technology. Tailored text messaging applied to a connection-making framework.'Irrelevant' text messages appeared to be positively perceived by participants.Suggestions' phrasing did not influence participants' responses on the suggestions.Unexpectedness involves location, memories, familiarity and non-familiarity.We propose a connection-making model and framework for design.},

abstract = {One key role of urban informatics is to understand demands, challenges, and opportunities for major infrastructure projects in a bottom-up format. In this respect, engaging citizens through communication tools available in Social Web, and distilling micro-knowledge distributed among them appear to be reliable and promising streams. Chaotic nature and large size of unstructured big-data gathered in this way, and semantic barriers for understanding and classifying the content are among other difficulties which challenge efficiency and effectiveness of such methods. This paper suggests a specific form of collective intelligence, which can be described as 'collective classification', as a strategy and employs crowdsourcing as a tool to overcome such difficulties. We explain crowdsourcing in form of a Game With A Purpose, designed and run by University of Toronto between June and August of 2013. The game aimed to classify the content of online feeds in the context of sustainability of infrastructure projects, and to form a folksonomy for decoding the future communication. Players of the game were provided with 'sustainability' (at a holistic view covering its three main pillars: economy, environment, and society) as the context, a set of relevant tweets as items to be annotated, and a set of indicators developed in the domain literature as a template to follow. On top of the predefined indicators, the participants were allowed to suggest and create their own classes. Players' inputs were used in scoring other players' performance and this refined the results by drawing on the 'Wisdom of the Crowd'. The core contribution of the research is to use human computation in a bottom-up approach to solve a transdisciplinary problem which traditionally has been tackled via top-down solutions. As an example, taxonomies created by domain professionals are normally biased towards professionals; such traditional solutions normally lack context-sensitivity in nature, constructivism in approach, and pluralism in perspective. The method and the platform presented by this paper can be directly applied in similar studies to benchmark, classify, and fine-tune public perspective/knowledge in urban infrastructure related technical or semi-technical issues. Crowdsourcing offered as an approach to collect users perspective on infrastructure.Collective intelligence to build a folksonomy for sustainability of infrastructure.Users with relevant technical background: low in size and high in credibility/accuracy.Increasing quality of outputs happens at the cost of decreasing participation rate.Separating and highlighting experts' products creates bias towards using them.},

These differences were also observed to exist between our male and female volunteers, along with additional differences in the amount of touch pressure applied to the screen.Results are discussed in terms of linking behavioural and physical biometrics.

abstract = {There has been a wealth of research on how individuals manage their tasks in general. However little to none has investigated whether, how, and why personal task management (PTM) behaviors differ across individuals. To fill this gap, we conducted two empirical studies: a focus group + contextual interviews with 19 participants, and an online survey with 178 respondents. Initially, based on the results of the first study, we were able to summarize the differences and similarities across the individuals by categorizing the participants into three categories: DIYers, make-doers, and adopters.Then, we conducted a survey with a broader population to assess to what extent our previous results would generalize to a broader population. We found that many of the survey respondents did not fit neatly into one of the previous categories; rather, they demonstrated tendencies of varying strength toward adopting, make-doing, and DIYing for their PTM. This was reflected in how they recorded and remembered their tasks, and if/how they maintained task lists. Based on this, we recommend that PTM tools have the capacity to accommodate the varying strengths of those tendencies: they should be personalizable so that people with DIY desire can personalize their tool when they need to and should be relatively effortless to use and integrate well with other systems in use to satisfy make-do tendencies.

abstract = {Twitter is one of the dominant social media, and the number of retweets is a key analytic descriptor of social media behavior. Unfortunately, there has been limited analysis and investigation of potential theories to explain empirical retweeting results. This paper uses social exchange theory and game theory to analyze a number of different previous empirical behavioral findings. In particular, the paper investigates games and network games between different potential retweeters by analyzing the relationships between their different groups of followers. In addition, cooperative retweeting settings, such as those in the Arab Spring revolutions, also are investigated for games between retweeters. Further, games between original tweeters and retweeters are analyzed using a "tit-for-tat" strategy for retweeting. Finally, this paper examines a game between an original tweeter and a retweeter for the problem of retweet hijacking. Throughout the focus is on modeling and explaining the empirical and anecdotal behavior of tweeters and retweeters using social exchange theory and game theory models. Social exchange and game theory are used to model retweeting.Retweet behavior is modeled as a game and compared to previous empirical research.Multiple games between retweeters were investigated.A set theoretic approach to analyzing subsets of Twitter followers was used.Extended the use of games as mental representations to retweet behavior.},

abstract = {Printed maps are the most common tool to prepare people for emergency evacuation in contexts such as public buildings or transportation. Unfortunately, they are poorly understood and often ignored by people. Virtual environments (VEs) could be a more effective method to support people in acquiring spatial knowledge about the real-world environment to evacuate. This paper pursues three main goals. First, we propose a VE-based tool to support spatial knowledge acquisition for evacuation purposes, using aviation as a real-world domain in which such knowledge is crucial for passengers' safety. Second, we study in detail one of the VE design choices (active or passive navigation), comparing a version of our tool in which users navigate by actively controlling their position with another version in which users are passively led along pre-defined routes. Third, we contrast the two versions of the tool with the traditional, printed diagrammatic map provided to passengers by airlines. Results of our study show that the VE-based approach produces objectively better spatial knowledge when users are asked to pinpoint their assigned position in the environment, and that active navigation produces a performance improvement in a subsequent virtual evacuation. Moreover, the VE-based approach is perceived as more enjoyable, easier to comprehend and more effective than printed maps when active navigation is available. HighlightsWe propose a novel VE-based tool for emergency evacuation preparedness in aviation.The tool provides spatial knowledge about emergency exits in an aircraft cabin.The proposed approach is more effective than printed diagrammatic maps.Letting people control movement in the VE is more effective than making them experience a passive tour.},

abstract = {Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is a research field which aims to improve the relationship between users and interactive computer systems. A main objective of this research area is to make the user experience more pleasant and efficient, minimizing the barrier between the users' cognition of what they want to accomplish and the computer's understanding of the user's tasks, by means of user-friendly, useful and usable designs. A bad HCI design is one of the main reasons behind user rejection of computer-based applications, which in turn produces loss of productivity and economy in industrial environments.In the eHealth domain, user rejection of computer-based systems is a major barrier to exploiting the maximum benefit from those applications developed to support the treatment of diseases, and in the worst cases a poor design in these systems may cause deterioration in the clinical condition of the patient. Thus, a high level of personalisation of the system according to users' needs is extremely important, making it easy to use and contributing to the system's efficacy, which in turn facilitates the empowerment of the target users. Ideally, the content offered through the interactive sessions in these applications should be continuously assessed and adapted to the changing condition of the patient. A good HCI design and development can improve the acceptance of these applications and contribute to promoting better adherence levels to the treatment, preventing the patient from further relapses.In this work, we present a mechanism to provide personalised and adaptive daily interactive sessions focused on the treatment of patients with Major Depression. These sessions are able to automatically adapt the content and length of the sessions to obtain personalised and varied sessions in order to encourage the continuous and long-term use of the system. The tailored adaptation of session content is supported by decision-making processes based on: (i) clinical requirements; (ii) the patient's historical data; and (iii) current responses from the patient. We have evaluated our system through two different methodologies: the first one performing a set of simulations producing different sessions from changing input conditions, in order to assess different levels of adaptability and variability of the session content offered by the system. The second evaluation process involved a set of patients who used the system for 14-28 days and answered a questionnaire to provide feedback about the perceived level of adaptability and variability produced by the system. The obtained results in both evaluations indicated good levels of adaptability and variability in the content of the sessions according to the input conditions. We present an HCI-based framework for the treatment of patients with Major Depression.The framework provides adaptive and personalised plans of therapeutic-based sessions.The Intelligent framework reacts according to the individual condition of the patient.Its functionality was evaluated using a relevant set of simulations and real patients.The developed framework can be adapted as a CDSS addressing mental health disorders.},

abstract = {Head-up displays (HUD) are important parts of visual interfaces of virtual environments such as video games. However, few studies have investigated their role in player-video game interactions. Two experiments were designed to investigate the influence of HUDs on player experience according to player expertise and game genre. Experiment 1 used eye-tracking and interviews to understand how and to what extent players use and experience HUDs in two types of commercial games: first-person shooter and real-time strategy games. Results showed that displaying a permanent HUD within the visual interface may improve the understanding of this environment by players. They also revealed that two HUD characteristics, namely composition and spatial organization, have particular influence on player experience. These critical characteristics were manipulated in experiment 2 to study more precisely the influence of HUD design choices on player experience. Results showed that manipulation of design of these HUD characteristics influences player experience in different ways according to player expertise and game genre. For games with HUDs that are perceived as very useful, the higher player expertise is, the more player experience is influenced. Recommendations for video game design based on these results are proposed. Permanent HUD may improve players' understanding of game environment.Composition and spatial organization are critical characteristics of HUDs.HUD design choices have influence on user experience in video games.This influence is different according to player expertise and game genre.},

abstract = {Requirements analysis activities underpin the success of the software development lifecycle. Subsequent errors in the requirements models can propagate to models in later phases and become much costlier to fix. Errors in requirement analysis are more likely in developing complex systems. Particularly, errors due to miscommunication and misinterpretation of a client's intentions are common. Ontologies relying on formal descriptions of semantics have often been used in multi agent systems (MAS) development to support various activities and generally improve the complex systems produced. However, their use during requirements analysis to validate match with the client's conceptualisation is largely unexplored. This article presents an ontology driven validation process to support requirement analysis of MAS models. This process is underpinned by an agent-based metamodel that describes commonly used informal agent requirement models. The process concurrently and incrementally validates the informal MAS requirement models produced. The synthesis of the process is first justified and illustrated in a manual tracing of the process. The paper then describes an interactive support tool to harness the formal semantics of ontologies and by pass the costly manual effort. The validation process is evaluated and illustrated using three case studies. There is need for high quality requirement models in any iterative process.This is acute in informal modelling settings e.g. agent oriented analysis.A tool harnesses domain knowledge to support analysis.We validate highlighting the methodology-independence of the overall approach.We validate also highlighting the domain-independence of the overall approach.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design and evaluation of a novel mechanism to develop research proposals and distribute funding: Creativity Greenhouse (CG). Building on an established funding sandpit mechanism for co-located participants, communication technologies and structures were designed to support similar activities at-a-distance. Given a particular topic, selected academic participants collaborate during an ideation phase, then form sub-groups around selected ideas to develop research proposals and compete for the available research funding. This paper details the motivations for developing a distributed approach, before describing our iterative design process and trials. We describe an iterative design and evaluation process to support at-a-distance ideation, group formation, and then competitive development of proposals in a shared virtual space, leading to the detailed evaluation of a full-scale CG event that resulted in the distribution of 1.85 million of funding. This work contributes a novel, fully-developed mechanism to produce research projects, evaluated 'In the Wild'. Our findings are explored with regards to distinctions and similarities between co-located and distributed events, participant well-being and pastoral care, and the capacity of technologies to mediate complex combinations of cooperative and competitive group work. Through this, we contribute knowledge of how to effectively support research funding events, and also to wider understanding of high-stakes, computer-mediated processes, that involve complex creative and social processes. We designed, deployed and evaluated a novel mechanism to distribute research funding 'In the Wild'.Communication technology allowed academics and a facilitation team to participate remotely.Collaborative ideation, group formation and between group competition were supported.Particular attention needs to be paid to well-being, work-life-balance and pastoral care.The Creativity Greenhouse approach successfully supported the process of a funding sandpit and 1.85 million were distributed through the mechanism.},

abstract = {To address the problem of errors in spreadsheets, we have investigated spreadsheet authors' mental models in a hope of finding cognition-based principles for spreadsheet visualization and debugging tools. To this end, we have conducted three empirical studies. The first study explored the nature of mental models of spreadsheet authors during explaining and debugging tasks. It was found that several mental models about spreadsheets are activated in spreadsheet authors' minds. Particularly, when explaining a spreadsheet, the real-world and domain mental models are prominent, and the spreadsheet model is suppressed; however, when locating and fixing an error, one must constantly switch back and forth between the domain model and the spreadsheet model, which requires frequent use of the mapping between problem domain concepts and their spreadsheet model counterparts. The second study examined the effects of replacing traditional spreadsheet formulas with problem domain narratives in the context of a debugging task. Domain narratives were found to be easy to learn and they helped participants to locate more errors in spreadsheets. Furthermore, domain narratives also increased the use of the domain mental model and appeared to improve the mapping between the domain and spreadsheet models. The third study investigated the effects of allowing spreadsheet authors to fix errors by editing domain narratives, thus relieving them from the use of traditional low-level cell references. This scenario was found to promote spreadsheet authors using even more of their domain mental model in a manner that completely overshadowed the use of their spreadsheet mental model. Thus, from a mental model perspective, it is possible to devise a new spreadsheet paradigm that uses domain narratives in place of traditional spreadsheet formulas, thus automatically presenting spreadsheet content so that it prompts spreadsheet authors to think in a manner that closely corresponds to their mental models of the application domain. HighlightsSpreadsheet authors have several mental models of a spreadsheet.The roles of mental models vary depending on the task at hand.Spreadsheet tools should provide support for mapping mental models.Domain narratives help to locate more errors in spreadsheets.Domain narratives make traditional low-level cell references dispensable.},

abstract = {Head gaze, or the orientation of the head, is a very important attentional cue in face to face conversation. Some subtleties of the gaze can be lost in common teleconferencing systems, because a single perspective warps spatial characteristics. A recent random hole display is a potentially interesting display for group conversation, as it allows multiple stereo viewers in arbitrary locations, without the restriction of conventional autostereoscopic displays on viewing positions. We represented a remote person as an avatar on a random hole display. We evaluated this system by measuring the ability of multiple observers with different horizontal and vertical viewing angles to accurately and simultaneously judge which targets the avatar is gazing at. We compared three perspective conditions: a conventional 2D view, a monoscopic perspective-correct view, and a stereoscopic perspective-correct views. In the latter two conditions, the random hole display shows three and six views simultaneously. Although the random hole display does not provide high quality view, because it has to distribute display pixels among multiple viewers, the different views are easily distinguished. Results suggest the combined presence of perspective-correct and stereoscopic cues significantly improved the effectiveness with which observers were able to assess the avatar's head gaze direction. This motivates the need for stereo in future multiview displays. HighlightsRepresented a remote person as an avatar on a random hole display (RHD).This RHD provides multiple users with perspective-correct stereo views from arbitrary positions.Evaluated a RHD for improving the head gaze perception for group teleconferencing.A perspective-corrected rendering improved viewers' ability in head gaze perception.Adding stereoscopic cues provided an additional improvement in head gaze perception.},

In this paper, we specifically address assisting people with visual impairments to aim at a target on a large wall-mounted display. We introduce a novel haptic device, which explores the use of vibrotactile feedback in blind user search strategies on a large wall-mounted display. Using mid-air gestures aided by vibrotactile feedback, we compared three target-aiming techniques: Random (baseline) and two novel techniques - Cruciform and Radial. The results of our two experiments show that visually impaired participants can find a target significantly faster with the Cruciform and Radial techniques than with the Random technique. In addition, they can retrieve information on a large display about twice as fast by augmenting speech feedback with haptic feedback in using the Radial technique. Although a large number of studies have been done on assistive interfaces for people who have visual impairments, very few studies have been done on large vertical display applications for them. In a broader sense, this work will be a stepping-stone for further research on interactive large public display technologies for users who are visually impaired. Display Omitted A directional vibrotactile feedback for people with visual impairments is proposed.Two experiments for target-aiming tasks by blind participants are conducted.Converting a 2D search space to linear searches improves target-aiming performance.Augmenting speech with vibrotactile feedback improves target-aiming performance.},

In this paper two versions of the same exercise are reported: one undertaken by participants at a conference and one undertaken by Military Intelligence personnel. The behaviour of groups of analysts (experienced versus inexperienced) is considered in terms the Data/Frame model of sense-making. The paper illustrates how Intelligence Analysis often involves parallel and overlapping explorations of data, with multiple frames that might be minimal and sketchy. The use of representations, such as link diagrams, provides a means of externalising frames and it is suggested that these can shift the style of reasoning exhibited by the teams as the Exercise progresses. Such a shift was seen more clearly in the behaviour of the Military Intelligence Officers who also spent more time developing and refining the diagrams to support the presentation of their findings.

abstract = {Collaboratively annotating digital texts allows learners to add valued information, share ideas, and create knowledge. However, excessive annotations and poor-quality annotations in a digital text may cause information overload and divert attention from the main content. The increased cognitive load ultimately reduces the effectiveness of collaborative annotations in promoting reading comprehension. Thus, this work develops a web-based collaborative reading annotation system (WCRAS-TQAFM) with two quality annotation filtering mechanisms-high-grade and master annotation filters-to promote the reading performance of learners. Ninety-seven students from three classes of a senior high school in Taiwan were invited to participate in an 80-min reading activity in which individual readers use WCRAS with or without annotation filters. Analytical results indicate that digital reading performance is significantly better in readers who use the high-grade annotation filter compared to those who read all annotations. Moreover, the high-grade annotation filter can enhance the reading comprehension of learners in all considered question types (i.e., recall, main idea, inference, and application). Also, the Cohen's kappa statistics was used for assessing whether the annotation selected by the high-grade annotation filter is in agreement with the annotations selected by a domain expert. The statistic results indicate that the proposed high-grade annotation filter is valid to some degree. Finally, neither of the proposed quality annotation filtering approaches significantly reduces cognitive load. Proposing high-grade and master annotation filtering schemes for annotation systems.Reviewing annotation frequency is an effective means of identifying high-quality annotations.High-grade annotation filtering can improve reading comprehension.High-grade annotation filtering is recommended to identify quality annotations.Quality annotation filtering schemes do not significantly reduce cognitive load.},

abstract = {Recently, interactive approaches aimed at helping people practice mindfulness have appeared in the literature. However, the few available user studies for such approaches focus only on short-term effects and are carried out in a lab or in a similar artificial setting. In this study, we aim instead at assessing the effectiveness of a mobile mindfulness app when used by people in their everyday contexts and over a prolonged period of time. People could participate in the study by downloading the app from Apple's App Store as well as Google Play and by answering a mindfulness questionnaire at three pre-set times over a 4-week period. Moreover, the app automatically collected usage data each time it was used and qualitative feedback at the end of the study. Results reveal that users with no or minimal experience with meditation significantly increased their level of mindfulness over the 4-week study period. Moreover, the qualitative feedback provided by participants indicates that the app was positively perceived as beautiful and its usage elicited positive feelings in most of them. We discuss possible factors that could have contributed to the obtained results. Finally, we analyze how many users abandoned the study and at what times, comparing such data with other studies based on app stores distribution, and giving possible reasons. This study investigates in situ 4-week use of a mobile mindfulness app (AEON).We follow a research in the large method, publishing the app on mobile app stores.We assess participants' mindfulness level and user experience with the app.AEON helped participants increase their level of mindfulness and was well-received.Additional factors that could have influenced the results are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the potential for reusing UI elements in the context of Model-Based UI Development (MBUID) and provides guidance for future MBUID systems with enhanced reutilization capabilities. Our study is based upon the development of six inter-related projects with a specific MBUID environment which supports standard techniques for reuse such as parametrization and sub-specification, inclusion or shared repositories.We analyze our experience and discuss the benefits and limitations of each technique supported by our MBUID environment. The system architecture, the structure and composition of UI elements and the models specification languages have a decisive impact on reusability. In our case, more than 40% of the elements defined in the UI specifications were reused, resulting in a reduction of 55% of the specification size. Inclusion, parametrization and sub-specification have facilitated modularity and internal reuse of UI specifications at development time, whereas the reuse of UI elements between applications has greatly benefited from sharing repositories of UI elements at run time. HighlightsReusing UI assets reduces the development effort in software industry.We provide a real case study where reusing UI resulted in significant benefits in productivity.The structure of UI Models and its components has a significant impact on reusability.MBUIDEs with run-time architecture can benefit from sharing repositories between various projects.},

abstract = {This research focuses on analysing collective activity in Wikipedia, conceptualised as an Online Epistemic Community ("OEC"). Previous research on Wikipedia has shown that widespread participation, coupled with the principle of neutrality of viewpoint, has led to 'editing wars' and associated high coordination costs. The question that we address is therefore that of how to analyse the interactive dynamics of conflictual OEC discussions. To address this issue, we performed a longitudinal analysis of a specific case-study within the French-speaking "astronomy" Wikipedia OEC, revolving around the renaming of the article on the celestial body "Pluto", given the 'descent' of its scientific status from that of a planet to an asteroid. Our choice was to focus on the analysis of dialogic and epistemic roles, as an appropriate meso-level unit of analysis. We present a qualitative-quantitative method for analysis of roles, based on filtering major participants and analysing the dialogic functions and epistemic contents of their communicative acts. Our analyses showed that online epistemic communities can be communities in the true sense of their involving cooperation, in that roles become gradually specialised and reciprocal over sequences of the discussion: when one participant changes role from one sequence to another, other participants 'fill in' for the vacant role. Secondly, we show that OECs, in the case of Wikipedia, do not function purely on a knowledge-level, but also involve, crucially, negotiation of images of participants' competences with respect to the knowledge domain. In that sense, OECs can be seen as socio-cognitive communities. The originality of our research resides in the qualitative-quantitative method for analysing interactive roles, and the results of its application to an extended longitudinal case study. We develop a methodology for qualitative-quantitative analysis of interactive roles in Online Epistemic Communities (OECs).We show how interactive roles are reciprocal and symmetrical in OECs.We show that OECs involve both knowledge-based and interpersonal processes (negotiation of images of participants' competences).},

abstract = {We describe the use of transformations of Gaussian Process (GP) priors to improve the context sensing capability of a system composed of a Kinect sensor and mobile inertial sensors. The Bayesian nonparametric model provides a principled mechanism for incorporating the low-sampling-rate position measurements and the high-sampling-rate derivatives in multi-rate sensor fusion which takes account of the uncertainty of each sensor type. The complementary properties of these sensors enable the GP model to calculate the likelihood of the observed Kinect skeletons and inertial data to identify individual users.We conducted three experiments to test the performance of the proposed GP model: (1) subtle hand movements, (2) walking with a mobile device in the trouser pocket, and (3) walking with a mobile device held in the hand. We compared the GP with the direct acceleration comparison method. Experimental results show that the GP approach can achieve successful matches (with mean accuracy µ 90 % ) in all 3 contexts, including when there are only subtle hand movements, where the acceleration comparison method performs poorly ( µ &lt; 20 % ) . HighlightsWe explore the complementary properties of Kinect sensor and inertial sensors.We describe a GP model to improve the context sensing in proxemic interactions.The model incorporates positions and accelerations in multi-rate sensor fusion.We identify users by matching Kinect skeletons with the sensed data from devices.User matching and identification through people's everyday movements is feasible.},

abstract = {Written text plays a special role in user interfaces. Key information in interaction elements and content are mostly conveyed through text. The global context, where software has to run in multiple geographical and cultural regions, requires software developers to translate their interfaces into many different languages. This translation process is prone to errors - therefore the question of how language quality can be measured is important. This paper presents the development of a questionnaire to measure user interface language quality (LQS). After a first validation of the instrument with 843 participants, a final set of 10 items remained, which was tested again ( N = 690 ). The survey showed a high internal consistency (Cronbach's α) of .82, acceptable discriminatory power coefficients (.34-.47), as well as a moderate average homogeneity of .36. The LQS also showed moderate correlation to UMUX, an established usability metric (convergent validity), and it successfully distinguished high and low language quality (discriminative validity). The application to three different products (YouTube, Google Analytics, Google AdWords) revealed similar key statistics, providing evidence that this survey is product-independent. Meanwhile, the survey has been translated and applied to more than 60 languages. HighlightsDevelopment of a survey to measure user rated user interface language quality (LQS).The survey shows good psychometric properties.The LQS correlates moderately to usability metrics.A case study is provided to show how the LQS can be used to improve language quality.The LQS has been translated into 60+ languages and applied to several products.},

abstract = {Sonification is a fairly new term to scientists who are unaware of its multiple use cases. Even if some general definitions of the concept of sonification are commonly accepted, heterogeneous techniques - significantly different as it regards approaches, means and goals - are available. In this work we propose a reference system useful to interpret already-existing sonification instances and to plan new sonification tasks. This work aims to present a reference system for sonification using the inherent properties in the sonic output rather than the data itself. Validation has been conducted by automatically analyzing available experiments and examples, and placing them on the proposed sonification space, according to time-granularity and abstraction-level dimensions. This work can constitute the starting point for future research on computer-assisted sonification. It will be beneficial to a wide range of readers, in particular those from different disciplines looking at new ways to present and analyze data. HighlightsWe provide a classification of the most common sonification approaches.We propose a new diagram called the sonification space.We analyze a number of already available sonifications to validate the diagram.We address some open issues such as orthogonality in sound features.},

abstract = {Acoustic Sonification maps a dataset onto the shape of 3D acoustic object. This concept has been demonstrated in the form of the Hypertension Singing Bowl shaped by a year of blood pressure readings. The sounds produced by this prototype raise the question of whether useful information about the dataset can be heard by interacting with the bowl? This paper explores the feasibility of Acoustic Sonification through a case study on the diagnosis of blood pressure in five categories of risk. The readings that define each category are used to generate five Diagnostic Singing Bowls based on the CAD model in the prototype. The set of Diagnostic Singing Bowls was 3D printed in stainless steel. The first set of bowls did not increase in pitch with severity of diagnosis as predicted by the acoustic model. Inspection showed that this was due to artefacts introduced by the 3D printing process. A next iteration of the mapping addressed this problem, and a second set of Diagnostic bowls was printed that do increase in pitch with the severity of the risk, as expected. The feasibility of using these bowls for diagnostic purposes was tested by generating two Patient bowls from blood pressure readings recorded from human patients. The resonant frequency of the Patient bowls most closely matches the frequency of the Diagnostic Bowl in the same category of risk. These results suggest that Acoustic Sonification may be a feasible technique that could have practical applications.

abstract = {This paper presents a multimodal interactive system for non-visual (auditory-haptic) exploration of virtual maps. The system is able to display haptically the height profile of a map, through a tactile mouse. Moreover, spatial auditory information is provided in the form of virtual anchor sounds located in specific points of the map, and delivered through headphones using customized Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs). The validity of the proposed approach is investigated through two experiments on non-visual exploration of virtual maps. The first experiment has a preliminary nature and is aimed at assessing the effectiveness and the complementarity of auditory and haptic information in a goal reaching task. The second experiment investigates the potential of the system in providing subjects with spatial knowledge: specifically in helping with the construction of a cognitive map depicting simple geometrical objects. Results from both experiments show that the proposed concept, design, and implementation allow to effectively exploit the complementary natures of the "proximal" haptic modality and the "distal" auditory modality. Implications for orientation &amp; mobility (O&amp;M) protocols for visually impaired subjects are discussed.

abstract = {In the last years several solutions were proposed to support people with visual impairments or blindness during road crossing. These solutions focus on computer vision techniques for recognizing pedestrian crosswalks and computing their relative position from the user. Instead, this contribution addresses a different problem; the design of an auditory interface that can effectively guide the user during road crossing. Two original auditory guiding modes based on data sonification are presented and compared with a guiding mode based on speech messages.Experimental evaluation shows that there is no guiding mode that is best suited for all test subjects. The average time to align and cross is not significantly different among the three guiding modes, and test subjects distribute their preferences for the best guiding mode almost uniformly among the three solutions. From the experiments it also emerges that higher effort is necessary for decoding the sonified instructions if compared to the speech instructions, and that test subjects require frequent 'hints' (in the form of speech messages). Despite this, more than 2/3 of test subjects prefer one of the two guiding modes based on sonification. There are two main reasons for this: firstly, with speech messages it is harder to hear the sound of the environment, and secondly sonified messages convey information about the "quantity" of the expected movement. HighlightsWe study audio interfaces to guide people with visual impairment in road crossing.We design two sonifications and implement them in a mobile prototype.We empirically compare the sonifications with a speech-based interface.The two sonifications are less intuitive but effective even after little training.Most subjects (75%) declare to prefer one of the two sonifications over speech.},

abstract = {Recordings of the Earth's surface oscillation as a function of time (seismograms) can be sonified by compressing time so that most of the signal's frequency spectrum falls in the audible range. The pattern-recognition capabilities of the human auditory system can then be applied to the auditory analysis of seismic data. In this experiment, we sonify a set of seismograms associated with a magnitude-5.6 Oklahoma earthquake recorded at 17 broadband stations within a radius of ~300km from the epicenter, and a group of volunteers listen to our sonified seismic data set via headphones. Most of the subjects have never heard a sonified seismogram before. Given the lack of studies on this subject, we prefer to make no preliminary hypotheses on the categorization criteria employed by the listeners: we follow the "free categorization" approach, asking listeners to simply group sounds that they perceive as "similar." We find that listeners tend to group together sonified seismograms sharing one or more underlying physical parameters, including source-receiver distance, source-receiver azimuth, and, possibly, crustal structure between source and receiver and/or at the receiver. This suggests that, if trained to do so, human listeners can recognize subtle features in sonified seismic signals. It remains to be determined whether auditory analysis can complement or lead to improvements upon the standard visual and computational approaches in specific tasks of geophysical interest.

Sound was used as the only means of content delivery as it was considered particularly effective in engaging visitors at an emotional level and had the potential to enhance the physical experience of being at an historical place. The implemented prototype is visitor-aware personalised multi-point auditory narrative system that automatically plays sounds and stories depending on a combination of features such as physical location, visitor proximity and visitor preferences. The curators created for the trail multiple narratives to capture the different voices of the War. The stories are all personal accounts (as opposed to objective and detached reporting of the facts); they were designed to trigger empathy and understanding while leaving the visitors free to interpret the content and the place on the bases of their own understanding and sensitivity. The result is an evocative embodied experience that does not describe the place in a traditional sense, but leaves its interpretation open. It takes visitors beyond the traditional view of heritage as a source of information toward a sensorial experience of feeling the past. A prototype was set up and tested with a group of volunteers showing that a design that carefully combines content design, sound design, tangible and embodied interaction can bring archaeological remains, with very little to see, back to life.

To this end, we ran an experiment where participants had to steer a path with the stylus through a curved corridor on the surface of a graphic tablet/display, and we measured steering time, dispersion of trajectories, and applied force. Despite the variety of subjective impressions elicited by the different feedback conditions, we found that only nonvisual feedback induced significant variations in trajectories and an increase in movement time. In a post-experiment, using a paper-and-wood physical realization of the same texture, we recorded a variety of gestural behaviors markedly different from those found with the virtual texture. With the physical setup, movement time was shorter and texture-dependent lateral accelerations could be observed. This work highlights the limits of multisensory pseudo-haptic techniques in the exploration of surface textures.

abstract = {This paper presents a system capable of rhythmic walking interaction by auditory and haptic display. Likewise, it summarizes the results of the research on the influence of the audio and haptic stimulation on rhythmic walking interaction. The system detects user's footsteps and either provides interactive real-time feedback or suggests a pace using a synthetic walking sound or vibration. This pace is either a constant tempo or adapts to the walker. Auditory and haptic feedback signals are either ecological physically-based synthetic walking signals or simple sinusoidal beeps. In the experiment, the different auditory and haptic feedback and interaction modes are studied with respect to their effect on the walking tempo. The results show that participants synchronise equally well with the tempo with either audio or haptic cues, but indicate the audio-haptic conditions as the easiest to synchronise with.

To transfer skills involving such fine motor tasks, instruction on how to move the fingers and use fingertip forces is essential. In this paper, we propose an optimal method for transmitting knowledge regarding fingertip forces from trainer to trainee; we then construct a haptic training system based on the proposed method. The resulting system conveys knowledge of fingertip forces and positions in three-dimensional space by combining an image display system with a five-fingered haptic interface robot capable of alternating force presentation. Finally, we describe several experiments carried out to optimize and evaluate the performance of the proposed method. HighlightsWe proposed optimal switching method for transferring multiple fingertip forces.Based on the proposed method, a haptic training system was developed.The proposed method enhanced the training effect compared with our earlier method.},

abstract = {With the growing popularity of large-scale collaborative ontology-engineering projects, such as the creation of the 11th revision of the International Classification of Diseases, we need new methods and insights to help project- and community-managers to cope with the constantly growing complexity of such projects. In this paper, we present a novel application of Markov chains to model sequential usage patterns that can be found in the change-logs of collaborative ontology-engineering projects. We provide a detailed presentation of the analysis process, describing all the required steps that are necessary to apply and determine the best fitting Markov chain model. Amongst others, the model and results allow us to identify structural properties and regularities as well as predict future actions based on usage sequences. We are specifically interested in determining the appropriate Markov chain orders which postulate on how many previous actions future ones depend on. To demonstrate the practical usefulness of the extracted Markov chains we conduct sequential pattern analyses on a large-scale collaborative ontology-engineering dataset, the International Classification of Diseases in its 11th revision. To further expand on the usefulness of the presented analysis, we show that the collected sequential patterns provide potentially actionable information for user-interface designers, ontology-engineering tool developers and project-managers to monitor, coordinate and dynamically adapt to the natural development processes that occur when collaboratively engineering an ontology. We hope that presented work will spur a new line of ontology-development tools, evaluation-techniques and new insights, further taking the interactive nature of the collaborative ontology-engineering process into consideration. HighlightsWe provide a novel application for Markov.Using Markov chains we extract and analyze sequential usage patterns.We categorize the types of analyses that Markov chains enable us to perform.We demonstrate the utility of the Markov chain analysis on a large-scale project.},

Recent research has demonstrated that a persuasive speaker can use these advantages to create a more persuasive message. However, little has been done to establish how a receiver of a persuasive message in a virtual, interactive environment might also use these advantages. Giving individuals the ability to customize a persuasive source may empower them and affect their perceptions of the persuasive message. In a 2(forewarned or not) 2(customize source or watch customization) experiment, participants were forewarned or not forewarned that they would be hearing a persuasive message about buying a new energy drink. Participants were then allowed to customize (or watch someone customize) the appearance of the speaker's avatar before the sales pitch. Participants who had the opportunity customize the speaker's appearance liked the product more and had higher purchase intentions than those who did not have control, regardless of forewarning. Findings suggest a new application for TSI, and that both users and sources may benefit when users have the power to customize the appearance of a virtual salesperson. Virtual environments (VEs) offer new opportunities for persuasion.Message sources and receivers can utilize affordances of interactive media.Allowed users in VE to customize avatar of a persuasive speaker before speech.Customizers liked product and had higher purchase intention than non-customizers.},

abstract = {A Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart (CAPTCHA) is a widely used security defense mechanism that is utilized by service providers to determine whether the entity interacting with their system is a human and not a malicious agent. Common design practices of current CAPTCHA schemes barely take into account cultural, contextual, and individual cognitive characteristics and abilities of users. Motivated by recent research which underpins the necessity for designing more user-friendly CAPTCHA, this paper investigates the effect of users' cognitive styles and cognitive processing abilities towards preference and task performance of CAPTCHA challenges. In the frame of the reported research, two user studies were conducted. The first study (n=131) explored the effect of users' cognitive styles (Verbal/Imager) on user preference and task performance of two complementary types of CAPTCHA mechanisms; text-recognition and image-recognition. The second study (n=125) explored the effect of users' cognitive processing abilities (speed of processing, controlled attention, working memory capacity) on task performance in regards with different levels of complexity of both text-recognition and image-recognition CAPTCHA. Analysis of results revealed interaction effects of users' cognitive processing characteristics towards preference and performance of CAPTCHA, suggesting that individual differences at such an intrinsic level are important to be considered for designing more usable and user-centric CAPTCHA challenges. We study the effects of cognitive factors on CAPTCHA preference and performance.Verbals prefer and solve significantly faster text CAPTCHA.There is a growing trend of Imagers preferring and solving faster image CAPTCHA.Users with enhanced cognitive processing abilities solve CAPTCHA faster.Implications about the design of personalized CAPTCHA are discussed.},

Building on the research surrounding the impact of visual aesthetics in usability testing, the present work aimed to determine whether the same pattern of effects repeatedly found for visual aesthetics will also be found for non-visual aesthetics. A series of three experiments was carried out, all examining sound and touch as two prominent dimensions of non-visual aesthetics. To increase the robustness of the results, the experiments were conducted with three different consumer products, which were a smartphone (N=60), vacuum cleaner (N=60), and video racing game (N=60). Although manipulation checks confirmed that users generally experienced both sound and tactile product properties as intended by the experimental manipulation, in none of the studies the results showed an effect on perceived usability. Other outcome variables such as affect and performance showed a few selected effects. Overall, this suggests that findings from the field of visual aesthetics cannot be easily transferred to the domain of non-visual aesthetics. The findings of the present studies are discussed within the framework of Schifferstein's work on sensory dominance. Effectsobserved for visual aesthetics were not found for non-visual aesthetics.Results that haptic and auditory aesthetics didn't affect perceived usability.There was no strong effect of non-visual aesthetics on performance and affect.},

abstract = {Trying to make a decision between two outcomes, when there is some level of uncertainty, is inherently difficult because it involves probabilistic reasoning. Previous studies have shown that most people do not correctly apply Bayesian inference to solve probabilistic problems for decision making under uncertainty. In an effort to improve decision making with Bayesian problems, previous work has studied supplementing the textual description of problems with visualizations, such as graphs and charts. However, results have been varied and generally indicate that visualization is not an effective technique. As these studies were performed over many years with a variety of goals and experimental conditions, we sought to re-evaluate the use of visualization as an aid in solving Bayesian problems. Many of these studies used the classic Mammography Problem with visualizations portraying the problem structure, the quantities involved, or the nested-set relations of the populations involved. We selected three representative visualizations from this work and developed two hybrid visualizations, combining structure types and frequency with structure. We also included a text-only baseline condition and a text-legend condition where all nested-set problem values were given to eliminate the need for participants to estimate or calculate values. Seven hundred participants evaluated these seven conditions on the classic Mammography Problem in a crowdsourcing system, where micro-interaction data was collected from the participants. Our analysis of the user input and of the results indicates that participants made use of the visualizations but that the visualizations did not help participants to perform more accurately. Overall, static visualizations do not seem to aid a majority of people in solving the Mammography Problem. Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted HighlightsWe evaluate the use of visualization as an aid in solving Bayesian problems.We propose comparability criteria for consistency in visualization design.We created a design space including existing and novel visualizations.700 participants evaluated 7 different visualizations of the Mammography Problem.Participants made use of the visualizations but they did not improve performance.},

abstract = {This study explored the relationship between the softness of two output displays (glass and elastic surfaces) and three direct input devices (fingertip and two types of styli, with acrylic and rubber tips) in terms of user task performance and satisfaction in tapping tasks. In a within-subjects experiment, 44 participants were asked to play a touch-based game as quickly and accurately as possible across combinations of the two independent variables. After finishing tasks in each condition, they filled out an evaluation questionnaire regarding tactile satisfaction, which addressed perceived feeling of pressing down on the surface, pleasantness, helpfulness, finger fatigue, and degree of elasticity. The results of this experiment show a main effect of touchscreen type on task performance, whereas input device type shows main effects on both task performance and satisfaction. Measures of five key sub-factors of subjective satisfaction are explained, and the practical implications of these findings are discussed. The two main stages of "pre-interaction" and "post-interaction" are observed.The combination of soft touchscreen and fingers shows the fastest task performance.An outstanding task performance does not guarantee a high level of user satisfaction.The elastic-surfaced display with the rubber-tipped stylus is the best for tapping.The glass-surfaced display with the acrylic-tipped stylus is the worst combination.},

abstract = {Mobile web browsing is highly recurrent, in that a large proportion of user's page requests are to a small set of websites. Despite this, most mobile browsers do not provide an efficient means for revisiting sites. Although significant research exists on prediction in the personal computer realm, little work has been done in the mobile realm where physical constraints of the device and mobile browsing behaviors are vastly different. The current research proposes a Bayesian model approach, based on a cognitive model of memory retrieval that integrates multiple cues in order to predict the next site a user will visit. These cues include frequency of site visitation, the recency of site visitation, and the context in which specific sites are accessed. The model is assessed using previously collected web logs from 24 iPhone users over the course of one year. Our model outperforms simpler models based on frequency or recency, which are sometimes implemented in desktop browsers. Potential applications of the model are discussed with the objective of increasing browsing efficiency on mobile devices. HighlightsPredicts website revisitation on mobile phones.Accounts for nearly 50% of site visits.Incorporates frequency, recency, and context (current site) to make predictions.Comparison of models to show contribution of each predictive cue.},

Oudjat is dedicated to the manual annotation facial expressions of emotion (FEE). Considering the existence of other software applications in that field, Oudjat provides a compromise solution between the currently existing tools. For the investigators, it is an easy-to-configure interface to set up relevant behaviors to be annotated. For the annotators, it is an easy-to-use interface. This tool can perform complex annotations procedures utilizing multiple responses panels such as buttons, scales (e.g., Likert scales), and free labelling. Oudjat also allows to chain response panels or to conduct sequence marking annotations (i.e., two-steps temporal annotation). As it can be configured in any language, Oudjat is particularly suited for intercultural experiments. Four annotation procedures are presented to illustrate Oudjat's possibilities with FEE annotation. Oudjat is an open source software available to the scientific community, and can be freely be obtained on request. We review the different annotation procedures for emotional stimuli.We review the available tools for emotional annotation and present their advantages and weaknesses.We present Oudjat a new tool for annotation experiments which is both configurable by investigators and easy to use by annotators.Four case studies are presented to highlight investigators possibilities with Oudjat.},

abstract = {Humans are reflective, adaptive, and social. They recall the past, sometimes discuss these recollections with others and become nostalgic; yet, previous research has not examined nostalgia in social media. This paper investigates the expression of nostalgia within Facebook conversations. The specific themes of nostalgic longing and the expression of personal emotions are investigated in two studies. Study 1 examines 375,857 Facebook posts, and Study 2 expands on this by comparing a sample of 10,000 Facebook and 10,000 general (non-nostalgic) posts. Content analyses of these posts reveal significant evidence of nostalgic expressions in Facebook conversations. Cluster analysis reveals newer themes of nostalgic longing related to family, life stories, historical events (presidential elections, man on the moon and Gandhi), spirituality, appreciation of life, romanticism and fun. General posts tend to focus on spontaneous, spur-of-the-moment greetings, emotions, and day of the week. Nostalgic posts, in contrast, are more reflective, more emotional, and frequently include both positive and negative emotions, which is consistent with a deeper, bittersweet character to nostalgia. The concurrent utilization of past- and present-tense words in nostalgic posts suggests that, for some Facebook users, nostalgia helps interpret and navigate present circumstances. The research concludes with theoretical and managerial implications. We identified newer topics of nostalgic longing on Facebook which are more pensive and reflective, indicating deeper levels of cognitive processing than general Facebook posts, which are more "in the moment."Nostalgic reverie on Facebook contains both cognitive reflection and affective reactions.Emotions expressed in Facebook conversations tend toward the positive and often contain mixed emotions, - documenting the bittersweet nature of nostalgia.Nostalgic Facebook posts frequently discuss the past, but also frequently discuss the present. Users frequently compare the past to the present and utilize the past to reflect on the present circumstances of their lives, the nation and society.These findings have managerial implications as well.Companies can segment Facebook users based on their posts and then target these consumers using nostalgia-based behavioral advertising campaigns.},

abstract = {The growth of speech interfaces and speech interaction with computer partners has made it increasingly important to understand the factors that determine users' language choices in human-computer dialogue. We report two controlled experiments that used a picture-naming-matching task to investigate whether users in human-computer speech-based interactions tend to use the same grammatical structures as their conversational partners, and whether such syntactic alignment can impact strong default grammatical preferences. We additionally investigate whether beliefs about system capabilities that are based on partner identity (i.e. human or computer) and speech interface design cues (here, voice anthropomorphism) affect the magnitude of syntactic alignment in such interactions. We demonstrate syntactic alignment for both dative structures (e.g., give the waitress the apple vs. give the apple to the waitress), where there is no strong default preference for one or other structure (Experiment 1), and noun phrase structures (e.g., a purple circle vs. a circle that is purple), where there is a strong default preference for one structure (Experiment 2). The tendency to align syntactically was unaffected by partner identity (human vs. computer) or voice anthropomorphism. These findings have both practical and theoretical implications for HCI by demonstrating the potential for spoken dialogue system behaviour to influence users' syntactic choices in interaction. As well as verifying natural corpora findings, this work also highlights that priming and cognitive mechanisms that are unmediated by beliefs about partner identity could be important in understanding why people align syntactically in human-computer dialogue. Paper investigates syntactic alignment in spoken human-computer dialogue.The role of partner modelling through partner type and voice is also explored.Humans align similarly with human and computer partners, irrespective of voice.Priming is an important mechanism to consider in explaining our HCD choices.Syntactic alignment can affect strong default preferences and could be used to improve spoken dialogue technology.},

abstract = {Pupillary response is associated with perceptual and cognitive loads in visual and cognitive tasks, but no quantitative link between pupil response and the task workload in visual-motor tasks has been confirmed. The objective of this study is to investigate how the changes of task requirement of a visual-motor task are reflected by the changes of pupil size. In the present study, a simple continuous aiming task is performed and the task requirement is manipulated and measured by Fitts' Index of Difficulty (ID), calculated for different combinations of the target size and movement distance. Pupil response is recorded using a remote eye-tracker. The results show that event-triggered pupil dilations in continuous aiming movements respect Fitts' Law, such that higher task difficulty evokes higher peak pupil dilation and longer peak duration. These findings suggest that pupil diameter can be employed as a physiological indicator to task workload evoked by the task requirement in visual-motor tasks. Pupil responses correlate to task difficulty in continuous aiming movements.Pupil size changes can indicate the mental workload evoked by physical tasks.Movement-related pupil response was detected from self-paced visual-motor tasks.The task difficulty of the motor task was quantitatively defined using Fitts' law.The pupillary measure was expanded from cognitive workload to physical workload.},

abstract = {Emerging systems for tabletop interaction have the potential to support small groups of students in collaborative learning activities. We argue that these devices have the potential to support learning by exploiting the interaction data that they can capture. The capture, analysis and presentation of these data can provide new ways to gain understanding of the collaborative processes. This is particularly important for teachers at two levels. First, they can gain a deeper level of awareness of the progress of individual students and groups in their class and, based on this, make real-time informed decisions. Second, they can do post-hoc reflection and analyse aspects of the class. This paper presents Tabletop-Supported Collaborative Learning (TSCL), a conceptual model that provides foundations for building tabletop-based systems that can inform understanding of the collaborative learning process. The model provides guidance for building the infrastructure to: (i) capture traces of student activity; (ii) exploit these through data analytics techniques; and (iii) provide useful information about the collaborative processes. We illustrate the usefulness of TSCL in its use to create a learning environment that was evaluated in two studies conducted in tertiary education contexts. The first was a laboratory study, where 60 students in 20 groups worked on a concept mapping task, with data from their interaction used to create visualisations of the group processes. The second study was conducted in-the-wild, involving 140 students, working in 8 class sessions.},

abstract = {This paper provides the results of various trial experiments in a hotel environment carried out using Sacarino, an interactive bellboy robot. We analysed which aspects of the robot design and behaviour are relevant in terms of user engagement and comfort when interacting with our social robot. The experiments carried out focused on the influence over the proxemics, duration and effectiveness of the interaction, taking into account three dichotomous factors related with the robot design and behaviour: robot embodiment (with/without robotic body), status of the robot (awake/asleep) and who starts communication (robot/user). Results show that users tend to maintain a personal distance when interacting with an embodied robot and that embodiment engages users in maintaining longer interactions. On the other hand, including a greeting model in a robot is useful in terms of engaging users to maintain longer interactions, and that an active-looking robot is more attractive to the participants, producing longer interactions than in the case of a passive-looking robot. A Bellboy, social robot interacting guests in a hotel is presented.Social robot design should take care of target user age that influences use distance.A robotic body encourages remarkably HCI (with respect to common computers).A two-step salutation can attract user attention while avoiding intimidation.Multimodal systems are highly recommended in real, noisy environment.},

abstract = {The main aim of this study is to investigate human understanding of process models and to develop an improved understanding of its relevant influence factors. Aided by assumptions from cognitive psychology, this article attempts to address specific deductive reasoning difficulties based on process models. The authors developed a research model to capture the influence of two effects on the cognitive difficulty of reasoning tasks: (i) the presence of different control-flow patterns (such as conditional or parallel execution) in a process model and (ii) the interactivity of model elements. Based on solutions to 61 different reasoning tasks by 155 modelers, the results from this study indicate that the presence of certain control-flow patterns influences the cognitive difficulty of reasoning tasks. In particular, sequence is relatively easy, while loops in a model proved difficult. Modelers with higher process modeling knowledge performed better and rated subjective difficulty of loops lower than modelers with lower process modeling knowledge. The findings additionally support the prediction that interactivity between model elements is positively related to the cognitive difficulty of reasoning. Our research contributes to both academic literature on the comprehension of process models and practitioner literature focusing on cognitive difficulties when using process models.

Participants were shown a series of websites and asked to identify the phishing websites. We use eye tracking to obtain objective quantitative data on which visual cues draw users' attention as they determine the legitimacy of websites. Our results show that users successfully detected only 53% of phishing websites even when primed to identify them and that they generally spend very little time gazing at security indicators compared to website content when making assessments. However, we found that gaze time on browser chrome elements does correlate to increased ability to detect phishing. Interestingly, users' general technical proficiency does not correlate with improved detection scores.

abstract = {Following the idea of using virtual environments (VEs) as mood induction procedures (MIPs), this study set out to examine whether five different virtual park scenarios would each elicit a specific affective state (i.e., joy, sadness, boredom, anger and anxiety). Within this main objective, a subset of two additional goals was identified: first, to analyze whether the sense of presence would differ across emotionally charged VEs, and second, to examine the link between a more objective measure of affective arousal, electrodermal activity (EDA), and presence. Following a between-subject design, 120 students were randomly assigned to one of the five VEs. Results show that almost all of the five virtual park scenarios were able to elicit the intended emotion. Additionally, presence levels were the same across all VEs suggesting that presence did not confound the emotional reaction to the VEs. Furthermore, EDA seems to be a poor indicator of presence as it is not significantly correlated with self-reported presence. The implications of these findings for both future research and practice are addressed in a comprehensive discussion. Four virtual park scenarios elicited the intended emotional states.Presence levels were the same across different virtual environments.Skin conductance level seems to be a poor indicator of presence.},

To gain a better understanding of the underlying affective and communicative processes that occur during such interactions, we carried out an exploratory study where we collected self-report and continuous behavioural and physiological measures from pairs of improvising drummers. Our analyses revealed interesting relationships between creative decisions and changes in heart rate. Self-reported measures of creativity, engagement, and energy were correlated with body motion; whilst EEG beta-band activity was correlated with self-reported positivity and leadership. Regarding co-visibility, lack of visual contact between musicians had a negative influence on self reported creativity. The number of glances between musicians was positively correlated with rhythmic synchrony, and the average length of glances was correlated with self-reported boredom. Our results indicate that ECG, motion, and glance measurements could be particularly suitable for the investigation of collaborative music making.

We investigate whether typing behavior is connected to two factors: the cognitive demands of a given task and the demographic features of the typist. We utilize features based on keystroke dynamics, stylometry, and "language production", which are novel hybrid features that capture the dynamics of a typists linguistic choices. Our study takes advantage of a large data set (~350 subjects) made up of relatively short samples (~450 characters) of free text. Experiments show that these features can recognize the cognitive demands of task that an unseen typist is engaged in, and can classify his or her demographics with better than chance accuracy. We correctly distinguish High vs. Low cognitively demanding tasks with accuracy up to 72.39%. Detection of non-native speakers of English is achieved with F1=0.462 over a baseline of 0.166, while detection of female typists reaches F1=0.524 over a baseline of 0.442. Recognition of left-handed typists achieves F1=0.223 over a baseline of 0.100. Further analyses reveal that novel relationships exist between language production as manifested through typing behavior, and both cognitive and demographic factors.

abstract = {Whiteboards facilitate coordinative practices by making information publicly accessible and thereby strengthening communication and joint commitment about it. This study investigates how coordination is accomplished in an emergency department through interactions with the whiteboard and with the coordinating nurse, who is the main keeper of the whiteboard. On the basis of observations, we find that coordination is accomplished through a highly intertwined process of technologically mediated visual overview combined with orally communicated details. The oral details serve to clarify and elaborate information at a more fine-grained level than the overview information on the whiteboard, to negotiate and reach agreement about the decisions that underlie the whiteboard information, and as a safeguard against misunderstandings and errors. This process is contingent on the clinicians tending to perceive the whiteboard and the coordinating nurse as a unit in the sense that they frequently update the whiteboard by informing the coordinating nurse about the change and, similarly, consider making a change on the whiteboard the same as having informed the coordinating nurse. These smooth transitions between instrumental and communicative coordination are central to the coordinative function of the whiteboard. We discuss this and other implications for design. ED clinicians tend to perceive the whiteboard and the coordinating nurse as one unit.Visual overview is mediated by the whiteboard, which temporarily holds information.Oral detail serves to clarify information, reach agreement and safeguard against error.},

Such visual histories are useful for a designer to reflect on a sketch, communicate ideas to others, and fork from or revert to an earlier point in the creative process. Our approach uses a bottom-up agglomerative clustering mechanism that groups adjacent frames based on their perceptual similarity while maintaining the causality of how a sketch was constructed. The resulting aggregation dendrogram can be cut at any level depending on available display space, and can be used to create a visual history consisting of either a comic strip of highlights or a single annotated summary frame. We conducted a user study comparing the speed and accuracy of participants recovering causality in a sketch history using comic strips, summary frames, and simple animations. Although animations with interaction may seem better than static graphics, our results show that both comic strip and summary frame significantly outperform animation. HighlightsWe present a history mechanism for sketching that captures drawing on a stroke level.We propose two history visualizations for sketches based on stroke clustering.One technique is a comic strip that shows sketch evolution over several frames.Another is a summary frame that numbers the changes in a single image.A user study found significant improvement for sketch summaries over animation.},

abstract = {Virtual environments (VEs) offer unique opportunities enabling users to experience real-time interactive objects and environments. Due to its dynamic three-dimensional (3D) presentation capability on two-dimensional screens, research has addressed the VE in relation to users' spatial cognitive factors. However, little is known about users' preferred cognitive modes for processing visual information and factors that affect visual cognitive processing in experiencing VEs. Research on gender differences in human-computer interaction has developed as a subfield approached from an interdisciplinary perspective that encompasses fields such as information science, marketing, neuroscience, and education. This study aims to investigate whether different visual cognitive styles influence the sense of presence (i.e., simulated experience in VEs) and how visual cognitions and presence affect user satisfaction of the 3D integrated system, as well as to uncover empirical evidence of gender influence on those relationships.A total of 181 college students (90 men, 91 women) in diverse disciplines participated in an experiment using a VE stimulus and were given a questionnaire. The questionnaire was adapted to measure participants' tendencies to use object versus spatial visualization, their sense of presence, and user satisfaction in the VE. Using multigroup structural equation modeling, we examined 3D visual information processing and gender effects. The results identify the relationship among visual cognitions, presence, and user satisfaction in VEs. We find it interesting that the results demonstrated significant gender differences in satisfaction as well as in processing visual information that influences user experience of the 3D VR embedded interface. Whereas women's object visualization style was found to affect their sense of presence in VEs; for men, it was spatial visualization. This result supports and further explains findings of previous studies suggesting that gender effects account for differences in processing visual information. We examine viewers' imagery styles on their experience of a 3D VR embedded interface.The moderating effect of gender on the relationship between visual cognitive style and presence is identified.Women's object imagery style positively affects their sense of presence.Men's spatial visualization negatively affects their sense of presence.Different experiences of the VR embedded interface by gender are from their visual information processing styles.},

This phenomena is changing the way we live, work, and interact. This creates, not only technological opportunities for smarter cities, but also interactional opportunities for the citizens. However, designing, developing, and deploying urban computing projects in the wild, outside the controlled research environment, is challenging, due to the complexity of the urban context as well as the people who live in it. What are the ways to trigger and increase the public towards active participation or technological uptake in urban computing__ __ How to design and structure participation for urban computing research and technologies in the wild for it to lead to mass participation with its citizens__ __ These are the questions that are investigated in this paper. We present a survey on existing approaches in engaging participations and devising interactions with a range of existing urban computing technologies: smartphones, public displays, cyber physical systems (including those with embedded systems, sensors, and actuators), and Internet of Things. Based on the reviews, we propose a taxonomy for categorising and characterising urban computing technologies and approaches with regards to the level of participation they stimulate, the participation scale they support, the manipulation and effects mode they enable, and the interaction mode and scale they enable. Finally, strategies for structuring and engendering participations and interactions based on our own experience from deploying small to large scale urban computing projects in the wild are presented in this paper. We present a survey on interactive and participatory approaches in urban computing.A taxonomy of existing technologies in urban computing is suggested..We consider participation level, scale, manipulation, effects, interaction modes.We present five-step strategies to engender participation in urban computing.},

abstract = {This paper presents research into new ways in which organisations can gather field-based consumer insight particularly in public spaces. In an increasingly complex and fast moving business world, there is a need for quicker and more efficient consumer experience research that also provides a wider focus on the situation under investigation as required when studying urban spaces. The paper presents a method called DiCER for using large groups of non-specialists (i.e non-ethnographers) to make fieldwork observations working in a transdisciplinary setting with ethnographers and designers. In this method, groups of people are given a small amount of training and provided with support materials that allow them to make and report observations. The method provides a way of harnessing the potential of an organisation s staff for a shared goal of generating useful fieldwork material.The method was first tried out in two studies that investigated how collaborative activity could be facilitated in large public spaces. This helped identify issues related to the design of support materials whilst conducting fieldwork and explored ways of analysing and presenting the results of such activity. A follow-up study observed the activity of conversations between strangers waiting in a railway station concourse. The aim of this was to test both the method on a more focused problem and prototype tools to support recording observations in such a context. The outcomes were prototypes and interventions demonstrating potential techniques for gathering fieldwork material.A final study explored the potential of using a group of non-specialist employees distributed across an organisation to fulfil parts of a fieldwork project. This guided the development of training sessions for people with little prior knowledge of doing fieldwork. The main output was design recommendations for further applications of the method in a similar context. New design research method for understanding consumer experience in public spaces.Based on design ethnography and developed through four studies in public spaces.Supports collaboration of ethnographers, designers and non-specialist fieldworkers.Method has three phases of activity detailing training, divergence and convergence.Provides a framework and materials to facilitate fieldwork across a large group.},

abstract = {While urban computing has often been envisaged as bridging place, technology and people, there is a gap between the micro-level of urban computing which focuses on the solitary user with technological solutions and the macro-level which proposes grand visions of making better cities for the public. The gap is one of scale of audience as well as scale of normative ambition. To bridge this gap the paper proposes a transdisciplinary approach that brings together actor-network theory with critical and participatory design to create prototypes that engage people and build publics. The theoretical discussion examines a way of thinking about size as performative and shiftable through practical design methods. The micro/macro prototyping approach is demonstrated via an empirical case study of a series of provocative prototypes which attempt to build a material public around the issue of community noise at Heathrow airport. The paper suggests that this approach allows issues to be followed and engaged with, and their dynamics re-designed across different scales. This proposes a new role and scope for the researcher/designer as proactively engaging in normative shaping and supporting of real world settings which bridge place, technology and people. HighlightsIdentifies a gap in 'scale of audience' and 'scale of normative ambition' in urban computing.Proposes a design approach using an actor-network understanding of scaling.Examines a case study of normative prototypes that reshape the issue of aircraft noise.Suggests a new scope and role for the designer as part of the networks they build.},

abstract = {This paper can be framed within the growing interest in the public dimension of technology design: it proposes a framework for the public design of urban technologies by elaborating on the concepts of digital commons, matters of concerns and engagement. The framework is discussed through the case study of a mobility application developed within a wider project of digital commons design. We contrast a Smart City approach and a urban computing one, and we argue that the latter is more fruitful in the long run, since it entails elements for the establishment of forms of recursive engagement of users, who co-produce digital commons together with technology designers as a response to their matters of concern. Applying our framework to the design of urban technologies, we conclude that design should support collaborative practices starting from the articulation of matters of concern to designing in a participatory way. HighlightsDigital commons are digital resources self-governed by concerned people.Public design is designing for publics and in the public dimension.Recursive publics are the publics recursively concerned with digital commons.Designers position themselves in relation to public issues.Urban places are an arena for the public design of digital commons.},

Although there is influential literature devoted to the subject of values and culture in Human-Computer Interaction, there is still a lack of principled and practical artifacts and methods to support researchers and practitioners in their activities. In this paper, we present a Value-oriented and Culturally Informed Approach (VCIA) to sensitize and support Computer Science and Engineering professionals in taking values and culture into consideration throughout the design of interactive systems. The approach is grounded on theoretical and methodological bases of Organizational Semiotics, Building Blocks of Culture, and Socially Aware Computing. VCIA offers a set of artifacts and methods articulated to support the design process in its different stages and activities: from the identification of stakeholders and their values, to the organization of requirements and the evaluation of the designed solution. In this paper, we present VCIA's principles, artifacts, and illustrate its usefulness in bringing values into consideration, supporting a socially aware system design.

abstract = {The term assortativity indicates the tendency, for a network node, to be directly connected to other nodes that are someway similar. In more technical terms, a given feature is assortative in a network if the probability that an arc exists between two nodes having this feature is greater than the probability that an arc exists between two generic nodes. The role of assortativity in real-world and online social networks has been largely investigated in the literature, in which, starting from degree assortativity, several forms of assortativity have been analyzed. When moving from a single-social-network to a multiple-social-network perspective, new specific traits can be studied, also under the assortativity magnifying glass. This is the case of membership overlap among networks (i.e., the fact that people belong to more online social networks) as expression of different traits of users personality. In this paper, we deal with the above issue, by defining two different measures of membership overlap assortativity, called Loose and Constrained Inter-social-network Assortativity, respectively and by observing that in two of the most representative online social networks, namely Facebook and Twitter, membership overlap is assortative. HighlightsIntroduction of two measures of membership overlap assortativity (MOA, for short).Experimental observation in Facebook and Twitter of membership overlap assortativity.MOA is source of privacy loss, helping the disclosure of implicit membership overlap.MOA opens a future issue on how information flow crossing OSNs is structured.},

Design proposals that support this task include space-filling thumbnails, faceted browsers, and textually enhanced thumbnails, amongst others. We argue that understanding the trade-offs in this space might be informed by a deep understanding of the visual search strategies that people choose given the constraints imposed by the natural ecology of images on the web, the human visual system, and the task demands. In the current paper we report, and empirically evaluate, a computational model of the strategies that people choose in response to these constraints. The model builds on previous insights concerning the human visual system and the adaptive nature of visual search. The results show that strategic parameters, including the number of features to look for, the evaluation-stopping rule, the gaze duration and the number of fixations are explained by the proposed computational model.

We investigate such factors as purchase experience, purchase intention, risk propensity, usage of various social network categories and user victimisation. The results suggest a strong positive link between purchase intention and paying attention to security notices/features on social networks. We find that higher use of narrow-purpose social networking services has a negative association with paying attention to security notices. We also show that users with higher risk propensity pay less attention to security notices/features. Finally, we find no association between purchase experience, user victimisation and perception of security notices/features. Our results provide new, and possibly more refined, evidence of the factors that influence the attention paid to security notices/features by social media users.

Previous work specific to human-agent/robot interaction has demonstrated the efficacy of implemented social behaviours, such as eye-gaze or facial gestures, for demonstrating the illusion of engagement and positively impacting interaction with a human. We describe the implementation of THAMBS, The Thinking Head Attention Model and Behavioural System, which is used to model attention controlling how a virtual agent reacts to external audio and visual stimuli within the context of an interaction with a human user. We evaluate the efficacy of THAMBS for a virtual agent mounted on a robotic platform in a controlled experimental setting, and collect both task- and behavioural-performance variables, along with self-reported ratings of engagement. Our results show that human subjects noticeably engaged more often, and in more interesting ways, with the robotic agent when THAMBS was activated, indicating that even a rudimentary display of attention by the robot elicits significantly increased attention by the human. Back-channelling had less of an effect on user behaviour. THAMBS and back-channelling did not interact and neither had an effect on self-report ratings. Our results concerning THAMBS hold implications for the design of successful human-robot interactive behaviours.

abstract = {Full body gestures provide alternative input to video games that are more natural and intuitive. However, full-body game gestures designed by developers may not always be the most suitable gestures available. A key challenge in full-body game gestural interfaces lies in how to design gestures such that they accommodate the intensive, dynamic nature of video games, e.g., several gestures may need to be executed simultaneously using different body parts. This paper investigates suitable simultaneous full-body game gestures, with the aim of accommodating high interactivity during intense gameplay. Three user studies were conducted: first, to determine user preferences, a user-elicitation study was conducted where participants were asked to define gestures for common game actions/commands; second, to identify suitable and alternative body parts, participants were asked to rate the suitability of each body part (one and two hands, one and two legs, head, eyes, and torso) for common game actions/commands; third, to explore the consensus of suitable simultaneous gestures, we proposed a novel choice-based elicitation approach where participants were asked to mix and match gestures from a predefined list to produce their preferred simultaneous gestures. Our key findings include (i) user preferences of game gestures, (ii) a set of suitable and alternative body parts for common game actions/commands, (iii) a consensus set of simultaneous full-body game gestures that assist interaction in different interactive game situations, and (iv) generalized design guidelines for future full-body game interfaces. These results can assist designers and practitioners to develop more effective full-body game gestural interfaces or other highly interactive full-body gestural interfaces. HighlightsWe examine suitable simultaneous full-body game gestures.We found a difference between gamers and non-gamers in their performed gestures.We provide a set of suitable and alternative body parts for common game actions/commands.We provide a set of user-defined simultaneous gestures.We propose a novel choice-based elicitation approach for assisting users in defining simultaneous full-body gestures.},

In order to integrate IoT into Chinese daily use, this study also investigated how Chinese users interact with things and IoT technologies. A four-phase study among users living in Beijing was conducted with a lifecycle of user-centered design. Results revealed that SWoT could activate users intuitive understanding of social network services, and make the interaction with SWoT natural in their own ways. Users living in Beijing tended to be utility-oriented and highly emphasized efficiency; they were distinctive in uncertainty avoidance and preference of hierarchical way of managing things. Our results suggested implications for the design of user-centered IoT systems in China, and shed light on improvements for the performance of IoT systems and balance of requirements between users and system design. HighlightsWe designed SWoT to enable users to interact with smart objects as in SNS.A complete lifecycle of user-centered design was conducted.SWoT is accepted as a private, family-based tool targeting utility and efficiency.Chinese emphasize controlled uncertainty and hierarchical structure in SWoT design.Efficiency, consistency, and perceived privacy are universal user requirements.},

abstract = {Multitasking and interruptions have been studied using a variety of methods in multiple fields (e.g., HCI, cognitive science, computer science, and social sciences). This diversity brings many complementary insights. However, it also challenges researchers to understand how seemingly disparate ideas can best be integrated to further theory and to inform the design of interactive systems. There is therefore a need for a platform to discuss how different approaches to understanding multitasking and interruptions can be combined to provide insights that are more than the sum of their parts. In this article we argue for the necessity of an integrative approach. As part of this argument we provide an overview of articles in this special issue on multitasking and interruptions. These articles showcase the variety of methods currently used to study multitasking and interruptions. It is clear that there are many challenges to studying multitasking and interruptions from different perspectives and using different techniques.

abstract = {In this article, we study how drivers interact with in-car interfaces, particularly by focusing on understanding driver in-car glance behavior when multitasking while driving. The work focuses on using an in-car touch screen to find a target item from a large number of unordered visual items spread across multiple screens. We first describe a cognitive model that aims to represent a driver s visual sampling strategy when interacting with an in-car display. The proposed strategy assumes that drivers are aware of the passage of time during the search task; they try to adjust their glances at the display to a time limit, after which they switch back to the driving task; and they adjust their time limits based on their performance in the current driving environment. For visual search, the model assumes a random starting point, inhibition of return, and a search strategy that always seeks the nearest uninspected item. We validate the model s predictions with empirical data collected in two driving simulator studies with eye tracking. The results of the empirical study suggest that the visual design of in-car displays can have a significant impact on the probability of distraction. In particular, the results suggest that designers should try to minimize total task durations and the durations of all visual encoding steps required for an in-car task, as well as minimize the distance between visual display elements that are encoded one after the other. The cognitive model helps to explain gaze allocation strategies for performing in-car tasks while driving, and thus helps to quantify the effects of task duration and visual item spacing on safety-critical in-car glance durations. We study drivers in-car glance behavior when multitasking while driving.We describe a cognitive model that represents driver s visual sampling strategy.Model s predictions were studied against data from two driving simulator studies.Task length and visual item spacing are critical factors for in-car glance lengths.The model helps explain drivers gaze allocation strategies while multitasking.},

abstract = {The abundance of communication technology, such as the omnipresence of cell phones, has not only increased our ability to reach people anytime anywhere, but also the likelihood of being interrupted. As a result, there is value in understanding how to design technology so that gains are realized from desired interruptions, while the losses from unwanted interruptions are minimized. This paper presents the findings of two complementary field studies, one quantitative and the other qualitative, exploring how the provision of additional incoming cell phone call information impacts people s interruption decision making. These studies were enabled by, Telling Calls, a research application built to enable users to provide and receive information such as what the call is about and the caller s circumstances. The qualitative study showed how the additional call information helps people make informed call handling decisions and acts as an aid to effective conversation. The quantitative study elucidated these findings and showed that reducing the uncertainty about the nature of an incoming call improves people s ability to predict the value of an interruption. By combining these diverse research approaches: (1) theory instantiation through tool building; (2) context-aware surveys; and (3) semi-structured interviews, we were able to gain unique insights into the nature of interruption management in the wild, and related design implications.

abstract = {This paper investigates how individual perceptions and attitudes about an organization influence multitasking behaviors in the workplace. While we know that individuals are significantly influenced in their behaviors by the characteristics of their organizations (e.g. ICTs, organizational structure, physical layout), we still do not know much about how the way individuals interpret their organization influences their multitasking behaviors. Thus, we specifically hypothesize that the individual perception of the organizational preferences for multitasking (i.e. organizational polychronicity) engenders the actual multitasking behaviors that an individual enacts in the workplace. We also hypothesize that the attachment to the organization (i.e. organizational identification) moderates the above relationship. We conducted a mixed method study in two knowledge intensive organizations (an R&amp;D Unit and a University Department) and collected data through a survey, diaries, and semi-structured interviews. Our findings support the first hypothesis but not the moderating role of organizational identification. However, this latter is directly related to how much a person is willing to work on multiple activities on a single day. Further, our study suggests that not only the organizational context should be investigated in the study of multitasking behaviors, but also the larger work context, including the individuals' professional communities. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical and practical implications as well as methodological reflections on mixing methods in the study of multitasking in organizations. We explore how the interpretation of the organization influences multitasking.We adopt mixed methods, i.e. a survey, diary data and semi-structured interviews.We find a positive relation between organizational polychronicity and multitasking.We also explore how organizational identification moderates such relationship.Identification has a direct effect on the number of tasks a person undertakes daily.},

abstract = {Our research explores how interruptive notifications support task management in a desktop environment. We conducted two user studies with a community of open source software users and developers to explore their experience with interruptive notifications. We found that certain kinds of notifications support multitasking, task prioritization, task management, as well as influence task disruption management. We discuss how these behaviors affect the notification-task management user experience and offer design guidelines derived from these results to inform better design of systems that interrupt through notification. User Experience Reports are a method that collects detail of the interruptive notification experience in the user s natural environment.Not all notifications are a negative; in fact, notifications are often a positive, useful experience when designed well.Features such as integration at the desktop system-level and the ability to view a history of past notifications provide great value in task managementThe KDE notification system and its users provide a rich use case of knowledge workers utilizing interruptive notifications in task management.},

abstract = {Using a microworld simulation of maritime decision making, we compared two decision support systems (DSS) in their impact upon recovery from interruption. The Temporal Overview Display (TOD) and Change History Table (CHT) - designed to support temporal awareness and change detection, respectively - have previously proven useful in improving situation awareness; however, evaluation of support tools for multitasking environments should not be limited to the specific aspects of the task that they were designed to augment. Using a combination of performance, self-report, and eye-tracking measures, we find that both DSS counter-intuitively have a negative effect on performance. Resumption lags are increased, elevated post-interruption decision-making times persist for longer, and defensive effectiveness is impaired relative to No-DSS. Eye-tracking measures indicate that in the baseline condition, participants tend to encode the visual display more broadly, where as those in the two DSS conditions may have experienced a degree of attentional tunnelling due to high workload. We suggest that for a support tool to be beneficial it should ease the burden on attentional resources so that these can be used for reconstructing a mental model of the post-interruption scene. We use a maritime microworld to study multitasking and interruption recovery.We use a holistic approach in the assessment of two DSS.We use a combination of performance, self-report and eye tracking measures.Both DSS impair defensive effectiveness and prolong interruption recovery.},

abstract = {Much of the large and growing body of literature on interruption and multitasking is motivated, in part, by a desire to reduce their negative effects in occupational settings, particularly those that are safety critical. Much of the existing knowledge has come from experimental studies, however, these do not necessarily generalize to non-experimental contexts. By virtue of being in situ, the results of observational studies are more generalizable, but internal validity remains an issue. Since many of the quantitative observational studies of interruption or multitasking to date have been largely descriptive, their full potential to contribute knowledge that informs practical improvements has been underutilized. We discuss ways to address threats to internal validity in quantitative observational studies through appropriate analysis with particular reference to workflow time studies, a form of direct observation. We also discuss the potential for more sophisticated analysis methods to both address some of the threats to internal validity and to provide more nuanced insights into the role and impacts of interruption and multitasking. In this way observational studies can contribute unique evidence to facilitate practical improvements to work practices and systems. Understanding interruption and multitasking can enable improvement to work practice.Quantitative observational studies give unique insights into interruption and multitasking.We discuss how the validity of workflow time studies can be improved.We outline innovative ways of quantitatively analysing observational data on work processes.},

abstract = {Two experiments used a spatial navigation task to study the relationship between individual differences in working memory capacity and interrupted task performance. The results of experiment one show that participants with low working memory capacity (WMC) are more susceptible to the negative effects of interruptions than participants with high WMC. The results of additional analyses indicate that both groups differ in their strategies used to memorize material from the primary task. A second experiment manipulated memory strategy use for high and low memory span participants and found that low span participants performed at the level of high spans when using a strategy that is more typically used by high span participants. However, this performance improvement did not show during interrupted tasks. Overall, these results suggest that individual memory capacity differences affect performance during interrupted tasks by determining selection of memory strategies and by limiting performance of participants. A new paradigm was developed to study task interruptions.Memory differences affect strategy selection and success in dealing with interruptions.Individual memory differences affect performance during interrupted tasks.},

The model is based on a meta-analytic integration of 31 experiments from the literature on applied task switching. Consistent trends from the meta-analysis, to avoid switching, and to switch to tasks lower difficulty, along with greater salience, priority and interest are used to set polarity parameters in the mathematical model. A decision model of multi-task attention switching is presented.The model posits that task switching is based on attractiveness attributes of alternative tasks, related to salience, difficulty, interest and priority.A fundamental bias against task switching is included.The weights and polarity of these attributes are based on two meta-analyses of applied task switching data, which are presented.},

abstract = {We examined effects of adding brief (1 second) lags between trials in a task designed to study errors in interrupted sequential performance. These randomly occurring lags could act as short breaks and improve performance or as short interruptions and impair performance. The lags improved placekeeping accuracy, and to interpret this effect we developed a cognitive model of placekeeping operations, which accounts for the effect in terms of the lag making memory for recent performance more distinct. Self-report data suggest that rehearsal was the dominant strategy for maintaining placekeeping information during interruptions, and we incorporate a rehearsal mechanism in the model. To evaluate the model we developed a simple new goodness-of-fit test based on analysis of variance that offers an inferential basis for rejecting models that do not accommodate effects of experimental manipulations. Brief, unfilled lags between trials improve placekeeping accuracy on the post-lag trialA model of the effect attributes it to sharpened memory for recent performance, with implications for interpreting speed-accuracy tradeoffs more generallyA model evaluation technique is developed that tests goodness of fit inferentially and helps identify incorrect theoretical assumptions},

abstract = {Interruptions and distractions are a feature of work in most complex sociotechnical systems in which people must handle multiple threads of work. Over the last 10-15 years there has been a crescendo of reviews and investigations into the impact that interruptions and distractions have on safety-critical aspects of healthcare work, such as medication administration, but findings are still inconclusive. Despite this, many healthcare communities have taken steps to reduce interruptions and distractions in safety-critical work tasks, a step that will usually do no harm but that may have unintended consequences. Investigations with a higher yield of certainty would provide better evidence and better guidance to healthcare communities. In this viewpoint paper we survey some key papers reporting investigations of interruptions and distractions in the field, in simulators, and in the laboratory. We also survey reports of field interventions aimed at minimizing interruptions and distractions with the intention of improving the safety of medication administration and other safety-critical healthcare tasks. To analyse the papers adopting each form of investigation, we use the three dimensions of fidelity, formal control exercised, and the potential generalizability to the field. We argue that studies of interruptions and distractions outside the healthcare clinical context, but intended to generalize to it, should become more formally representative of the cognitive context of healthcare work. Research would be improved if investigators undertook programs of studies that successively achieve fidelity, control, and potential generalizability, or if they strengthened the design of individual studies. Interruptions in healthcare are studied in the field, simulators, and laboratory.The goal is to test whether interruptions can harm clinicians and their patients.Methods used vary in fidelity, control exercised, and potential generalizability.Studies with low fidelity should be more representative of healthcare work.Research would be improved by programs of studies and improving individual studies.},

Despite the fact that many gestures require frequently dragging, pinching, spreading, and rotating the finger-tips, there currently does not exist a human performance model describing this interaction. In this paper, a novel user performance model is derived for virtual object manipulation on touch-sensitive displays, which involves simultaneous translation, rotation, and scaling of the object. Two controlled experiments with dual-finger unimanual manipulations were conducted to validate the new model. The results indicate that the model fits the experimental data well (with R2 and R values above 0.9), and performs the best among several alternative models. Moreover, based on the analysis of the empirical data, the simultaneity nature of manipulation in the task is explored and several design implications are provided. HighlightsWe propose a quantitative model for unimanual dual-finger multi-touch manipulations.We conduct two formal experiments to explore the task nature and validate the model.Experimental results and comparisons indicate the excellent performance of our model.In-depth analysis and discussion provide insights of the task and implications for design.},

abstract = {Video-oculography gaze tracking permits the monitoring of a computer user s point of regard (PoR) on the screen by tracking with a video camera the centre of the pupil and patterns of infrared reflections on the cornea. Gaze tracking has been used as an alternative to traditional pointing mechanisms during human computer interaction. Gaze direction provides also an implicit but imprecise hint about intention. This work uses gaze as a source of information about user s intention. We explore how to benefit from behind the scenes gaze tracking in a web browsing scenario by employing the user s PoR to prefetch URLs of potential future interest. Our working hypothesis is that before clicking on a URL of interest, the user would have previously fixated at the URL and/or the surrounding area. Hence, using gaze data to prefetch URLs can speed up web navigation and increase user comfort. The results of our experiments show that browsing the web using prefetching of web content based on gaze activity is in fact faster than traditional browsing. The caveat of our approach is that the network traffic volume increases as a result of the prefetching activity occurring in the browser s background. We have also carried out additional experiments to find out the optimal trade-off between speed gain and network traffic increase in a prefetching scenario. Leveraging upon the positive results of our experiments, we postulate the idea of an attentive computer system that monitors users gaze and takes preventive or assertive action in terms of what the user is likely to do next based on the direction of gaze. To our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study on the concept of prefetching content of potential future interest in advance using the information gathered by monitoring a user s gaze. HighlightsPropose method to speed up web browsing speed by monitoring user s gaze during HCI.Links gazed at are prefetched on browser s background during web browsing.If prefetched links are clicked by the user, the already downloaded content is displayed instantly by the browser.Carry out user study to quantify the advantages of the prefetching method.Additional experiments carried out to find the optimal trade-off between speed gain and network traffic increase.},

abstract = {Print interpreting supports people with a hearing disability by giving them access to spoken language. In print interpreting, the interpreter types the spoken text in real time for the hard-of-hearing client to read. This results in dynamic text presentation. An eye movement study was conducted to compare two types of dynamic text presentation formats in print interpreting: letter-by-letter and word-by-word. Gaze path analysis with 20 hearing participants showed different types of reading behaviour during reading of two pieces of text in these two presentation formats. Our analysis revealed that the text presentation format has a significant effect on reading behaviour. Rereading and regressions occurred significantly more often with the word-by-word format than with the letter-by-letter format. We also found a significant difference between the number of regressions starting at the words that end a sentence and that of regressions starting at all other words. The frequency of rereading was significantly higher for incorrectly typed or abbreviated words than for the other words. Analysis of the post-test questionnaire found almost equal acceptance of the word-by-word and letter-by-letter formats by the participants. A follow-up study with 18 hard-of-hearing participants showed a similar trend in results. The findings of this study highlight the importance of developing print interpreting tools that allow the interpreter and the client to choose the options that best facilitate the communication. They also bring up the need to develop new eye movement metrics for analysing the reading of dynamic text, and provide first results on a new dynamic presentation context. Significantly more regressions with word-by-word format than with letter-by-letter.Regressions starting at the words that end a sentence were more than other words.Rereading was more with incorrectly typed or abbreviated words than other words.Text presentation format has a significant effect on reading behaviour.},

We examined whether allowing the user to control the process of fusing or integrating different algorithms (i.e., different sources of relevance) resulted in increased engagement and a better user experience. The essential contribution of this research stems from the results of a user study (N=40) of controllability in a scenario where users could fuse different recommendation approaches, with the possibility of inspecting and filtering the items recommended. First, we introduce an interactive Venn diagram visualization, which combined with sliders, can provide an efficient visual paradigm for information filtering. Second, we provide a three-fold evaluation of the user experience: objective metrics, subjective user perception, and behavioral measures. Through the analysis of these metrics, we confirmed results from recent studies, such as the effect of trusting propensity on accepting the recommendations and also unveiled the importance of features such as being a native speaker. Our results present several implications for the design and implementation of user-controllable personalized systems. We explored user-controllable interfaces as extension of traditional-ranked lists.We introduced SetFusion, a controllable interface with sliders and a Venn diagram.We conducted a controlled user study on online conference article recommendation.Our evaluation had three dimensions: users' perception, behavioral and IR metrics.Controllable interface had a positive effect influenced by users' characteristics.},

On the generative side, we explore the expressive capabilities of an abstract, faceless, creature-like robot, with very few degrees of freedom, lacking both facial expressions and the complex humanoid design found often in emotionally expressive robots. We validate our system in a series of experiments: in one study, we find an advantage in classification for animated vs static affect expressions and advantages in valence and arousal estimation and personal preference ratings for both animated vs static and physical vs on-screen expressions. In a second experiment, we show that our parametrically generated expression variables correlate with the intended user affect perception. Combining the generative system with a perceptual component of natural language sentiment analysis, we show in a third experiment that our automatically generated affect responses cause participants to show signs of increased engagement and enjoyment compared with arbitrarily chosen comparable motion parameters.

However, persuasion profiling can also be implemented using implicit, behavioral measures of user traits.

abstract = {The effects of physical embodiment and physical presence were explored through a survey of 33 experimental works comparing how people interacted with physical robots and virtual agents. A qualitative assessment of the direction of quantitative effects demonstrated that robots were more persuasive and perceived more positively when physically present in a user s environment than when digitally-displayed on a screen either as a video feed of the same robot or as a virtual character analog; robots also led to better user performance when they were collocated as opposed to shown via video on a screen. However, participants did not respond differently to physical robots and virtual agents when both were displayed digitally on a screen - suggesting that physical presence, rather than physical embodiment, characterizes people s responses to social robots. Implications for understanding psychological response to physical and virtual agents and for methodological design are discussed. Survey identified 33 works exploring user responses to physical robots and virtual agents.Robot agents had greater influence when physically present than telepresent.No differences were found between physical robots displayed on a screen and virtual agents that looked similar.Physical presence, but not physical embodiment alone, resulted in more favorable responses from participants.},

abstract = {We develop and evaluate three interfaces for video search of articulated objects, specifically humans performing common actions. The three interfaces, (1) a freehand interface with motion cues (e.g., arrows), (2) an articulated human stick figure with motion cues, and (3) a keyframe interface, were designed to allow users to quickly generate motion-based queries. We performed both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the interfaces through a formal user study by measuring accuracy and speed of user input and asking the users to complete a free-response questionnaire. Our results indicate that the constrained interfaces outperform the freehand sketch-based interface, in terms of both search accuracy and query completion time. Additionally, the users described strong preferences for the search interfaces containing pre-defined models, and the generated queries were rated higher, in terms of semantic matches to the query concept. HighlightsWe develop three interfaces for video search of articulated objects.Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of each interface.Constrained interfaces outperform the freehand sketch-based interface.Users indicated strong preferences for search interfaces containing pre-defined models.},

abstract = {ObjectivesThis study aimed to evaluate the usefulness of adaptive customization support in a natural work environment: the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS) in radiology. MethodsAdaptive support was given in the form of customization suggestions, generated based on behavioral user data, which participants could choose to accept or ignore. Twelve radiologists worked with the standard adaptable version of the PACS for six weeks, during which their actions on the PACS interface were logged. Based on these logging data, customization support was generated for each specific participant. Half of the participants received support and half did not. After the support was given, logging continued for another six weeks. Participants customization behavior and performance, measured as the average time needed to review a radiography study, were compared between the groups. Subjective responses to the customization support were also measured. ResultsParticipants who received support used the PACS s customization facilities more effectively than participants who did not receive support. Participants receiving support accepted most of the customization suggestions and all participants indicated that the support was useful. We did not find an increase in efficiency due to the support, possibly because the performance measure we used was not sensitive enough. Subjective responses did show that participants perceived the support as increasing their efficiency. ConclusionAdaptive customization support would be a useful addition to the standard adaptable PACS interface, because it allows radiologists to customize their interface more effectively. Radiologists do not always customize their user interface effectively.They sometimes do not customize at all.Adaptive customization support improves radiologists customization effectiveness.Radiologists have a positive attitude towards adaptive customization support.},

abstract = {Emotional experience has become an important topic in human-technology interaction research and design. Nevertheless, such research and design often lacks a proper explanatory basis and methodologically robust operationalisation. In this article, a conceptualisation of emotional user experience is formulated based on the appraisal theory of emotion, where the goal congruence of the interaction events and the task-independent individual traits are thought to underlie the user's emotional response. A laboratory study with N=50 participants conducting ordinary computer tasks is reported. The results suggest that subjective emotional experience depends on a number of factors relating to individual differences in coping and task events. Emotional user experience, as analysed according to a competence-frustration model of emotion, is dependent on the user s technological problem-solving tendency, frustration tendency, pre-task self-confidence, and task performance. Individual differences in emotional responses in human-technology interaction were investigated.Competence is affected by individual differences in planful problem solving trait.Frustration is affected by individual differences in frustration tendency trait.Self-confidence of the user affects emotional user experience.},

abstract = {Two important automation characteristics are crucial when considering human performance consequences of automation support. One characteristic concerns the function allocation (FA) between human and automation. Adverse effects of automation seem to be most likely when the human operator is taken out-of-the-loop from active decision-making, excessing a boundary from information automation to decision automation. The second characteristic is the reliability of automation. Previous research suggests a critical reliability boundary around 70% below which automation support cannot be considered as helpful. This study explored differential effects of crossing both boundaries at the same time. Within a multi-task simulation consisting of a monitoring task and two concurrent tasks, participants were assigned to one of six groups, two manual control groups and four automation-supported groups. Automation support differed with respect to FA (stage 1 vs stage 4 automation) and reliability (68.75% vs 87.5%), both factors varied across the critical boundaries. Results suggest that reliability determines human operators attention allocation and performance. When reliability was below the boundary, participants showed an increased attentional effort and a worse performance compared to fairly reliable support. Against the stated assumptions, FA did not reveal any impact. In combination with previous research this result might indicate that the FA boundary might rather be some kind of "function allocation valley" concerning decision-making automation (stage 3) in which negative consequences for human operators are most likely. Results are discussed in the context of recent automation research. Research suggests two boundaries that determine if automation is beneficial.1. Adverse effects of automation are most likely when decision-making is automated.2. Automation less reliable than 70% cannot be considered as helpful.We crossed both boundaries at the same time: function allocation (FA) and reliability.Reliability determined attention allocation and performance, FA showed no impact.},

abstract = {A common perception is that online dating systems "match" people on the basis of profiles containing demographic and psychographic information and/or user interests. In contrast, product recommender systems are typically based on Collaborative Filtering, suggesting purchases not based on "content" but on the purchases of "similar" users. In this paper, we study Collaborative Filtering for people-to-people recommendation in online dating, comparing this approach to a baseline Profile Matching method. Initial data analysis highlights the problem of over-recommending popular users, a standard problem for Collaborative Filtering applied to product recommendation, but more acute in people-to-people recommendation. We address this problem with a two-stage recommender process that employs a Decision Tree derived from interactions data as a "critic" to re-rank candidates generated by Collaborative Filtering. Our baseline Profile Matching method dynamically chooses, for each user, attributes that contribute most significantly to successful interactions with candidates having the best matching attribute value. The key evaluation metric is success rate improvement, the increase in the chance of a user having a successful interaction when acting on recommendations. Our methods were first evaluated on historical data from a large online dating site and then trialled live over a 9 week period providing recommendations via e-mail to a large number of users. The trial confirmed the consistency of the analysis on historical data and the ability of our Collaborative Filtering method to generate suitable candidates over an extended period. Moreover, the Collaborative Filtering method gives a higher success rate improvement than Profile Matching. Author-HighlightsCollaborative Filtering is feasible for people-to-people recommendation.Collaborative Filtering improves users success rates more than Profile Matching.A general method is given to avoid over-recommending highly popular users.Collaborative Filtering and Profile Matching have been validated in a live trial.Performance of methods in the live trial setting is consistent over time.},

abstract = {Nowadays, there is a wide variety of e-learning repositories that provide digital resources for education in the form of learning objects. Some of these systems provide recommender systems in order to help users in the search for and selection of the learning objects most appropriate to their individual needs. The search for and recommendation of learning objects are usually viewed as a solitary and individual task. However, a collaborative search can be more effective than an individual search in some situations - for example, when developing a digital course between a group of instructors. The problem of recommending learning objects to a group of users or instructors is much more difficult than the traditional problem of recommending to only one individual. To resolve this problem, this paper proposes a collaborative methodology for searching, selecting, rating and recommending learning objects. Additionally, voting aggregation strategies and meta-learning techniques are used in order to automatically obtain the final ratings without having to reach a consensus between all the instructors. A functional model has been implemented within the DELPHOS hybrid recommender system. Finally, various experiments have been carried out using 50 different groups in order to validate the proposed learning object group recommendation approach. A collaborative methodology for searching, selecting, rating and recommending learning objects.Voting aggregation strategies and meta-learning techniques are used in order to automatically obtain or predict the final ratings.A functional prototype system has been implemented and tested with 50 different groups of users.},

Especially the perceived feedback usefulness determines its positive effects. In today s digitalized world, feedback is more often given electronically, i.e. computer-mediated or even automated by computer systems. Those feedback interventions effect on perceptions resulting from the difference of communication media is essentially considered by the concept of social presence. However, information systems (IS) research lacks a structured evaluation of possible design choices of feedback media, their influence on the social presence and subsequent effect on the perceived feedback usefulness. To close this research gap, we conduct a laboratory experiment with 43 participants in which we analyze six different design choices for feedback media. We applied a 2\'{\i} 3 experimental design covering the feedback source (human, non-human feedback) and media richness (text, audio, and video). We show that social presence directly and mediated by the perceived trustworthiness of feedback on simple IT-based tasks impacts perceived feedback usefulness. Our study concludes by outlining opportunities for future research and practical implications for human and non-human (i.e. automated) feedback. We model the link between social presence and perceived feedback usefulness.We analyze six different feedback design choices with respect to social presence.We find that social presence is dependent on media richness and feedback source.Social presence is an important factor determining perceived feedback usefulness.This effect is partly mediated by perceived trustworthiness of the feedback.},

abstract = {As technology advances, robots and virtual agents will be introduced into the home and healthcare settings to assist individuals, both young and old, with everyday living tasks. Understanding how users recognize an agent s social cues is therefore imperative, especially in social interactions. Facial expression, in particular, is one of the most common non-verbal cues used to display and communicate emotion in on-screen agents (Cassell et al., 2000). Age is important to consider because age-related differences in emotion recognition of human facial expression have been supported (Ruffman et al., 2008), with older adults showing a deficit for recognition of negative facial expressions. Previous work has shown that younger adults can effectively recognize facial emotions displayed by agents (Bartneck and Reichenbach, 2005; Courgeon et al., 2009, 2011; Breazeal, 2003); however, little research has compared in-depth younger and older adults' ability to label a virtual agent s facial emotions, an import consideration because social agents will be required to interact with users of varying ages. If such age-related differences exist for recognition of virtual agent facial expressions, we aim to understand if those age-related differences are influenced by the intensity of the emotion, dynamic formation of emotion (i.e., a neutral expression developing into an expression of emotion through motion), or the type of virtual character differing by human-likeness. Study 1 investigated the relationship between age-related differences, the implication of dynamic formation of emotion, and the role of emotion intensity in emotion recognition of the facial expressions of a virtual agent (iCat). Study 2 examined age-related differences in recognition expressed by three types of virtual characters differing by human-likeness (non-humanoid iCat, synthetic human, and human). Study 2 also investigated the role of configural and featural processing as a possible explanation for age-related differences in emotion recognition. First, our findings show age-related differences in the recognition of emotions expressed by a virtual agent, with older adults showing lower recognition for the emotions of anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral. These age-related difference might be explained by older adults having difficulty discriminating similarity in configural arrangement of facial features for certain emotions; for example, older adults often mislabeled the similar emotions of fear as surprise. Second, our results did not provide evidence for the dynamic formation improving emotion recognition; but, in general, the intensity of the emotion improved recognition. Lastly, we learned that emotion recognition, for older and younger adults, differed by character type, from best to worst: human, synthetic human, and then iCat. Our findings provide guidance for design, as well as the development of a framework of age-related differences in emotion recognition. Age-related differences in emotion recognition transcend human faces to virtual agent faces.Dynamic formation of emotion did not increase emotion recognition for younger and older adults.Emotion recognition was highest for human characters, and lowest for virtual agent faces.Differences in emotion recognition may be due to featural processing.},

The model aims to enable simulation of multimodal human-computer interaction for automatic usability evaluation. The experimental results indicate that modality efficiency and input performance are important moderators of modality choice. Accordingly, we establish a utility-driven model that provides probability estimations of modality usage, based on the parameters of modality efficiency and input performance. Four variants of the model that differ in training data are fitted by means of Sequential Least Squares Programming. The analysis reveals a considerable fit regarding averaged modality usage. When applied to individual modality usage profiles, the accuracy decreases significantly. In an application example it is shown how the modality choice mechanism can be deployed for simulating interaction in the field of automatic usability evaluation. Results and possible limitations are discussed. Decreased input performance of a specific modality, decreases the usage of this modality.Decreased efficiency of the GUI, increases VUI usage.A model predicting modality choice is proposed.The model can be deployed for automatic usability evaluation.System designers are provided with working knowledge about expected modality usage.},

abstract = {Improvements in executive functions appear to have a strong impact on preschool learning activities and academic performance. This paper presents some experiences in training working memory and attentional control supported by an educational software system called APRENDO. The aims were to assess the suitability of the APRENDO system as a computer-based learning system in terms of improvements in these two executive functions, and to establish whether the tasks help children - especially children with the poorest performance - in a school task requiring the use of both processes. The participants were 52 four-year-old children, divided into a control group and an experimental group. The experimental group trained with two types of APRENDO visuospatial exercises: "Find the different objects" and "Find the intruder". Before and after the training phase, all the children performed a school task with similar psychological demands selected from their ordinary school materials. The results of both APRENDO exercises showed positive correlations between the same variables over the training sessions, demonstrating the suitability of the exercises. On the other hand, in the experimental group, there were significant differences between some of the variables analyzed, e.g., the time needed to complete the exercises ("Answering time") or the number of clicks on the correct images ("Answer accuracy") in both exercises during the sessions. The results indicate that the children who obtained lower scores in the pre-test phase were those who benefitted the most from training. The analysis of the errors made by the children in both tasks suggests that these errors are due to the incorrect application of the same cognitive abilities. The implications for educational practice are discussed.

abstract = {Our present understanding of young children's touch-screen performance is still limited, as only few studies have considered analyzing children's touch interaction patterns so far. In this work, we address children aged between 3 and 6 years old during their preoperational stage according to Piaget's cognitive developmental theory, and we report their touch-screen performance with standard tap and drag and drop interactions on smart phones and tablets. We show significant improvements in children's touch performance as they grow from 3 to 6 years, and point to performance differences between children and adults. We correlate children's touch performance expressed with task completion times and target acquisition accuracy with sensorimotor evaluations that characterize children's finger dexterity and graphomotor and visuospatial processing abilities, and report significant correlations. Our observations are drawn from the largest children touch dataset available in the literature, consisting in data collected from 89 children and an additional 30 young adults to serve as comparison. We use our findings to recommend guidelines for designing touch-screen interfaces for children by adopting the new perspective of sensorimotor abilities. We release our large dataset into the interested community for further studies on children's touch input behavior. It is our hope that our findings on the little-studied age group of 3- to 6-year-olds together with the companion dataset will contribute toward a better understanding of children's touch interaction behavior and toward improved touch interface designs for small-age children. HighlightsWe investigate small-age children's touch performance on smart phones and tablets.Children's touch performance improves significantly from 3 to 6 years.We discuss findings in terms of Piaget's preoperational developmental stage.We recommend design guidelines by considering children's sensorimotor skills.Dataset released for the largest children touch-screen study up to date (89 children).},

abstract = {There has been recent interest on the impact of emotional expressions of computers on people's decision making. However, despite a growing body of empirical work, the mechanism underlying such effects is still not clearly understood. To address this issue the paper explores two kinds of processes studied by emotion theorists in human-human interaction: inferential processes, whereby people retrieve information from emotion expressions about other's beliefs, desires, and intentions; affective processes, whereby emotion expressions evoke emotions in others, which then influence their decisions. To tease apart these two processes as they occur in human-computer interaction, we looked at physiological measures (electrodermal activity and heart rate deceleration). We present two experiments where participants engaged in social dilemmas with embodied agents that expressed emotion. Our results show, first, that people's decisions were influenced by affective and cognitive processes and, according to the prevailing process, people behaved differently and formed contrasting subjective ratings of the agents; second we show that an individual trait known as electrodermal lability, which measures people's physiological sensitivity, predicted the extent to which affective or inferential processes dominated the interaction. We discuss implications for the design of embodied agents and decision making systems that use emotion expression to enhance interaction between humans and computers. We show that computers' emotional displays have a deep impact on people's decision making.We show that these effects of emotion displays occur through affective and cognitive processes.These processes can lead to distinct decision behavior and subjective impressions.Electrodermal lability, an individual trait, predicts which process dominates the interaction.},

abstract = {Community-based co-design takes place within a communal value system and opens up a new debate around the principles of participation and its benefits within HCI4D and ICTD projects. This study contributes to a current gap of expression of participants' gains, especially from an indigenous and marginalized rural communities' perspective. We have collected community viewpoints concurrently over the past five years of our longitudinal research project in rural Namibia. A number of themes have emerged out of the data as extracted by our native researcher, such as the special importance of learning technology, appreciation of the common project goal, the intrinsic pleasure of participation, frustrations about exclusions and other concerns, as well as immediate rewards and expectations of gaining resources. We acknowledge our own bias in the curation of viewpoints, and incompleteness of subjectivities while embedding our discussion within a local contextual interpretation. Through our learning from the communities we argue for a shift in perspective that acknowledges local epistemologies in HCI and participatory design and research. We suggest considering harmony and humanness as the primary values guiding community-based interactions. We discuss several challenges in the collaboration and co-creation of new knowledge at the frontier of multiple cultural, linguist, research and design paradigms. In the absence of generalized guidelines we suggest to pursue local workability while producing trans-contextual credibility.

abstract = {Social practice art may suggest new understandings of and strategies for participation in HCI-but not in a straightforward way. Based on participant-observation at a major arts festival, we describe how a set of artists, concerned with environmental issues and community engagement, frame and enact participation, and describe how the nature of this participation deviated from both artists' and our ideas of what participation would be. We delineate how the disciplinary context of art both enables and limits the kinds of participation that can be achieved. We characterize 3 strategies these artists use to achieve participation: participation in spectacle, participation in making, and participation in inquiry. We develop the implications of this work to inform HCI through three case studies related to sustainability - spectacle computing, heirloom computing, and citizen science - to demonstrate the potential for similar strategies for participation and to call attention to how HCI, too, implicitly constructs, enables, and constrains participation. Participation in social practice art is enabled by disciplinary structures.Participation in social practice art is also constrained by disciplinary structures.HCI could fruitfully recognize/negotiate how our discipline enacts participation.Three arts strategies map to HCI: participation in spectacle, making, and inquiry.},

We then deployed the system in a four week log study of 26 participants' actual file retrievals on their personal computers. Follow-up interviews contextualised the findings. Results are presented in two sections focusing on the files (the number of files, patterns of revisitation, file types, etc.) and on the interface mechanisms used to retrieve them (file browsers, search tools, 'recent files' lists, etc.). We conclude by discussing implications for the design of next-generation file retrieval interfaces.

abstract = {Social micro-blogging systems such as Twitter are designed for rapid and informal communication from a large potential number of participants. Due to the volume of content received, human users must typically skim their timeline of received content and exercise judgement in selecting items for consumption, necessitating a selection process based on heuristics and content meta-data. This selection process is not well understood, yet is important due to its potential use in content management systems.In this research we have conducted an open online experiment in which participants are shown quantitative and qualitative meta-data describing two pieces of Twitter content. Without revealing the text of the tweet, participants are asked to make a selection. We observe the decisions made from 239 surveys and discover insights into human behaviour on decision making for content selection. We find that for qualitative meta-data consumption decisions are driven by online friendship and for quantitative meta-data the largest numerical value presented influences choice. Overall, the 'number of retweets' is found to be the most influential quantitative meta-data, while displaying multiple cues about an author's identity provides the strongest qualitative meta-data. When both quantitative and qualitative meta-data is presented, it is the qualitative meta-data (friendship information) that drives selection. The results are consistent with application of the Recognition heuristic, which postulates that when faced with constrained decision-making, humans will tend to exercise judgement based on cues representing familiarity. These findings are useful for future interface design for content filtering and recommendation systems. Author-HighlightsWe have examined which metadata cues are used when deciding to consume content.The online experiment used Twitter content and users as its subject.Users prefer content from someone with whom they already have a relationship.Users prefer content judged by others to have value (based on number of retweets).Clear metadata signals can affect decision making in content consumption.},

abstract = {Gamification has drawn the attention of academics, practitioners and business professionals in domains as diverse as education, information studies, human-computer interaction, and health. As yet, the term remains mired in diverse meanings and contradictory uses, while the concept faces division on its academic worth, underdeveloped theoretical foundations, and a dearth of standardized guidelines for application. Despite widespread commentary on its merits and shortcomings, little empirical work has sought to validate gamification as a meaningful concept and provide evidence of its effectiveness as a tool for motivating and engaging users in non-entertainment contexts. Moreover, no work to date has surveyed gamification as a field of study from a human-computer studies perspective. In this paper, we present a systematic survey on the use of gamification in published theoretical reviews and research papers involving interactive systems and human participants. We outline current theoretical understandings of gamification and draw comparisons to related approaches, including alternate reality games (ARGs), games with a purpose (GWAPs), and gameful design. We present a multidisciplinary review of gamification in action, focusing on empirical findings related to purpose and context, design of systems, approaches and techniques, and user impact. Findings from the survey show that a standard conceptualization of gamification is emerging against a growing backdrop of empirical participants-based research. However, definitional subjectivity, diverse or unstated theoretical foundations, incongruities among empirical findings, and inadequate experimental design remain matters of concern. We discuss how gamification may to be more usefully presented as a subset of a larger effort to improve the user experience of interactive systems through gameful design. We end by suggesting points of departure for continued empirical investigations of gamified practice and its effects. We present findings from a survey of the gamification literature.Theoretical findings suggest that gamification is a distinct concept.Conceptual foundations tend to converge on psychological theories of motivation.Early applied work suggests positive-leaning but mixed results.Empirical work on specific elements with direct ties to theory and stronger experimental designs is needed.},

abstract = {The field of Participatory Design (PD) has greatly diversified and we see a broad spectrum of approaches and methodologies emerging. However, to foster its role in designing future interactive technologies, a discussion about accountability and rigour across this spectrum is needed. Rejecting the traditional, positivistic framework, we take inspiration from related fields such as Design Research and Action Research to develop interpretations of these concepts that are rooted in PD's own belief system. We argue that unlike in other fields, accountability and rigour are nuanced concepts that are delivered through debate, critique and reflection. A key prerequisite for having such debates is the availability of a language that allows designers, researchers and practitioners to construct solid arguments about the appropriateness of their stances, choices and judgements.To this end, we propose a "tool-to-think-with" that provides such a language by guiding designers, researchers and practitioners through a process of systematic reflection and critical analysis. The tool proposes four lenses to critically reflect on the nature of a PD effort: epistemology, values, stakeholders and outcomes. In a subsequent step, the coherence between the revealed features is analysed and shows whether they pull the project in the same direction or work against each other. Regardless of the flavour of PD, we argue that this coherence of features indicates the level of internal rigour of PD work and that the process of reflection and analysis provides the language to argue for it. We envision our tool to be useful at all stages of PD work: in the planning phase, as part of a reflective practice during the work, and as a means to construct knowledge and advance the field after the fact. We ground our theoretical discussions in a specific PD experience, the ECHOES project, to motivate the tool and to illustrate its workings. Participatory Design (PD) requires nuanced concepts of accountability and rigour.Accountability and rigour are constructed through debate, critique and reflection.Our "tool-to-think-with" guides designers in systematic and critical reflection.We provide four lenses for reflection: epistemology, values, stakeholders, outcomes.The "coherence" between reflective perspectives indicates internal rigour of PD work.},

Haptic feedback has previously been investigated to assist motion-impaired computer users, however, limitations such as target distracters have hampered its integration with graphical user interfaces (GUIs). In this paper two new haptic assistive techniques are presented that utilise the 3DOF capabilities of the Phantom Omni. These are referred to as deformable haptic cones and deformable virtual switches. The assistance is designed specifically to enable motion-impaired operators to use existing GUIs more effectively. Experiment 1 investigates the performance benefits of the new haptic techniques when used in conjunction with the densely populated Windows on-screen keyboard (OSK). Experiment 2 utilises the ISO 9241-9 point-and-click task to investigate the effects of target size and shape. The results of the study prove that the newly proposed techniques improve interaction rates and can be integrated with existing software without many of the drawbacks of traditional haptic assistance. Deformable haptic cones and deformable virtual switches were shown to reduce the mean number of missed-clicks by at least 75% and reduce targeting times by at least 25%.},

abstract = {In order to improve intelligent Human-Computer Interaction it is important to create a personalized adaptive emotion estimator that is able to learn over time emotional response idiosyncrasies of individual person and thus enhance estimation accuracy. This paper, with the aim of identifying preferable methods for such a concept, presents an experiment-based comparative study of seven feature reduction and seven machine learning methods commonly used for emotion estimation based on physiological signals. The analysis was performed on data obtained in an emotion elicitation experiment involving 14 participants. Specific discrete emotions were targeted with stimuli from the International Affective Picture System database. The experiment was necessary to achieve the uniformity in the various aspects of emotion elicitation, data processing, feature calculation, self-reporting procedures and estimation evaluation, in order to avoid inconsistency problems that arise when results from studies that use different emotion-related databases are mutually compared. The results of the performed experiment indicate that the combination of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with sequential floating forward selection (SFFS) exhibited the highest accuracy in discrete emotion classification based on physiological features calculated from ECG, respiration, skin conductance and skin temperature. Using leave-one-session-out crossvalidation method, 60.3% accuracy in classification of 5 discrete emotions (sadness, disgust, fear, happiness and neutral) was obtained. In order to identify which methods may be the most suitable for real-time estimator adaptation, execution and learning times of emotion estimators were also comparatively analyzed. Based on this analysis, preferred feature reduction method for real-time estimator adaptation was minimum redundancy - maximum relevance (mRMR), which was the fastest approach in terms of combined execution and learning time, as well as the second best in accuracy, after SFFS. In combination with mRMR, highest accuracies were achieved by k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and MLP with negligible difference (50.33% versus 50.54%); however, mRMR+kNN is preferable option for real-time estimator adaptation due to considerably lower combined execution and learning time of kNN versus MLP.},

abstract = {Intimate interactions between remotely located individuals are not well supported by conventional communication tools, mainly due to the lack of physical contact. Also, haptic research has not focused on the use of a kiss as a mode of interaction that maintains intimacy in long distance relationships. In this study, we designed and developed a haptic device called Kissenger (Kiss-Messenger) for this issue. Kissenger is an interactive device that provides a physical interface for transmitting a kiss between two remotely connected people. Each device is paired with another and the amount of force and shape of the kiss by the user is sensed and transmitted to another device that is replicated using actuators. Kissenger is designed to augment already existing remote communication technologies. Challenges in the design and development of the system are addressed through an iterative design process involving constant evaluation by users after each stage. The devices are evaluated through a short- and a long-term user study with remotely located couples. The results point to an initial acceptance of the device with feedback from the users on directions to improve the overall experience. This study discusses potential issues that designers should be aware of when prototyping for remote intimate interactions.},

abstract = {The design and selection of 3D modeled hand gestures for human-computer interaction should follow principles of natural language combined with the need to optimize gesture contrast and recognition. The selection should also consider the discomfort and fatigue associated with distinct hand postures and motions, especially for common commands. Sign language interpreters have extensive and unique experience forming hand gestures and many suffer from hand pain while gesturing. Professional sign language interpreters (N=24) rated discomfort for hand gestures associated with 47 characters and words and 33 hand postures. Clear associations of discomfort with hand postures were identified. In a nominal logistic regression model, high discomfort was associated with gestures requiring a flexed wrist, discordant adjacent fingers, or extended fingers. These and other findings should be considered in the design of hand gestures to optimize the relationship between human cognitive and physical processes and computer gesture recognition systems for human-computer input.},

abstract = {Although computer agents routinely replace people as companies' representatives, few researchers consider the impressions customers develop about these computers and humans in the same organizational positions. I ask: how do customers develop impressions of the goodness and power for computers agents compared to human agents? I propose a theoretical model by which the agent@?s computer identity weakens social processes that lead to goodness and power impressions. This model explains conflicting prior research and proposes specific hypotheses for the current study. I test the hypotheses with a laboratory experiment where participants believe they are buying products online from a representative of a real organization. I manipulate product quality to alter goodness impressions, the organization@?s constraint of the representative to alter power impressions, and human versus computer identity to test the hypothesized weakening interaction effects. The weakening hypothesis for goodness is not supported, while the weakening hypothesis for power is fully supported. Future work should test the goodness and power weakening hypotheses under different conditions and with different manipulations to determine under what conditions the former operates and to provide additional support for the latter.},

abstract = {Operators in complex environments are often supported by alarm systems that indicate when to shift attention to certain tasks. As alarms are not perfectly reliable, operators have to select appropriate strategies of attention allocation to compensate for unreliability and to maintain overall performance. This study explores how humans adapt to differing alarm reliabilities. Within a multi-task simulation consisting of a monitoring task and two other concurrent tasks, participants were assigned to one of five groups. In the manual control group none of the tasks was supported by an alarm system, whereas the four experimental groups were supported in the monitoring task by a miss-prone alarm system differing in reliability, i.e. 68.75%, 75%, 87.5%, 93.75%. Compared to the manual control group, all experimental groups benefited from the support by alarms, with best performance for the highest reliability condition. However, for the lowest reliability group the benefit was associated with an increased attentional effort, a more demanding attention allocation strategy, and a declined relative performance in a concurrent task. Results are discussed in the context of recent automation research.},

In addition, we have evaluated more than 50 GUI frameworks and APIs and proved usefulness and generality of our classification of concerns. As an additional proof of applicability of the proposed classification, we have refactored the inheritance hierarchy of the selected GUI API using concern-oriented interfaces.

abstract = {Handheld devices like smartphones and tablets have emerged as one of the most promising platforms for Augmented Reality (AR). The increased usage of these portable handheld devices has enabled handheld AR applications to reach the end-users; hence, it is timely and important to seriously consider the user experience of such applications. AR visualizations for occluded objects enable an observer to look through objects. AR visualizations have been predominantly evaluated using Head-Worn Displays (HWDs), handheld devices have rarely been used. However, unless we gain a better understanding of the perceptual and cognitive effects of handheld AR systems, effective interfaces for handheld devices cannot be designed. Similarly, human perception of AR systems in outdoor environments, which provide a higher degree of variation than indoor environments, has only been insufficiently explored. In this paper, we present insights acquired from five experiments we performed using handheld devices in outdoor locations. We provide design recommendations for handheld AR systems equipped with visualizations for occluded objects. Our key conclusions are the following: (1) Use of visualizations for occluded objects improves the depth perception of occluded objects akin to non-occluded objects. (2) To support different scenarios, handheld AR systems should provide multiple visualizations for occluded objects to complement each other. (3) Visual clutter in AR visualizations reduces the visibility of occluded objects and deteriorates depth judgment; depth judgment can be improved by providing clear visibility of the occluded objects. (4) Similar to virtual reality interfaces, both egocentric and exocentric distances are underestimated in handheld AR. (5) Depth perception will improve if handheld AR systems can dynamically adapt their geometric field of view (GFOV) to match the display field of view (DFOV). (6) Large handheld displays are hard to carry and use; however, they enable users to better grasp the depth of multiple graphical objects that are presented simultaneously.},

This isolation has an impact on the emotional wellbeing of the child. In this paper we report on research that explores the design of technologies that mitigate some of the negative aspects of separation, while respecting the sensitivities of the hospital, school and home contexts. We conducted design workshops with parents, teachers and hospital staff and found that there was a strong desire for mediated connection, but also a significant need to protect privacy and avoid disruption. In response we designed a novel technology that combined an ambient presence with photo-sharing to connect hospitalised children with schools and families. This paper reports on the field trial of the technology. The research provides new insights into how technology can support connectedness and provides a foundation for contributing to the wellbeing of children and young people in sensitive settings. Hospitalised children suffer isolation which impacts their well-being.Attempts have been made to use off-the-shelf ICT to ameliorate isolation.Sensitive contexts at hospital and school make the use of existing technologies problematic.We trialled lightweight communication technology for hospitalised children.Ambient awareness and photo-sharing show promise for creating social connectedness.},

abstract = {Relaxation training is an application of affective computing with important implications for health and wellness. After detecting user s affective state through physiological sensors, a relaxation training application can provide the user with explicit feedback about his/her detected affective state. This process (biofeedback) can enable an individual to learn over time how to change his/her physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance. In this paper, we provide three contributions to the field of affective computing for health and wellness. First, we propose a novel application for relaxation training that combines ideas from affective computing and games. The game detects user s level of stress and uses it to influence the affective state and the behavior of a 3D virtual character as a form of embodied feedback. Second, we compare two algorithms for stress detection which follow two different approaches in the affective computing literature: a more practical and less costly approach that uses a single physiological sensor (skin conductance), and a potentially more accurate approach that uses four sensors (skin conductance, heart rate, muscle activity of corrugator supercilii and zygomaticus major). Third, as the central motivation of our research, we aim to improve the traditional methodology employed for comparisons in affective computing studies. To do so, we add to the study a placebo condition in which user s stress level, unbeknown to him/her, is determined pseudo-randomly instead of taking into account his/her physiological sensor readings. The obtained results show that only the feedback presented by the single-sensor algorithm was perceived as significantly more accurate than the placebo. If the placebo condition was not included in the study, the effectiveness of the two algorithms would have instead appeared similar. This outcome highlights the importance of using more thorough methodologies in future affective computing studies. Relaxation training has important implications for health and wellness.We propose a novel biofeedback-controlled game for relaxation training.We compare two stress detection solutions for the game and a placebo condition.Only one of the two solutions produced better results than the placebo.We highlight methodological implications for the evaluation of affective computing systems.},

Results suggest that this persuasive medium can pleasantly encourage an experience comparable to mindfulness by consistently inducing a calm mental clarity and loss of intention.

abstract = {Recovery is a necessary factor in avoiding work-related strain and in feeling prepared for the next day of work. In order for recovery to be successful, an individual must experience psychological detachment from work, relaxation, mastery experiences and a sense of control, all of which have been argued to be assisted by digital game use. However, it is unclear whether these associations will be greater for certain digital game genres, or whether this would extend to other recovery-related outcomes, for instance work home interference (WHI), where the stress from work interferes with home-life. These factors may be vital in determining whether interventions aimed at improving recovery using digital games would be effective, and what form these should take. The present research surveyed 491 participants and found that the total number of hours spent playing digital games per week was positively correlated with overall recovery. Correlations varied with genre, highlighting the importance of game characteristics in this relationship: first person shooters and action games were most highly correlated with recovery. Moreover, digital game use was not related to a reduction in work-home interference. When restricting the analysis to gamers who report to have developed online relationships, online social support mediated the relationship between digital game use and recovery. Results are discussed in terms of how digital games may be utilised to improve recovery and reduce work-related stress. Hours spent playing videogames are positively correlated with overall recovery.Highly immersive games are particularly highly correlated with overall recovery.Online social support enhances the relationship between video game use and recovery.},

Stroke++ splits a Chinese character into multiple radicals. By leveraging hieroglyphic properties of Chinese characters, our method requires users to only input a subset of the radicals to identify the target character, making it much faster and easier to input Chinese on mobile phones. Our user study results show that Stroke++ outperforms most major Chinese input methods on mobile devices, including Stroke, Pinyin and Hand Writing Recognition (HWR), in terms of the input efficiency and usability.

abstract = {The purpose of this experiment is to investigate the fine motor performance of young and older adults on a reach to grasp task in a desktop virtual environment with increasing precision requirements. Aging brings about potential loss of an individual's function due to disease, injury, or the degenerative nature of aging itself. Three-dimensional virtual environments have been identified as systems with good potential to ameliorate such problems in older individuals, and precise fine motor skills represent an important class of functional skills. Two groups of participants (Young, n=10, mean age 21.3 years, range 20-24, senior, n=10, mean age 70.7 years, range 60-85) performed a reach to grasp in a desktop virtual environment with simple, low contrast graphics. Results indicate that visual feedback of the hand for sensory guidance of movement did not improve motor performance for either group, and that as precision requirements of the task increased, age group differences in movement time and peak grasp aperture also increased. These findings extend the literature on age group differences in human motor control across the lifespan and differ from previous studies which showed presence of visual feedback of the hand improved motor performance in young adults. Differences in luminance contrast levels in past studies and the current one suggest that control over this feature of the visual scene is an important design consideration for all end-users and warrants additional investigation. Additional recommendations for age-specific design of three dimensional user interfaces include usage of tangibles that are sufficient in size to limit detrimental effects for older adults.},

abstract = {Navigation within a closed environment requires analysis of a variety of acoustic cues, a task that is well developed in many visually impaired individuals, and for which sighted individuals rely almost entirely on visual information. For blind people, the act of creating cognitive maps for spaces, such as home or office buildings, can be a long process, for which the individual may repeat various paths numerous times. While this action is typically performed by the individual on-site, it is of some interest to investigate at which point this task can be performed off-site, at the individual's discretion. In short, is it possible for an individual to learn an architectural environment without being physically present? If so, such a system could prove beneficial for navigation preparation in new and unknown environments. The main goal of the present research can therefore be summarized as investigating the possibilities of assisting blind individuals in learning a spatial environment configuration through the listening of audio events and their interactions with these events within a virtual reality experience. A comparison of two types of learning through auditory exploration has been performed: in situ real displacement and active navigation in a virtual architecture. The virtual navigation rendered only acoustic information. Results for two groups of five participants showed that interactive exploration of virtual acoustic room simulations can provide sufficient information for the construction of coherent spatial mental maps, although some variations were found between the two environments tested in the experiments. Furthermore, the mental representation of the virtually navigated environments preserved topological and metric properties, as was found through actual navigation.},

abstract = {Recommender systems help users locate possible items of interest more quickly by filtering and ranking them in a personalized way. Some of these systems provide the end user not only with such a personalized item list but also with an explanation which describes why a specific item is recommended and why the system supposes that the user will like it. Besides helping the user understand the output and rationale of the system, the provision of such explanations can also improve the general acceptance, perceived quality, or effectiveness of the system. In recent years, the question of how to automatically generate and present system-side explanations has attracted increased interest in research. Today some basic explanation facilities are already incorporated in e-commerce Web sites such as Amazon.com. In this work, we continue this line of recent research and address the question of how explanations can be communicated to the user in a more effective way. In particular, we present the results of a user study in which users of a recommender system were provided with different types of explanation. We experimented with 10 different explanation types and measured their effects in different dimensions. The explanation types used in the study include both known visualizations from the literature as well as two novel interfaces based on tag clouds. Our study reveals that the content-based tag cloud explanations are particularly helpful to increase the user-perceived level of transparency and to increase user satisfaction even though they demand higher cognitive effort from the user. Based on these insights and observations, we derive a set of possible guidelines for designing or selecting suitable explanations for recommender systems.},

For instance, molecular design requires the simultaneous control of several connected kinematic structures, with strong physical and chemical interactions, to provide the relevant conformation and docking solutions. This paper investigates two working strategies for carrying out closely coupled manipulations in such environments. We present an experimental study which compares bimanual and collaborative configurations. For both strategies, we provide users with the same number of resources, such as the same visualization system and the same number of manipulation tools. The performances are better in the collaborative configuration for the simultaneous management of several constraints and the manipulation of distant regions. However, this working strategy involves a strong communication flow to coordinate the actions. The performances are better in the bimanual configuration when the tasks involve a limited working space and a low level of constraints.},

We introduce delay predictivity as a new factor profoundly affecting user performance. A system delay is predictive when its duration is informative about the nature of consecutive interaction events. We report an experiment (N=122) where short delays were differently distributed across two alternative target stimuli in a choice response task. We manipulated variability and predictivity of delays. For one group of participants the delays were of constant duration. For three other groups the delays were variable, but differed in predictivity. They were either non-predictive, probabilistically predictive (they predicted the targets with a probability of 0.8), or deterministically predictive. Performance with constant delays was superior to performance with variable non-predictive or with probabilistically predictive delays. Surprisingly, participants with deterministically predictive delays outperformed participants in all other groups. This has important implications for interface design, whenever there is some degree of freedom in scheduling system delays. Best performance is achieved with predictive delays, but only when deterministic predictivity can be achieved. Otherwise, constant delays are to be preferred over variable ones.},

This study evaluated cursor trajectories from 29 individuals with bilateral cerebral palsy (CP) and different levels of function.

Results show that the contributors to a model that assesses different MACS levels are the movement time, acceleration-deceleration cycles and average speed. The model appears unaffected by accuracy measures. For both typically-developed youth and participants with CP, a good model of index of difficulty must include the following predictors: rapidity - movement time, average speed, zero acceleration crossings and accuracy, trajectory distance, linearity index, and indices of vertical and horizontal components. Models for those who are typically-developed should also include an index of diagonal component and curvature index.},

abstract = {The last 2 decades have seen a constantly increasing interest in mindfulness, due to its positive effects on health and well-being. Recently, a number of mobile applications aimed at supporting people in practicing mindfulness techniques have appeared, but their efficacy has not been formally evaluated yet. In this paper, we first introduce the reader to mindfulness techniques, traditional as well as computer-based. Then, we propose and evaluate a mobile application (called AEON) aimed at helping users in practicing thought distancing, i.e. a mindfulness technique that requires one not to react in response to his/her thoughts but to be aware of them and observe them while they go away. AEON allows the user to enter his/her thoughts and visualize them as written in ink on a parchment placed under water. By touching the screen, the user can interact with the water and produce waves that progressively dissolve each written thought. We evaluate AEON on a sample of naive meditators (i.e. people with no or minimal experience with meditation), contrasting it with two traditional thought distancing techniques that are not computer-based. The first traditional technique requires users to mentally visualize their thoughts as printed on clouds and observe them as they pass by, while the second requires users to write their thoughts on cards, then pick up the cards one at a time, look at them and toss them into a wastepaper basket. AEON obtained better results in terms of achieved mindfulness, perceived level of difficulty and degree of pleasantness. Since practicing mindfulness tends to be difficult for naive meditators, these results suggest that AEON can be a novel and effective way to help them approach mindfulness.},

As a first step towards better understanding this interpretation process, our research focuses on quantitative monitoring of interpreters' brain responses associated with geoscientific target spotting. This paper presents a method that profiles brain responses using electroencephalography (EEG) to detect P300-like responses that are associated with target spotting for complex geoscientific data. In our experiment, eight interpreters with varying levels of expertise and experience were asked to detect features, which are likely to be copper-gold rich porphyry systems within magnetic geophysical data. The target features appear in noisy background and often have incomplete shape. Magnetic images with targets and without targets were shown to participants using the ''oddball'' paradigm. Event related potentials were obtained by averaging the EEG epochs across multiple trials and the results show delayed P3 response to the targets, likely due to the complexity of the task. EEG epochs were classified and the results show reliable single trial classification of EEG responses with an average accuracy of 83%. The result demonstrated the usability of the P300-like responses to quantify the geoscientific target spotting performances.},

abstract = {Analysis of the usability of an interactive system requires both an understanding of how the system is to be used and a means of assessing the system against that understanding. Such analytic assessments are particularly important in safety-critical systems as latent vulnerabilities may exist which have negative consequences only in certain circumstances. Many existing approaches to assessment use tasks or scenarios to provide explicit representation of their understanding of use. These normative user behaviours have the advantage that they clarify assumptions about how the system will be used but have the disadvantage that they may exclude many plausible deviations from these norms. Assessments of how a design fails to support these user behaviours can be a matter of judgement based on individual experience rather than evidence. We present a systematic formal method for analysing interactive systems that is based on constraints rather than prescribed behaviour. These constraints capture precise assumptions about what information resources are used to perform action. These resources may either reside in the system itself or be external to the system. The approach is applied to two different medical device designs, comparing two infusion pumps currently in common use in hospitals. Comparison of the two devices is based on these resource assumptions to assess consistency of interaction within the design of each device.},

In a 'memory tour', we asked participants to walk us through their family home selecting and discussing significant mnemonic objects. With each personal narrative we recorded memento location, i.e. the room, place within the room and any nearby objects. Although photos were not the most popular mementos, when chosen they were highly significant, and often unique. These photo mementos were usually not representational but symbolic, where only the owner knows their many layers of meaning. Photos from different times in the person's life were strategically placed in different rooms. Their location afforded different functions, e.g. photo mementos in family spaces reinforced family bonds, photo mementos in personal spaces were for immersive reminiscing, whereas those in public rooms had an aesthetic value and to spark conversations with visitors. Finally photo mementos were rarely isolated: they were clustered in displayed albums or stored with other memorabilia in boxes or drawers to represent a stage in life. We explore the implications of these findings by designing potential new home photo technologies, looking at how new designs might support the types of behaviours observed. Through four conceptual designs we examine how photo technology might integrate into the practices and aesthetic of the family home. The concepts led to a set of concluding considerations that need to be taken into account when designing new forms of display technology that are part of a larger domestic photo system.},

abstract = {Collaborative Computer-Supported Argument Visualization (CCSAV) is a technical methodology that offers support for online collective deliberation over complex dilemmas. As compared with more traditional conversational technologies, like wikis and forums, CCSAV is designed to promote more critical thinking and evidence-based reasoning, by using representations that highlight conceptual relationships between contributions, and through computational analytics that assess the structural integrity of the network. However, to date, CCSAV tools have achieved adoption primarily in small-scale educational contexts, and only to a limited degree in real world applications. We hypothesise that by reifying conversations as logical maps to address the shortcomings of chronological streams, CCSAV tools underestimate the importance of participation and interaction in enhancing collaborative knowledge-building. We argue, therefore, that CCSAV platforms should be socially augmented in order to improve their mediation capability. Drawing on Clark and Brennan influential Common Ground theory, we designed a Debate Dashboard, which augmented a CCSAV tool with a set of widgets that deliver meta-information about participants and the interaction process. An empirical study simulating a moderately sized collective deliberation scenario provides evidence that this experimental version outperformed the control version on a range of indicators, including usability, mutual understanding, quality of perceived collaboration, and accuracy of individual decisions. No evidence was found that the addition of the Debate Dashboard impeded the quality of the argumentation or the richness of content.},

Whilst a number of technological improvements have helped reduce the likelihood of security breaches, users themselves have an integral role to play in reducing technology mediated fraud. This paper focuses on the role of the user, specifically capturing information about their perceptions and behaviour when using technology to complete financial transactions. Semi-structured interviews with twenty-nine participants were conducted to increase knowledge and understanding in this domain. The findings are guided by the components of the health belief model (HBM) which is used as a framework for exploring critical issues associated with behavioural change. Results indicate that users typically felt safe and secure whilst conducting financial transactions online and at the ATM. The users' perceived level of threat was low mainly because they thought it unlikely that they would be a victim of fraud and because of a reduced sense of responsibility for any negative outcomes. Whilst users were aware at a superficial level of what fraudulent activities take place they were less sure about behaviours designed to counteract fraud and their potential efficacy. Furthermore, security concerns among ATM users were not as high as concerns among Internet users with Internet users appearing to take more individual responsibility for their more personal technologies in more private spaces. The paper concludes with some practical implications based around the HBM suggesting user focused ways forward for encouraging secure behaviour.},

Research is being carried out in numerous areas to assist with cooking, from solving difficulties in the kitchen to more recently enhancing already good experiences related to cooking. To design solutions that are not only usable, but useful in all related aspects of cooking, we must get a good understanding of the needs of the user. It is important that real needs are identified, so that products or systems designed are adopted and are sustainable. There are various methods that researchers and designers use to gain user insights and there is much debate on different approaches and their effectiveness. Whilst there have been a number of ethnographic style studies in people's homes, there has been little in the way of understanding user goals in the kitchen which could lead to more effective design solutions. In this paper, we present goal-directed research of cooking needs in Singapore. We produce three primary design personas and three secondary personas, describing their goals and needs and where they can be helped through technology. An online survey was carried out to validate our personas, comparing our qualitative and quantitative findings. We provide a general holistic overview of kitchen requirements for these personas, whether in helping correct problems or enhancing positive experiences and how these needs can be connected. The user requirements provided can help guide researchers and help designers produce more meaningful, complete and acceptable technology solutions in the kitchen.},

abstract = {Food crises imply responses that are not what people and organisations would normally do, if one or more threats (health, economic, etc.) were not present. At an individual level, this motivates individuals to implement coping strategies aimed at adaptation to the threat that has been presented, as well as the reduction of stressful experiences. In this regard, microblogging channels such as Twitter emerge as a valuable resource to access individuals' expressions of coping. Accordingly, Twitter expressions are generally more natural, spontaneous and heterogeneous - in cognitive, affective and behavioural dimensions - than expressions found on other types of social media (e.g. blogs). Moreover, as a social media channel, it provides access not only to an individual but also to a social level of analysis, i.e. a psychosocial media analysis. To show the potential in this regard, our study analysed Twitter messages produced by individuals during the 2011 EHEC/Escherichia coli bacteria outbreak in Europe, due to contaminated food products. This involved more than 3100 cases of bloody diarrhoea and 850 of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), and 53 confirmed deaths across the EU. Based on data collected in Spain, the country initially thought to be the source of the outbreak, an initial quantitative analysis considered 11,411 tweets, of which 2099 were further analysed through a qualitative content analysis. This aimed at identifying (1) the ways of coping expressed during the crisis; and (2) how uncertainty about the contaminated product, expressed through hazard notifications, influenced the former. Results revealed coping expressions as being dynamic, flexible and social, with a predominance of accommodation, information seeking and opposition (e.g. anger) strategies. The latter were more likely during a period of uncertainty, with the opposite being true for strategies relying on the identification of the contaminated product (e.g. avoid consumption/purchase). Implications for food crisis communication and monitoring systems are discussed.},

abstract = {Owing to the popularity of various hand tracking interfaces, there have been numerous applications developed to provide intuitive hand interaction with the virtual world. As users start with great anticipation, they end up with dissatisfaction due to difficulties of manipulation or physical tiredness coming very short. Although the task itself is rather trivial in a real life situation, it requires much effort in the virtual environment. We address this awkwardness as 'VR interaction-induced fatigue symptom' and hypothesize its causes based on our observations. We argue that the source of the fatigue comes from the restricted sensory information of the VR interfaces, and that users try to accommodate the missing sensory feedback by excessive motion leading to wrong posture or bad timing. We demonstrate our hypothesis by conducting experiments of two types of virtual interaction scenarios: object transport and 3D selection. Furthermore, by analyzing the behaviors of users' action collected from our experiment, we derive essential factors to be considered in designing VR applications, and propose a conceptual interaction model for orchestrating virtual grasping.},

abstract = {These days, when we float an idea for an interface or demo a prototype, the compliment that we crave for is ''This is Cool!'' Coolness has become a major design goal for HCI professionals. If we are serious about building Cool into our products, we should also be serious about measuring it. With this in mind, we performed a scientific explication of the concept in order to capture the psychological essence of ''coolness,'' covering a number of characteristics such as trendiness, uniqueness, rebelliousness, genuineness and utility. Based on the discourse in the literature, we arrived at a series of questionnaire measures, which we subjected to an exploratory factor analysis in Study 1 (N=315). The factor structure that emerged was tested through a confirmatory factor analysis in Study 2 (N=835), in which American and Korean respondents rated their perceptions of a variety of old and new technologies. Converging evidence suggests that in order for an interface to be rated as cool, it should not only be attractive and original, but also help the user assert his/her uniqueness or subcultural identity. Study 3 (N=317) tested the content validity of our factors by comparing them with a holistic evaluation of coolness and arrived at a parsimonious three-factor solution for conceptualizing it in terms of originality, attractiveness and subcultural appeal. Together, these constitute tangible user criteria that designers can strategically address and researchers can systematically measure.},

abstract = {Unhealthy eating behavior is a major contributing factor to the onset of several diseases and health conditions (e.g., obesity, type 2 diabetes). It is therefore not surprising that health interventions aimed at modifying dietary behavior have been identified as the cornerstone treatment for many health conditions. Interventions that use persuasive technology can be effective for motivating healthy eating behavior, and recent years have witnessed an increasing number of persuasive technologies with the purpose of promoting healthy eating behavior or attitude by manipulating various determinants of healthy behavior. However, these applications generally take a one-size-fits-all approach that is biased toward individualistic cultures. To resolve this problem, we propose culturally relevant design approaches for tailoring persuasive technology interventions to collectivists and individualistic cultures. Our guidelines are based on a large-scale survey of 554 participants' (collectivist=306 and individualist=247) eating behavior and associated determinants - identified by Health Belief Model - to understand how healthy eating behavior relates to various cultural groups and sub-groups. We developed two models of healthy eating behavior for the collectivist and individualistic cultural groups identified by Hofstede, and an additional eight models to investigate the moderating effect of gender and age on healthy eating behavior. We then explored the similarities and differences between the models and developed persuasive profiles of motivators of healthy eating behavior for each group. Additionally, we proposed two approaches for designing culturally relevant persuasive applications based on our results. The first is a one-size-fits-all approach that will motivate the majority of the population, while not demotivating any user. The second is a personalized approach that will best motivate a particular cultural group. Finally, to make our approaches actionable in persuasive intervention design, we map the theoretical determinants of healthy eating behavior as identified by Health Belief Model to common persuasive system design strategies.},

abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers are increasingly examining how Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can help people eat more healthfully. However, within HCI, there has been little examination of the way that cultural values influence how people think about food and wellness, and how sociocultural context supports or impedes attempts to eat healthfully. Our work focuses on the diet-related health challenges of African Americans within low-income neighborhoods. This population disproportionately experiences diet-related disease, and as such, researchers have consistently advocated research that examines the way in which food practices are culturally situated. Through formative focus groups with 46 participants we identified several design implications for tools that promote healthy eating while accounting for collectivism, a cultural value often ascribed to the African American population. Based on our design implications we developed, deployed and evaluated two systems that supported the sharing of community-held knowledge about making healthy eating decisions. In our discussion, we present implications for the design of collectivistic systems that address food practices. We conclude with recommendations for HCI research that investigates the relationship between culture and food more broadly.},

In the second experiment (N=34), we compare automatic and user-initiated communication of emoticons. Results show that user-initiated communication of emoticons is experienced as more intimate than automatic communication. These results are discussed in light of the interpersonal process model of intimacy and can help the design of applications aimed at improving social interactions through affective communication technology.},

We argue that the alternative of a continuous list representation of successive days would offer several advantages such as faster calendar search, a more natural linear view of time, a scrollable and zoomable interface and better scalability for devices of different size. This alternative, linear calendar appears to be well suited to modern touch-centric platforms with their refined support for scrolling and zooming. We tested search performance and navigation with digital calendars in a comparison of grid and list representations by employing a remote, web-based method. On their personal computers, participants performed a series of search tasks in a fictitious calendar. The results show that calendar search is faster in list view when searching for dates, between month breaks and in the next month (with and without navigation). Searching for days is faster in grid view, however, highlighting days in list view eliminates this difference. The results indicate substantial promise for the list view digital calendar and we describe a high fidelity rendering of the user interface for a digital calendar with a list view.},

The perceptual relevance of such a spatial audiovisual coherence is of significant interest. In this paper, a subjective experiment is carried out where an angular error between an s-3D video and a spatially accurate sound reproduced through Wave Field Synthesis (WFS) is simulated. The psychometric curve is measured with the method of constant stimuli, and the threshold for bimodal integration is estimated. The impact of the presence of background noise is also investigated. A comparison is made between the case without any background noise and the case with an SNR of 4dBA. Estimates of the thresholds and the slopes, as well as their confidence intervals, are obtained for each level of background noise. When background noise was present, the point of subjective equality (PSE) was higher (19.4^o instead of 18.3^o) and the slope was steeper (-0.077 instead of -0.062 per degree). Because of the overlap between the confidence intervals, however, it was not possible to statistically differentiate between the two levels of noise. The implications for the sound reproduction in a cinema theater are discussed.},

abstract = {During the past 45 years there has been a recurrence of interest on supporting sketching at electronic devices and interactive surfaces, and despite being sketching recognition fairly well addressed on the literature, the adoption of electronic sketching as a design tool is still a challenge. The current popularization of touch screen devices allows designers to sketch using their device of preference, while the current multi-platform capabilities made possible by HTML5 allows sketching systems to run on many devices at the same time. Those two factors combined might pose new opportunities for researchers to explore how designers use sketching on flexible setups by combining heterogeneous sketching devices for design sessions. This may arise new possibilities in the field of prototyping user interfaces since, by using such multi-platform systems, designers would now be able of designing interfaces for multiple devices by producing and testing them on the device itself. This paper reports a pilot experiment conducted with 6 developers, grouped into pairs on design sessions using Gambit - a multi-platform sketching system that provides a lightweight approach for prototyping user interfaces for many devices at once. We performed a discourse analysis of the professionals based on recorded videos of interviews conducted during and after design sessions with the system and aggregated the data in order to investigate the main requirements for multi-platform sketching systems.},

abstract = {Currently, a lot of the tasks engaged by users over the Web involve dealing with multiple Web sites. Moreover, whilst Web navigation was considered as a lonely activity in the past, a large proportion of users are nowadays engaged in collaborative activities over the Web. In this paper we argue that these two aspects of collaboration and tasks spanning over multiple Web sites call for a level of coordination that require Distributed User Interfaces (DUI). In this context, DUIs would play a major role by helping multiple users to coordinate their activities whilst working collaboratively to complete tasks at different Web sites. For that, we propose in this paper an approach to create distributed user interfaces featuring procedures that are aimed to orchestrate user tasks over multiple Web sites. Our approach supports flexible process modeling by allowing users to combine manual tasks and automated tasks from a repertoire of patterns of tasks performed over the Web. In our approach, whilst manual tasks can be regarded as simple instructions that tell users how to perform a task over a Web site, automated tasks correspond to tools built under the concept of Web augmentation (as it augments the repertoire of tasks users can perform over the Web) called Web augmenters. Both manual and automated tasks are usually supported by specific DOM elements available in different Web sites. Thus, by combining tasks and DOM elements distributed in diverse Web sites our approach supports the creation of procedures that allows seamless users interaction with diverse Web site. Moreover, such an approach is aimed at supporting the collaboration between users sharing procedures. The approach is duly illustrated by a case study describing a collaborative trip planning over the Web.},

User Centered Development promotes reactive answers to this kind of evolutions either by software evolutions through iterative development approaches or at runtime by providing additional information to the operators such as contextual help for instance. This paper proposes a model-based approach to support proactive management of context of use evolutions. By proactive management we mean mechanisms in place to plan and implement evolutions and adaptations of the entire user interface (including behaviour) in a generic way. The approach proposed handles both concentration and distribution of user interfaces requiring both fusion of information into a single UI or fission of information into several ones. This generic model-based approach is exemplified on a safety critical system from space domain. It presents how the new user interfaces can be generated at runtime to provide a new user interface gathering in a single place all the information required to perform the task. These user interfaces have to be generated at runtime as new procedures (i.e. sequences of operations to be executed in a semi-autonomous way) can be defined by operators at any time in order to react to adverse events and to keep the space system in operation. Such contextual, activity-related user interfaces complement the original user interfaces designed for operating the command and control system. The resulting user interface thus corresponds to a distribution of user interfaces in a focus+context way improving usability by increasing both efficiency and effectiveness.},

In this paper, we present three case studies on building distributed user interface applications: a distributed media player for multiple displays and controls, a collaborative search system integrating a tabletop and mobile devices, and a multiplayer Tetris game for multi-surface use. While there exist several possible network architectures for such applications, our particular approach focuses on peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures. This focus leads to a number of challenges and opportunities. Drawing from these studies, we derive general challenges for P2P DUI development in terms of design, architecture, and implementation. We conclude with some general guidelines for practical DUI application development using peer-to-peer architectures.},

abstract = {The combination and integration of services between mobile computing and context-aware applications responds to the use of mobile devices defining a wide range of distributed user interfaces to support social activities. In this paper, we propose a novel solution that combines social software with context awareness to improve users' interaction in public spaces. This approach is based on the concept of collaborative interactive panels where users share their opinions and ideas about environmental issues by performing natural gestures. And so, taking advantage of physical resources already available in public spaces combined with the use of well-known technologies, such as mobile devices and RFID, we extend the concept of social software from the Web to physical public scenarios, such as bus stations, squares, etc. As an example, we present a case of study that encourage citizens' participation in decisions related to the community environmental issues reducing the gap between the social software and users.},

abstract = {Emergency planning is an ongoing activity in which a multidisciplinary group of experts intermittently collaborate to define the most appropriate response to risks. One of the most important tasks of emergency planning is the review of plans as a way of maintaining, refining, and improving them. This review of plans is based on exchanging knowledge and experiences in order to take into account different perspectives and generate alternative solutions. An exploratory case study carried out within municipal organizations has disclosed how the application of rigid plan reviewing practices hinders team creativity and, consequently, effective decision-making. This paper presents a computer-based collaborative environment aimed at supporting unstructured team discussion during the post-hoc review of emergency plan. This collaborative environment allows emergency planning team members to share their view in a free manner by interacting with user interface components distributed across several input and output dimensions. The usage of the environment has proved how the application of new interactive technologies can create more dynamic work settings, fostering team creativity.},

abstract = {The debate about online privacy gives testimony of Web users' concerns. Privacy concerns make consumers adopt data protection features, guide their appreciation for existing features, and can steer their consumption choices amongst competing businesses. However, approaches to measure privacy concern are fragmented and often ad-hoc, at the detriment of reliable results. The need for measurement instruments for privacy concern is twofold. First, attitudes and opinions about data protection cannot be established and compared without reliable mechanisms. Second, behavioural studies, notably in technology acceptance and the behavioural economics of privacy require measures for concern as a moderating factor. In its first part, this paper provides a comprehensive review of existing survey instruments for measuring privacy concerns. The second part focuses on revealed preferences that can be used for opportunistically measuring privacy concerns in the wild or for scale validation. Recommendations for scale selection and reuse are provided.},

abstract = {Direct touch manipulation interactions with technology are now commonplace and significant interest is building around their use in the culture and heritage domain. Such interactions can give people the opportunity to explore materials and artefacts in ways that would otherwise be unavailable. These are often heavily annotated and can be linked to a large array of related digital content, thus enriching the experience for the user. Research has addressed issues of how to present digital documents and their related annotations but at present it is unclear what the optimal interaction approach to navigating these annotations in a touch display context might be. In this paper we investigate the role of two alternative approaches to support the navigation of annotations in digitised documents in the context of a touch interface. Through a control study we demonstrate that, whilst the navigation paradigm displays a significant interaction with the type of annotations task performed, there is no discernible advantage of using a natural visual metaphor for annotation in this context. This suggests that design of digital document annotation navigation tools should account for the context and navigation tasks being considered.},

abstract = {The use of mobile applications continues to experience exponential growth. Using mobile apps typically requires the disclosure of location data, which often accompanies requests for various other forms of private information. Existing research on information privacy has implied that consumers are willing to accept privacy risks for relatively negligible benefits, and the offerings of mobile apps based on location-based services (LBS) appear to be no different. However, until now, researchers have struggled to replicate realistic privacy risks within experimental methodologies designed to manipulate independent variables. Moreover, minimal research has successfully captured actual information disclosure over mobile devices based on realistic risk perceptions. The purpose of this study is to propose and test a more realistic experimental methodology designed to replicate real perceptions of privacy risk and capture the effects of actual information disclosure decisions. As with prior research, this study employs a theoretical lens based on privacy calculus. However, we draw more detailed and valid conclusions due to our use of improved methodological rigor. We report the results of a controlled experiment involving consumers (n=1025) in a range of ages, levels of education, and employment experience. Based on our methodology, we find that only a weak, albeit significant, relationship exists between information disclosure intentions and actual disclosure. In addition, this relationship is heavily moderated by the consumer practice of disclosing false data. We conclude by discussing the contributions of our methodology and the possibilities for extending it for additional mobile privacy research.},

Whether a task is framed as either hedonic or utilitarian received limited support. However, viewing time does make a difference and unconstrained viewing versus 5s of viewing time results in higher levels of perceived involvement, enjoyment, trust, and effectiveness. In addition, eye-tracking results indicate that users tend to focus more on hedonic zones versus utilitarian zones (i.e. exhibit higher number of fixations and longer viewing times). Interview data provide additional support and insights. In sum, these findings contribute to understanding the complex and dynamic perceptions of online shoppers.},

To examine these relationships, the paper offers an operational definition, develops and validates a measurement tool for assessing the principles. To provide a comprehensive and broad definition of the principles, over 20 books written by practitioners were reviewed and more than 100 questionnaire items were extracted. These items were further refined through two rounds of content analysis using emergent and a priori coding with 10 judges and 2 experts. The remaining items from the two rounds of coding were examined using surveys. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed. The results show that the items under 6 constructs have adequate convergent and discriminant validity. Lastly, a field study testing effects of the principles on perceived ease of use and aesthetics was conducted. The results show that principles of design predict perceived ease of use better than perceived aesthetics. Implications for practice and research are discussed.},

abstract = {In studies of people's privacy behavior, the extent of disclosure of personal information is typically measured as a summed total or a ratio of disclosure. In this paper, we evaluate three information disclosure datasets using a six-step statistical analysis, and show that people's disclosure behaviors are rather multidimensional: participants' disclosure of personal information breaks down into a number of distinct factors. Moreover, people can be classified along these dimensions into groups with different ''disclosure styles''. This difference is not merely in degree, but rather also in kind: one group may for instance disclose location-related but not interest-related items, whereas another group may behave exactly the other way around. We also found other significant differences between these groups, in terms of privacy attitudes, behaviors, and demographic characteristics. These might for instance allow an online system to classify its users into their respective privacy group, and to adapt its privacy practices to the disclosure style of this group. We discuss how our results provide relevant insights for a more user-centric approach to privacy and, more generally, advance our understanding of online privacy behavior.},

Our aim in doing so is to highlight some of the opportunities and challenges involved in including an explicit focus on 'context' in qualitative privacy research in healthcare.

abstract = {The majority of digital games available today offer a variety of multi-player settings including co-located and mediated play between opponents. Immersion, the sense of being ''in the game,'' is one of the key components of the gaming experience but existing literature suggests that social play provides more fun but less immersion. There is however little empirical support for this. This paper therefore addresses the question: how does playing digital games in a social situation alter the sense of immersion felt by the individuals playing? This paper presents three experiments that test the relationship between social setting and immersion. The three experiments aim to manipulate the social setting in which players play, be it against a computer, against a person online or against a co-located person. Overall the three experiments show that players are more immersed when playing against another person rather than playing against a computer but there is no significant difference in immersion whether the other person is online or in the same room. This refutes previous claims about social play reducing immersion and indeed that social play enhances the sense of being in the game where interaction is through the game.},

First, participants in the EID condition achieved target goals significantly faster across all magnitudes of sensor noise. Second, participants in the EID condition exhibited more stable control; experiencing fewer and shorter oscillations around the target goals. This is the first study to empirically investigate the impact of the presence and magnitude of sensor noise on the robustness and effectiveness of an EID interface.

There have been a number of definitions for mental map preservation and many different algorithmic approaches to drive dynamic graph drawing to satisfy these definitions. One of the most frequently used definitions is that of Coleman and Parker where ''the placement of existing nodes and edges should change as little as possible when a change is made to the graph.'' A number of experiments have been run to test the effectiveness of this definition from a usability perspective. To date, no experiment has found conclusive evidence that supports the effectiveness of the mental map in the comprehension of a dynamic graph series. In this paper, we summarize the experiments conducted on this definition of mental map preservation and provide recommendations to designers and researchers to fully understand when the mental map supports user tasks.},

Each of these patterns connects one aspect of a given scenario to a conceptual model and offers guidelines for converting this aspect into a target model. Together, these four patterns transform a scenario into four interrelated requirements models. These scenario aspects are identified according to the concepts of scenarios used in both Cognitive Science and Requirements Engineering. This paper first lays out the theoretical foundation of this pattern language and then gives a detailed description, illustration and assessment of this language.},

We developed a virtual job interview simulation at a university career service to help student populations faced with the prospect of their first job interview. The virtual job interview simulation can deliver a realistic mock job interview within a high-quality immersive system that is similar to professional virtual reality (VR) systems. We conducted two experimental studies with a common theme: the role of graphical reality of the virtual interviewer and the immersive visual display in the virtual job interview simulation. The results are presented in this study based on a psycho-physiological approach, revealing variation in the distribution of participants' anxiety state across various VR conditions. The overall conclusion of this study is that the sense of anxiety is less correlated to the graphical realism in VR environment even though the more graphically detailed the virtual human was, the more it provoked a sense of presence. In addition, at least some degree of physical immersion is needed to maintain anxiety levels over the course of VR exposure.},

abstract = {While nowadays the most usual way to show emotions in digital contexts is via virtual characters, its use may raise false expectations (the user attributes human abilities to the virtual character). This paper proposes and explores an approach to express emotions which intends to minimize the user's expectations by using a non-anthropomorphic model. Emotions are represented in terms of arousal and valence dimensions. They are visualized in a simple way through the behaviour and appearance of a series of cartoonish clouds. In particular, the arousal value is expressed through the movement of these clouds (controlled by a flocking algorithm), while the valence value is expressed through their degree of darkness. Furthermore, the paper describes a user experiment which investigated whether the arousal and valence expressed by our model are appropriately interpreted by the users or not. The results suggest that movement and darkness are interpreted as arousal and valence respectively and that they are independent of each other.},

However, we also find that the colour-coding interface provides clinicians with a better overview of the information displayed by the electronic whiteboard.

Findings determined that redundant audio-visual modalities are as good as (but no better than) the visual modality, and both are superior to the auditory modality. Reported findings also determined that walking speeds are unaffected by communicative modality. Shape drawing tasks were performed on a touch screen using each modality, and a robust, novel error calculation algorithm was developed to assess the drawing error between the user input and the desired shapes. Drawing error was determined to be significantly higher with the Auditory condition, but drawing speed was unaffected by the communicative modality. The evaluation finds that the visual modality should be leveraged as the primary communicative modality for mobile, map-based interfaces. The drawing error algorithm can be applied to any domain that requires determining precise matchings to known information when drawing.},

abstract = {Effective acquisition of descriptive semantics for images is still an open issue today. Crowd-based human computation represents a family of approaches able to provide large scale metadata with decent quality. Within this field, games with a purpose (GWAP) have become increasingly important, as they have the potential to motivate contributors to the process through entertainment. However, the existing solutions are weak, when specific metadata are needed. In this work, we present a game with a purpose called PexAce, which utilizes manpower to collect tags characterizing a set of given images. Using novel game mechanics, the game is a single-player, less prone to cold-start problems and suitable for deployment in the domain of personal imagery. As our experiments show, the game delivers tags that characterize images with high precision (using a posteriori expert evaluation and evaluation against the gold standard: the extended Corel 5k dataset). We also employ the game in the domain of personal images, where very specific metadata are needed for their proper organization (person names, places, events) and show, that the game is able to collect even these kinds of metadata. We show that the key to higher quality metadata lies in combining the fun factor of the game with motivation for personal gain.},

abstract = {TimelyPresent is a single purpose information appliance for asynchronous messaging to connect three-generation families whose members need to keep in touch across large distances and in different time zones. The touch screen devices are used in pairs situated in the homes of family members. A user at one end can create a short video clip that is represented as a gift-wrapped present to be sent to the home of another family member. To reinforce the present metaphor the design deliberately confounds common assumptions made about electronic devices in that the present having been sent is no longer accessible to the sender and is delayed so that it arrives at the local time that it was recorded. The paper first describes the process by which this design was derived from the qualitative data in the form of quotes from an open-ended probe study. This process served to preserve the richness of the information in the quotes, while at the same time providing 'requirements' for design. The main part of the paper describes the results from a 2-month, four-family field study of the device. Logs recording the behaviour of users of TimelyPresent, transcripts of 15 interviews, and 133 presents created by the participants were analysed. Analysis of the logs showed that the families needed to preview presents before sending them and repeatedly revisit them after receipt. The analysis of the content of the presents demonstrated the need for the 'forward' and 'backward' facing cameras, now commonly provided in tablets and phones. A forward facing camera is needed because 70% of the presents featured a recording of someone doing something. Other categories of topic were simple ''I am thinking of you'' messages (15%), ''things I've done'' (8%), and requests for action (7%). Analysis of the interviews confirmed many of the social needs identified in previous work in this area as well as the value of the present metaphor and its ability to support playful use that enhances subsequent conversations using synchronous media.},

abstract = {Technological developments in smart phones and various sensors have been growing at a rapid pace, which leads people to share their context information with other users and support strangers in social network services (SNS). This allows us to study the effects of shared context information on socially supportive behaviors of individuals (Good Samaritans) in SNS. Our aim of this study is to investigate the pattern of social support amongst strangers in SNS. We aim to find out which types and forms of context information induce high levels of willingness to provide social support among strangers. We focus on four different types of context information (location, activity, emotion, or physical environment), which vary by degree of self-disclosure. We also investigated two forms of context information (subjective vs. objective), which differ depending on the provision of human interpretation. In order to achieve our research goals, we first constructed a causal model between context information and social support mediated by the theory of mind, which consists of simulation theory (empathy) and theory theory (rational reasoning). To verify the model, we conducted two exploratory pre-studies and a controlled main experiment. Our results indicated that types and forms of context information affect social support, simulation theory and theory theory. First, we found that a high level of self-disclosure positively effects social support. Context information in the subjective form induced more social supports compared to the objective form even though the information content itself is the same. Emotional context information presented in the subjective form has the strongest positive effect on social support. Furthermore, a high level of self-disclosure was found to positively affect context form's effect on simulation theory and social supports. In regard to theory theory, we discovered that high levels of self-disclosure have a positive effect. Both practical and theoretical implications of the study results have been presented. Theoretically, a conceptual model of the effects of context information on intention to provide social supports has been proposed and empirically verified. Practically, the interplay between context information types and forms can be utilized to construct social network services efficiently promoting social supports among fellow users. This paper ends with study limitations and implications.},

abstract = {Social media sites have become immensely popular. In 2010 it was estimated that Americans spent a quarter of their online time using social networking sites (SNSs) and blogs. Prior studies have shown how people spend more time socializing through digital communication services such as SNSs reducing face-to-face interaction. Individuals limited offline interactions cause a sense of self-perception of being less socially involved. In this paper we explore how the use of an ubiquitous system we developed, Tlatoque, is able to adapt and move the SNS's social capital outside the desktop into a domestic setting to support older adults' offline interactions with their family. The findings of a 21 week deployment study uncovered the offline practices surrounding the use of Tlatoque and its social implications toward the existing family ties (n=30). Results qualitatively indicate that the content shared in SNSs strengthens older adults' social network by enriching and complementing traditional social engagements such as those conducted over the phone or in-person.},

abstract = {Modern mobile devices support accessing Web-based social networking services from the user interface (UI) of Web browsers, applications, and mobile widgets. While effectively accessing these services, people may find it tedious to switch between multiple user interfaces in order to be aware of the latest content. Aiming for an improved user experience, we experimented with integration of these services into mobile devices' main user interface. The integrated content is presented beyond application silos and automatically filtered to highlight the relevant elements. A mobile system called LinkedUI was developed and deployed in one lab test and one field study. Three findings emerge from these studies. Firstly, it is feasible to construct an alternative device UI that supports integration of Web content across applications and services via hyperlinking. Time, publisher (e.g., contacts), content types, and geographical locations are key dimensions for association of content. Secondly, the alternative device UI enables better usability of accessing social networking services than accessing them from individual Web sites on mobile devices. It helps people to be aware of the latest content during microbreaks. Thirdly, automatic filtering, on the basis of one user's data, is one promising approach to identifying relevant content. Given filtered content, most people using the automatic filtering approved the functionality and experienced a better sense of control that is arguably due to the reduced information volume.},

abstract = {Users share a lot of personal information with friends, family members, and colleagues via social networks. Surprisingly, some users choose to share their sleeping patterns, perhaps both for awareness as well as a sense of connection to others. Indeed, sharing basic sleep data, whether a person has gone to bed or waking up, informs others about not just one's sleeping routines but also indicates physical state, and reflects a sense of wellness. We present Somnometer, a social alarm clock for mobile phones that helps users to capture and share their sleep patterns. While the sleep rating is obtained from explicit user input, the sleep duration is estimated based on monitoring a user's interactions with the app. Observing that many individuals currently utilize their mobile phone as an alarm clock revealed behavioral patterns that we were able to leverage when designing the app. We assess whether it is possible to reliably monitor one's sleep duration using such apps. We further investigate whether providing users with the ability to track their sleep behavior over a long time period can empower them to engage in healthier sleep habits. We hypothesize that sharing sleep information with social networks impacts awareness and connectedness among friends. The result from a controlled study reveals that it is feasible to monitor a user's sleep duration based just on her interactions with an alarm clock app on the mobile phone. The results from both an in-the-wild study and a controlled experiment suggest that providing a way for users to track their sleep behaviors increased user awareness of sleep patterns and induced healthier habits. However, we also found that, given the current broadcast nature of existing social networks, users were concerned with sharing their sleep patterns indiscriminately.},

This study aims to clarify why users share their context information in social network service (SNS), even while they are concerned with the potential risk at the same time. Drawing on the diverse theories of self-disclosure, we take an approach that the consideration of benefit encourages users to endure the existence of risk, and that users actively adjust the way they share their information to optimize the level of benefit and risk. In a qualitative study, we examined what kinds of risks and benefits exist in context information sharing situations and how users control them. An experiment was conducted using stimuli that simulate the actual use of SNS to investigate the effect of various context types and control types on users' expected benefit and risk and their intention to share. The results showed that both expected benefit and expected risk influenced users' intention to share. More interestingly, the effect of expected benefit was found to be stronger than that of expected risk. Moreover, different privacy control strategies were found to have induced different effects on the expected benefit and expected risk. Implications and limitations of this study were proposed at the end of this study.},

Jung and Lee, 2004.) have resulted in unsimilar findings with respect to subjective (users' evaluations) as well as objective (e.g. task performance of the users) measurements. The comparability of these results is mainly impeded by the use of different robots, a variety of virtual embodiments (video recording, computer simulation, animated characters, etc.) and different interaction scenarios. To overcome this problem, an experimental study was conducted in which the embodiment of an artificial entity was varied systematically as well as the type of interaction using a 2x2 between subjects design (N=83). Participants interacted with either a robot or a virtual representation of this robot (on a screen) in a task-oriented or a persuasive-conversational scenario. The results revealed that participants perceived the robot as more competent than the virtual character in the task-oriented scenario, but the opposite was true for the persuasive-conversational scenario. Furthermore, participants in the task-oriented scenario felt better after the interaction than participants who had a persuasive-conversational interaction with the artificial entity, regardless of its embodiment. No statistically significant differences between the experimental conditions emerged with respect to objective measures (persuasion and task performance). Various explanations for these findings are discussed and implications for the application of robots and virtual characters are derived.},

Physical workload is an important component of overall workload and influences human performance. The presented research examines physical workload metrics, appraises predictive models of physical workload, and investigates the impact of human-robot peer-based teaming situations on physical workload. Two evaluations are presented. The Guided evaluation required participants to follow guided instructions provided by a partner, either a remotely located human or a locally situated robot. The Collaborative evaluation required collaboration and teaming with joint decisions with either the locally situated human or robot partner. The results from both evaluations show that overall workload and subjectively rated physical workload was lower for the human-robot teams than the human-human teams; however, the physiologically measured physical workload was higher for the human-robot teams. The lack of a collocated human partner during the Guided evaluation did not affect the workload results. The modeling techniques and empirical measures used in the evaluations can be extended to other human-robot team situations.},

Results showed most users preferred the TUI version over the GUI version. This is a surprising finding, considering both versions were equivalent in regard to most performance parameters, and the TUI version was even perceived as inferior to the GUI version in regard to usability. Interviews with users revealed this preference stemmed from high levels of stimulation and enjoyment, derived from three TUI properties: physical interaction, rich feedback, and high levels of realism. Potential underlying mechanisms for these findings and practical implications are discussed.},

Players' movements are recorded with a motion capture system. The player then labels the movements and uses them as input to a machine learning algorithm that generates a responsive behavior model. This interface supports a more embodied approach to character design that we call ''Customizing by Doing''. We present a user study which shows that using their own movements made the users feel more engaged with the game and the design process, due in large part to a feeling of personal ownership of the movement.},

abstract = {Issues such as hand and tracker jitter negatively affect user performance with 3D selection techniques based on the ray-casting metaphor. This makes it difficult for users to select objects that have a small visible area, since small targets require high levels of precision. We introduce an approach to address this issue that uses progressive refinement of the set of selectable objects to reduce the required precision of the task. We present three exemplar techniques (sphere-casting refined by QUAD menu (SQUAD), discrete zoom, and continuous zoom) and derive a preliminary design space for progressive refinement from their characteristics. We explore the trade-offs between progressive refinement and immediate selection techniques in two studies: first comparing SQUAD to ray-casting; and second comparing the zooming techniques to ray-casting. In both studies, an analytical evaluation based on a distal pointing model and an empirical evaluation demonstrates that progressive refinement selection can provide significant benefits compared to immediate techniques. In the first study, SQUAD was much more accurate than ray-casting, and SQUAD was faster than ray-casting with small targets and less cluttered environments. The issue with SQUAD, however, is that it requires all selectable objects to be visually distinct. The zooming techniques address this issue by exploring other areas of the progressive refinement design space. They allow users to use the spatial relationships among objects as criteria for selection and to increase precision without requiring precision in pointing. The results of the second study show that while the zooming techniques were significantly slower than ray-casting, accuracy was much higher. Additionally, depending on the size of the target, users chose not to use zoom and, therefore, performed as fast as with ray-casting.},

MTi only requests that the user places his hand on the display with the fingers comfortably stretched apart. A dataset of 34 users was created on which our method reported 94.69% identification accuracy.

abstract = {Remote communication between people typically relies on audio and vision although current mobile devices are increasingly based on detecting different touch gestures such as swiping. These gestures could be adapted to interpersonal communication by using tactile technology capable of producing touch stimulation to a user's hand. It has been suggested that such mediated social touch would allow for new forms of emotional communication. The aim was to study whether vibrotactile stimulation that imitates human touch can convey intended emotions from one person to another. For this purpose, devices were used that converted touch gestures of squeeze and finger touch to vibrotactile stimulation. When one user squeezed his device or touched it with finger(s), another user felt corresponding vibrotactile stimulation on her device via four vibrating actuators. In an experiment, participant dyads comprising a sender and receiver were to communicate variations in the affective dimensions of valence and arousal using the devices. The sender's task was to create stimulation that would convey unpleasant, pleasant, relaxed, or aroused emotional intention to the receiver. Both the sender and receiver rated the stimulation using scales for valence and arousal so that the match between sender's intended emotions and receiver's interpretations could be measured. The results showed that squeeze was better at communicating unpleasant and aroused emotional intention, while finger touch was better at communicating pleasant and relaxed emotional intention. The results can be used in developing technology that enables people to communicate via touch by choosing touch gesture that matches the desired emotion.},

abstract = {In this article we report on a new digital interactive self-report method for the measurement of human affect. The AffectButton (Broekens and Brinkman, 2009. ACII 2009: IEEE) is a button that enables users to provide affective feedback in terms of values on the well-known three affective dimensions of pleasure (valence), arousal and dominance. The AffectButton is an interface component that functions and looks like a medium-sized button. The button presents one dynamically changing iconic facial expression that changes based on the coordinates of the user's pointer in the button. To give affective feedback the user selects the most appropriate expression by clicking the button, effectively enabling 1-click affective self-report on 3 affective dimensions. Here we analyze 5 previously published studies, and 3 novel large-scale studies (n=325, n=202, n=128). Our results show the reliability, validity, and usability of the button for acquiring three types of affective feedback in various domains. The tested domains are holiday preferences, real-time music annotation, emotion words, and textual situation descriptions (ANET). The types of affective feedback tested are preferences, affect attribution to the previously mentioned stimuli, and self-reported mood. All of the subjects tested were Dutch and aged between 15 and 56 years. We end this article with a discussion of the limitations of the AffectButton and of its relevance to areas including recommender systems, preference elicitation, social computing, online surveys, coaching and tutoring, experimental psychology and psychometrics, content annotation, and game consoles.},

Then, based on this architecture, we propose a generic, reconfigurable evaluation environment, called EISEval, designed and developed to help evaluators analyze and evaluate certain aspects of interactive systems in general and of agent-based architecture interactive systems in particular: User Interface (UI), non-functional properties (e.g., response time, complexity) and user characteristics (e.g., abilities, preferences, progress). System designers can draw useful conclusions from the evaluation results to improve the system. This environment was applied to evaluate an agent-based interactive system used to supervise an urban transport network in a study organized in laboratory.},

abstract = {In its traditional stance, participatory design (PD) is centred on certain work/application settings and is concerned with the involvement of representative users from these contexts. Nevertheless, current web technologies enable new forms of distributed participation which might allow PD processes to be implemented in a broader and flexible way, but may at the same time raise new issues in relation to participation. In this paper, we report on a Participatory Product Development project, using social technologies, where new issues were raised-a large population of heterogeneous and globally distributed users; a range of personal and institutional purposes, and the use of these technologies in a largely untested environment. We will reflect on insights that we gathered by through observation of and participation in a software development process driven and influenced by members of an existing online community. By means of participatory observation, analysis of the use of online tools and through semi- structured interviews we identified issues around different notions of timeliness and of process structures that are related to different roles, responsibilities and levels of experience. Our results indicate that the involvement of heterogeneous users in such a context needs to be handled carefully, for the reasons we set out. The role of user representatives acting for a broader online community can become crucial when managing heterogeneity, formulating acceptable compromises and- perhaps most crucially- dealing with different professional and 'hobbyist' worldviews. Additionally, we found that the use of standard web technologies only partly support online participation processes. PD 'in the wild' needs to be better embedded in use situations and environments (e.g., by linking discussion and design space, using feedback tools, continuous reflection of the current state of development) rather than refining participatory design as a meta-process separate from use.},

A recent study of Paulson et al. (2011) already demonstrated the successful use of hand posture for discriminating between several actions in an office setting. Inspired by their approach and following closely the results in motor planning and control from psychology (Makenzie and Iberall, 1994), we adopt a more cautious and punctilious approach in order to understand the opportunities that hand posture brings for recognizing properties of target objects. We present results from an experiment designed in order to investigate recognition of object properties during grasping in two different conditions: object translation (involving firm grasps) and object exploration (which includes a large variety of different hand and finger configurations). We show that object size and shape can be recognized with up to 98% accuracy during translation and up to 95% and 91% accuracies during exploration by employing user-dependent training. In contrast, experiments show less accuracy (up to 60%) for user-independent training for all tested classification techniques. We also point out the variability of individual grasping postures resulted during object exploration and the need for using classifiers trained with a large set of examples. The results of this work can benefit psychologists and researchers interested in human studies and motor control by providing more insights on grasping measurements, pattern recognition practitioners by reporting recognition results of new algorithms, as well as designers of interactive systems that work on gesture-based interfaces by providing them with design guidelines issued from our experiment.},

Three experiments tested the interleaving strategies of users completing simple office-based tasks while adjusting access control privileges to documents. Previous work predicted users would switch tasks to enable them to work on the task that produced the greatest current benefit-they would maximise the marginal rate of return. Results found that by interleaving between tasks users were able to focus on shorter tasks and that the interleaving decisions were consistent with a strategy of maximising the marginal rate of return. However, interruptions from access control tasks disrupted the processing involved in this task management and led to errors in task selection (Experiment 2) and task performance (Experiment 3). Task interleaving can therefore have costs in security contexts where errors can be catastrophic. Understanding which strategies maximise the marginal rate of return could predict users' task management behaviour.},

abstract = {Pointing at displays from a distance is becoming a common method of interacting with computer applications and entertainment systems, using devices such as the Wii Remote, the PlayStation Move controller, or the Microsoft Kinect. These systems often implement relative forms of ray-cast pointing, in which the user simply points a hand-held input device towards targets on the screen. Ray-casting interaction is easy for novices to learn and understand, but this technique often suffers from accuracy problems: for example, hand jitter, arm fatigue, calibration drift, or lack of skill can all reduce people's ability to acquire and select on-screen targets. In this paper, we analyse and evaluate the idea of target assistance as a way to address the accuracy problems of ray-cast pointing. Although several assistance schemes have been proposed for mouse-based pointing, these ideas have not been tested in distant-pointing settings, and there is little knowledge available to guide design in this increasingly common interaction scenario. To establish this basic design knowledge, we carried out four studies of relative ray-casting using three different target assistance techniques-two motor-space techniques (sticky targets and a novel form of target gravity), and one acquisition-feedback technique that combined visual, tactile, and auditory feedback. Our first three studies tested each assistance technique separately, to explore how different parameters for each method affected performance and perceptibility. Our fourth study carried out a direct comparison of the best versions of each technique, and also examined the effects of distractor objects placed in the path to the target. Our studies found that the two motor-space techniques were extremely effective in improving selection accuracy without being highly obvious to users, and that the new gravity-based technique (which attracts the cursor even when it is not over the target) performed best of all. There was no observed effect on performance when the combined acquisition-feedback technique was used. Our studies are the first to comprehensively explore the optimization, performance, and perceptibility of target assistance techniques for relative ray-casting-our results provide designers with clear guidelines about what methods to use, how to configure the techniques, and what effects can be expected from their use.},

We propose a teaching aid that combines graphic analogies and haptics intended to improve the grasp of non-intuitive nanoscale phenomena for people without prior knowledge of nanophysics. We look specifically at the most important nanophysical phenomenon, namely, the behavior of the probe of an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) as it approaches a sample. The results from experiments carried out with 45 students indicate that a ''magnet-spring'' analogy helped beginners to establish the link between the behavior of a probe and its force-distance curve. The addition of haptic feedback increased focus about forces and improved the interpretation of the effect of cantilever stiffness. Haptic feedback and the analogical representation were very much appreciated by the subjects and had an impact on the construction of a mental model. Taken together, our results show a positive influence of using haptic feedback and graphic analogies, especially when students are first exposed to the notions that are in effect at the nanoscale.},

abstract = {In this paper, we performed an exploration on the design and evaluation of pen tail gesture, an interaction method that allows the use of pen tail movement to initiate interactions. Based on our interviews with some designers and researchers who regularly used pen-based tools, we conducted three experiments to establish baseline criteria to distinguish intentional pen tail gestures from incidental pen tail movements, and to understand the basic movement behaviors in pen tail gestures. We developed designs and recognition methods of pen gestures, and implemented three application prototypes based on them. Our research can inspire some new designs of pen-based tools and enrich the design repertoire of pen-based user interfaces.},

abstract = {Auditory interfaces can overcome visual interfaces when a primary task, such as driving, competes for the attention of a user controlling a device, such as radio. In emerging interfaces enabled by camera tracking, auditory displays may also provide viable alternatives to visual displays. This paper presents a user study of interoperable auditory and visual menus, in which control gestures remain the same in the visual and the auditory domain. Tested control methods included a novel free-hand gesture interaction with camera-based tracking, and touch screen interaction with a tablet. The task of the participants was to select numbers from a visual or an auditory menu including a circular layout and a numeric keypad layout. Results show, that even with participant's full attention to the task, the performance and accuracy of the auditory interface are the same or even slightly better than the visual when controlled with free-hand gestures. The auditory menu was measured to be slower in touch screen interaction, but questionnaire revealed that over half of the participants felt that the circular auditory menu was faster than the visual menu. Furthermore, visual and auditory feedback in touch screen interaction with numeric layout was measured fastest, touch screen with circular menu second fastest, and the free-hand gesture interface was slowest. The results suggest that auditory menus can potentially provide a fast and desirable interface to control devices with free-hand gestures.},

abstract = {The dual task is a data-rich paradigm for evaluating speech modes of a synthetic talking head. Three experiments manipulated auditory-visual (AV) and auditory-only (A-only) speech produced by text-to-speech synthesis from a talking head (Experiment 1-single task; Experiment 2-dual task), and natural speech produced by a human male similar in appearance to the talking head (Experiment 3-dual task). In a dual task, participants perform two tasks concurrently with a secondary reaction time (RT) task sensitive to cognitive processing demands of the primary task. In the primary task, participants either shadowed words or named the superordinate categories to which words belonged under AV (dynamic face with lips moving) or A-only (static face) speech modes. First, it was hypothesized that category naming is more difficult than shadowing. The hypothesis was supported in each experiment with significantly longer latencies on the primary task and slower RT on the secondary task. Second, an AV advantage was hypothesized and supported by significantly shorter latencies for the AV modality on the primary task of Experiment 3 and with partial support in Experiment 1. Third, it was hypothesized that while the AV modality helps it also creates great cognitive load. Significantly longer RT for AV presentation in the secondary tasks supported this hypothesis. The results indicate that task difficulty influences speech perception. Performance on a secondary task can reveal cognitive demand that is not evident in a single task or self-report ratings. A dual task will be an effective evaluation tool in operational environments where multiple tasks are conducted (e.g., responding to spoken directions and monitoring displays) and an implicit, sensitive measure of cognitive load is imperative.},

abstract = {Pointing techniques that offer users multiple trajectories to a target have the potential to reduce pointing time by allowing a shorter than normal movement distance. However, such techniques potentially introduce additional elements into the pointing task involving identification of the alternative trajectories, assessment of their relative performance, and selection of the one to use. These additional tasks may reduce or negate the benefits of offering shorter paths. To better understand these issues, we developed a methodology for controlling the relative benefits of alternative target trajectories, and used it to evaluate three interfaces-a 'pointer wrapping' technique that allows the cursor to traverse from one screen edge to the opposing edge, and a system allowing users to choose between multiple cursors in two configurations ('Ninja cursors'). We found that performance with these techniques was significantly worse than that predicted by Fitts' law for a single cursor, suggesting that the additional elements in their use are significant. Detailed analysis of behaviour during acquisitions showed that much of this cost is accrued in the mental preparation that precedes motor action, and in additional volatility in the pointing movements. We discuss how the method and findings may assist those developing enhanced pointing techniques.},

abstract = {The interactive demands of the upcoming ubiquitous computing era have set off researchers and practitioners toward prototyping new gesture-sensing devices and gadgets. At the same time, the practical needs of developing for such miniaturized prototypes with sometimes very low processing power and memory resources make practitioners in high demand of fast gesture recognizers employing little memory. However, the available work on motion gesture classifiers has mainly focused on delivering high recognition performance with less discussion on execution speed or required memory. This work investigates the performance of today's commonly used 3D motion gesture recognizers under the effect of different gesture dimensionality and bit cardinality representations. Specifically, we show that few sampling points and low bit depths are sufficient for most motion gesture metrics to attain their peak recognition performance in the context of the popular Nearest-Neighbor classification approach. As a practical consequence, 16x faster recognizers working with 32x less memory while delivering the same high levels of recognition performance are being reported. We present recognition results for a large gesture corpus consisting in nearly 20,000 gesture samples. In addition, a toolkit is provided to assist practitioners in optimizing their gesture recognizers in order to increase classification speed and reduce memory consumption for their designs. At a deeper level, our findings suggest that the precision of the human motor control system articulating 3D gestures is needlessly surpassed by the precision of today's motion sensing technology that unfortunately bares a direct connection with the sensors' cost. We hope this work will encourage practitioners to consider improving the performance of their prototypes by careful analysis of motion gesture representation rather than by throwing more processing power and more memory into the design.},

abstract = {Coordination theory, created in a collaborative HCI context, has long emphasized the importance of implicit coordination. Such coordination is possible through interactivity design that creates shared cognition. Teams experience implicit coordination when they achieve tacit task coordination without direct or purposeful communication of task strategies among the participants, but this is impossible to achieve without shared cognition. Implicit coordination is often more effective than explicit coordination, and teams increasingly lack sufficient time or capabilities to coordinate explicitly; therefore, methods to foster implicit coordination could result in highly practical techniques to improve task performance. Implicit coordination, despite its promise, has not received much attention in the HCI literature. A particular problem we believe has hindered the application of implicit coordination is the dearth of objective measurement of implicit coordination and the related construct shared cognition. Teams have difficulty improving, implementing, and proving the value of implicit coordination without measurement. For our theoretical foundation, we use implicit coordination theory (ICT) to explain and predict how a simple shared interface in a group error-detection task can establish formalized group memory and group awareness, which foster the shared cognition necessary for implicit coordination to occur. To test ICT, we demonstrate innovative measurement of implicit coordination and shared cognition-without intrusive perceptual survey items-by leveraging measures from signal detection theory (SDT). We use the context of teams performing heuristic data-flow diagramming (HDFD) (which is similar to the Prepare, Collect, and Repair (PCR)-based process of heuristic evaluation) to measure the improved shared cognition and implicit coordination. Namely, we measured shared cognition with SDT's measure of response bias (c); we measured implicit coordination with SDT's measure of discrimination (d'). Supporting our ICT-based predictions, groups operating with a shared interface indeed experienced more shared cognition and implicit coordination-resulting in higher discrimination, more positive response bias, and more accurate hit rates and false-alarm rates than the control groups. Our results show great promise in making similar predictions, measurements, and improvements in other individual or group inspection tasks, which are prevalent in HCI development research and practice.},

abstract = {This study presents a framework for understanding task and psychological factors affecting reliance on advice from decision aids. The framework describes how informational asymmetries in combination with rational, motivational and heuristic factors explain human reliance behavior. To test hypotheses derived from the framework, 79 participants performed an uncertain pattern learning and prediction task. They received advice from a decision aid either before or after they expressed their own prediction, and received feedback about performance. When their prediction conflicted with that of the decision aid, participants had to choose to rely on their own prediction or on that of the decision aid. We measured reliance behavior, perceived and actual reliability of self and decision aid, responsibility felt for task outcomes, understandability of one's own reasoning and of the decision aid, and attribution of errors. We found evidence that (1) reliance decisions are based on relative trust, but only when advice is presented after people have formed their own prediction; (2) when people rely as much on themselves as on the decision aid, they still perceive the decision aid to be more reliable than themselves; (3) the less people perceive the decision aid's reasoning to be cognitively available and understandable, the less people rely on the decision aid; (4) the more people feel responsible for the task outcome, the more they rely on the decision aid; (5) when feedback about performance is provided, people underestimate both one's own reliability and that of the decision aid; (6) underestimation of the reliability of the decision aid is more prevalent and more persistent than underestimation of one's own reliability; and (7) unreliability of the decision aid is less attributed to temporary and uncontrollable (but not external) causes than one's own unreliability. These seven findings are potentially applicable for the improved design of decision aids and training procedures.},

abstract = {This paper presents novel subject-dependent biosignal features, with a view towards increasing the effectiveness of automatic psychological stress detection. The features proposed in this work focus on suppressing between-subject variability that typically appears in biosignals like the skin conductance (SC) and the electrocardiogram (ECG), and degrades the performance of relevant emotion recognition (ER) systems. For this purpose, the proposed features employ filtering of input signals, on the basis of ''rest signatures'' calculated from each subject's baseline recordings. These signatures are biosignal transformations capable to express each individual's baseline deviation from signal templates, which would ideally be applied during rest. The proposed subject-dependent features, extracted from SC and ECG modalities, were found capable to significantly increase automatic stress detection accuracy over a multi-subject (N=24) data set, collected through an experiment of natural stress induction. They provided accuracy at the level of 95%, significantly improved to the respective result (86.05%) taken from common SC and ECG features that have been typically used in the past. They appeared also similarly effective in automatic frustration detection over a further dataset. The results of the present work indicate that the proposed subject-dependent features, can lead to significant advances in the performance of future relevant ER systems.},

Developing websites around the needs of those with visual impairments is especially critical as the affluent Baby Boomer generation ages and is faced with a multitude of vision problems. Despite this fast growing, web-reliant population, little work has been done to develop a behavioral model that addresses its needs. Grounded in accessibility and acceptance theories, this research proposes a model that predicts Web usage behavior of blind and low-vision users. Our results show that one of the most widely used acceptance models does not predict the adoption behavior of visually impaired users as effectively as a modified model that includes information accessibility. Those with visual impairments decide to revisit a website based, in part, on its accessibility as well as its ease of use and usefulness. These results suggest that traditional acceptance models may predict the behavior of users with visual impairments better when reliability and convenience of access to Information are also considered.},

abstract = {A user operating an interactive system performs actions such as ''pressing a button'' and these actions cause state transitions in the system. However to perform an action, a user has to do what amounts to a state transition themselves, from the state of having completed the previous action to the state of starting to perform the next action; this user transition is out of step with the system's transition. This paper introduces action graphs, an elegant way of making user transitions explicit in the arcs of a graph derived from the system specification. Essentially, a conventional transition system has arcs labeled in the form ''user performs action A'' whereas an action graph has arcs labelled in the form ''having performed action P, the user performs Q.'' Action graphs support many modelling techniques (such as GOMS, KLM or shortest paths) that could have been applied to the user's actions or to the system graph, but because it combines both, the modelling techniques can be used more powerfully. Action graphs can be used to directly apply user performance metrics and hence perform formal evaluations of interactive systems. The Fitts Law is one of the simplest and most robust of such user modelling techniques, and is used as an illustration of the value of action graphs in this paper. Action graphs can help analyze particular tasks, any sample of tasks, or all possible tasks a device supports-which would be impractical for empirical evaluations. This is an important result for analyzing safety critical interactive systems, where it is important to cover all possible tasks in testing even when doing so is not feasible using human participants because of the complexity of the system. An algorithm is presented for the construction of action graphs. Action graphs are then used to study devices (a consumer device, a digital multimeter, an infusion pump) and results suggest that: optimal time is correlated with keystroke count, and that keyboard layout has little impact on optimal times. Many other applications of action graphs are suggested.},

In addition, we have developed a web page design support database based on a user-centered experimental procedure and a neural network model. This design support database can be used to examine how a specific combination of design elements, particularly the ratio of graphics to text, will affect the users' feelings about a web page. As a general rule, the ratio of graphics to text between 3:1 and 1:1 will give the users the best feelings of ease-to-use and clear-to-follow. A web page with a ratio of 1:1 will have the most realistic look, while a ratio of over 3:1 will have the fanciest appearance.

abstract = {We explore improving support for revisitation in documents by automatically generating bookmarks based on users' reading history. After showing that dwell time and number of visits are not appropriate for predicting revisitations in documents, we model the high-level reading task as a sequence of reading blocks and recognize long-distance scrolls as separators between them. A long-distance scroll is defined as a continuous scrolling action which causes the document to be navigated beyond a one-page distance. We propose a new technique, called the Head-Tail (HT) algorithm, to generate bookmarks at the head and the tail of reading blocks, whose validity is quantitatively verified by log data analysis. Two studies were conducted to investigate this HT implicit bookmarking technique. The first is a controlled experiment that compared the HT algorithm to the widely used simple recency algorithm for generating implicit bookmarks, in terms of revisit coverage ability and distance between bookmarks. Results showed the HT algorithm to be superior in both measures. The second is a more ecologically valid study that investigated implicit bookmarking performance in real reading tasks, using Adobe Reader integrated with our implicit bookmarking technique. Results showed that our technique covered 85.1% of revisitations and saved users from 66.0% of long-distance scrolling actions. We end with a discussion of how to encourage users to use implicit bookmarks.},

abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that people show social reactions when interacting with human-like virtual agents. For instance, human users behave in a socially desirable way, show increased cooperation or apply human-like communication. It has, however, so far not been tested whether users are prone to mimic the artificial agent's behavior although this is a widely cited phenomenon of human-human communication that seems to be especially indicative of the sociality of the situation. We therefore conducted an experiment, in which we analyzed whether humans reciprocate an agent's smile. In a between-subjects design, 104 participants conducted an 8-min small-talk conversation with an agent that either did not smile, showed occasional smiles, or displayed frequent smiles. Results show that although smiling did not have a distinct impact on the evaluation of the agent, the human interaction partners themselves smiled longer when the agent was smiling.},

abstract = {The idea of robotic companions capable of establishing meaningful relationships with humans remains far from being accomplished. To achieve this, robots must interact with people in natural ways, employing social mechanisms that people use while interacting with each other. One such mechanism is empathy, often seen as the basis of social cooperation and prosocial behaviour. We argue that artificial companions capable of behaving in an empathic manner, which involves the capacity to recognise another's affect and respond appropriately, are more successful at establishing and maintaining a positive relationship with users. This paper presents a study where an autonomous robot with empathic capabilities acts as a social companion to two players in a chess game. The robot reacts to the moves played on the chessboard by displaying several facial expressions and verbal utterances, showing empathic behaviours towards one player and behaving neutrally towards the other. Quantitative and qualitative results of 31 participants indicate that users towards whom the robot behaved empathically perceived the robot as friendlier, which supports our hypothesis that empathy plays a key role in human-robot interaction.},

abstract = {Schematic maps are an important component of assistance for navigating transport networks worldwide. By showing routes as simple straight lines, they reduce the cognitive load of journey planning, and by revealing the underlying structure of networks, they make their key features easier to identify and learn. However, although there are many suggestions for optimizing schematic maps so as to maximize these benefits, to date these have not been directly supported by published usability studies or psychological theory. In this paper, we suggest that there are circumstances in which conventional schematic maps fail to yield benefits, and we compare journey planning using the current official RATP Paris Metro map with an all-curves design which replaces straight lines and corners with gentle curves. Three separate usability studies with slightly different methodologies showed that the journey planning time for the all-curves map was better than the RATP version, with effect sizes ranging from 0.48 to 1.12. Subjective usability ratings were derived from questionnaires, and user preferences, but neither were correlated with objective usability measures. We conclude that (1) in terms of designing schematics, there is no evidence to suggest that any rule-set can be claimed to be a gold-standard, and it is important to match the design rules to the properties of the network, (2) in some circumstances, radical departures from traditional ideas can yield usability benefits, and (3) map usability appears to be distinct from map engagement, although the latter is undoubtedly important in encouraging people fully to make use of navigation aides.},

This paper presents a study of four candidate display styles. Three of them, Vertical, Horizontal, and Compact-Horizontal, are used in commercial products. The fourth style, Matrix, is novel. The candidate display style is studied in conjunction with various manual selection devices including Mouse, Numeric Keys, Spacebar, Cursor Key, and Numeric Keypad. Results show that a great deal of time is taken to choose the correct character in both Chinese and Japanese input. The candidate display style affects both input efficiency and subjective preference. Results also show that the Compact-Horizontal display style outperforms other display styles with a normal keyboard but the Matrix display style is the most efficient when used with a Numeric Keypad due to stimulus-response compatibility and the movement efficiency of such a design.},

abstract = {The area of multitouch interaction research is at its infancy. The commercial sector has seen an exponential growth in this area with ubiquitous products like Apple i-Phone, i-Pad, and Microsoft surface table. In spite of their popularity, developers are still finding it difficult to extend this novel interface to engineering applications such as computer aided design (CAD), due to insufficient understanding of the factors that affect the multitouch interface interaction when applied to CAD operations. The objective of this research is to (1) outline the key elements of the multitouch interface for CAD, (2) identify the factors affecting the performance of a multitouch enabled CAD modeling environment, and (3) lay a foundation for future research and highlight the directions for extending the multitouch interface for CAD and other engineering applications. To demonstrate specific results we have conducted mouse emulation experiments. We compared the performance of two finger touch-based interaction techniques (drag state finger touch and track state finger touch) and a standard mouse device for 3D CAD modeling operations. The results indicated that both the task completion time and error rates are statistically the same for both the finger touch-based techniques. However, the error concentration observed from the experiments revealed that for the edge selection tasks, the track state technique is more suited than the drag state technique. Both the finger touch-based techniques suffered from precise dimension control while executing the tasks. The inclusion of a grid on the design space for modeling purpose reduced user errors. The mouse device outperformed both the finger touch-based techniques and yielded statistically better results in terms of task completion time and error rates.},

These viewpoints include (1) the rejection of the notion of knowledge as a commodity to be transferred from one locus to another, (2) an acceptance of the situated nature of human expertise, (3) emphasis on knowledge acquisition as the modeling of problem solving, and (4) the pursuit of reusable patterns in problem solving and in domain descriptions that can facilitate both modeling and system implementation.

My major message is that knowledge modeling is an underrated but still important method to reduce the complexity problems that arise in constructing knowledge-based applications. Scale - as apparent in the Semantic Web - is another important parameter in recent developments in Knowledge Acquisition: it requires other techniques than those of the 1980s. Natural Language Processing is the most promising way forward, but also the most difficult source of the acquisition of formalized knowledge. I will argue that some of the lessons learned in building knowledge-based systems may carry over to reasoning in the Semantic Web and to knowledge acquisition from natural language web sources.},

abstract = {Looking back over 25yrs of R&amp;D in knowledge acquisition - particularly mediated by workshops and a journal founded by Brian Gaines - it is remarkable how topics and perspectives have changed. We started from the assumption that the knowledge acquisition bottleneck was due to the problems of experts expressing their expert knowledge. However, explicitly available knowledge, as, e.g. in handbooks, appeared often sufficient to construct an adequate 'artificial problem solver'. Expert systems became knowledge systems. The bottleneck was rather experienced in modeling the domain knowledge and the reasoning control - the problem solving method (PSM) - for automated execution. By developing libraries of reusable PSMs, or implementing shells with built-in PSMs, this bottleneck could be eased. Specifications of domain knowledge lead to the development of ontologies: another source for reuse. Despite the fact that this brought sufficient technology for a mature engineering methodology, little use is made of it in current practice, and developing 'intelligent' software is not much different today from what it was at the beginning of the 1980s. A more impressive heritage of knowledge acquisition R&amp;D is the introduction of technology for building ontologies. These found their way via knowledge management to the architecture of the Semantic Web. In research apparent solutions also bring new problems. Two of these problems are suggested by empirical cognitive science research. The first one is that knowledge as represented in currently available (top-level) ontologies are too simple, because high level concepts may come in design 'patterns': a view that has recently also been taken up in the knowledge acquisition community. The second problem is the fact that despite much empirical research in cognitive psychology, we have insufficient insight in how we acquire new conceptualisations from text. This is a serious bottleneck for an early dream in knowledge acquisition: automated knowledge acquisition.},

abstract = {In the early years of knowledge acquisition research there was considerable discussion about the possibility of obtaining knowledge from experts, based on the ideas of situated cognition. The central idea from situated cognition was that knowledge is only ever created in a context and so cannot be used reliably out of context. These ideas seem to have had little impact on most of the knowledge acquisition research that followed, probably because they seemed to be too negative about the possibilities for knowledge-based systems. This paper suggests that situated cognition can be reinterpreted as making the positive suggestion that if people distinguish between different conclusions in different contexts, they do so because they can identify features that distinguish the contexts. This type of case or context differentiation could be readily integrated with a range of knowledge acquisition frameworks, and experience with Ripple-Down Rules suggests that it provides a very simple way for domain experts and others to easily provide a large amount of knowledge for a system.},

In this paper we look at the influence the Web has had on knowledge acquisition and vice versa. To this end we discuss in some depth four topics, namely the ontology language OWL, the vocabulary language SKOS, the notion of ontology alignment and the potential of semantic search. Even from this limited selection of research issues related to ''Web knowledge'' it is safe to conclude that the Web has had a large impact on knowledge acquisition, but also the other way around.},

abstract = {Teaching argumentation is challenging, and the factors of how to effectively support the acquisition of argumentation skills through technology are not fully explored yet. One of the key reasons for that is the lack of comparability between studies. In this article, we describe LASAD, a collaborative argumentation framework that can be flexibly parameterized. We illustrate the flexibility of the framework with respect to visualization, structural definitions and kind of cooperation. Using this framework, this paper presents an evaluation of the impact of using an argumentation system with different argument representations and with collaborative vs. individual use on the outcomes of scientific argumentation. We investigate which combinations of these factors produces the best results concerning argument production and learning outcomes. The results of this controlled lab study with 36 participants showed that the use of simple representational formats is superior compared to highly structured ones. Even though the latter encouraged the provision of additional non-given material, the former is less error-prone. A hypothesized structural guidance provided by more complex formats could not be confirmed. With respect to collaboration, the results highlight that arguing in groups lead to more cluttered argumentation maps, including a higher amount of duplicate elements. An expected peer-reviewing between group members did not occur. Yet, groups also tended to include more points-of-view in their arguments, leading to more elaborated argument maps.},

This review helps to identify key awareness-related requirements for the development of collaborative systems. The second contribution is related to the proposal of a generic situation model that is based on the concept of entities, interactions and specific roles. This new conceptual framework intends to favor situation awareness and support shared representations. It concerns both technical and organizational design activities and describes the collaborative situations from multiple views and at different organizational levels (project, team and individual). The proposal's interest and its feasibility for use in the development of collaborative systems are demonstrated by instances related to a case study and by analyzing the potential satisfaction of the identified awareness-related requirements. To sum up, the paper offers a synthesis of key context-related concepts and a generic model for the representation of collaborative situations to increase awareness.},

This multi-path video approach was designed to circumvent limitations of traditionally linear video for use as a shared representation in collaborative knowledge building activities. The article describes how people created video resources in collaborative activities in two different settings. We discuss different modes of working that were observed and outline the specific challenges of using the video medium as shared representation. Finally we demonstrate how an analysis of collaborative dimensions of the shared multi-path video representation can be applied to discuss the design space and to raise the discourse about the usefulness of these representations in knowledge building environments.},

We observed how the technologies proposed to manage those representations were successful only to the extent they were made able to adapt to the dynamic and open conventions that actors adopted during their activities. The point of the paper is that locality, openness and underspecification are key factors in this process, for their capability to promote tacit knowledge and to let competent actors reach a sufficient level of mutual understanding towards some common goal. The paper proposes a conceptual framework to characterize the notion of knowledge artifact interpreted as a semiotic system where actors can make sense of shared and underspecified representations, and derives from this notion implications for the design of a supportive technology.},

In particular, we show through an empirical study of 78 participants that providing cues to identity and shared pointers increases mutual engagement between participants, but together these features can overwhelm users. We also demonstrate that support for free-form annotation and spatial interaction with shared representations mediates interaction and helps participants to manage their collaborative activity effectively. In this paper we develop several measures mutual engagement and demonstrate their use to assess the design of shared representations. A key contribution of this paper is the development of a measure of collocation of participant interaction which indicates mutual engagement. The findings of the study have implications beyond the domain of collaborative music making and we outline some design guidelines for mutually engaging shared representations.},

To address this problem, we investigate audemes, a new category of non-speech sounds whose semiotic structure and flexibility open new horizons for the aural interaction with content-rich applications. Three experiments with blind participants examined the attributes of an audeme that most facilitate the accurate recognition of their meaning. A sequential concatenation of different sound types (music, sound effect) yielded the highest meaning recognition, whereas an overlapping arrangement of sounds of the same type (music, music) yielded the lowest meaning recognition. We discuss seven guidelines to design well-formed audemes.},

abstract = {Vehicle crashes caused by driver distraction are of increasing concern. One approach to reduce the number of these crashes mitigates distraction by giving drivers feedback regarding their performance. For these mitigation systems to be effective, drivers must trust and accept them. The objective of this study was to evaluate real-time and post-drive mitigation systems designed to reduce driver distraction. The real-time mitigation system used visual and auditory warnings to alert the driver to distracting behavior. The post-drive mitigation system coached drivers on their performance and encouraged social conformism by comparing their performance to peers. A driving study with 36 participants between the ages of 25 and 50 years old (M=34) was conducted using a high-fidelity driving simulator. An extended Technology Acceptance Model captured drivers' acceptance of mitigation systems using four constructs: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, unobtrusiveness, and behavioral intention to use. Perceived ease of use was found to be the primary determinant and perceived usefulness the secondary determinant of behavioral intention to use, while the effect of unobtrusiveness on intention to use was fully mediated by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The real-time system was more obtrusive and less easy to use than the post-drive system. Although this study included a relatively narrow age range (25 to 50 years old), older drivers found both systems more useful. These results suggest that informing drivers with detailed information of their driving performance after driving is more acceptable than warning drivers with auditory and visual alerts while driving.},

abstract = {This article proposes enhanced techniques for improving the controllability of tilt interaction. Tilt interaction offers an intuitive, one-handed form of interaction for mobile applications. Tilt interaction is particularly well-suited to mobile map-based applications, where traditional mobile interaction techniques suffer from several shortcomings. Current implementations of tilt interaction, however, suffer from several shortcomings. Existing zooming techniques used in conjunction with tilt interaction are often difficult to control. Tilt-controlled panning can also be difficult to control in a mobile context of use, where the user's walking motion affects the accuracy of tilt interaction. The use of rate-controlled tilt interaction to perform zooming is proposed. Two different approaches to sensitivity adaptation are investigated, where the sensitivity of tilt-controlled panning is automatically adjusted to compensate for the user's current context of use. A usability study was conducted with thirty participants to evaluate the proposed techniques. The results of the usability study showed that tilt zooming offered better efficiency, user satisfaction and perceived workload than gesture zooming. The use of a static dampening factor to compensate for walking motion was found to provide actual and perceived controllability improvements.},

We include a user's sex and their website design experience as important moderators on this relationship. Results show a positive relationship between perceived web knowledge and web usability, and under the context of website design experience, more value is placed on the utility of the web, rather than on its ease of use. This moderation effect is stronger for female than it is for male web users.

Although such effects have been observed in various domains (e.g., instruction and interface designs), little is known about the cognitive processing mechanisms underlying these effects, nor its applicability to complex visual problem solving. In three experiments, we showed that the impact of spatial arrangement of information on problem solving time can be surprisingly large for complex real world tasks. It was also found that the effect can be caused by large increases in slow, external information searches (Experiment 1), that the spatial arrangement itself is the critical factor and the effect is domain-general (Experiment 2a), and that the underlying mechanism can involve micro-strategy selection for information encoding in a response to differing information access cost (Experiment 2b). Overall, these studies show a large slowdown effect (i.e., approximately 30%) that stacking information produces over spatially distributed information, and multiple paths by which this effect can be produced.},

abstract = {An innovative motoric measure of slant based on gait is proposed as the angle between the foot and the walking surface during walking. This work investigates whether the proposed action-based measure is affected by factors such as material and inclination of the walking surface. Experimental studies were conducted in a real environment set-up and in its virtual simulation counterpart evaluating behavioural fidelity and user performance in ecologically-valid simulations. In the real environment, the measure slightly overestimated the inclined path whereas in the virtual environment it slightly underestimated the inclined path. The results imply that the proposed slant measure is modulated by motoric caution. Since the ''reality'' of the synthetic environment was relatively high, performance results should have revealed the same degree of caution as in the real world, however, that was not the case. People become more cautious when the ground plane was steep, slippery, or virtual.},

Two versions, the constructive and the value-account iScale, were motivated by two distinct theories on how people reconstruct emotional experiences from memory. These two versions were tested in two separate studies. Study 1 aimed at providing qualitative insight into the use of iScale and compared its performance to that of free-hand graphing. Study 2 compared the two versions of iScale to free recall, a control condition that does not impose structure on the reconstruction process. Overall, iScale resulted in an increase in the amount, the richness, and the test-retest consistency of recalled information as compared to free recall. These results provide support for the viability of retrospective techniques as a cost-effective alternative to longitudinal studies.},

In the first study, 119 screenshots of real websites varying in VC (low vs. medium vs. high) and PT (low vs. high) were rated on perceived aesthetics. Screenshot presentation time was varied as a between-subject factor (50ms vs. 500ms vs. 1000ms). Results reveal that VC and PT affect participants' aesthetics ratings within the first 50ms of exposure. In the second study presentation times were shortened to 17, 33 and 50ms. Results suggest that VC and PT affect aesthetic perception even within 17ms, though the effect of PT is less pronounced than the one of VC. With increasing presentation time the effect of PT becomes as influential as the VC effect. This supports the reasoning of the information-processing stage model of aesthetic processing (Leder et al., 2004), where VC is processed at an earlier stage than PT. Overall, websites with low VC and high PT were perceived as highly appealing.},

abstract = {We address a ''sticking object'' problem for the release of whole-hand virtual grasps. The problem occurs when grasping techniques require fingers to be moved outside an object's boundaries after a user's (real) fingers interpenetrate virtual objects due to a lack of physical motion constraints. This may be especially distracting for grasp techniques that introduce mismatches between tracked and visual hand configurations to visually prevent interpenetration. Our method includes heuristic analysis of finger motion and a transient incremental motion metaphor to manage a virtual hand during grasp release. We integrate the method into a spring model for whole-hand virtual grasping to maintain the physically-based pickup and manipulation behavior of such models. We show that the new spring model improves release speed and accuracy based on pick-and-drop, targeted ball-drop, and cube-alignment experiments. In contrast to a standard spring-based grasping method, measured release quality does not depend notably on object size. Users subjectively prefer the new approach and it can be tuned to avoid potential side effects such as increased drops or visual distractions. We further investigated a convergence speed parameter to find the subjectively good range and to better understand tradeoffs in subjective artifacts on the continuum between pure incremental motion and rubber-band-like convergence behavior.},

abstract = {Breakdowns in complex systems often occur as a result of system elements interacting in unanticipated ways. In systems with human operators, human-automation interaction associated with both normative and erroneous human behavior can contribute to such failures. Model-driven design and analysis techniques provide engineers with formal methods tools and techniques capable of evaluating how human behavior can contribute to system failures. This paper presents a novel method for automatically generating task analytic models encompassing both normative and erroneous human behavior from normative task models. The generated erroneous behavior is capable of replicating Hollnagel's zero-order phenotypes of erroneous action for omissions, jumps, repetitions, and intrusions. Multiple phenotypical acts can occur in sequence, thus allowing for the generation of higher order phenotypes. The task behavior model pattern capable of generating erroneous behavior can be integrated into a formal system model so that system safety properties can be formally verified with a model checker. This allows analysts to prove that a human-automation interactive system (as represented by the model) will or will not satisfy safety properties with both normative and generated erroneous human behavior. We present benchmarks related to the size of the statespace and verification time of models to show how the erroneous human behavior generation process scales. We demonstrate the method with a case study: the operation of a radiation therapy machine. A potential problem resulting from a generated erroneous human action is discovered. A design intervention is presented which prevents this problem from occurring. We discuss how our method could be used to evaluate larger applications and recommend future paths of development.},

abstract = {This paper presents the interaction design of, and demonstration of technical feasibility for, intelligent tutoring systems that can accept handwriting input from students. Handwriting and pen input offer several affordances for students that traditional typing-based interactions do not. To illustrate these affordances, we present evidence, from tutoring mathematics, that the ability to enter problem solutions via pen input enables students to record algebraic equations more quickly, more smoothly (fewer errors), and with increased transfer to non-computer-based tasks. Furthermore our evidence shows that students tend to like pen input for these types of problems more than typing. However, a clear downside to introducing handwriting input into intelligent tutors is that the recognition of such input is not reliable. In our work, we have found that handwriting input is more likely to be useful and reliable when context is considered, for example, the context of the problem being solved. We present an intelligent tutoring system for algebra equation solving via pen-based input that is able to use context to decrease recognition errors by 18% and to reduce recognition error recovery interactions to occur on one out of every four problems. We applied user-centered design principles to reduce the negative impact of recognition errors in the following ways: (1) though students handwrite their problem-solving process, they type their final answer to reduce ambiguity for tutoring purposes, and (2) in the small number of cases in which the system must involve the student in recognition error recovery, the interaction focuses on identifying the student's problem-solving error to keep the emphasis on tutoring. Many potential recognition errors can thus be ignored and distracting interactions are avoided. This work can inform the design of future systems for students using pen and sketch input for math or other topics by motivating the use of context and pragmatics to decrease the impact of recognition errors and put user focus on the task at hand.},

We investigated the utility of multi-touch interaction in the safety critical domain of maritime dynamic positioning (DP) vessels. We conducted initial paper prototyping with domain experts to gain an insight into natural gestures; we then conducted observational studies aboard a DP vessel during operational duties and two rounds of formal evaluation of prototypes-the second on a motion platform ship simulator. Despite following a careful user-centred design process, the final results show that traditional touch-screen button and menu interaction was quicker and less erroneous than gestures. Furthermore, the moving environment accentuated this difference and we observed initial use problems and handedness asymmetries on some multi-touch gestures. On the positive side, our results showed that users were able to suspend gestural interaction more naturally, thus improving situational awareness.},

We explored three types of manual selection gestures: squeeze, breach and trigger. The fastest and most preferred technique was the trigger gesture in the single point experiment and the unimanual breach gesture in the multi-finger pointing study. The laser pointer obtained mixed results: it is fast, but inaccurate in single point, and it obtained the lowest ranking and performance in the multipoint experiment.

As networking infrastructures mature, it is increasingly feasible and affordable to consider closer integration and use of these heterogeneous devices in tandem. However, little is known about how best to design or evaluate such 'device ecologies'; in particular, how best to combine devices to achieve a desired type of collaborative user experience. A central concern is how users switch their attention between devices, to utilize the various elements to best effect. We describe here the development of an ecology of devices for groups of students to use when engaged in collaborative inquiry-learning activities. This included a multi-touch tabletop, laptops, projections, video streams and telephone. In situ studies of students and tutors using it in three different settings showed how individuals and groups switched their foci between the multiple devices. We present our findings, using a novel method for analysing users' transitions between foci, identifying patterns and emergent characteristics. We then discuss the importance of designing for transitions that enable groups to appropriately utilise an ecology of devices, using the concepts of seams, bridges, niches and focal character.},

abstract = {Multi-touch, which has been heralded as a revolution in human-computer interaction, provides features such as gestural interaction, tangible interfaces, pen-based computing, and interface customization-features embraced by an increasingly tech-savvy public. However, multi-touch platforms have not been adopted as ''everyday'' computer interaction devices that support important text entry intensive applications such as word processing and spreadsheets. In this paper, we present two studies that begin to explore user performance and experience with entering text using a multi-touch input. The first study establishes a benchmark for text entry performance on a multi-touch platform across input modes that compare uppercase-only to mixed-case, single-touch to multi-touch and copy to memorization tasks. The second study includes mouse style interaction for formatting rich text to simulate a word processing task using multi-touch input. As expected, our results show that users do not perform as well in terms of text entry efficiency and speed using a multi-touch interface as with a traditional keyboard. Not as expected was the result that degradation in performance was significantly less for memorization versus copy tasks, and consequently willingness to use multi-touch was substantially higher (50% versus 26%) in the former case. Our results, which include preferred input styles of participants, also provide a baseline for further research to explore techniques for improving text entry performance on multi-touch systems.},

While a number of gestural vocabularies have been proposed, these are generally restricted to one or two fingers or can be difficult to learn. We introduce Finger-Count gestures, a coherent set of multi-finger and two-handed gestures. Finger-Count gestures are simple, robust, expressive and fast to perform. In order to make these gestures self-revealing and easy to learn, we propose the Finger-Count menu, a menu technique and teaching method for implicitly learning Finger-Count gestures. We discuss the properties, advantages and limitations of Finger-Count interaction from the gesture and menu technique perspectives as well as its integration into three applications. We present alternative designs to increase the number of commands and to enable multi-user scenarios. Following a study which shows that Finger-Count is as easy to learn as radial menus, we report the results of an evaluation investigating which gestures are easier to learn and which finger chords people prefer. Finally, we present Finger-Count for in-the-air gestures. Thereby, the same gesture set can be used from a distance as well as when touching the surface.},

In order to gain a deeper understanding of the design of multi-touch user interfaces, this paper presents semiotic analysis of multi-touch applications as an interesting approach to gain deeper understanding of the way users use and understand multi-touch interfaces. In a case study example, user tests of a multi-touch tabletop application platform called MuTable are analysed with the Communicability Evaluation Method to evaluate to what extent users understand the intended messages (e.g., cues about interaction and functionality) the MuTable platform communicates. The semiotic analysis of this case study shows that although multi-touch interfaces can facilitate user exploration, the lack of well-known standards in multi-touch interface design and in the use of gestures makes the user interface difficult to use and interpret. This conclusion points to the importance of the elusive balance between letting users explore multi-touch systems on their own on one hand, and guiding users, explaining how to use and interpret the user interface, on the other.},

Although emerging large (e.g., ~10m wide), high-resolution displays provide great potential for visualizing dense, complex datasets, their utility is often limited by a fundamental interaction problem - the need to interact with data from multiple positions around a large room. Our solution is a selection and querying interface that combines a hand-held multi-touch device with 6 degree-of-freedom tracking in the physical space that surrounds the large display. The interface leverages context from both the user's physical position in the room and the current data being visualized in order to interpret multi-touch gestures. It also utilizes progressive refinement, favoring several quick approximate gestures as opposed to a single complex input in order to most effectively map the small mobile multi-touch input space to the large display wall. The approach is evaluated through two interdisciplinary visualization applications: a multi-variate data visualization for social scientists, and a visual database querying tool for biochemistry. The interface was effective in both scenarios, leading to new domain-specific insights and suggesting valuable guidance for future developers.},

abstract = {This paper presents an assessment of automatically generated multimodal referring expressions as produced by embodied conversational agents in a virtual world. The algorithm used for this purpose employs general principles of human motor control and cooperativity in dialogues that can be parameterised so as to vary the precision of the pointing gestures and the amount of linguistic information included in the referring expressions. The study assessed how native speakers of English and Japanese perceived three different algorithmic outputs for multimodal referring behaviour in terms of understandability, human-likeness and a social practice (selling). Results show that users generally prefer mobile agents that are economical in their linguistic descriptions to stationary verbose agents. They also show the need for further calibration of the algorithm to accommodate the differences between the two groups. In addition to the detailed description of the set up and results of the study, the paper discusses implications for the design and use of agents, methodological issues that arose while conducting the cross-cultural study and directions for future work.},

abstract = {The feeling of presence in a virtual reality (VR) is a concept without a standardized objective measurement. In the present study, we used event-related brain potentials (ERP) of the electroencephalogram (EEG) elicited by tones, which are not related to VR, as an objective indicator for the presence experience within a virtual environment. Forty participants navigated through a virtual city and rated their sensation of being in the VR (experience of presence), while hearing frequent standard tones and infrequent deviant tones, which were irrelevant for the VR task. Different ERP components elicited by the tones were compared between participants experiencing a high level of presence and participants with a low feeling of presence in the virtual city. Early ERP components, which are more linked to automatic stimulus processing, showed no correlation with presence experience. In contrast, an increased presence experience was associated with decreased late negative slow wave amplitudes, which are associated with central stimulus processing and allocation of attentional resources. This result supports the assumption that increased presence is associated with a strong allocation of attentional resources to the VR, which leads to a decrease of attentional resources available for processing VR-irrelevant stimuli. Hence, ERP components elicited by the tones are reduced. Particularly, frontal negative slow waves turned out to be accurate predictors for presence experience. Summarizing, late ERPs elicited by VR-irrelevant tones differ as a function of presence experience in VR and provide a valuable method for measuring presence in VR.},

In an experiment, the preconditions of flow experience - but not flow experience proper - mediated the effects of artefact complexity, task complexity and intrinsic motivation (as a situation-specific trait) on both flow and task outcome. However, preconditions did not predict overall artefact evaluation. Within a staged model of flow experience, the broader implications of this work for human-computer interaction are explored.},

abstract = {Durations are often used to judge the status of an invisible process. However, the apparent duration of an interval depends on the actual duration and on other variables, such as the workload during the interval and the person's expectations. An experiment dealt with the use of durations as an information source on the state of an invisible process and the effects of expectations and workload on decisions regarding the process. Eighty-nine participants observed a computerized simulation of a process which could be either intact or faulty, with intact processes ending on average sooner than faulty ones, and they had to indicate whether or not the process is intact and to estimate its duration. A binary cue with either intermediate or no validity indicated whether the process was supposedly intact or not, generating expectations about the duration of the process. Perceived durations and the decisions about the intactness of a process depended on the actual process duration, as well as on the expectations generated by the binary cue. In addition, task workload affected time estimates, but it had no effect on participants' tendency to adhere to cue recommendations or their ability to distinguish between intact and faulty processes. Results show that users' duration-based decisions about the status of a computerized process are affected by internal and external cues. While users can use durations as an information source, they should, whenever possible, be accompanied by additional indicators, lowering the inherent uncertainty in the duration estimation process.},

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive taxonomy of icons that is intended to enable the generalization of the findings of recognition studies. To accomplish this, we analyzed a sample of more than eight hundred icons according to three axes: lexical category, semantic category, and representation strategy. Three basic representation strategies were identified: visual similarity; semantic association; and arbitrary convention. These representation strategies are in agreement with the strategies identified in previous taxonomies. However, a greater number of subcategories of these strategies were identified. Our results also indicate that the lexical and semantic attributes of a concept influence the choice of representation strategy.},

In the present study, we tested whether participants who respond relatively quickly when making predictions about an entity are more or less likely to distinguish between human and nonhuman agents on the dimension of intentionality. Participants responded to a series of five scenarios in which they chose between intentional and nonintentional actions for a human, a computer, and a robot. Results indicated that participants who chose quickly were more likely to distinguish human and nonhuman agents than participants who deliberated more over their responses. We suggest that the short-response time participants were employing a first-line default to distinguish between human intentionality and more mechanical nonhuman behavior, and that the slower, more deliberative participants engaged in deeper second-line reasoning that led them to change their predictions for the behavior of a human agent.},

abstract = {Adaptive digital educational games (DEGs) providing players with relevant interventions can enhance gameplay experience. This advance in game design, however, renders the user experience (UX) evaluation of DEGs even more challenging. To tackle this challenge, we developed a four-dimension evaluation framework (i.e., gaming experience, learning experience, adaptivity, and usability) and applied it to an empirical study with a DEG on teaching geography. Mixed-method approaches were adopted to collect data with 16 boys aged 10-11. Specifically, a so-called Dyadic User Experience Tests (DUxT) was employed; participants were paired up to assume different roles during gameplay. Learning efficacy was evaluated with a pre-post intervention measurement using a domain-specific questionnaire. Learning experience, gaming experiences and usability were evaluated with intensive in situ observations and interviews guided by a multidimensional scheme; content analysis of these transcribed audio data was supplemented by video analysis. Effectiveness of adaptivity algorithms was planned to be evaluated with automatic logfiles, which, unfortunately, could not be realised due to some technical problem. Nonetheless, the user-based data could offer some insights into this issue. Furthermore, we attempted to bridge the existing gap in UX research - the lack of theoretical frameworks in understanding user experience - by adopting Engestrom's (1987) extended framework of Activity Theory (AT) that provides contextual information essential for understanding contradictions and breakdowns observed in the interactions between the game players. The dyadic gameplay setting allows us to explore the issue of group UX. Implications for further applications of the AT framework in the UX research, especially the interplay between evaluation and redesign (i.e., downstream utility of UX evaluation methods), are discussed.},

abstract = {Virtual learning system (VLS) is an information system that facilitates e-learning have been widely implemented by higher education institutions to support face-to-face teaching and self-managed learning in the virtual learning and education environment (VLE). This is referred to a blended learning instruction. By adopting the VLS, students are expected to enhance learning by getting access to course-related information and having full opportunities to interact with instructors and peers. However, there are mixed findings revealed in the literature with respect to the learning outcomes in adopting VLS. In this study, we argue that the link between the precedents of leading students to continue to use VLSs and their impacts on learning effectiveness and productivity are overlooked in the literature. This paper aims to tackle this question by integrating information system (IS) continuance theory with task-technology fit (TTF) to extend our understandings of the precedents of the intention to continue VLS and their impacts on learning. By doing it, factors of technology-acceptance-to-performance, based on TAM (technology acceptance model) and TTF and post-technology-acceptance, based on expectation-confirmation theory, models can be included to test in one study. The results reveal that perceived fit and satisfaction are important precedents of the intention to continue VLS and individual performance. Later, a discussion and conclusions are provided. This study sheds light on learning system design as assisted by IS in VLE and can serve as a basis for promoting VLS in assisting learning.},

The first is an ecological study of Second Life used in an undergraduate class, by observation, interviews, and limit surveys. Use of Second Life motivated students with good user experience, although they viewed it as a games technology. Second Life was used to prepare virtual meetings and presentations but not for online discussion, with Blackboard and especially Facebook providing collaborative support. In the second experimental study, the effectiveness and user experience with Second Life and Blackboard were compared, including a face-to-face control condition. There were no performance differences overall, although face-to-face was quicker and was preferred by users, followed by Blackboard and Second Life. Blackboard was perceived to be more usable, whereas Second Life provided a better user experience. Worst performance was indicated by dislike of avatar interaction in Second Life, and poor user experience in Blackboard, whereas better performance was associated with engagement with avatars, and better usability in Blackboard. The results of both studies are reviewed using Salmon's model for online learning, suggesting that Second Life helped motivation and socialisation stages, although integration with other technologies is necessary for knowledge construction. Preliminary guidelines are proposed for configuration and management of Second Life in collaborative learning. The affordances for collaboration in virtual worlds are discussed, with reflections on user experience and functional support provided by Second Life, as an exemplar of a virtual world for collaborative learning support.},

However, in these kinds of open systems, the agents do not necessarily use the same, or even similar, trust models, leading to semantic differences between trust evaluations in the different agents. Hence, to successfully use communicated trust evaluations, the agents need to align their trust models. We explicate that currently proposed solutions, such as common ontologies or ontology alignment methods, lead to additional problems and propose a novel approach. We show how the trust alignment can be formed by considering the interactions that agents share and describe a mathematical framework to formulate precisely how the interactions support trust evaluations for both agents. We show how this framework can be used in the alignment process and explain how an alignment should be learned. Finally, we demonstrate this alignment process in practice, using a first-order regression algorithm, to learn an alignment and test it in an example scenario.},

Both experiments showed an advantage in overall performance for semantically structured two-dimensional (2D) spatialized layouts, such as multidimensional scaling (MDS), over structured and non-structured list displays. The second experiment also demonstrated that this advantage is not simply due to the 2D nature of the display, but the combination of 2D display and the semantic structure underpinning it. Without this structure, performance fell to that of a Random List of documents. The effect of document type in this study and in Butavicius and Lee's (2007) study on visualizations of news articles may be partly described by a change in bias on a speed-accuracy trade-off. At one extreme, users were accurate but slow in answering questions based on the dialog texts while, at the other extreme, users were fast but relatively inaccurate when responding to queries about emails. Similarly, users could respond accurately using the non-structured list interface; however, this was at the cost of very long response times and was associated with a technique whereby participants navigated by clicking on neighboring document representations. Implications of these findings for real-world applications are discussed.},

abstract = {Over 25 years ago Woods (1984) introduced the concept of visual momentum: the extent to which an interface supports a practitioner in transitioning between various information-seeking activities that are required for understanding and exploring work domains. Increasing visual momentum requires the consideration of a range of ''cognitive couplings'' that span all levels of the interface: between multiple screens, within individual screens, and within a display on a screen. Although the concept has been well received, we believe that its potential to improve the quality of human computer interaction may be under-appreciated. Our purpose in this review is to provide a better understanding of visual momentum: to provide concrete and diverse examples of its successful application, to review empirical findings, to refine and expand the original design techniques that were proposed, and to integrate diverse terms that appear across different research communities.},

abstract = {We developed an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that aims to promote engagement and learning by dynamically detecting and responding to students' boredom and disengagement. The tutor uses a commercial eye tracker to monitor a student's gaze patterns and identify when the student is bored, disengaged, or is zoning out. The tutor then attempts to reengage the student with dialog moves that direct the student to reorient his or her attentional patterns towards the animated pedagogical agent embodying the tutor. We evaluated the efficacy of the gaze-reactive tutor in promoting learning, motivation, and engagement in a controlled experiment where 48 students were tutored on four biology topics with both gaze-reactive and non-gaze-reactive (control condition) versions of the tutor. The results indicated that: (a) gaze-sensitive dialogs were successful in dynamically reorienting students' attentional patterns to the important areas of the interface, (b) gaze-reactivity was effective in promoting learning gains for questions that required deep reasoning, (c) gaze-reactivity had minimal impact on students' state motivation and on self-reported engagement, and (d) individual differences in scholastic aptitude moderated the impact of gaze-reactivity on overall learning gains. We discuss the implications of our findings, limitations, future work, and consider the possibility of using gaze-reactive ITSs in classrooms.},

Results indicated that polychrons switched between two tasks more than monochrons and achieved better performance when the tasks were equally important and difficult. When the priority between the tasks was different, monochrons changed their emphasis to the more important task even though polychrons did not change their strategy as dramatically as the monochrons. In addition, monochrons indicated significantly higher workload and difficulty than polychrons.

abstract = {As it evolves, the World Wide Web (the Web) increasingly reveals the potential to enhance new aspects of our daily lives. While some take full advantage of the Web's diverse and cutting edge offerings, others choose to limit the extent of their utilization to a small subset of the Web's available functions. Recognizing this variation, a growing body of research investigates the drivers of usage behavior on the Web. Individual differences, namely broad personality and IT-specific traits, are highlighted within this stream as important predictors of Web use. Although substantial progress has been made, an important issue still facing trait research in this area is the absence of a theory-grounded basis for inter-relating broad personality and IT-specific traits. As a result, the accumulation of extant trait research is characterized by a disjointed assortment of trait constructs lacking clear theoretical linkages with one another. Additionally, while numerous studies have investigated isolated Web usage behaviors, an important outcome that remains under-investigated is the extent of an individual's utilization of the Web overall. Addressing these issues, the current study leverages the hierarchical view of traits to develop a theory-grounded, integrative model of broad personality and IT-specific traits. After developing the hierarchical model, the integrated network of traits is positioned as a direct antecedent of Web utilization and empirically tested via a two-stage field survey of 230 Web users. The results corroborate most of the hypotheses, providing support for the hierarchical view and extending the knowledge base on Web-user behavior. Overall, this study unifies disjointed personality and IT-specific trait constructs and offers theoretical guidance for future studies, introducing a much-needed ground for cumulative tradition within this stream.},

abstract = {As the popularity of online shopping grows, concerns about identity theft and fraud are increasing. While stronger customer authentication procedures may provide greater protection and thus benefit customers and retailers, security is often traded off against convenience. To provide insight into this security-convenience trade-off in customer authentication, we experimentally investigated how levels of authentication security and financial risk factors affect perception and evaluation of authentication systems in two contexts: security questions (Experiment 1) and card security codes (Experiment 2). Experiment 1, which examined the effects of security level and product price as a financial risk factor, showed that authentication procedures based on higher-level security tended to be perceived as significantly less convenient and more frustrating. Interestingly, participants rated the higher-level security system (i.e., asking more demanding challenge questions) as less convenient and more frustrating when the amount involved in the transactions was higher. Experiment 2, which introduced consumer liability for fraudulent activities as an additional financial risk factor, showed that participants gave more positive ratings of the higher-level security system under full liability than under zero liability. Taken together, the present research suggests that patterns of security-convenience trade-offs reflecting consumers' perception and appreciation of authentication technologies may vary depending on the characteristics of financial risk factors involved in the transaction process.},

Furthermore, the paper discusses the results of a user study aimed at empirically investigating how velocity-oriented approaches perform in target acquisition and in trajectory-based interaction tasks, considering both laser-style and image-plane pointing modalities. The experiments, carried out in a low precision scenario in which a Wiimote was used both as a wand and a tracking system, show that Smoothed Pointing allows a significant decrease in the error rate and achieves the highest values of throughput in trajectory-based tasks.

Results showed that task performance was significantly faster in the audio, haptic and visual feedback condition compared to the haptic and visual feedback condition. One special focus was also to study how participants utilize the auditory and haptic force feedback in order to obtain a common understanding of the workspace and to maintain an awareness of the group members' actions.

However, the creation of virtual humans with the ability to understand and respond to natural language requires costly engineering by conversation knowledge engineers (generally computer scientists), and incurs logistical cost for acquiring domain knowledge from domain experts (educators). We address these problems using a novel crowdsourcing method entitled Human-centered Distributed Conversational Modeling. This method facilitates collaborative development of virtual humans by two groups of end-users: domain experts (educators) and domain novices (students). We implemented this method in a web-based authoring tool called Virtual People Factory. Using Virtual People Factory, medical and pharmacy educators are now creating natural language virtual patient interactions on their own. This article presents the theoretical background for Human-centered Distributed Conversational Modeling, the implementation of the Virtual People Factory authoring tool, and five case studies showing that Human-centered Distributed Conversational Modeling has addressed the logistical cost for acquiring knowledge.},

abstract = {A large body of HCI research focuses on devices and techniques to interact with applications in more natural ways, such as gestures or direct pointing with fingers or hands. In particular, recent years have seen a growing interest in laser pointer-style (LPS) interaction, which allows users to point directly at the screen from a distance through a device handled like a common laser pointer. Several LPS techniques have been evaluated in the literature, usually focusing on users' performance and subjective ratings, but not on the effects of these techniques on the musculoskeletal system. One cannot rule out that ''natural'' interaction techniques, although found attractive by users, require movements that might increase likelihood of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) with respect to traditional keyboard and mouse. Our study investigates the physiological effects of a LPS interaction technique (based on the Wii Remote) compared to a mouse and keyboard setup, used in a sitting and a standing posture. The task (object arrangement) is representative of user actions repeatedly carried out with 3D applications. The obtained results show that the LPS interaction caused more muscle exertion than mouse and keyboard. Posture played also a significant role. The results highlight the importance of extending current studies of novel interaction techniques with thorough electromyographic (EMG) analyses.},

abstract = {Touch-based interaction with computing devices is becoming more and more common. In order to design for this setting, it is critical to understand the basic human factors of touch interactions such as tapping and dragging; however, there is relatively little empirical research in this area, particularly for touch-based dragging. To provide foundational knowledge in this area, and to help designers understand the human factors of touch-based interactions, we conducted an experiment using three input devices (the finger, a stylus, and a mouse as a performance baseline) and three different pointing activities. The pointing activities were bidirectional tapping, one-dimensional dragging, and radial dragging (pointing to items arranged in a circle around the cursor). Tapping activities represent the elemental target selection method and are analysed as a performance baseline. Dragging is also a basic interaction method and understanding its performance is important for touch-based interfaces because it involves relatively high contact friction. Radial dragging is also important for touch-based systems as this technique is claimed to be well suited to direct input yet radial selections normally involve the relatively unstudied dragging action, and there have been few studies of the interaction mechanics of radial dragging. Performance models of tap, drag, and radial dragging are analysed. For tapping tasks, we confirm prior results showing finger pointing to be faster than the stylus/mouse but inaccurate, particularly with small targets. In dragging tasks, we also confirm that finger input is slower than the mouse and stylus, probably due to the relatively high surface friction. Dragging errors were low in all conditions. As expected, performance conformed to Fitts' Law. Our results for radial dragging are new, showing that errors, task time and movement distance are all linearly correlated with number of items available. We demonstrate that this performance is modelled by the Steering Law (where the tunnel width increases with movement distance) rather than Fitts' Law. Other radial dragging results showed that the stylus is fastest, followed by the mouse and finger, but that the stylus has the highest error rate of the three devices. Finger selections in the North-West direction were particularly slow and error prone, possibly due to a tendency for the finger to stick-slip when dragging in that direction.},

To those who are accessing pages through non-visual means, such as screen readers, the challenges offered by these tasks are not easily overcome, even when pages are unchanging documents. The advent of 'Web 2.0' and Web applications, however, means that documents often are not static, but update, either automatically or due to user interaction. This development poses a difficult question for screen reader designers: how should users be notified of page changes? In this article we introduce rules for presenting such updates, derived from studies of how sighted users interact with them. An implementation of the rules has been evaluated, showing that users who were blind or visually impaired found updates easier to deal with than the relatively quiet way in which current screen readers often present them.},

abstract = {There has been a lot of interest in ethnography within human-computer interaction over the last two decades, and its relevance within systems development is today beyond question. However, one of the challenges reported is that ethnography generates findings and knowledge with such contextual richness that it can be hard to transfer into system design. In the light of recent years' push for the use of ethnography within the area of mobile human-computer interaction, this challenge has resurfaced and is of renewed importance to the research field. In this article we describe an interdisciplinary combination of ethnography with a structured software engineering method supporting the transition from collected data to design and implementation. We explore this combination through two case studies of mobile system development for supporting distributed work activities within industrial process control. We show that when developing mobile systems ethnographic data is a highly valuable source of input for developing object-oriented models by providing contextual richness, and that in turn, objected-oriented analysis is a highly valuable method for working with ethnographic field data in systems development by supporting the creation of abstract models. Combining the two, we have a method where ethnographic field studies inform core system design.},

The model is tested with a controlled experiment using a custom-developed application. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control condition, where they had to perform tasks in sequence, or an experimental condition, where they could discretionarily switch tasks by clicking on tabs. Our results show an inverted-U pattern for performance efficiency (productivity) and a decreasing line for performance effectiveness (accuracy). The results of this study indicate that the nature of the relation between multitasking and performance depends upon the metric used. If performance is measured with productivity, different multitasking levels are associated with an inverted-U curve where medium multitaskers perform significantly better than both high and low multitaskers. However, if performance is measured with accuracy of results, the relation is a downward slopping line, in which increased levels of multitasking lead to a significant loss in accuracy. Metaphorically speaking, juggling multiple tasks is much more difficult while balancing on a high wire, where performance mishaps can have serious consequences.},

Ten pairs of individually matched children (one typically developing and one child on the autistic spectrum) aged between seven and nine created reality and fantasy based stories using Bubble Dialogue software. The study provided a brief starting point for the stories, relying on the imaginative capabilities of the children to develop the stories beyond the story opening. The study contributes to the literature as an alternative to paper based studies of imagination given the known appeal of technology to most children, particularly children on the autistic spectrum (Gal et al., 2005). This study found that the children with autism were as able as the typically developing children to engage with the task, although qualitative differences in their responses were recorded.},

Due to the voluminous and complex nature of the data, path planning in such demanding environments requires the use of automated planners. In order to better understand how to support human operators in the task of path planning with computer aids, an experiment was conducted with a prototype path planner under various conditions to assess the effect on operator performance. Participants were asked to create and optimize paths based on increasingly complex path cost functions, using different map visualizations including a novel visualization based on a numerical potential field algorithm. They also planned paths under degraded automation conditions. Participants exhibited two types of analysis strategies, which were global path regeneration and local sensitivity analysis. No main effect due to visualization was detected, but results indicated that the type of optimizing cost function affected performance, as measured by metabolic costs, sun position, path distance, and task time. Unexpectedly, participants were able to better optimize more complex cost functions as compared to a simple time-based cost function.},

abstract = {In modern multi-representational environments, software developers need to coordinate various information sources to effectively perform maintenance tasks. Although visual attention is an important skill in software development, our current understanding of the role of visual attention in the coordination of representations during maintenance tasks is minimal. Therefore, we applied eye-tracking to capture visual attention strategies and construct a detailed account of visual attention during debugging. Two groups of programmers with two distinct levels of experience debugged a program with the help of multiple representations. The proportion of time spent looking at each representation, the frequency of switching attention between visualrepresentations and the type of switch were investigated during consecutive phases of debugging. We found repetitive patterns in visual strategies that were associated with less expertise and lower performance. Novice developers made use of both the code and graphical representations while frequently switching between them. More experienced participants expended more efforts integrating the available information and primarily concentrated on systematically relating the code to the output. Our results informed us about the differences in program debugging strategies from a fine-grain, temporal perspective and have implications for the design of future development environments.},

Drawn from three distinct domains of human-computer interaction design and related areas, the new development of a simplicity construct and measurement scales were then validated. The final measurement model consisted of six components: reduction, organization, component complexity, coordinative complexity, dynamic complexity, and visual aesthetics. The following phase aimed at verifying the relationship between simplicity perception of the interface and evaluations of user satisfaction. The hypothesis was accepted that user satisfaction was positively affected by simplicity perception and that the relationship between the two constructs was very strong. The findings imply that a simplified interface design of the task performance, information hierarchy, and visual display attributes contributes to positive satisfaction evaluations when users interact with their smartphone as they engage in communication, information search, and entertainment activities.},

abstract = {Soft lifting refers to the process whereby a legally licensed software program is installed or copied in violation of its licensing agreement. Previous research on this pervasive kind of unethical computer use has mainly focused on the determinants of this unethical act, which are rooted in personal, economic, technological, cultural, socio-political, or legal domains. However, little is known about the symbolic power that soft lifting has on the sense of self. Based on recent advances in behavioral priming, we hypothesized that soft lifting can influence the signals one sends to oneself; more specifically, soft lifting may prime individuals to experience an inauthentic sense of self, which, in turn, prompts further unethical behavior. In Study 1, we showed that participants, primed with the memory of a recent soft lifting experience, cheated more than participants recalling a recent experience of purchasing authentic software or than control participants. Moreover, feelings of inauthenticity mediated the priming effect of soft lifting on dishonest behavior. In Study 2, participants primed with soft lifting showed a greater willingness to purchase a wide range of counterfeit products over authentic products. Besides those antecedents or correlates of soft lifting already identified in the literature, educators should pay more attention to the negative impact of soft lifting on the self-images of users, which may go beyond computer-related behaviors. Priming may provide a new direction for HCI researchers to examine the impact of computer-use-related factors on users' perceptions, motivations, and behaviors.},

We examined among 44 participants the emotional responses as measured by facial electromyography (EMG) to aesthetic background images that varied on the emotional valence (unpleasant to pleasant) and arousal (calming to exciting) dimensions and were presented both separately and as background images for news messages. Effects of image arousal on free recall of news messages were also examined. A priori pleasant compared to unpleasant images were associated with higher orbicularis oculi EMG responses, both when presented alone and when presented as news message backgrounds. Analyses based on the participants' subjective pleasantness ratings also showed greater corrugator supercilii EMG activity for unpleasant compared to pleasant images. High-arousal as compared to low-arousal images improved recall for the superimposed news messages. In contrast, recall was not affected by a priori image valence or subjective pleasantness ratings. The results demonstrate that abstract images can be used to evoke emotional responses in the viewers that persist even when unrelated messages are superimposed on them. Similarly, high-arousal images can be used to enhance memory for superimposed textual messages.},

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) focus on spatial reasoning.

This paper provides a thorough and comprehensive synthesis of the disparate literature that pertains to the subject of proximity. It offers insights into why existing methods for reasoning with proximity work, or do not work, and analyses their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, the paper provides the derivation of new proximity measures, and their evaluation, backed by experiments and reflections. New measures are formally described in a unifying and compelling framework. This framework acknowledges that while distance is one factor that influences proximity perception, proximity is much more than just a distance measure.},

Buyers' ratings of trust and number of purchases served as dependent variables. Significant main effects were found for reputation scores and photos on both dependent variables and there was no interaction effect. Trustworthy photos and positive reputation contributed towards buyers' trust and higher purchase rates. Surprisingly, neither untrustworthy photos nor negative reputation performed worse than missing information. On the contrary, completely missing information (no reputation, no photo) led to distrust and differed significantly from completely negative information (low reputation, untrustworthy photo), which resulted in a neutral trust level. Overall, the data suggest that not only does positive information increase trust, but mere uncertainty reduction regarding a seller can also contribute towards trust in online transactions.},

The first experiment supported the idea that learners will spend more of their time reading easier texts when reading time is more limited; the second experiment showed that readers shift preference towards harder texts when their learning goals are more demanding. These phenomena evince an impressive capability of readers. Further, the experiments reveal that the most common method of time allocation is a version of satisficing (Reader and Payne, 2007) in which preference for texts emerges without any explicit comparison of the texts (the longest time spent reading each text is on the first time that text is encountered). These experiments therefore offer further empirical confirmation for a method of time allocation that relies on monitoring on-line texts as they are read, and which is sensitive to learning goals, available time and text difficulty.},

This study analyses usability professionals' operational understanding of usability by eliciting the constructs they employ in their thinking about system use. We approach usability broadly and without a priori distinguishing it from user experience. On the basis of repertory-grid interviews with 24 Chinese, Danish, and Indian usability professionals we find that they make use of more utilitarian than experiential, i.e. user-experience related, constructs. This indicates that goal-related performance is central to their thinking about usability, whereas they have less elaborate sets of experiential constructs. The usability professionals mostly construe usability at an individual level, rather than at organizational and environmental levels. The few exceptions include effectiveness constructs, which are evenly spread across all three levels, and relational constructs, which are phrased in terms of social context. Considerations about users' cognitive activities appear more central to the usability professionals than conventional human-factors knowledge about users' sensorial abilities. The usability professionals' constructs, particularly their experiential constructs, go considerably beyond ISO 9241 usability, indicating a discrepancy between this definition of usability and the thinking of the professionals concerned with delivering usability. Finally, usability is construed rather similarly across the three nationalities of usability professionals.},

Their subjective intention to create a strong password was measured by a questionnaire, and the objective strength of the passwords they created was calculated. Results of the ANOVA and the path models derived from the path analysis indicated that people's adoption intention, such as their intention to adopt e-banking, can be enhanced by changing their perceived Knowledge, Controllability and Awareness, while changing the perceived Controllability is most effective.

abstract = {Multimodal interfaces have attracted more and more attention. Most researches focus on each interaction mode independently and then fuse information at the application level. Recently, several frameworks and models have been proposed to support the design and development of multimodal interfaces. However, it is challenging to provide automatic modality adaptation in multimodal interfaces. Existing approaches are using rule-based specifications to define the adaptation of input/output modalities. Rule-based specifications have the problems of completeness and coherence. Distinct from previous work, this paper presents a novel approach that quantifies the user preference of each modality and considers the adaptation as an optimization issue that searches for a set of input/output modalities matching user's preference. Our approach applies a cross-layer design, which considers the adaptation from the perspectives of the interaction context, available system resources, and QoS requirements. Furthermore, our approach supports human-centric adaptation. A user can report the preference of a modality so that selected modalities fit user's personal needs. An optimal solution and a heuristic algorithm have been developed to automatically select an appropriate set of modality combinations under a specific situation. We have designed a framework based on the heuristic algorithm and existing ontology, and applied the framework to conduct a utility evaluation, in which we have employed a within-subject experiment. Fifty participants were invited to go through three scenarios and compare automatically selected modalities with randomly selected modalities. The results from the experiment show that users perceived the automatically selected modalities as appropriate and satisfactory.},

An experiment was designed to elicit affective states with standardized affective pictures when multiple physiological signals were measured. Three data mining methods (i.e., decision rules, k-nearest neighbours, and decomposition tree) based on the rough set technique were then applied to construct prediction models from the extracted physiological features. We created three types of prediction models, i.e., gender-specific (male vs. female), culture-specific (Chinese vs. Indian vs. Western), and general models (participants with different genders and cultures as samples), and direct comparisons were made among these models. The best average prediction accuracies in terms of the F"1 measures (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) were 60.2%, 64.9%, 63.5% for the general models with 14, 21, and 42 samples, 78.0% for the female models, 75.1% for the male models, 72.0% for the Chinese models, 73.0% for the Indian models, and 76.5% for the Western models, respectively. These results suggested that the specific models performed better than did the general models.},

A growing number of users worldwide are utilizing this possibility. The aim of this research was to study active virtual world users' satisfaction of psychological needs both inworld and outworld. A global online survey for the users of Second Life was constructed based on a model of ten psychological needs. The results based on 258 responses indicated that self-esteem, autonomy and physical thriving were the most highly satisfied needs inworld. Furthermore, the results indicated that autonomy, physical thriving, and money-luxury were needs, which were satisfied to a significantly larger extent in the virtual world than in the users' real lives (when not using a computer). On the other hand, the needs for competence, relatedness, security, and popularity-influence were more extensively satisfied in the users' daily lives than when in Second Life. The qualitative findings highlighted relatedness needs as motivations for Second Life usage and revealed five central themes in the motivations for Second Life usage: Second Life as self-therapy, as a source of instant pleasures, as liberation from social norms, as a tool for self-expression, and as exploration and novelty. In all, the findings suggest that the use of advanced virtual worlds is driven by a variety of different psychological needs. Virtual world usage is also related to need satisfaction in the users' lives outside the virtual world.},

abstract = {Decades of research have led to notable improvements in the representations used to aid human comprehension of computer programs. Much of this research has focused on visual representations, which leaves open the question of how best to design auditory representations of computer programs. While this question has particular relevance for visually impaired programmers, sighted programmers might also benefit from enhanced auditory representations of their programs. In order to investigate this question empirically, first, we introduce artifact encoding, a novel approach to rigorously measuring the comprehensibility of auditory representations of computer programs. Using this approach as a foundation, we present an experimental study that compared the comprehensibility of two alternative auditory program representations: one with lexical scoping cues that convey the nesting level of program statements, and another without such scoping cues. The results of our first experiment validate both artifact encoding and the scoping cues we used. To see whether auditory cues validated through our paradigm can aid program comprehension in a realistic task scenario, we experimentally compared programmers' ability to debug programs using three alternative environments: (1) an auditory execution environment with our empirically derived auditory cues; (2) an auditory execution environment with the current state-of-the-art auditory cues generated by a screen reader running on top of Microsoft Visual Studio; and (3) a visual version of the execution environment. The results of our second experiment showed that our comprehensible auditory cues are significantly better than the state-of-the-art, affording human performance approaching the effectiveness of visual representations within the statistical margin of error. This research contributes a novel methodology and foundational empirical data that can guide the design of effective auditory representations of computer programs.},

abstract = {Emotion is a key aspect of user experience. To design a user interface for positive emotional experience, the affective quality of the user interface needs to be carefully considered. A major factor of affective quality in today's user interface for digital media is interactivity, in which motion feedback plays a significant role as an element. This role of motion feedback is particularly evident in touchscreen user interfaces that have been adopted rapidly in mobile devices. This paper presents two empirical studies performed to increase our understanding of motion feedback in terms of affective quality in mobile touchscreen user interfaces. In the first study, the relationships between three general motion properties and a selected set of affective qualities are examined. The results of this study provide a guideline for the design of motion feedback in existing mobile touchscreen user interfaces. The second study explores a new dimension of interactivity that is the Weight factor of Laban's Effort system. To experiment the Weight factor in a mobile touchscreen user interface, a pressure sensitive prototype was developed to recognize the amount of force applied by the user's finger action. With this prototype, the effects of implementing pressure requirements on four different types of user interfaces were examined. Results show that implementing the Weight factor can significantly influence the affective quality and complement the physical feel of a user interface. The issues to consider for effective implementation are also discussed.},

abstract = {Designing interactions with technologies that are compatible with rural wisdom and skills can help to digitally enfranchise rural people and, thus, contribute to community cohesion in the face of Africa's urbanization. Oral information has been integral to rural identity and livelihood in Africa for generations. However, the use of technology can inadvertently displace the knowledge of communities with practices that differ from the knowledge traditions in which technology is designed. We propose that devices that are sensitive to users' locations, combined with platforms for social networking and user-generated content, offer intriguing opportunities for rural communities to extend their knowledge practices digitally. In this paper we present insights on the way rural people of the Herero tribe manage information spatially and temporally during some of our design activities in Namibia. We generated these insights from ethnography and detailed analysis of interactions with media in our ongoing Ethnographic Action Research. Rural participants had not depicted their wisdom graphically by photography or video before, rarely use writing materials and some cannot read. Thus, we gathered 30h of observer-and participant-recorded video and participants' interpretations and interactions with thumbnail photos from video, photography and paper. We describe insights into verbal and bodily interactions and relationships between bodies, movements, settings, knowledge and identity. These findings have made us more sensitive to local experiences of locations and more aware of assumptions about space and time embedded in locative media. As a result, we have started to adopt an approach that emphasizes connectors rather than points and social-relational and topokinetic rather than topographic spaces. In the final section of the paper we discuss applying this approach in design by responding to the ways that participants use social relationships to orient information and use voice, gesture and movement to incorporate locations into this ''dialogic''. In conclusion we outline why we hope our reflections will inspire others to examine the spatial, temporal and social affordances of technologies within the bonds of rural, and other, communities.},

abstract = {This study aims to establish a conceptual framework on the characteristics of idioculture in crowd computing, as well as the antecedents and consequences of idioculture. Idioculture is defined as distinct cultural elements that characterize a certain group. It is important in group interaction because it can be used as a tool to seek a group's optimal distinctiveness, which is a natural human desire to maintain a balance between being too inclusive or too personalized in crowd settings. In order to provide empirical data for the conceptual framework, this study developed a crowd computing system prototype, named event-driven social media (EDSM), which supports idioculture emergence and sharing in a crowd setting. The prototype was implemented in a massive-scale event involving approximately 20,000 people. The study results were derived from content analysis on 5988 text messages from 1510 users exchanged through EDSM during the event and interviews with 15 users after the event. The findings revealed that group cultures were triggered by EDSM to become idioculture, and the idioculture shared through EDSM affected user experience. First, sources of idioculture included collective, playful, and routine-breaking group cultures. Second, the characteristics of idioculture included catchwords, humorous references, and nicknames. Third, by sharing idioculture, users of EDSM were able to experience social connectedness, group cohesion, and social enjoyment. This study ends with implications on the design of EDSM from the perspective of HCI.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF) recommender systems have emerged in various applications to support item recommendation, which solve the information-overload problem by suggesting items of interest to users. Recently, trust-based recommender systems have incorporated the trustworthiness of users into CF techniques to improve the quality of recommendation. They propose trust computation models to derive the trust values based on users' past ratings on items. A user is more trustworthy if s/he has contributed more accurate predictions than other users. Nevertheless, conventional trust-based CF methods do not address the issue of deriving the trust values based on users' various information needs on items over time. In knowledge-intensive environments, users usually have various information needs in accessing required documents over time, which forms a sequence of documents ordered according to their access time. We propose a sequence-based trust model to derive the trust values based on users' sequences of ratings on documents. The model considers two factors - time factor and document similarity - in computing the trustworthiness of users. The proposed model enhanced with the similarity of user profiles is incorporated into a standard collaborative filtering method to discover trustworthy neighbors for making predictions. The experiment result shows that the proposed model can improve the prediction accuracy of CF method in comparison with other trust-based recommender systems.},

''EMMA's World'' is a VR application in which patients can explore negative experiences to the degree required for their specific therapeutic needs. To accomplish therapeutic goals, a series of virtual elements is customized to be meaningful to the user; the elements contain the fundamental emotional components that the person must confront. Thirty-nine participants diagnosed with PTSD (N=10), PG (N=16), and AD (N=13) were randomly assigned to a standard cognitive-behavioral program (CBT) (N=20) or a CBT program driven by EMMA's World (N=19). Participants were assessed before and after treatment. Measurements related to anxiety, depression and other emotions, maladjustment and interference were applied. Results indicate that CBT with EMMA's World was as effective as the standard CBT program for the treatment of these disorders, and the statistically significant differences (depression, relaxation intensity and social area interference) were in favor of EMMA's World. We expect VR to provide a positive alternative that will draw in clients who do not seek traditional forms of treatment.},

abstract = {Emotional human-computer interactions are attracting increasing interest with the improvement in the available technology. Through presenting affective stimuli and empathic communication, computer agents are able to adjust to users' emotional states. As a result, users may produce better task performance. Existing studies have mainly focused on the effect of only a few basic emotions, such as happiness and frustration, on human performance. Furthermore, most research explored this issue from the psychological perspective. This paper presents an emotion and performance relation model in the context of vehicle driving. This general emotion-performance model is constructed on an arousal-valence plane and is not limited to basic emotions. Fifteen paid participants took part in two driving simulation experiments that induced 115 pairs of emotion-performance sample. These samples revealed the following: (1) driving performance has a downward U-shaped relationship with both intensities of arousal and valence. It deteriorates at extreme arousal and valence. (2) Optimal driving performance, corresponding to the appropriate emotional state, matches the ''sweet spot'' phenomenon of the engagement psychology. (3) Arousal and valence are not perfectly independent across the entire 2-D emotion plane. Extreme valence is likely to stimulate a high level of arousal, which, in turn, deteriorates task performance. The emotion-performance relation model proposed in the paper is useful in designing emotion-aware intelligent systems to predict and prevent task performance degradation at an early stage and throughout the human-computer interactions.},

abstract = {Introduction: All hospitals in the province of Styria (Austria) are well equipped with sophisticated Information Technology, which provides all-encompassing on-screen patient information. Previous research made on the theoretical properties, advantages and disadvantages, of reading from paper vs. reading from a screen has resulted in the assumption that reading from a screen is slower, less accurate and more tiring. However, recent flat screen technology, especially on the basis of LCD, is of such high quality that obviously this assumption should now be challenged. As the electronic storage and presentation of information has many advantages in addition to a faster transfer and processing of the information, the usage of electronic screens in clinics should outperform the traditional hardcopy in both execution and preference ratings. This study took part in a County hospital Styria, Austria, with 111 medical professionals, working in a real-life setting. They were each asked to read original and authentic diagnosis reports, a gynecological report and an internal medical document, on both screen and paper in a randomly assigned order. Reading comprehension was measured by the Chunked Reading Test, and speed and accuracy of reading performance was quantified. In order to get a full understanding of the clinicians' preferences, subjective ratings were also collected. Results: Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests showed no significant differences on reading performance between paper vs. screen. However, medical professionals showed a significant (90%) preference for reading from paper. Despite the high quality and the benefits of electronic media, paper still has some qualities which cannot provided electronically do date.},

abstract = {Freehand gestural interaction, in which the user's hands move in mid-air to provide input, has been of interest to researchers, but freehand menu selection interfaces have been under-investigated so far. Freehand menu selection is inherently difficult, especially with increasing menu breadth (i.e., the number of items), largely because moving hands in free space cannot achieve precision as high as physical input devices such as mouse and stylus. We have designed a novel menu selection interface called the rapMenu (Ni et al., 2008), which is controlled by wrist tilt and multiple pinch gestures, and takes advantage of the multiple discrete gesture inputs to reduce the required precision of the user hand movements. In this article, we first review the visual design and behavior of the rapMenu technique, as well as related design issues and its potential advantages. In the second part, we present two studies of the rapMenu in order to further investigate the strengths and limitations of the design principle. In the first study, we compared the rapMenu to the extensively studied tilt menu technique (Rahman et al., 2009). Our results revealed that the rapMenu outperforms the tilt menu as menu breadth increases. In the second study, we investigated how the rapMenu affords the opportunity of eyes-free selection and users' transition from novice to expert. We found that within 10min of practice, eyes-free selection with rapMenu has competitive speed and accuracy with the visual rapMenu and the tilt menu. Finally, we discuss design variations that use other axes of wrist movement and adopt alternative auditory feedback.},

However, there have been few recent evaluation studies of User Evaluation Methods (UEMs), especially those with the aim of improving methods rather than assessing their efficacy (i.e. formative rather than summative evaluations). In this article, we present formative evaluations of two new methods for assessing the functionality and usability of a particular type of interactive system-electronic information resources. These serve as an example of an evaluation approach for assessing the success of new HCI methods. We taught the methods to a group of electronic resource developers and collected a mixture of focus group, method usage and summary questionnaire data-all focusing on how useful, usable and learnable the developers perceived the methods to be and how likely they were to use them in the future. Findings related to both methods were generally positive, and useful suggestions for improvement were made. Our evaluation sessions also highlighted a number of trade-offs for the development of UEMs and general lessons learned, which we discuss in order to inform the future development and evaluation of HCI methods.},

abstract = {Centuries ago, the existence of life was explained by the presence of a soul (Tylor, 1871). Known as animism, this term was re-defined in the 1970s by Piaget as young children's beliefs that inanimate objects are capable of actions and have life-like qualities. With the development of robots in the 21st century, researchers have begun examining whether animism is apparent in children's impressions of robots. The purpose of this study was to use a model of knowledge structures, or schemata, to examine whether children attribute human qualities of cognition, affect, and behavior to a robot. An experiment was set up at a science center located in a major Western Canadian city, and visitors to the center were invited to participate. A total of 198 children ages 5-16 years (M=8.18 years) with an approximate even number of boys and girls were included. Children completed a semi-structured interview after observing a robot, a small 5 degree of freedom robot arm, perform a block stacking task. Answers to the nine questions about the robot were scored according to whether they referenced humanistic qualities. Results from frequency and content analyses suggest that a significant proportion of children ascribe cognitive, behavioral, and especially affective, characteristics to robots.},

abstract = {Patients with locked-in syndrome are perceptually and cognitively aware of their environment but are unable to speak and have very limited motor capabilities. These patients frequently use a virtual keyboard with a cursor that moves over different items. The user triggers a selector when the cursor is over the desired item. For text entry such a method is excruciatingly slow, but is critical for patients who otherwise cannot communicate. We show how such keyboards can be optimally designed to maximize text entry speed while simultaneously controlling the entry error rate. The described method quantifies how different factors in keyboard design influence both entry speed and accuracy and demonstrates that different keyboard designs can greatly alter the efficiency of keyboard use. For a given text corpus and allowable average entry error proportion, the method identifies the cursor duration and character layout that minimizes average entry time. The method can easily be adapted to a variety of keyboard designs and selection devices and thereby improve the communication of locked-in syndrome patients.},

First, give an overview of the development road to multi-modal communication with computers. Then we motivate our research with a hybrid system, we introduce the architecture of Turk-2, we describe the human experiments and its evaluation. The results justify that multi-modal interaction makes game playing more engaging, enjoyable - and even more effective.

abstract = {Phobia towards small animals has been treated using exposure in vivo and virtual reality. Recently, augmented reality (AR) has also been presented as a suitable tool. The first AR system developed for this purpose used visible markers for tracking. In this first system, the presence of visible markers warns the user of the appearance of animals. To avoid this warning, this paper presents a second version in which the markers are invisible. First, the technical characteristics of a prototype are described. Second, a comparative study of the sense of presence and anxiety in a non-phobic population using the visible marker-tracking system and the invisible marker-tracking system is presented. Twenty-four participants used the two systems. The participants were asked to rate their anxiety level (from 0 to 10) at 8 different moments. Immediately after their experience, the participants were given the SUS questionnaire to assess their subjective sense of presence. The results indicate that the invisible marker-tracking system induces a similar or higher sense of presence than the visible marker-tracking system, and it also provokes a similar or higher level of anxiety in important steps for therapy. Moreover, 83.33% of the participants reported that they did not have the same sensations/surprise using the two systems, and they scored the advantage of using the invisible marker-tracking system (IMARS) at 5.19+/-2.25 (on a scale from 1 to 10). However, if only the group with higher fear levels is considered, 100% of the participants reported that they did not have the same sensations/surprise with the two systems, scoring the advantage of using IMARS at 6.38+/-1.60 (on a scale from 1 to 10).},

abstract = {Sensing technologies such as inertia tracking and computer vision enable spatial interactions where users make selections by 'air pointing': moving a limb, finger, or device to a specific spatial region. In addition of expanding the vocabulary of possible interactions available, air pointing brings the potential benefit of enabling 'eyes-free' interactions, where users rely on proprioception and kinaesthesia rather than vision. This paper explores the design space for air pointing interactions, and presents tangible results in the form of a framework that helps designers understand input dimensions and resulting interaction qualities. The framework provides a set of fundamental concepts that aid in thinking about the air pointing domain, in characterizing and comparing existing solutions, and in evaluating novel techniques. We carry out an initial investigation to demonstrate the concepts of the framework by designing and comparing three air pointing techniques: one based on small angular 'raycasting' movements, one on large movements across a 2D plane, and one on movements in a 3D volume. Results show that large movements on the 2D plane are both rapid (selection times under 1s) and accurate, even without visual feedback. Raycasting is rapid but inaccurate, and the 3D volume is expressive but slow, inaccurate, and effortful. Many other findings emerge, such as selection point 'drift' in the absence of feedback. These results and the organising framework provide a foundation for innovation and understanding of air pointing interaction.},

An iterative psychometric process was used where responses to three versions of the CPQ were gathered from three independent user samples. Factor analysis and item analysis were used to produce the final thirty-item instrument. The original five-factor model was reduced to three factors, namely, Efficiency, Helpfulness, and Transparency. Cronbach's alpha for the Global scale and the three subscales are all above 0.90.

We found that polices come in many forms-documented in service-level agreements and best-practice guidelines, given by management directives, applied by system administrators through formal processes, and built into tools such as configuration management applications. We found that although policies sometimes make explicit statements and establish formal processes, much is left implicit, by design or omission, with appropriate interpretation and execution dependent on human judgment. We argue that people must play an active role in the application of policies to system management because complex situational demands require it, and we discuss some issues in the design of tools that incorporate policies in supporting computer system management.},

abstract = {Multi-user virtual reality systems enable natural collaboration in shared virtual worlds. Users can talk to each other, gesture and point into the virtual scenery as if it were real. As in reality, referring to objects by pointing results often in a situation whereon objects are occluded from the other users' viewpoints. While in reality this problem can only be solved by adapting the viewing position, specialized individual views of the shared virtual scene enable various other solutions. As one such solution we propose show-through techniques to make sure that the objects one is pointing to can always be seen by others. We first study the impact of such augmented viewing techniques on the spatial understanding of the scene, the rapidity of mutual information exchange as well as the proxemic behavior of users. To this end we conducted a user study in a co-located stereoscopic multi-user setup. Our study revealed advantages for show-through techniques in terms of comfort, user acceptance and compliance to social protocols while spatial understanding and mutual information exchange is retained. Motivated by these results we further analyze whether show-through techniques may also be beneficial in distributed virtual environments. We investigated a distributed setup for two users, each participant having its own display screen and a minimalist avatar representation for each participant. In such a configuration there is a lack of mutual awareness, which hinders the understanding of each other's pointing gestures and decreases the relevance of social protocols in terms of proxemic behavior. Nevertheless, we found that show-through techniques can improve collaborative interaction tasks even in such situations.},

abstract = {In computer-mediated communication, participants often experience a loss of information that would have been conveyed by non-verbal means in a face-to-face communication. They need to compensate for this loss by being more verbose which may have a negative impact on the efficiency of communication or give rise to misunderstandings. In this paper, we present a computer system that augments the imagery perceived from the remote site with additional visual information and that can be controlled by using a Nintendo Wiimote game controller. Our prototype illustrates our approach how a system might be able to partially compensate for the information typically lost in conventional video conferencing where deictic gestures cannot be relayed properly to the remote site. Concerning user acceptance, our user tests also show that the visualization technique is crucial which is used for highlighting the objects or persons that are being pointed at. Adequate visualization techniques based on non-photorealistic rendering are proposed.},

By adopting perspectives from social psychology and interaction design, the work examines the role of reflection through the use of a non-traditional digital artefact that acts as a site for enduring attachments of personal emotional significance. To this end, we respond to previous research work on reflection through design, in the development of four Lovers' boxes whose purposes and meanings are completed through reflections both by romantic couples and their integration in everyday lives. A field study was conducted involving five couples in new relationships who were asked to exchange video messages (co-created with a digital media artist) using the Lovers' box over a period of five weeks. Our findings demonstrated: (1) that the creation, exchange and display of messages embedded in the digital artefact served as both mirrors and sources for reflection concerning couples' relationships; (2) the rich manner in which the Lovers' box became meaningful to participants, as they perceived it as keepsake or digital storybook of their meaningful experiences, experienced it as an enjoyable shared hobby with their partner and saw it as providing them a snapshot into the beloved person's mind and thoughts; and (3) how the potential for new castings of digital artefacts might support our personal and emotional lives.},

Field studies into families' use of physical and digital objects for remembering provided a rich understanding of associated user needs and human values, and suggested properties for 'digital mementos' such as being 'not like work', discoverable and fun. In a subsequent design study, artefacts were devised to express these features and develop the understanding of needs and values further via discussion with groups of potential 'users'. 'Critical artefacts' (the products of Critical Design) were used to enable participants to envisage broader possibilities for social practices and applications of technology in the context of personal remembering, and thus to engage in the design of novel devices and systems relevant to their lives. Reflection was a common theme in the work, being what the digital mementos were designed to afford and the mechanism by which the design activity progressed. Ideas for digital mementos formed the output of this research and expressed the designer's and researcher's understanding of participants' practices and needs, and the human values that underlie them and, in doing so, suggest devices and systems that go beyond usability to support a broader conception of human activity.},

abstract = {We all collect personal mementos, treasured objects that remind us about our past. We also remember significant people and places from our past. A key way that we reflect on our identity is through collecting, organizing and talking to others about such personal mementos, places and people. However, most work on mementos has focused on physical objects rather than their digital representations. And when digital archives have been examined these have been found to be underexploited. We, therefore, implemented and evaluated a new class of digital memory application, MemoryLane, that is designed on the basis of prior research into memory and reminiscence. MemoryLane allows people to capture, actively organize and reflect on digital representations of mementos relating to people, places and objects. Users can also annotate captured mementos with spoken or textual narratives. User feedback provides new information about the nature of digital reminiscing and reflection. Our 31 persons evaluation showed that people were active in organizing and reflecting on these personal digital collections. As we expected, most mementos centered around familiar home objects, although mementos relating to people tended to be regarded as most important and to evoke stronger emotions. Participants also recorded many spoken narratives about mementos, but these spoken reflections were unpopular on playback. We discuss the theoretical and design implications of our work.},

The grammar approach aims to develop a richer picture of user actions in a task accommodating aspects of the socio-organizational context. This paper reflects on user tasks as emerged from interviews with real users in supply chain industries where Forecasting Support Systems (FSS) are used to predict future product sales. In this paper, we use HTA to describe what the expert literature has identified as the stages in producing sales forecasts. In order to evaluate this against reported scenarios and observations of actual use, we apply an approach that uses a parallel to the grammar of everyday language to represent user activities. In addition to specifying the particular socio-organizational aspects of FSS use, we show how the grammar approach contributes to effective analysis of unstructured, qualitative data. The methodology we adopt also eases our attempt to understand user tasks and validate the constructed HTA model in a given context. The methodological implications and future research directions for task analysis models are discussed.},

abstract = {Ontologies - a form of structured and logically related knowledge or classification hierarchy embedded in a computer system - are regarded by many scientists as having enormous promise for the consistent use and re-use of data. To realise this promise, however, is not straightforward. In this paper, based on ethnographic observation, we argue that the challenges for ontology building are 'social' as much as they are technical. By this we mean the routine work undertaken in the building process and the problems and difficulties entailed can be understood in terms of the practices of knowledge workers and the practical nature of 'sorting things out'. Getting a better sense of how, in practise, this work gets done gives a sense of the main challenges of building successful ontologies and how this impacts on the design of tool support. In considering the practices of one group in particular, we try to show how, for members, the technical problems of determining what classification structure is appropriate, and what its boundaries might be, depend substantially on assumptions about the 'community' and its interests and purposes. This 'turn to the social' has ramifications for the understanding of ontology building and use. Specifically, 'modelling' approaches to ontology building tell us little about the practical organisation of the work and how this relates to the prospect of successful sharing. Ethnographic enquiry may reveal important issues that are otherwise missed.},

Results from factor analysis and the correction for attenuation formula revealed an adequate reliability of the single-item measure. Positive correlations with both trust and aesthetics supported the convergent validity of the single-item measure for usability.

abstract = {In recent years, an increasing number of Mixed Reality (MR) applications have been developed using agent technology - both for the underlying software and as an interface metaphor. However, no unifying field or theory currently exists that can act as a common frame of reference for these varied works. As a result, much duplication of research is evidenced in the literature. This paper seeks to fill this important gap by outlining ''for the first time'' a formal field of research that has hitherto gone unacknowledged, namely the field of Mixed Reality Agents (MiRAs), which are defined as agents embodied in a Mixed Reality environment. Based on this definition, a taxonomy is offered that classifies MiRAs along three axes: agency, based on the weak and strong notions outlined by Wooldridge and Jennings (1995); corporeal presence, which describes the degree of virtual or physical representation (body) of a MiRA; and interactive capacity, which characterises its ability to sense and act on the virtual and physical environment. Furthermore, this paper offers the first comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art of MiRA research and places each project within the proposed taxonomy. Finally, common trends and future directions for MiRA research are discussed. By defining Mixed Reality Agents as a formal field, establishing a common taxonomy, and retrospectively placing existing MiRA projects within it, future researchers can effectively position their research within this landscape, thereby avoiding duplication and fostering reuse and interoperability.},

abstract = {The law of path steering, as proposed by Accot and Zhai, describes a quantitative relationship between the human temporal performance and the path spatial characteristics. The steering law is formulated as a continuous goal-crossing task, in which a large number of goals are crossed along the path. The steering law has been verified empirically for locomotion, in which a virtual driving task through straight and circular paths was performed. We revisit the path steering law for manipulation tasks in desktop virtual environments. We have conducted controlled experiments in which users operated a pen input device to steer a virtual ball through paths of varying length, width, curvature and orientation. Our results indicate that, although the steering law provides a good description of the overall task time as a function of index of difficulty ID=L/W, where L and W are the path length and width, it does not account for other relevant factors. We specifically show that the influence of curvature can be modeled by a percentage increase in steering time, independent of index of difficulty. The path orientation relative to the viewing direction has a periodic effect on the steering time, which can be optimally described by a function of Fourier series expansions. In addition, there is also an effect of the handedness of the subjects on the steering between the left and right districts in 3D manipulation tasks.},

abstract = {Multimodal training involving both visual and auditory information was shown to improve text comprehension and reduce cognitive load. However, it is argued that in spatial tasks visual guidance can impair training effectiveness because it encourages shallow performance strategies and little exploration. Moreover, visual aids are attractive to both trainers as well as trainees, who tend to use them despite their potential disadvantages. To examine this potential training trap, two experimental studies were conducted. In Study 1, each trainer instructed trainees on how to perform a 3-D puzzle in two conditions: vocal guidance (17 trainees), where only vocal instructions were possible, and vocal guidance with mouse pointing (17 trainees), where the trainer could also use a mouse to point out positions on the trainee's screen. The results showed that while the use of the mouse pointer reduced trainees' mental load during training, it also drastically lowered performance level on a non-supervised test. In Study 2, a real-world version of puzzle was trained. A comparison of a vocal guidance group (16 trainees) to a group trained with an additional mouse pointing and drawing option (16 trainees) showed, as well, reduced performance levels with the additional visual aids. The results suggest that the abundant use of multimodal training in Augmented Reality (AR) applications should be re-evaluated.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study is to better understand the digital divide by identifying the variety of ways in which people in Europe use the Internet. First, by using cluster analysis on survey data (N=12,666/age: 16-74 years) from Eurostat on Internet usage in Norway, Sweden, Austria, the UK, and Spain, we identified five user types: Non-Users (42%), Sporadic Users (18%), Instrumental Users (18%), Entertainment Users (10%), and Advanced Users (12%). These user types differ in their distributions over country, age, access, household members, and gender. An alarming finding is that 60% of the population was found to be either Non-Users or Sporadic Users, which reflects a large digital divide in Europe. Second, we conducted a logistic regression to identify the predictors for different user types. We found on a cross-national level that age and Internet access are the most salient predictors, whereas gender and household seems to be less relevant. However, the amount of variance explained differs between countries. We also suggested a future increase in the digital divide between the identified user types-a user type divide. The user typology and the identified predictors might help researchers, practitioners, and decision makers to better understand Internet users and the multi-complex variations among individuals and countries. This knowledge will also serve as a means to understand the digital divide by providing a more nuanced perspective on Europeans' unequal usage of the Internet and participation in an increasingly digital society.},

Our study suggests that this type of self-taught intermediate level of skill is device-specific. Experienced users (casual users and experts) exhibited superior performance for representative tasks. This is mainly attributable to faster navigation and better knowledge of interface terminology, not to deeper conceptual representation of the problems. Interviews suggest that this skill is the consequence of routine use and three recurring learning events: familiarization, following of media, and ad hoc problem-solving situations. We conclude by discussing why intermediate levels of skill deserve more attention in HCI research.},

Grounded theory, a qualitative research methodology, is appropriate to achieve this, because the Semantic Web is currently at an early introduction stage. Data was gathered through in-depth interviews with fifteen informants from user organizations adopted the Semantic Web and suppliers that supported the implementation of the projects. The interview transcripts were analyzed by using the open coding scheme of grounded theory. Five factors affecting the adoption and infusion of the Semantic Web were identified. The first factor is demand pull including requirements for solving search and integration problems of existing systems and for creating new services. Second, such things as environmental conduciveness, potential business value, government sponsorship programs, active roles of suppliers, etc. affect the adoption of the Semantic Web from the perspective of technology push. Third, organizational competence including communication and absorptive capacity plays an important role in its adoption. Fourth, user's over-expectation has a negative impact on its adoption. Finally, various factors affect the infusion of the Semantic Web, such as additional investment budget for extending systems based on the Semantic Web, sharing ontologies, and demonstrable effects.},

abstract = {This paper describes a user study on the benefits and drawbacks of simultaneous spatial sounds in auditory interfaces for visually impaired and blind computer users. Two different auditory interfaces in spatial and non-spatial condition were proposed to represent the hierarchical menu structure of a simple word processing application. In the horizontal interface, the sound sources or the menu items were located in the horizontal plane on a virtual ring surrounding the user's head, while the sound sources in the vertical interface were aligned one above the other in front of the user. In the vertical interface, the central pitch of the sound sources at different elevations was changed in order to improve the otherwise relatively low localization performance in the vertical dimension. The interaction with the interfaces was based on a standard computer keyboard for input and a pair of studio headphones for output. Twelve blind or visually impaired test subjects were asked to perform ten different word processing tasks within four experiment conditions. Task completion times, navigation performance, overall satisfaction and cognitive workload were evaluated. The initial hypothesis, i.e. that the spatial auditory interfaces with multiple simultaneous sounds should prove to be faster and more efficient than non-spatial ones, was not confirmed. On the contrary-spatial auditory interfaces proved to be significantly slower due to the high cognitive workload and temporal demand. The majority of users did in fact finish tasks with less navigation and key pressing; however, they required much more time. They reported the spatial auditory interfaces to be hard to use for a longer period of time due to the high temporal and mental demand, especially with regards to the comprehension of multiple simultaneous sounds. The comparison between the horizontal and vertical interface showed no significant differences between the two. It is important to point out that all participants were novice users of the system; therefore it is possible that the overall performance could change with a more extensive use of the interfaces and an increased number of trials or experiments sets. Our interviews with visually impaired and blind computer users showed that they are used to sharing their auditory channel in order to perform multiple simultaneous tasks such as listening to the radio, talking to somebody, using the computer, etc. As the perception of multiple simultaneous sounds requires the entire capacity of the auditory channel and total concentration of the listener, it does therefore not enable such multitasking.},

Consistency increased when participants were allowed to move freely, contrary to the assumption that constraining body movement, position, and orientation across individuals would increase consistency. Overall pointing consistency also did not fall off when participants could not look at the targets during interaction (after having previously pointed to them).

Study 1 adapted the aesthetics scale (Lavie and Tractinsky, 2004) to accommodate evaluations of map displays. Study 2 examined map displays that vary in the amount of data presented, their abstraction level and color schema, using objective and subjective usability measures. Maps with minimal detail produced best performances and highest evaluations. Abstractions were found to be advantageous when combined with reduced amount of detail and specific color schemas. Moderate abstractions were sufficient for obtaining the desired benefits. The color schema mainly affected the objective measures, pointing to the importance of good contrast between the cursor and the map colors. Study 3 further examined map schemas. Color schemas again had no effect on the perceptions of aesthetics and usability. Overall, similar results and high correlations were found for the perceived aesthetics and usability scales, indicating the connection between perceived aesthetics and usability. Lower correlations were found between the actual usability (performance) and the aesthetics scale. Finally, users' usability evaluations were not always in line with their actual performance, pointing to the importance of using objective usability measures.},

Two independent user trials were combined within the same experimental design to evaluate the commands that users employed when they used free speech in which they were not restricted to a specific vocabulary. The study also investigated when participants were told they were either talking to a machine (e.g. a speech recognition system) or instructing another person to complete a VR based task. Previous research has illustrated that when users are limited to a specific vocabulary, this can alter the interaction style employed. The findings from this research illustrate that the interaction style users employ are very different when they are told they are talking to a machine or another person. Using this knowledge, recommendations can be drawn for the development of speech input vocabularies for future VR applications.},

There was a pattern in which students with low prior knowledge of chemistry performed better on subsequent problem-solving tests if they learned from the polite tutor rather than the direct tutor (d=.78 on an immediate test, d=.51 on a delayed test), whereas students with high prior knowledge showed the reverse trend (d=-.47 for an immediate test; d=-.13 for a delayed test). These results point to a boundary condition for the politeness principle-the idea that people learn more deeply when words are in polite style. At least for low-knowledge learners, the results are consistent with social agency theory-the idea that social cues, such as politeness, can prime learners to accept a web-based tutor as a social partner and therefore try harder to make sense of the tutor's messages.},

abstract = {Evaluating e-learning systems is a complex activity which requires considerations of several criteria addressing quality in use as well as educational quality. Heuristic evaluation is a widespread method for usability evaluation, yet its output is often prone to subjective variability, primarily due to the generality of many heuristics. This paper presents the pattern-based (PB) inspection, which aims at reducing this drawback by exploiting a set of evaluation patterns to systematically drive inspectors in their evaluation activities. The application of PB inspection to the evaluation of e-learning systems is reported in this paper together with a study that compares this method to heuristic evaluation and user testing. The study involved 73 novice evaluators and 25 end users, who evaluated an e-learning application using one of the three techniques. The comparison metric was defined along six major dimensions, covering concepts of classical test theory and pragmatic aspects of usability evaluation. The study showed that evaluation patterns, capitalizing on the reuse of expert evaluators know-how, provide a systematic framework which reduces reliance on individual skills, increases inter-rater reliability and output standardization, permits the discovery of a larger set of different problems and decreases evaluation cost. Results also indicated that evaluation in general is strongly dependent on the methodological apparatus as well as on judgement bias and individual preferences of evaluators, providing support to the conceptualisation of interactive quality as a subjective judgement, recently brought forward by the UX research agenda.},

In particular, the results show that specific website design attributes have distinct effects on shaping consumers' trust and distrust.

Our study attempts to answer this question by experimentally investigating how specialization in media technology (specifically, web agent, web site, and computer) influences individuals' perception and attitudes towards sources in online communication, particularly consumer trust and purchase behaviors in e-commerce. All subjects (N=124) went to a specially constructed online site with a virtual shopping cart for a wine-purchasing task, as part of a 2 (specialist vs. generalist web agent)x2 (specialist vs. generalist web site)x2 (specialist computer vs. generalist computer) between-subjects experiment. Results indicate significant main effects and interactions of the agent, site, and computer specialization on trust and purchase decision time. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

The project investigates how robotic toys can become social mediators, encouraging children with special needs to discover a range of play styles, from solitary to collaborative play (with peers, carers/teachers, parents, etc.). This article explains the developmental process of constructing relevant play scenarios for children with different special needs. Results are presented from consultation with panel of experts (therapists, teachers, parents) who advised on the play needs for the various target user groups and who helped investigate how robotic toys could be used as a play tool to assist in the children's development. Examples from experimental investigations are provided which have informed the development of scenarios throughout the design process. We conclude by pointing out the potential benefit of this work to a variety of research projects and applications involving human-robot interactions.},

In the following, we describe a model based on fuzzy methods that enables to generate complex facial expressions of emotions. It uses fuzzy similarity to compute the degree of resemblance between facial expressions of the ECA. We also present an algorithm that adapts the facial behaviour of the agent depending on its social relationship with the interactants. This last algorithm is based on the theory of politeness by Brown and Levinson (1987). It outputs complex facial expressions that are socially adequate.},

abstract = {Several collaboration problems in virtual project teams that work in knowledge-intensive contexts can be attributed to a hampered process of interpersonal trust formation. Solutions to trust formation problems need to be based on an understanding of how interpersonal trust forms in face-to-face project teams as well as on insight into how this process differs in virtual teams. Synthesizing literature from various disciplines, we propose a model for the formation of interpersonal trust between project team members. Taking this model as a starting point, we analyse how virtual settings may alter or even obstruct the process of trust formation. One method to improve the formation of interpersonal trust in virtual settings is to facilitate the assessment of trustworthiness. This can be done by making information available about individual virtual project team members. Previous research in virtual project teams focussed principally on the medium by which information is spread, for example, by phone, mail, or videoconferencing. Most researchers failed to take the specific content of the information into account, although there is general agreement that personal, non-task-related information is important to foster trust. For this, we propose to use the antecedents of trustworthiness, which until now have mainly been used as a framework to measure trust, as a design framework instead. This framework of antecedents can also be used to determine which type of information is relevant to assess each other's trustworthiness. We review existing literature on the antecedents of trustworthiness and extend the well-accepted antecedents of 'ability', 'benevolence' and 'integrity' with several other antecedents, such as 'communality' and 'accountability'. Together, these form the TrustWorthiness ANtecedents (TWAN) schema. We describe how these antecedents can be used to determine which information is relevant for team members assessing others' trustworthiness. In future research we will first verify this extended cognitive schema of trustworthiness (TWAN) empirically and then apply it to the design of artefacts or guidelines, such as a personal identity profile to support the assessment of trustworthiness in virtual project teams.},

The effect of pre-game story exposure on game evaluation was mediated by participants' feelings of presence. When a comparison between participants who watched the pre-game story and those who watched a non-story video was conducted, no mediating role of feelings of presence was found. In Experiment 2, participants read a movie script before playing the game. Its results partially replicated those of Experiment 1 with no significant mediating role of feelings of presence.

abstract = {More and more people entering the stage of retirement at around age 55-65 are healthy, active, and also very computer-literate. This trend is rapidly changing the common image of late-midlife technology users, which rests on the assumption that they find it difficult to embrace new technologies and also that their main interests are health related. Although technology use and lifestyles are changing, however, many other aspects of life remain the same. One of these aspects is that of the transitions, or life changes, that generally take place in these years. Besides retirement, these transitions include changes in health, housing, social interaction, work life, and personal finance. People develop different ways of coping with these transitions, which brings up interesting issues related to the late midlife stage. This paper presents a diary-aided interview study of late middle-age adults (N=24) in Finland and Sweden with a focus on the interplay between technologies and transitions. Transitions were found to play a part in how the life interests of late middle-aged persons are often conflictive, forcing them to choose from among various 'possible selves'. At its best, technology can help alleviate these tensions. This finding is exemplified in the paper's discussion of two design implications associated with particular clashes of interests, related to how daily activities are organized and how contact is maintained with one's friends and family.},

The results show a greater sense of presence in test anxiety environments than in a neutral environment. Moreover, high test anxiety students feel more presence than their non-test anxiety counterparts. Spatial intelligence and introversion also influence the sense of presence experienced by high test anxiety students exposed to anxiety triggering virtual environments.

Although the value of fieldwork for design is widely recognised, difficulties surround the exploitation of fieldwork data within the design process. Since not every development project can support or justify large-scale field investigation, the issue of how to build on previous work within a domain is particularly important. In this paper we consider this issue in the context of development of mobile healthcare applications. Many such systems will be built in the coming years, and already a number of influential studies have derived concepts from fieldwork data and used them to support analysis of healthcare work. Using a patient review process as an example, we examine how the concepts from such exemplar studies can be leveraged to analyse fieldwork data, and to facilitate requirements elicitation. The concepts, previous interpretation within the domain, prototypical requirements and associated critique together provide a framework for analysis. The concepts are used to highlight issues that must be addressed and to derive requirements. We make the case that these concepts are not ''value free'' and that the course of our analysis is significantly altered through the palette of concepts used. The methodological implications of this proposition are also considered.},

Participants navigated a virtual multilevel building and their survey knowledge was measured by the judgment of spatial relative direction. The results showed that (1) the accuracy of spatial judgment along the horizontal direction and response time were improved for participants with the exocentric view aid; (2) the accuracy of spatial judgment along the vertical direction was worst in the condition with a 3D floor map; (3) in general participants with a 3D building map performed best. The data suggested that the large scale of an exocentric view aid and the increased number of exocentric perspective through which the spatial layout is observed can facilitate the acquisition of survey knowledge in a virtual building. Potential applications of the findings include the design of a 3D map for navigation in both real and virtual buildings.},

The results of evaluating the system's usefulness in an e-government portal are indicative of the value added of our approach.

This paper investigates how designer's intentions, as captured by the behaviour chain model, materialise through users' reported practices in the social network site Facebook. A total of 423 Facebook users from 5 countries answered a questionnaire that allowed us to examine how 2 user characteristics, experience with the site, and culture, shape the nature of true commitment. Our findings show that experience with the site and even more so, culture, have an effect on users' motivations for using Facebook, as well as their instrumental uses and the time they invest on the site. This analysis reifies the behaviour chain model by allowing designers to understand how the features they design are embodied in users' practices.},

Two studies were conducted in the UK to examine this, with one of the two studies being replicated in Malaysia. The first study presented respondents with a blog entry in one of three conditions: where the blogger was fully identifiable with a photograph, where only the age and sex of the blogger were revealed, and where only an alias was given for the blogger. Multi item constructs were used to measure the credibility of the blog and the blogger. No differences were found. Study 2 examined whether this was due to the presentation of the blog entry. This time respondents were shown one of two blog posts which conveyed exactly the same information and revealed exactly the same information about the blogger. One post introduced a number of spelling/grammar/punctuation errors. Results show that the well presented blog's writer was perceived as being more credible than the writer of the badly presented blog, but there was no difference in the credibility of the blog itself. The implications of the results are discussed with reference to the use of blogs as a knowledge sharing tool.},

Given the importance of visual aesthetics in human-computer interaction, it is vital that it is adequately assessed. The present research aimed at providing a precise operational definition and to develop a new measure of perceived visual aesthetics of websites. Construction of the Visual Aesthetics of Website Inventory (VisAWI) was based on a comprehensive and broad definition of visual aesthetics so that the resulting instrument would completely describe the domain of interest. Four interrelated facets of perceived visual aesthetics of websites were identified and validated in a series of seven studies. Simplicity and Diversity have repeatedly been treated as formal parameters of aesthetic objects throughout the history of empirical aesthetics, Colors are a critical property of aesthetic objects, and Craftsmanship addresses the skillful and coherent integration of the relevant design dimensions. These four facets jointly represent perceived visual aesthetics, but are still distinguishable from each other and carry unique meaning. The subscales contained in the VisAWI demonstrate good internal consistencies. Evidence for the convergent, divergent, discriminative, and concurrent validity of the VisAWI is provided. Overall, the present research suggests that the VisAWI appears to be a sound measure of visual aesthetics of websites comprising facets of both practical and theoretical interest.},

While the design of PRA's functional features has received a high degree of attention in academic studies, the social aspects of human-PRA interactions are comparatively less explored. This paper investigates the potential of enhancing users' social experiences of interacting with an anthropomorphic PRA (i.e., an agent with human-like characteristics, such as facial expressions, body gestures, or speech output) by manipulating its demographic embodiments. The two demographic variables assessed are ethnicity and gender. As suggested by similarity-attraction theory and social identity theory, the results of our laboratory experiment reveal that PRAs that match the ethnicity, though not the gender, of their users are perceived as more sociable, more enjoyable, and more useful to interact with than the mismatched ones. More interestingly, the ''matching-up'' effects of ethnicity are more significant among female users than males. Implications for practitioners on how to use an anthropomorphic agent's demographic characteristics to enhance users' interaction experience are also discussed.},

abstract = {The development of knowledge-based systems is usually approached through the combined skills of software and knowledge engineers (SEs and KEs, respectively) and of subject matter experts (SMEs). One of the most critical steps in this task aims at transferring knowledge from SMEs' expertise to formal, machine-readable representations, which allow systems to reason with such knowledge. However, this process is costly and error prone. Alleviating such knowledge acquisition bottleneck requires enabling SMEs with the means to produce the target knowledge representations, minimizing the intervention of KEs. This is especially difficult in the case of complex knowledge types like processes. The analysis of scientific domains like Biology, Chemistry, and Physics uncovers: (i) that process knowledge is the single most frequent type of knowledge occurring in such domains and (ii) specific solutions need to be devised in order to allow SMEs to represent it in a computational form. We present a framework and computer system for the acquisition and representation of process knowledge in scientific domains by SMEs. We propose methods and techniques to enable SMEs to acquire process knowledge from the domains, to formally represent it, and to reason about it. We have developed an abstract process metamodel and a library of problem solving methods (PSMs), which support these tasks, respectively providing the terminology for SME-tailored process diagrams and an abstract formalization of the strategies needed for reasoning about processes. We have implemented this approach as part of the DarkMatter system and formally evaluated it in the context of the intermediate evaluation of Project Halo, an initiative aiming at the creation of question answering systems by SMEs.},

abstract = {Technological advances have made possible a new generation of digital prosthetic memory devices (or memory aids). Yet we currently know little about when, how and why these devices might be useful. We evaluated two novel prosthetic memory devices in naturalistic and controlled learning settings. Both devices provide controlled access to annotated digital records of lectures, potentially freeing students from taking detailed notes, allowing them to re-access lecture recordings whenever they choose. Digital records had benefits over traditional learning aids (e.g. handouts/personal notes): Students were more accurate in answering class quizzes using digital records, and spontaneous digital records usage outside lectures showed strategic access during important aspects of the course. Native speakers who used digital records performed better on coursework, and non-native language speakers used digital records extensively. Despite being a verbatim record, digital records did not substitute for attendance: students who had attended lectures performed better on quizzes and final coursework and few students listened to lectures from beginning to end. Digital records are thus a highly promising teaching tool, but prosthetic memory devices are best understood as working in synergy with current tools to aid human memory, rather than replacing it. We conclude by discussing potential theory and design implications.},

We propose that an automated path planning tool for littoral navigation can reduce workload and improve the overall system efficiency, particularly under time pressure. To this end, a maritime automated path planner (MAPP) was developed, incorporating information requirements developed from a cognitive task analysis, with special emphasis on designing for trust. Human-in-the-loop experimental results showed that MAPP was successful in reducing the time required to generate an optimized path, as well as reducing path lengths. The results also showed that while users gave the tool high acceptance ratings, they rated the MAPP as average for trust, which we propose is the appropriate level of trust for such a system.},

abstract = {Models of human motor behavior are well known as an aid in the design of user interfaces (UIs). Most current models apply primarily to desktop interaction, but with the development of non-desktop UIs, new types of motor behaviors need to be modeled. Distal pointing-pointing directly at a target that is remotely situated with respect to the input device-is such a motor behavior. A model of distal pointing would be particularly useful in the comparison of different interaction techniques, because the performance of such techniques is highly dependent on user strategy, making controlled studies difficult to perform. Inspired by Fitts' law, we studied four possible models and concluded that movement time for a distal pointing task is best described as a function of the angular amplitude of movement and the angular size of the target. Contrary to Fitts' law, our model shows that the angular size has a much larger effect on movement time than the angular amplitude and that the growth in the difficulty of the tasks is quadratic, rather than linear. We estimated the model's parameters experimentally with a correlation coefficient of 96%.},

abstract = {The rapid development of blogs as a social networking tool has greatly increased the number of people who are expressing themselves in text published online. As yet little is known about the social psychology of online interaction using recently developed Web 2.0 functionalities. To what extent do principles of social psychology carry over into the online domain and how can appropriate use of those principles assist in activities such as community building, e-commerce, marketing, and personalization of services? There would seem to be a large number of novel research questions that can be posed with respect to online interaction. One pertinent question concerns the extent to which compatibility of personality influences online interaction. We investigated this question in terms of hypotheses derived from the personality research literature, using a two-part experiment. In the first study, eight participants wrote blogs in two distinct genres (personal diaries and commentaries) and rated their own personalities. In the second study 12 different participants judged the personality of authors as implied in the blog texts created in the first study. Those participants also completed a personality questionnaire and rated their attraction to the blog text author. Readers of the blog corpus were able to consistently judge the personality of the writers based solely on the text that they wrote. Moreover, they followed a well-established social rule regarding interpersonal attraction in real-life interaction. Blog readers were significantly more attracted to blog writers with more similar personalities-offering support that in a blog environment, ''birds of a feather flock together.'' Emotion word use in the blog corpus correlated with writer's personality, suggesting that online personality may be signalled by linguistic cues. The two most popular genres of blog writing, personal journal and commentary, differed in how accurately readers judged author personality traits. Based on the results obtained it is suggested that personality is an important determinant and that further research on how people communicate with blogs will be relevant to social network analysis and to marketing.},

Based on a study of 94 users exposed to a new technology, with measurements taken at two points in time, we found that both instrumental and hedonic factors affect individuals' intentions to explore, but their effects change over time such that as time goes by, the effect of personal innovativeness decreases and performance expectancy increases. In addition to our contributions and implications for research on technology acceptance, we present practical implications both for developers and managers, with a view toward helping the development and deployment of technologies that satisfy the evolution of users' needs over time.},

We examined the impact of working memory load and expected button-to-action mapping congruency on affordances and conventions. The findings suggest both sides of the debate are correct. Learned conventions were found to structure responses towards expected actions, just like affordances, but affordance-based interactions were not affected by memory load while convention-based actions were. Therefore, designers ought to employ perceptual affordances when possible and when not feasible they ought to reuse established conventions. Additionally, evidence is presented that violating expected affordance-based and convention-based button-to-action mappings caused a similar performance cost. We believe that after the initial learning period, conventions play a critical role in the perception of a design's available actions just as perceptual affordances do.},

abstract = {Time is an essential concept in cultural heritage applications. Instances of temporal concepts such as time intervals are used for the annotation of cultural objects and also for querying datasets containing information about these objects. Hence it is important to match query and annotation intervals by examining their similarity or closeness. One of the problems is that in many cases time intervals are imprecise. For example, the boundaries of the ''Pre-Roman age'' and the ''Roman age'' are inherently imprecise and it may be difficult to distinguish them with clear-cut intervals. In this paper we apply the fuzzy set theory to model imprecise time intervals in order to determine relevance of the relationship between two time intervals. We present a method for matching query and annotation intervals based on their weighted mutual overlapping and closeness. We present (1) methods for calculating these weights to produce a combined measure and (2) results of comparing the combined measure with human evaluators as a case study. The case study takes into consideration archaeological temporal information, which is in most cases inherently fuzzy, and therefore offers a particularly complex and challenging scenario. The results show that our new combined measure that utilizes different weighted measures together in rankings, performs the best in terms of precision and recall. It should be used when ranking annotation intervals according to a given query interval in cultural heritage information retrieval. Our approach intends to be generalizable: overlapping and closeness may be calculated between any two fuzzy temporal intervals. The presented procedure of using user evaluation results as a basis for assigning weights for overlapping and closeness could potentially be used to reveal weights in other domains and purposes as well.},

We believe the WAP Push service feature of mobile phones can help bridge the gap between internet and mobile services, and expand the number of potential blog readers. Since mobile phone screen size is very limited, content providers must be familiar with individual user preferences in order to recommend content that matches narrowly defined personal interests. To help identify popular blog topics, we have created (a) an information retrieval process that clusters blogs into groups based on keyword analyses, and (b) a mobile content recommender system (M-CRS) for calculating user preferences for new blog documents. Here we describe results from a case study involving 20,000 mobile phone users in which we examined the effects of personalized content recommendations. Browsing habits and user histories were recorded and analyzed to determine individual preferences for making content recommendations via the WAP Push feature. The evaluation results of our recommender system indicate significant increases in both blog-related push service click rates and user time spent reading personalized web pages. The process used in this study supports accurate recommendations of personalized mobile content according to user interests. This approach can be applied to other embedded systems with device limitations, since document subject lines are elaborated and more attractive to intended users.},

Both experiments included three sessions during which participants drove a simple driving simulator and performed tasks with the telematic system at one of the adaptivity levels. We measured task performance times and lane position variance. Adaptivity was not always equally beneficial, and its benefits depended on a number of factors, including the frequency in which the tasks were performed, the user's age, the difficulty of the task and the user's involvement in the task. In familiar, routine situations, a fully adaptive system was beneficial for all participants, particularly older ones. In unfamiliar situations, to which the AUI was not adjusted, cognitive workload increased substantially, adversely affecting performance. Intermediate levels of adaptivity keep users involved in the task and help them become more proficient when performing both routine and non-routine tasks. However, intermediate levels of adaptivity should also be implemented with care, because they may also have adverse effects when users encounter non-routine situations.},

The analysis of objective data provides insights into how the system is actually used in the field. Combined with the subjective data, personal opinions and evaluative judgments on the product quality can be then related to actual user behavior. In order to collect these data in a most natural context, remote data collection allows for extensive user testing within habitual environments.

Three recent and notable changes of recommender systems have been as follows: (1) a shift from characteristic-based recommendation algorithms to social-based recommendation algorithms; (2) an increase in the number of dimensions on which algorithms are based; and (3) availability of products that cannot be examined for quality before purchase. The combination of these elements is affecting users' perceptions and attitudes regarding recommender systems and the products recommended by them, but the psychological effects of these trends remain unexplored. The current study empirically examines the effects of these elements, using a 2 (recommendation approach: content-based vs. collaborative-based, within)x2 (dimensions used to generate recommendations: 6 vs. 30, between)x2 (product type: experience products (fragrances) vs. search products (rugs), between) Web-based study (N=80). Participants were told that they would use two recommender systems distinguished by recommendation approach (in fact, the recommendations were identical). There were no substantive main effects, but all three variables exhibited two-way interactions, indicating that design strategies must be grounded in a multi-dimensional understanding of these variables.

A preliminary survey examined 117 respondents' attitudes towards news content personalization and their interest in various news topics and subtopics. The second survey examined 23 participants' declared and actual interests. Participants preferred personalization based on general news topics. Declared interest in general news topics adequately predicted the actual interests in some topics, while in others users' interests differed between general news topics and subtopics. The variance in interest in items also differed among topics. Thus, different personalization methods should be used for different topics. For some, such as 'Sports', users show either high interest or no interest at all. In the latter case most articles related to the topic should be removed, with the exception of items that refer to unique events that may raise general interest according to the expressed interest. In other topics, such as 'Science &amp; Technology', most users are interested in important articles, even if they are not interested in the general news topic. Here, the filtering technique should identify the important articles and present them to all readers. The results can be used to develop effective and simple personalization mechanisms which can be applied to the personalization of news, as well as to other domains.},

abstract = {Social interaction among people is an essential part of every society, and a strong foundation for the development and self-actualization of a person. Even in virtual environments we tend to interact in a social way. Our research addresses the tasks of recognition, interpretation, and visualization of affect communicated through text messaging. In order to facilitate sensitive and expressive interaction in computer-mediated communication, we previously introduced a novel syntactical rule-based approach to affect recognition from text. The evaluation of the developed Affect Analysis Model showed promising results regarding its capability to accurately recognize affective information in text from an existing corpus of informal online conversations. To enrich the user's experience in online communication, to make it enjoyable, exciting, and fun, we implemented a web-based Instant Messaging (IM) application, AffectIM, and endowed it with emotional intelligence by integrating the developed Affect Analysis Model. This paper describes the findings of a twenty-person study conducted with our AffectIM system. The results of the study indicate that our IM system with automatic emotion recognition function can achieve a level of affective intelligence (system is successful at conveying the user's feelings, avatar expression is appropriate) that is comparable to ''gold standard'', where users select the label of the conveyed emotion manually.},

abstract = {The importance of space and place in collaborative practices has been strengthened with the ubiquitous computing paradigm, which aims at the integration of computation in physical objects and places. New location-based applications allow users to know where other individuals are in the physical world. New collaborative applications engage users in geographically dispersed and mobile activities. However, there is still a lack of information concerning how mutual location-awareness (i.e. knowing partners' whereabouts) might influence socio-cognitive processes involved in coordination. To address this issue, we conducted field experiments with a mobile and collaborative game, running on Tablet PCs, and compared two interfaces. On the first interface, groups received automatic updates from teammates' whereabouts, while this automatic MLA tool was not provided by the second interface. In addition, all users could use their Tablet PCs to communicate by annotating the map. We found no differences between the two conditions with regard to the task performance. However, contrary to our expectations, players without automatic MLA had a better representation of their partners' paths, wrote more messages and provided more elaborate explanations of their strategies. Additionally, automatic location-awareness undermined the coordination process, leading participants to be less articulate about their strategy. The paper discusses these results and the implications of such results.},

abstract = {Talk is often suspended during medical consultations while the clinician interacts with the patient's records and other information. This study of four general practitioners (GPs) focused on these suspensions and the adjacent conversational turns. Conversation analysis revealed how GPs took action to close conversations down prior to attending to the records, resulting in a 'free turn' that could be taken up by either GP or patient. The durations of the intervening pauses were also analysed, exposing a hitherto unobserved 10-second timeframe within which both GP and patient showed a preference for the conversation to be resumed. Resumption was more likely to be achieved within 10s when the GP's records were paper-based rather than computer-based. Subsequent analysis of topic changes on resumption of talk has revealed a 5-second timeframe, also undocumented; when pauses exceed this timeframe, it is rare for the previous topic to be resumed without a restatement. Data recorded in the home suggest that these timeframes are also present in family conversations. We argue for considering the two timeframes when designing systems for use in medical consultations and other conversational settings, and discuss possible outcomes.},

abstract = {Daily health self-management, such as the harmonization of food, exercise and medication, is a major problem for a large group of older adults with obesity or diabetics. Computer-based personal assistance can help to behave healthy by persuading and guiding older adults. For effective persuasion, the assistant should express social behaviors (e.g., turn taking, emotional expressions) to be trustworthy and show empathy. From the motivational interviewing method and synthetic assistants' literature, we derived a set of social behaviors, and implemented a subset in a physical character, a virtual character and a text interface. The first behavior type concerns conversing with high-level dialogue (semantics, intentions), which could be implemented in all 3 assistants. The other behavior types could only be implemented in the characters: showing natural cues (e.g., gaze, posture), expressing emotions (e.g., compassionate face), and accommodating social conversations (e.g., turn taking). In an experiment, 24 older adults (45-65) interacted with the text interface and one of the characters, conform a ''one-week diabetics scenario''. They experienced the virtual and physical character as more empathic and trustworthy than the text-based assistant, and expressed more conversational behavior with the characters. However, it seems that the preference of interacting with the character or the text interface was influenced by the conscientiousness of the participant; more conscientious people liked the text interface better. Older adults responded more negative to the characters that lacked the social behaviors than to the text interface. Some differences between the virtual and physical character probably occurred due to the specific constraints of the physical character.},

The aim of this study was to elicit knowledge of ventilation management to provide a baseline for evaluating the performance of an expert system for neonatal ventilation (FLORENCE). The modified Delphi method and focus group techniques were used to arrive at consensus management strategies on 40 hypothetical ventilation scenarios. The underlying cognitive processes of the experts were also explored further to assist in the development of the expert system. The strategies arrived at were used to provide a performance level which FLORENCE was tested against. The solutions were judged to be equivalent between FLORENCE and neonatologists in 29 of the 40 cases. In the remaining 11 scenarios; FLORENCE also provided adequate solutions. Conclusions: The focus group technique was more effective than modified Delphi method in achieving consensus on ventilation management. This consensus on ventilation was used as the baseline to evaluate the performance of an expert system.},

abstract = {Mapping medical concepts from a terminology system to the concepts in the narrative text of a medical document is necessary to provide semantically accurate information for further processing steps. The MetaMap Transfer (MMTx) program is a semantic annotation system that generates a rough mapping of concepts from the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus to free medical text, but this mapping still contains erroneous and ambiguous bits of information. Since manually correcting the mapping is an extremely cumbersome and time-consuming task, we have developed the MapFace editor. The editor provides a convenient way of navigating the annotated information gained from the MMTx output, and enables users to correct this information on both a conceptual and a syntactical level, and thus it greatly facilitates the handling of the MMTx program. Additionally, the editor provides enhanced visualization features to support the correct interpretation of medical concepts within the text. We paid special attention to ensure that the MapFace editor is an intuitive and convenient tool to work with. Therefore, we recently conducted a usability study in order to create a well founded background serving as a starting point for further improvement of the editor's usability.},

abstract = {Currently, infection control guidelines in hospitals and other health care institutions are more expert-driven than user-oriented. In order to enhance the usability of the expert-driven guideline format, we developed a website for the communication of existing guidelines that better fit the practical information needs of health care workers (HCWs). We employed a user-centered design process that involved two studies. In the initial study, 28 HCWs were asked to solve tasks using existing, paper-based infection control guidelines. In order to detect their strategies and problems, the participants were asked to think aloud. Usability problems occurred due to poorly structured information, insufficient quality of information, and a mismatch between experts' and HCWs' vocabulary. To overcome these shortcomings, three design principles were applied for communicating infection control guidelines: better navigation (the guidelines should be searchable in several ways); multimodality (the guidelines should not be presented as text only), and action-orientation (the guidelines should be presented as HCWs' behaviors). A website was developed to meet these principles. In the second study, the same 28 HCWs completed tasks identical to those of the first study while thinking aloud, but this time using the website. The percentage of correctly completed tasks increased and the mean time for task completion decreased significantly. Also, respondents were more satisfied with the website than the paper-based guidelines. The number of problems due to poor information quality and a mismatch in vocabulary declined, although the number of structural problems increased. This can probably be explained by the fact that the navigation structure was user-generated (using Card Sort), in contrast to a standardized answer format based on common usability principles. Overall, we found that involving HCWs in the development process is important to create a sense of ownership and to foster the implementation of the guidelines, which might eventually result in compliance and reduce health care-associated infections. This paper outlines concrete steps for how to involve HCWs in the design process.},

abstract = {The contextual information of Web images is investigated to address the issue of enriching their index characterizations with semantic descriptors and therefore bridge the semantic gap (i.e. the gap between the low-level content-based description of images and their semantic interpretation). Although we are highly motivated by the availability of rich knowledge on the Web and the relative success achieved by commercial search engines in indexing images using surrounding text-based information in webpages, we are aware that the unpredictable quality of the surrounding text is a major limiting factor. In order to improve its quality, we highlight contextual information which is relevant for the semantic characterization of Web images and study its statistical properties in terms of its location and nature considering a classification into five semantic concept classes: signal, object, scene, abstract and relational. A user study is conducted to validate the results. The results suggest that there are several locations that consistently contain relevant textual information with respect to the image. The importance of each location is influenced by the type of webpage as the results show the different distribution of relevant contextual information across the locations for different webpage types. The frequently found semantic concept classes are object and abstract. Another important outcome of the user study shows that a webpage is not an atomic unit and can be further partitioned into smaller segments. Segments containing images are of interest and termed as image segments. We observe that users typically single out textual information which they consider relevant to the image from the textual information bounded within the image segment. Hence, our second contribution is a DOM Tree-based webpage segmentation algorithm to automatically partition webpages into image segments. We use the resultant human-labeled dataset to validate the effectiveness of our segmentation method and experiments demonstrate that our method achieves better results compared to an existing segmentation algorithm.},

It is not surprising that companies are interested in gaining the patronage of this group, particularly via the web. Surprisingly, very little research into making web pages appealing to this important demographic has been done. This paper addresses this need through two separate studies. The first, an online survey, provides evidence that our proposed score for predicting the visual appeal of web pages reflects the self report measure of what pages Generation Y likes. To refine these findings, an eye tracking study is conducted using the pages that were most and least liked in Study I. Participants' eye movement is tracked while browsing these pages, providing evidence of what attracts their attention. The results of these two studies suggest that Generation Y may prefer pages that include a main large image, images of celebrities, little text, and a search feature. This research has important implications.},

However, the utility of this approach and the associated design implications are questioned by the interruption value evaluation paradigm, which holds that interpersonal interruption management decisions are often made by people assessing factors such as who the interruption is from and what it is about (the relational context). To assess the validity of the competing assumptions underlining these paradigms about everyday interpersonal interruption management, a field study of interruption management practices in everyday cell phone use was conducted. Analysis of 1201 incoming calls from our experience sampling method study of cell phone use shows that ''who'' is calling is used most of the time (87.4%) by individuals to make deliberate call handling decisions (N=834), in contrast to the interruptee's current local social (34.9%) or cognitive (43%) contexts. Building on these findings, we present a theoretical framework that aids in understanding the design space of interruption management tools that focus on reducing uncertainty of the interruption context to improve interruption management decisions.},

Most of these methodologies follow the participatory design approach to involve the user in the design process. Virtual Reality is a valid tool to support Participatory Design, because it facilitates the collaboration among designers and users. The present study aims to evaluate the feasibility and the efficacy of an innovative Participatory Design approach where Virtual Reality plays a 'double role': a tool to evaluate the usability of the virtual product interface, and a communication channel that allows users to be directly involved in the design process as co-designers. In order to achieve these goals, we conducted three experiments: the purpose of the first experiment is to determine the influence of the virtual interface on the usability evaluation by comparing ''user-real product'' interaction and ''user-virtual product'' interaction. Subsequently, we tested the effectiveness of our approach with two experiments involving users (directly or through their participation in a focus group) in the redesign of a product user interface. The experiments were conducted with two typologies of consumer appliances: a microwave oven and a washing machine.},

abstract = {The Augmented Representation of Cultural Objects (ARCO) system, developed as a part of an EU ICT project, provides museum curators with software and interface tools to develop web-based virtual museum exhibitions by integrating augmented reality (AR) and 3D computer graphics. ARCO technologies could also be deployed in order to implement educational kiosks placed in real-world museums. The main purpose of the system is to offer an entertaining, informative and enjoyable experience to virtual museum visitors. This paper presents a formal usability study that has been undertaken in order to explore participants' perceived 'sense of being there' and enjoyment while exposed to a virtual museum exhibition in relation to real-world visits. The virtual museum implemented was based on an existing gallery in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, UK. It is of interest to determine whether a high level of presence results in enhanced enjoyment. After exposure to the system, participants completed standardized presence questionnaires related to the perceived realism of cultural artifacts referred to as AR objects' presence, as well as to participants' generic perceived presence in the virtual museum referred to as VR presence. The studies conducted indicate that previous experience with ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) did not correlate with perceived AR objects' presence or VR presence while exposed to a virtual heritage environment. Enjoyment and both AR objects' presence and VR presence were found to be positively correlated. Therefore, a high level of perceived presence could be closely associated with satisfaction and gratification which contribute towards an appealing experience while interacting with a museum simulation system.},

abstract = {We study the incidence (rate of occurrence), persistence (rate of reoccurrence immediately after occurrence), and impact (effect on behavior) of students' cognitive-affective states during their use of three different computer-based learning environments. Students' cognitive-affective states are studied using different populations (Philippines, USA), different methods (quantitative field observation, self-report), and different types of learning environments (dialogue tutor, problem-solving game, and problem-solving-based Intelligent Tutoring System). By varying the studies along these multiple factors, we can have greater confidence that findings which generalize across studies are robust. The incidence, persistence, and impact of boredom, frustration, confusion, engaged concentration, delight, and surprise were compared. We found that boredom was very persistent across learning environments and was associated with poorer learning and problem behaviors, such as gaming the system. Despite prior hypothesis to the contrary, frustration was less persistent, less associated with poorer learning, and did not appear to be an antecedent to gaming the system. Confusion and engaged concentration were the most common states within all three learning environments. Experiences of delight and surprise were rare. These findings suggest that significant effort should be put into detecting and responding to boredom and confusion, with a particular emphasis on developing pedagogical interventions to disrupt the ''vicious cycles'' which occur when a student becomes bored and remains bored for long periods of time.},

abstract = {Research suggests that human limitations are rarely considered in the design of knowledge-based authentication systems. In an attempt to foster entry to a system, individuals tend to choose passwords which are easy to recall. However, inappropriate selection can compromise data security. A novel approach has been developed to restore the balance between security and memorability through the use of the haptic channel. This paper introduces the Tactile Authentication System (TAS), which enables the user to authenticate entry through the ability to remember a sequence of pre-selected tactile sensations. The design process undertaken to develop distinguishable tactile stimuli for use within TAS is described, and details of the recognition-based tactile authentication mechanism are also presented. Findings from an empirical study reported in this paper, have revealed that 16 participants were able to authenticate access to TAS over the course of a one-month period, with low levels of error. The approach was found to offer benefits over conventional visual-based authentication methods. Tactile stimuli are presented underneath the fingertips, and are therefore occluded from others. As the sense of touch is personal to each user, tactile stimuli are difficult to describe in concrete terms, and cannot easily be written down or disclosed, thereby reducing the chance of unauthorized third party access.},

abstract = {Small devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) are widely used to access the World Wide Web (Web). However, accessing the Web from small devices is affected by poor interface bandwidth, such as small keyboards and limited pointing devices. There is little empirical work investigating the input difficulties caused by such insufficient facilities, however, anecdotal evidence suggests that there is a link between able-bodied users of the mobile Web and motor impaired users of the Web on desktop computers. This being the case we could transfer the solutions which already exists for motor impaired users into the mobile Web and vice versa. This paper presents a user study that investigates the input errors of mobile Web users in both typing and pointing. The study identifies six types of typing errors and three types of pointing errors shared between our two user domains. We find that mobile Web users often confuse the different characters located on the same key, press keys that are adjacent to the target key, and miss certain key presses. When using a stylus, they also click in the wrong places, slide the stylus during multiple clicks, and make errors when dragging. Our results confirm that despite using different input devices, mobile Web users share common problems with motor impaired desktop users; and we therefore surmise that it will be beneficial to transfer available solutions between these user domains in order to address their common problems.},

abstract = {Personalized graphical user interfaces have the potential to reduce visual complexity and improve interaction efficiency by tailoring elements such as menus and toolbars to better suit an individual user's needs. When an interface is personalized to make useful features more accessible for a user's current task, however, there may be a negative impact on the user's awareness of the full set of available features, making future tasks more difficult. To assess this tradeoff we introduce awareness as an evaluation metric to be used in conjunction with performance. We then discuss three studies we have conducted, which show that personalized interfaces tradeoff awareness of unused features for performance gains on core tasks. The first two studies, previously published and presented only in summary, demonstrate this tradeoff by measuring awareness using a recognition test of unused features in the interface. The studies also evaluated two different types of personalized interfaces: a layered interfaces approach and an adaptive split menu approach. The third study, presented in full, focuses on adaptive split menus and extends results from the first two studies to show that different levels of awareness also correspond to an impact on performance when users are asked to complete new tasks. Based on all three studies and a survey of related work, we outline a design space of personalized interfaces and present several factors that could affect the tradeoff between core task performance and awareness. Finally, we provide a set of design implications that should be considered for personalized interfaces.},

In the initial case study, both consumers and web operators thought the use of software agents enhanced online auction efficiency and timeliness. The second phase of the investigation established that consumer familiarity with the agent functionality was positively associated with seven dimensions: online auction site's task, agent's technology, task-technology fit, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived playfulness, intention to use tool, and negatively associated with perceived risk. Intelligent agents have the potential to release skilled operator time for the use of value-adding tasks in the planning and expansion of online auctions.},

The difference between game play with other avatars (player-controlled characters) or agents (characters controlled by the computer) may influence the engagement a game player experiences. This study investigated the effects of agency (avatar versus agent) and the type of gaming activity (competition versus cooperation) on physiological arousal and subjective evaluation of play. A 2 (avatar, agent)x2 (competition, cooperation) within-subject experiment was conducted (N=32). Players exhibited greater physiological arousal to otherwise identical interactions when other characters were introduced as an avatar rather than an agent. Furthermore, the co-player's source of agency interacted with the type of gaming activity. The results have implications for understanding how different forms of representation in virtual worlds and games will affect psychological responses in the contexts of entertainment, learning and the conduct of serious work.},

Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of symmetry and balance on the aesthetic appeal of text-overlaid images. In the first experiment, five color photos were used to compose a set of test images overlaid with a paragraph of Chinese texts as the stimuli. Contrastly, the second experiment applied monochrome photos to compute the stimuli. The positions of the text overlay were determined by varying the balance and symmetry in order to validate computational aesthetic quantification algorithms with subjective ratings. The stimuli were rated by 20 subjects in each experiment using the ratio-scale magnitude estimation method against a benchmark image for each photo. Results from both experiments show that subjects are adept at judging symmetry and balance in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Subjects are also adept at judging radial symmetry about the center point of an image. The experiments also established a relationship between a higher averaged visual balance and the aesthetic appeal of text-overlaid images. Symmetry in either direction, however, did not result in any proportional relations to the aesthetic appeal.},

abstract = {Colour has the potential to elicit emotions or behaviors, yet there is little research in which colour treatments in website design are systematically tested. Little is known about how colour affects trust or satisfaction on the part of the viewer. Although the Internet is increasingly global, few systematic studies have been undertaken in which the impact of colour on culturally diverse viewers is investigated in website design. In this research three website colour treatments are tested across three culturally distinct viewer groups for their impact on user trust, satisfaction, and e-loyalty. To gather data, a rich multi-method approach is used including eye-tracking, a survey, and interviews. Results reveal that website colour appeal is a significant determinant for website trust and satisfaction with differences noted across cultures. The findings have practical value for web marketers and interface designers concerning effective colour use in website development.},

abstract = {The uptake of digital photos vs. print photos has altered the practice of photo-sharing. Print photos are easy to share within the home, but much harder to share outside of it. The opposite is true of digital photos. People easily share digital photos outside the home, e.g., to family and friends by e-mail gift-giving, and to social networks and the broader public by web publishing. Yet within the home, collocated digital photo-sharing is harder, primarily because digital photos are typically stored on personal accounts in desktop computers located in home offices. This leads to several consequences. (1) The invisibility of digital photos implies few opportunities for serendipitous photo-sharing. (2) Access control and navigation issues inhibit family members from retrieving photo collections. (3) Photo viewing is compromised as digital photos are displayed on small screens in an uncomfortable viewing setting. To mitigate some of these difficulties, we explore how physical memorabilia collected by family members can create opportunities that encourage social and collocated digital photo-sharing. First, we studied (via contextual interviews with 20 households) how families currently practice photo-sharing and how they keep memorabilia. We identified classes of memorabilia that can serve as memory triggers to family events, trips, and times when people took photos. Second, we designed Souvenirs, a photo-viewing system that exploits memorabilia as a social instrument. Using Souvenirs, a family member can meaningfully associate physical memorabilia with particular photo-sets. Later, any family member can begin their story-telling with others through the physical memento, and then enrich the story by displaying its associated photos simply by moving the memento close to the home's large-format television screen. Third, we re-examined our design premises by evoking household reactions to an early version of Souvenirs. Based on these interviews, we redesigned Souvenirs to better reflect the preferences and real practices of photo and memorabilia use in the home.},

abstract = {Passing around stacks of paper photographs while sitting around a table is one of the key social practices defining what is commonly referred to as the 'Kodak Generation'. Due to the way digital photographs are stored and handled, this practice does not translate well to the 'Flickr Generation', where collocated photo sharing often involves the (wireless) transmission of a photo from one mobile device to another. In order to facilitate 'cross-generation' sharing without enforcing either practice, it is desirable to bridge this gap in a way that incorporates familiar aspects of both. In this paper, we discuss a novel interaction technique that addresses some of the constraints introduced by current communication technology, and that enables photo sharing in a way, which resembles the passing of stacks of paper photographs. This technique is based on dynamically generated spatial regions around mobile devices and has been evaluated through two user studies. The results we obtained indicate that our technique is easy to learn and as fast, or faster than, current technology such as transmitting photos between devices using Bluetooth. In addition, we found evidence of different sharing techniques influencing social practice around photo sharing. The use of our technique resulted in a more inclusive and group-oriented behavior in contrast to Bluetooth photo sharing, which resulted in a more fractured setting composed of sub-groups.},

Adopting a social psychological approach and focusing on intergenerational power dynamics, our research explores the use of domestic photo displays in family representation. Parents and their teenagers from eight families in the south of England were interviewed at home about their interpretations of both stored and displayed photos within the home. Discussions centred on particular photographs found by the participants to portray self and family in different ways. The findings show that public displays of digital photos are still curated by mothers of the households, but with more difficulty and less control than with analogue photos. In addition, teenagers both contribute and comply with this curation within the home, whilst at the same time developing additional ways of presenting their families and themselves online that are 'unsupervised' by the curator. We highlight the conflict of interest that is at play within teen and parent practices and consider the challenges that this presents for supporting the representation of family through the design of photo display technology.},

The focus of this paper is on the social practices surrounding images captured from a new photographic device-SenseCam-which, rather than capturing individual images when triggered by the user, automatically captures a series of images. This paper is concerned with the use of SenseCam digital images in social contexts where there is a professional purpose-supporting the collaborative reflective practices of school teachers and university tutors as part of their professional development. Analysis of video data collected from 16 in-situ case studies of reflective discussions shows evidence that reflection took place as defined in the literature. Further the phototalk around SenseCam images was found to benefit reflection in these social situations through promotion of a rich shared understanding of the lesson context: supporting return to the experience, sharing of background context, grounding conversations, illustrating and providing evidence, and allowing people to see more. The paper concludes with a discussion on how different features of SenseCam images, such as variable quality, lack of audio and incompleteness, helped in this reflection or not. Finally implications from this work and participant's comments are used to suggest ways in which SenseCam may be used in the future in teachers' and tutors' social reflection.},

To date there has been much research in the HCI community towards sharing of both analog and digital photographs. With recent advances in network technology further research has been done with photos being shared almost immediately after capture. However, most of the research has focused on synchronous sharing with groups of distributed users and little has been done to focus on how synchronous capture and sharing could benefit a group of collocated mobile users. To help start exploration in this area we have created Mobiphos. In this article we present how synchronous capture and sharing affects how groups of mobile, collocated users engage with their environment and each other while touring a city. We also discuss the design guidelines of Mobiphos and the implications for future photoware for the mobile, collocated context.},

However, in order for them to be effectively employed in human-computer interfaces, significant knowledge is required in areas including the perception of acoustic signatures of walking, and the design, engineering, and evaluation of interfaces that utilize them. Much of this expertise has accumulated in recent years, although many questions remain to be explored.

The issues it addresses may be of central relevance to areas of the emerging discipline of sonic interaction design that have begun to address the unique problems of designing sound for highly interactive contexts. Three experiments were conducted to assess two key aspects of the sound design developed for an abstract object designed for these experiments, which we refer to as the Spinotron. First, a comparison of sound source identification was made between three cases: passive listening to temporally static sounds; passive listening to dynamically evolving sounds; and listening to sounds generated through active manipulation of the artifact. The results show that control over the sound production process influences the material of the objects in interaction identified as the source of the sounds. Second, in a learning experiment, users' performance with the Spinotron device was compared between a group of participants that were provided only with passive proprioceptive information, and for another group who were also presented with synthetic sound produced by the artifact. The results indicated that the sound, when present, aided users in learning to control the device, whereas without the sound no learning was observed. Together, these results hold promise toward creating a foundation for the design of continuous sound that is intended to accompany control actions on the part of users, and toward establishing a basis for experimental/quantitative evaluation methods and gathering basic knowledge about sensory-motor activity engaged in tangible sonic interactions.},

The evaluation of paco aimed to investigate how useful this framework is in a real-world environment. It was conducted in two phases: experts in auditory display design first captured successful designs through paco and created a body of design patterns. These patterns were subsequently used in a controlled experiment with novice designers who were given a design task that forced them to use audio. The results demonstrate that paco has facilitated the transfer of design knowledge and good practice from experts to novices through design patterns. The context space, a key concept in paco, improves the contextual awareness of designers and provides an organising principle for problems, patterns and artefacts. We close by reflecting on the results and discussing future lines of research.},

abstract = {Monitoring of cognitive and physical function is central to the care of people with or at risk for various health conditions, but existing solutions rely on intrusive methods that are inadequate for continuous tracking. Less intrusive techniques that facilitate more accurate and frequent monitoring of the status of cognitive or physical function become increasingly desirable as the population ages and lifespan increases. Since the number of seniors using computers continues to grow dramatically, a method that exploits normal daily computer interactions is attractive. This research explores the possibility of detecting cognitive and physical stress by monitoring keyboard interactions with the eventual goal of detecting acute or gradual changes in cognitive and physical function. Researchers have already attributed a certain amount of variability and ''drift'' in an individual's typing pattern to situational factors as well as stress, but this phenomenon has not been explored adequately. In an attempt to detect changes in typing associated with stress, this research analyzes keystroke and linguistic features of spontaneously generated text. Results show that it is possible to classify cognitive and physical stress conditions relative to non-stress conditions based on keystroke and linguistic features with accuracy rates comparable to those currently obtained using affective computing methods. The proposed approach is attractive because it requires no additional hardware, is unobtrusive, is adaptable to individual users, and is of very low cost. This research demonstrates the potential of exploiting continuous monitoring of keyboard interactions to support the early detection of changes in cognitive and physical function.},

The goal of the investigation is to examine perceived interactivity in a model which includes most commonly tested cognitive elements such as efficiency and effectiveness, but augments this model with the inclusion of a cognitive-affective element for trust, and an affective element of enjoyment. More specifically, a model is created to validate the relationship of perceived interactivity (comprised of user control, user connectedness, and responsiveness of the web-poll application) to efficiency, effectiveness, trust and enjoyment, of the website. In turn, efficiency, effectiveness, trust, and enjoyment are tested for their influence on user behavioral intentions for e-loyalty. All relationships in the model are supported. In addition, exploratory evaluation of qualitative comments is conducted to investigate additional insights between the five web-poll treatments in this investigation. The research confirms the complexity of a model in which cognitive, cognitive-affective and affective elements are present, and advances knowledge on the consequences of perceived interactivity. In additional to theoretical advancements, the research has merit for web designers and online marketers regarding how to enhance interactive online web applications.},

This paper presents an empirical study that compared three theories of agent realism: Realism Maximization Theory, Uncanny Valley Theory, and Consistency Theory. Results of this study showed that people responded best to an embodied agent when it demonstrated moderately realistic, inconsistent behavior. These results support Uncanny Valley Theory and demonstrate the powerful influence of agent behavior on users' responses.},

abstract = {Designing user interfaces which can cope with unconventional control properties is challenging, and conventional interface design techniques are of little help. This paper examines how interactions can be designed to explicitly take into account the uncertainty and dynamics of control inputs. In particular, the asymmetry of feedback and control channels is highlighted as a key design constraint, which is especially obvious in current non-invasive brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Brain-computer interfaces are systems capable of decoding neural activity in real time, thereby allowing a computer application to be directly controlled by thought. BCIs, however, have totally different signal properties than most conventional interaction devices. Bandwidth is very limited and there are comparatively long and unpredictable delays. Such interfaces cannot simply be treated as unwieldy mice. In this respect they are an example of a growing field of sensor-based interfaces which have unorthodox control properties. As a concrete example, we present the text entry application ''Hex-O-Spell'', controlled via motor-imagery based electroencephalography (EEG). The system utilizes the high visual display bandwidth to help compensate for the limited control signals, where the timing of the state changes encodes most of the information. We present results showing the comparatively high performance of this interface, with entry rates exceeding seven characters per minute.},

abstract = {Recent field experiments on acceptability of notifications in the home showed that people generally want to be informed of urgent messages as soon as possible, whereas non-urgent messages should not be presented at all. A possible way to improve the acceptability of a notification might be to adjust the presentation mode and the timing of notifications to the message content and to the state of the user. For example, acceptability might be improved by considering user activities when selecting the best time to present the message. The relation between acceptability, presentation mode and timing has not been formally studied in a controlled home setting before. This paper presents the results of a user study, in which 10 participant couples were asked to engage in everyday home activities, and to subjectively rate factors that were expected to influence acceptability. The study was situated in a living-room laboratory in which the user activities and the timing of notifications were controlled. Questionnaire data was evaluated using cluster analysis in order to construct a semantic model that describes the relationship between user, system and environment. The key findings in the present study are: (1) acceptability could be improved by adjusting the level of intrusiveness of the presentation to message urgency: urgent messages should be presented intrusively, medium-urgent messages unobtrusively, and (2) non-urgent messages should be postponed until the message urgency has increased, or skipped if the message urgency never exceeds the predefined presentation threshold. Surprisingly, the user activities at the time of notification were not found to influence acceptability. These findings have resulted in a model of acceptability of notifications for the design of future home notification systems.},

Twenty, hand-held, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) collect responses on customizable skin interfaces. The pARF server transmits the customizable options, synchronizes devices and collects data for export. We report two studies using the pARF that demonstrate respondent agreement of perceived emotion during particular sections of two dance works. Greater agreement was evident in continuous ratings of arousal than valence; arousal appears to be related to surface features of the dance work. Future applications of the pARF to studies of multi-modal perception and cognition are discussed.},

Consequently, it is unclear how movement affects the experiential side of VEs. We introduce a novel method of measuring and modelling human movement. A specific information entropy-based modelling method enabled us to identify different movement patterns and analyse the experiential components related to them. The data was collected by registering the movement patterns of 68 participants who were in a virtual house doing a search task. The experiential side of the VE was measured with the Experimental Virtual Environment Questionnaire (EVEQ). Four movement patterns were identified. In addition, fluent movement in VEs was related to a high sense of presence. Moreover, the participants who moved fluently in the environment assessed their skills high. The results show how movement is related the way in which people experience the VE. The movement analysis method introduced here is applicable to other related research areas as well.},

The current study examined website complexity within the framework of aesthetic theory and psychophysiological research on cognition and emotion. We hypothesized that increasing the complexity of websites would have a detrimental cognitive and emotional impact on users. In a passive viewing task (PVT) 36 website screenshots differing in their degree of complexity (operationalized by JPEG file size; correlation with complexity ratings in a preliminary study r=.80) were presented to 48 participants in randomized order. Additionally, a standardized visual search task (VST) assessing reaction times, and a one-week-delayed recognition task on these websites were conducted and participants rated all websites for arousal and valence. Psychophysiological responses were assessed during the PVT and VST. Visual complexity was related to increased experienced arousal, more negative valence appraisal, decreased heart rate, and increased facial muscle tension (musculus corrugator). Visual complexity resulted in increased reaction times in the VST and decreased recognition rates. Reaction times in the VST were related to increases in heart rate and electrodermal activity. These findings demonstrate that visual complexity of websites has multiple effects on human cognition and emotion, including experienced pleasure and arousal, facial expression, autonomic nervous system activation, task performance, and memory. It should thus be considered an important factor in website design.},

People balance awareness with privacy by using several privacy-protection strategies built into the system. A preliminary evaluation with two groups using this system shows that people use it to maintain awareness of what others are doing, project a certain image of themselves, monitor progress, coordinate joint tasks, determine others' availability, and engage in serendipitous conversation and collaboration. While privacy was not a large concern for these groups, a theoretical analysis suggests that privacy risks may differ for other user communities.},

In order to achieve these goals, a screen magnifier and an experimental tool to present stimulus words were developed. Seventy-two elderly Chinese adults took part in the experiment. The findings indicate that, for a screen magnifier, the overlapping mode is superior to the parallel mode; the yellow-highlighted background is superior to the non-highlighted background; for lower-density text, the dual output mode (visual+auditory) is superior to the mono output mode (visual only), while for the higher-density text, no difference was found between the mono and dual output modes. Based on the findings, several recommendations are made. The overlapping mode should be set as the default working mode. Yellow could be a reasonable choice of background color for a magnifier when the text is black. Auditory output support should be used, and users should be advised to use dual output when the text density is lower and mono output when the text density is higher.},

abstract = {The work presented in this paper aims at assessing human emotions using peripheral as well as electroencephalographic (EEG) physiological signals on short-time periods. Three specific areas of the valence-arousal emotional space are defined, corresponding to negatively excited, positively excited, and calm-neutral states. An acquisition protocol based on the recall of past emotional life episodes has been designed to acquire data from both peripheral and EEG signals. Pattern classification is used to distinguish between the three areas of the valence-arousal space. The performance of several classifiers has been evaluated on 10 participants and different feature sets: peripheral features, EEG time-frequency features, EEG pairwise mutual information (MI) features. Comparison of results obtained using either peripheral or EEG signals confirms the interest of using EEGs to assess valence and arousal in emotion recall conditions. The obtained accuracy for the three emotional classes is 63% using EEG time-frequency features, which is better than the results obtained from previous studies using EEG and similar classes. Fusion of the different feature sets at the decision level using a summation rule also showed to improve accuracy to 70%. Furthermore, the rejection of non-confident samples finally led to a classification accuracy of 80% for the three classes.},

abstract = {Although machine learning is becoming commonly used in today's software, there has been little research into how end users might interact with machine learning systems, beyond communicating simple ''right/wrong'' judgments. If the users themselves could work hand-in-hand with machine learning systems, the users' understanding and trust of the system could improve and the accuracy of learning systems could be improved as well. We conducted three experiments to understand the potential for rich interactions between users and machine learning systems. The first experiment was a think-aloud study that investigated users' willingness to interact with machine learning reasoning, and what kinds of feedback users might give to machine learning systems. We then investigated the viability of introducing such feedback into machine learning systems, specifically, how to incorporate some of these types of user feedback into machine learning systems, and what their impact was on the accuracy of the system. Taken together, the results of our experiments show that supporting rich interactions between users and machine learning systems is feasible for both user and machine. This shows the potential of rich human-computer collaboration via on-the-spot interactions as a promising direction for machine learning systems and users to collaboratively share intelligence.},

Users regarded the heavier, non-ideal, e-health advisors as more trustworthy, which explained the larger part of the variance in the level of involvement, distance, and intentions to use a health advisor.

abstract = {It was thought that computer-performance-related problems in human-computer interaction (HCI) would become negligible with the constant increase in computing power. However, despite major advances in computer technology, contemporary HCI is still characterized by brief delays in computer responsiveness caused, for example, by background processes or network delays. Research on long system-response times (SRTs) indicates that delays may have negative behavioral and emotional consequences. However, there are fundamental differences between previously researched long SRTs and delays as they occur in contemporary HCI, such as different timings and occurrence probabilities. Therefore the previous research is not necessarily applicable to modern HCIs. We developed a paradigm aimed at mimicking important aspects of contemporary HCI to empirically test the effects of sporadic brief delays with an average duration of 1.6s. Results showed performance decrements in the response directly following a delay in terms of increased reaction times and error rates. Furthermore, blocks in which delays occurred were less liked than blocks without delays, suggesting that delays may affect the emotional state. The data provide evidence that delays cause a significant deterioration of performance, and indicates that delays in contemporary HCI may negatively affect work productivity, work satisfaction, and health-and-safety. Suggestions for HCI design and the relationship to user interruption are discussed.},

abstract = {In the framework of data interpretation for petroleum exploration, this paper contributes two contributions for visual exploration aiming to manually segment surfaces embedded in volumetric data. Resulting from a user-centered design approach, the first contribution, dynamic picking, is a new method of viewing slices dedicated to surface tracking, i.e. fault-picking, from 3D large seismic data sets. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm of interaction breaking with the conventional 2D slices method usually used by geoscientists. Based on the 2D+time visualization method, dynamic picking facilitates localizing of faults by taking advantage of the intrinsic ability of the human visual system to detect dynamic changes in textured data. The second, projective slice, is a focus+context visualization technique that offers the advantage of facilitating the anticipation of upcoming slices over the sloping 3D surface. From the reported experimental results, dynamic picking leads to a good compromise between fitting precision and completeness of picking while the projective slice significantly reduces the amount of workload for an equivalent level of precision.},

We introduce a tool feature, usability problem instance records, to better support novice usability practitioners.

abstract = {The increasing complexity of applications on handheld devices requires the development of rich new interaction methods specifically designed for resource-limited mobile use contexts. One appealingly convenient approach to this problem is to use device motions as input, a paradigm in which the currently dominant interaction metaphors are gesture recognition and visually mediated scrolling. However, neither is ideal. The former suffers from fundamental problems in the learning and communication of gestural patterns, while the latter requires continual visual monitoring of the mobile device, a task that is undesirable in many mobile contexts and also inherently in conflict with the act of moving a device to control it. This paper proposes an alternate approach: a gestural menu technique inspired by marking menus and designed specifically for the characteristics of motion input. It uses rotations between targets occupying large portions of angular space and emphasizes kinesthetic, eyes-free interaction. Three evaluations are presented, two featuring an abstract user interface (UI) and focusing on how user performance changes when the basic system parameters of number, size and depth of targets are manipulated. These studies show that a version of the menu system containing 19 commands yields optimal performance, compares well against data from the previous literature and can be used effectively eyes free (without graphical feedback). The final study uses a full graphical UI and untrained users to demonstrate that the system can be rapidly learnt. Together, these three studies rigorously validate the system design and suggest promising new directions for handheld motion-based UIs.},

abstract = {The digitisation of cultural heritage and linguistics texts has long been troubled by the problem of how to represent overlapping structures arising from different markup perspectives ('overlapping hierarchies') or from different versions of the same work ('textual variation'). These two problems can be reduced to one by observing that every case of overlapping hierarchies is also a case of textual variation. Overlapping textual structures can be accurately modelled either as a minimally redundant directed graph, or, more practically, as an ordered list of pairs, each containing a set of versions and a fragment of text or data. This 'pairs-list' representation is provably equivalent to the graph representation. It can record texts consisting of thousands of versions or perspectives without becoming overloaded with data, and the most common operations on variant text, e.g. comparison between two versions, can be performed in linear time. This representation also separates variation or other overlapping structures from the document content, leading to a simplification of markup suitable for wiki-like web applications.},

In the initial stage ERP users usually lack the complete will to determine whether or not they use ERP, but their continuance intentions are not always mandatory. Thus, understanding the relationship between individual differences and continuance intention helps design an effective training program, which in turn improves the effectiveness of ERP usage. Grounded on expectation-confirmation theory (ECT), this study examined the influences of dynamic and stable individual differences on satisfaction and continuance, respectively. Dynamic individual differences include both general computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety, and personal innovativeness in information technology (IT) refers to a stable, situation-specific traits. In addition to individual differences, we also assessed the moderating effect of ERP experience. A cross-sectional survey method was used to collect data. A total of 305 useful responses were analyzed by using partial least squares (PLS). We found that all the individual differences affect continuance intention either directly or indirectly (through satisfaction). Individuals' prior experience of ERP moderates five of the relationships between individual differences and continuance intention. We also provide implications for both managers and researchers.},

In our previous study, we demonstrated the effectiveness of using operator's eye movement information to understand attention allocation, which has made attention observable. The present paper describes our study which addressed immeasurability and uncertainty of attention. Specifically, we used eye fixation's duration to indicate operator's attention and developed a new computational model for the attention and its allocation using fuzzy logics clustering techniques. Along with the development of this model, we also developed an experiment to verify the effectiveness of the model. The result of the experiment shows that the model is promising.},

Previous research has shown both facilitative and prohibitive effect of adding perceptual detail to user interfaces. However, it is not clear how adding this kind of resolution might also interact with learner abilities. This study evaluated how well routes were remembered from maps that were either enhanced with actual satellite photography or presented in more traditional (low resolution) form by learners who differed in spatial ability. Results indicated that learners recalled a mapped route significantly better in the low perceptual detail condition than in the high detail condition and spatial visualization ability significantly predicted success on these tasks whereas mental rotation ability did not. Thus, it appears that the addition of perceptual detail not only affects learning, but also interacts with learner ability.},

abstract = {This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to engineering socio-technical design. The paper addresses technological design for social interactions that are non-instrumental, and thereby sometimes contradictory or surprising and difficult to model. Through cooperative analysis of cultural probe data and development of agent-oriented software engineering (AOSE) models, ethnographers and software engineers participate in conversations around shared artifacts, which facilitate the transition from data collected in a social environment to a socially oriented requirements analysis for informing socio-technical design. To demonstrate how this transition was made, we present a case study of the process of designing technology to support familial relationships, such as playing, gifting, showing, telling and creating memories. The case study is based on data collected in a cultural probes study that explores the diverse, complex and unpredictable design environment of the home. A multidisciplinary team worked together through a process of conversations around shared artifacts to cooperatively analyze collected data and develop models. These conversations provided the opportunity to view the data from the perspective of alternative disciplines that resulted in the emergence of novel understandings and innovative practice. The artifacts in the process included returned probe items, scrapbooks, videos of interviews, photographs, family biographies and the AOSE requirements models. When shared between the two communities of practice, some of these artifacts played important roles in mediating discussions of mutual influence between ethnographers and software engineers. The shared artifacts acted as both triggers for conversations and information vessels-providing a variety of interpretable objects enabling both sides to articulate their understandings in different ways and to collaboratively negotiate understandings of the collected data. Analyzing the interdisciplinary exchange provided insight into the identification of bridging elements that allowed 'the social' to permeate the processes of analysis, requirements elicitation and design.},

abstract = {This paper examines what can be learned about bodies of literature using a concept mapping tool, Leximancer. Statistical content analysis and concept mapping were used to analyse bodies of literature from different domains in three case studies. In the first case study, concept maps were generated and analysed for two closely related document sets-a thesis on language games and the background literature for the thesis. The aim for the case study was to show how concept maps might be used to analyse related document collections for coverage. The two maps overlapped on the concept of ''language''; however, there was a stronger focus in the thesis on ''simulations'' and ''agents.'' Other concepts were not as strong in the thesis map as expected. The study showed how concept maps can help to establish the coverage of the background literature in a thesis. In the second case study, three sets of documents from the domain of conceptual and spatial navigation were collected, each discussing a separate topic: navigational strategies, the brain's role in navigation, and concept mapping. The aim was to explore emergent patterns in a set of related concept maps that may not be apparent from reading the literature alone. Separate concept maps were generated for each topic and also for the combined set of literature. It was expected that each of the topics would be situated in different parts of the combined map, with the concept of ''navigation'' central to the map. Instead, the concept of ''spatial'' was centrally situated and the areas of the map for the brain and for navigational strategies overlaid the same region. The unexpected structure provided a new perspective on the coverage of the documents. In the third and final case study, a set of documents on sponges-a domain unfamiliar to the reader-was collected from the Internet and then analysed with a concept map. The aim of this case study was to present how a concept map could aid in quickly understanding a new, technically intensive domain. Using the concept map to identify significant concepts and the Internet to look for their definitions, a basic understanding of key terms in the domain was obtained relatively quickly. It was concluded that using concept maps is effective for identifying trends within documents and document collections, for performing differential analysis on documents, and as an aid for rapidly gaining an understanding in a new domain by exploring the local detail within the global scope of the textual corpus.},

Thirty-six dyads, working under low or high time-pressure conditions, needed to combine information and to produce a written plan. Teams working in the sophisticated communication environment collaborated from separate locations over a networked computer system allowing them to share a note-taking program, work in parallel, and exchange in real-time audio as well as video. Results revealed detrimental effects of time pressure on both team processes and outcomes, and supported our hypothesis that distributed teams can perform as well as FtF teams. No differences were found between FtF teams and teams working in the sophisticated communication environment on process and outcome measures, except for the quantity of performance: The sophisticated communication environment enabled distributed teams to work on the task more rapidly than their FtF counterparts. Radio teams produced plans of lower quality and were less satisfied with the quality of their planning process than FtF teams.},

A set of corresponding movement schemas in Labanotation was constructed to visually represent the spatial and social interaction of multiple users over time. Together these three design representations of moving bodies were used to enable the design team to work with the aspects of human movement relevant to Bystander and to ensure that the system could respond in a coherent and robust manner to the shifting configurations of visitors in the space. They also supported two experiential methods of design reflection-in-action-enactment and immersion-that were vital for grounding designers' understandings of the specific interactive nature of the work in their own sensing, feeling and moving bodies.},

abstract = {Users who visit a web page for the first time select links on the basis of the link anchors and the descriptions of the links that are provided on the page. If these descriptions give an inaccurate impression of the underlying pages, users make incorrect choices. In this paper we present a novel algorithm to automatically detect links with problematic descriptions in hierarchical menus on the basis of usage information stored in the sites' log files. The algorithm searches the log files for navigation patterns that show that many users make navigation mistakes at certain points in the site. Repeated mistakes indicate that users do not understand the intentions of a link description. The algorithm distinguishes several types of problematic descriptions and provides recommendations for how problematic descriptions of each type can be improved. The findings of the algorithm can help a webmaster of a site to gain insights in the behavior of the sites' users and to improve the site's menu accordingly. Evaluation in three domains shows that webmasters perceive the analyses made by the algorithm as very helpful for improving sites. Moreover, a user experiment demonstrates that the adaptations made by the webmasters on the basis of the analyses, significantly reduce the number of navigation mistakes.},

However, it has never been examined how different field times as implemented through different deadlines for participation influence response behavior. Four experiments were conducted in which the deadline for taking part in the study was varied across several days, and there was a control group who was not told any deadline. We examined the impact of both stating a deadline versus not stating a deadline and the length of the deadline on the response rate, the retention rate, and response completeness. It was found that response rises with the number of days a study is in the field. There is tentative evidence that the more generous the deadline, the smaller the retention rate and clear evidence that response completeness is lower. Moreover, in a quasi-experimental fashion it was explored whether responding late to a study request is associated with being retained until the end of the study and with the completeness of filling out the questionnaire. There is no straightforward association between responding late to a study request on the one hand and retention and response completeness on the other hand.},

We have used the method in two distinct eScience contexts, and may offer an effective, low cost way to deal with bridging between software design teams and scientists to develop useful and usable eScience artifacts. To that end, we propose a set of criteria in order to understand why MT works. Through these criteria we also reflect upon the relation of MT to other design elicitation methods in order to propose a kind of method framework from which other designers may be assisted in choosing elicitation methods and in developing new methods both for eScience contexts and beyond.},

abstract = {e-Science projects face a difficult challenge in providing access to valuable computational resources, data and software to large communities of distributed users. On the one hand, the raison d'etre of the projects is to encourage members of their research communities to use the resources provided. On the other hand, the threats to these resources from online attacks require robust and effective security to mitigate the risks faced. This raises two issues: ensuring that (1) the security mechanisms put in place are usable by the different users of the system, and (2) the security of the overall system satisfies the security needs of all its different stakeholders. A failure to address either of these issues can seriously jeopardise the success of e-Science projects. The aim of this paper is to firstly provide a detailed understanding of how these challenges can present themselves in practice in the development of e-Science applications. Secondly, this paper examines the steps that projects can undertake to ensure that security requirements are correctly identified, and security measures are usable by the intended research community. The research presented in this paper is based on four case studies of e-Science projects. Security design traditionally uses expert analysis of risks to the technology and deploys appropriate countermeasures to deal with them. However, these case studies highlight the importance of involving all stakeholders in the process of identifying security needs and designing secure and usable systems. For each case study, transcripts of the security analysis and design sessions were analysed to gain insight into the issues and factors that surround the design of usable security. The analysis concludes with a model explaining the relationships between the most important factors identified. This includes a detailed examination of the roles of responsibility, motivation and communication of stakeholders in the ongoing process of designing usable secure socio-technical systems such as e-Science.},

The main idea behind HEMP is to provide haptic-like sensations by dynamically displacing the visual representation of the user's hand. This paper studies the possible application of HEMP to the simulation of force fields (FFs). The proposed hardware solution for simulating the hand displacement is based on an augmented reality configuration, the video see-through head-mounted display. A response model is proposed for controlling the hand displacement. This model adapts to the user's hand movements. It also accounts for a number of perceptual and system constraints. An experiment has been carried out to investigate the potential of the proposed technique. Subjects had to perform an FF strength comparison task and to fill in an illusion evaluation questionnaire. Comparison response results show that different FF strength levels are discriminable and the questionnaire indicates that subjects perceive flow pressure-like sensations. The analysis of arm muscular activity seems to confirm these results.},

abstract = {Wayfinding, the ability to recall the environment and navigate through it, is an essential cognitive skill relied upon almost every day in a person's life. A crucial component of wayfinding is the construction of cognitive maps, mental representations of the environments through which a person travels. Age, disease or injury can severely affect cognitive mapping, making assessment of this basic survival skill particularly important to clinicians and therapists. Cognitive mapping has also been the focus of decades of basic research by cognitive psychologists. Both communities have evolved a number of techniques for assessing cognitive mapping ability. We present the Cognitive Map Probe (CMP), a new computerized tool for assessment of cognitive mapping ability that increases consistency and promises improvements in flexibility, accessibility, sensitivity and control. The CMP uses a tangible user interface that affords spatial manipulation. We describe the design of the CMP, and find that it is sensitive to factors known to affect cognitive mapping performance in extensive experimental testing.},

abstract = {This paper presents an extended version of Navidget. Navidget is a new interaction technique for camera positioning in 3D environments. This technique derives from the point-of-interest (POI) approaches where the endpoint of a trajectory is selected for smooth camera motions. Unlike the existing POI techniques, Navidget does not attempt to automatically estimate where and how the user wants to move. Instead, it provides good feedback and control for fast and easy interactive camera positioning. Navidget can also be useful for distant inspection when used with a preview window. This new 3D user interface is totally based on 2D inputs. As a result, it is appropriate for a wide variety of visualization systems, from small handheld devices to large interactive displays. A user study on TabletPC shows that the usability of Navidget is very good for both expert and novice users. This new technique is more appropriate than the conventional 3D viewer interfaces in numerous 3D camera positioning tasks. Apart from these tasks, the Navidget approach can be useful for further purposes such as collaborative work and animation.},

abstract = {Object selection is a primary interaction technique which must be supported by any interactive three-dimensional virtual reality application. Although numerous techniques exist, few have been designed to support the selection of objects in dense target environments, or the selection of objects which are occluded from the user's viewpoint. There is, thus, a limited understanding on how these important factors will affect selection performance. In this paper, we present a set of design guidelines and strategies to aid the development of selection techniques which can compensate for environment density and target visibility. Based on these guidelines, we present new forms of the ray casting and bubble cursor selection techniques, which are augmented with visual, audio, and haptic feedback, to support selection within dense and occluded 3D target environments. We perform a series of experiments to evaluate these new techniques, varying both the environment density and target visibility. The results provide an initial understanding of how these factors affect selection performance. Furthermore, the results showed that our new techniques adequately allowed users to select targets which were not visible from their initial viewpoint. The audio and haptic feedback did not provide significant improvements, and our analysis indicated that our introduced visual feedback played the most critical role in aiding the selection task.},

In doing so we escape conventional assumptions as to how technology might support family life, and instead propose alternative forms of technology that serve as acceptable sites for highly personalised and personally significant emotional statements. Two designs are presented, Traces and Blossom, which are both responses to the lives and personal accounts of our participants, and a challenge to the conventions of interaction design. By reflecting on our designs we identify and unpick assumptions as to the nature of the digital technology with a view to opening up a design space that places an emphasis on both the individual and the authentic character of our emotional lives.},

Going beyond the evaluation of specific design concepts, this paper reports on three studies that aimed to answer the following research questions: (a) Do families want to be aware of each other through the day? Or, would they perhaps rather not know more about each other's activities and whereabouts than they already do? (b) If they do wish to have some awareness, what should they be aware of? The research involved in-depth interviews with 20 participants, a field trial of an awareness system connecting five ''busy'' parents with their children and a survey of 69 participants conducted over the web. Triangulation of the results of the three studies leads to the following conclusions: (a) Some busy parents want to automatically exchange awareness information during the day while others do not. (b) Availability of partner for coordinating family activities, daily activities in new family situations, activity, and location information of dependent children are salient awareness information needs for this group. (c) Awareness information needs to vary with contexts, suggesting the need for flexible mechanisms to manage the sharing of such information.},

abstract = {Divorce affects a significant number of children and parents worldwide. We interviewed 10 parents and five children to get a qualitative understanding of the challenges faced by these families and the role of technology in maintaining contact. We found that both parents had a strong need to maintain autonomy in raising the child, though the residential parent had more opportunities to be instrumentally involved. Both parents and children sought to manage tensions between the two households-parents by reducing interruption of the other household, children by trying to keep contact with the other parent as private as possible. Our participants used the telephone as the primary means to stay in touch while apart but expressed dissatisfaction with the limits of audio-only communication. It was difficult to keep a phone conversation engaging-both parents and children instead sought ways to maintain contact through shared activities and routines but found little technological support to do so while separated. Situated in these results, we present implications for design that may aid in creating technologies for communication between parents and young children in divorced families.},

This is achieved through two critical reviews of a small number of social studies related to the design and use of existing and emerging communication technologies. The first review explores how existing, recent and emerging technologies are adopted within the domestic home and explores how social patterns dictate adoption. The second review draws more broadly on research activity related to the design and development of ubiquitous technologies for everyday life and what lessons can be learnt from them. Together, these two reviews suggest novel communication technology adoption will evolve through small imperceptible steps from the edges of existing products and services; therefore design research needs to be more aligned to this approach. To make any real impact and influence, research activity needs to move away from attempts to deliver ubiquity in the home and place more emphasis at the pragmatic, incremental level of emerging communication services and products.},

Through making aspects of audio messages visible, BubbleBoard offered a number of improvements over existing answer machines. However, the new affordances associated with this were not appropriated by family members in the ways we had expected.

The current study extends previous research by presenting test users with a context (mode of use) in which to make their judgements, using sets of web pages from specific domains rather than unrelated pages, studying the congruence of perceptions of aesthetic value over time, including judgements after use of a web site, manipulating the aesthetic design of web pages and studying the relationship between usability and aesthetic value. The results from two experiments demonstrate that context increases the stability of judgements from perceptions after brief exposure to those after self-paced exposure and from perceptions after self-paced exposure to those of after site use. Experiment 1 shows that relatively attractive pages are preferred over relatively unattractive pages after brief exposure, but only if no context is provided. Experiment 2 shows that after brief exposure, classically aesthetic pages that are information oriented are rated as more attractive than expressively aesthetic pages. Perceptions are not correlated with measures of task performance or mental effort. We conclude that context is a pivotal factor influencing the stability of users' perceptions, which must be explicitly addressed in the study of users' product experience. Furthermore, the type of aesthetics that is relevant to users' perceptions appears to depend on the application domain. The principle 'what is beautiful is usable' is not confirmed.},

Yet it is hard to imagine a domain of human-computer interaction where usability has more impact on how democracy works. This article reports a laboratory investigation of the usability of six electronic voting systems chosen to represent the features of systems in current use and potentially in future use. The primary question was whether e-voting systems are sufficiently hard to use that voting accuracy and satisfaction are compromised. We observed that voters often seemed quite lost taking far more than the required number of actions to cast individual votes, especially when they ultimately voted inaccurately. Their satisfaction went down as their effort went up. And accuracy with some systems was disturbingly low. While many of these problems are easy to fix, manufacturers will need to adopt usability engineering practices that have vastly improved user interfaces throughout the software industry.},

We describe designs that can be reused to create intelligent agents capable of explaining themselves. The designs include ways to provide ontological, mechanistic, and operational explanations. These designs inscribe lessons learned from prior research and provide guidance for incorporating explanation facilities into intelligent systems. The designs are derived from both prior research on explanation tool design and from the empirical study reported here on the questions users ask when working with an intelligent system. We demonstrate the use of these designs through examples implemented using the Herbal high-level cognitive modeling language. These designs can help build better agents-they support creating more usable and more affordable intelligent agents by encapsulating prior knowledge about how to generate explanations in concise representations that can be instantiated or adapted by agent developers.},

abstract = {We study the decision to learn a new use of technology within a post-adoption context. This particular nuance of technology adoption is interesting because while the technology has been adopted at some level by both users and organizations, expanding technology use relies on users adopting additional tools and features within a given system on their own accord. This study addresses how situational goal orientation moderates the effects of ease of learning perceptions within the post-adoption context. We find that when a potential user has a situational learning goal orientation, they indicate intent to learn a new use of technology regardless of whether the technology is perceived to be easy or difficult to learn. However, potential users with a situational performance goal orientation indicate intent to learn the new system feature depending on ease of learning. These results have implications for future research using traditional technology acceptance parameters in the post-adoption context, and provide evidence that situational goal orientation is an effective managerial intervention for use in organizational training.},

abstract = {The present study has surveyed physician views and attitudes before and after the introduction of speech technology as a front end to an electronic medical record. At the hospital where the survey was made, speech technology recently (2006-2007) replaced traditional dictation and subsequent secretarial transcription for all physicians in clinical departments. The aim of the survey was (i) to identify how attitudes and perceptions among physicians affected the acceptance and success of the speech-recognition system and the new work procedures associated with it; and (ii) to assess the degree to which physicians' attitudes and expectations to the use of speech technology changed after actually using it. The survey was based on two questionnaires-one administered when the physicians were about to begin training with the speech-recognition system and another, asking similar questions, when they had had some experience with the system. The survey data were supplemented with performance data from the speech-recognition system. The results show that the surveyed physicians tended to report a more negative view of the system after having used it for some months than before. When judging the system retrospectively, physicians are approximately evenly divided between those who think it was a good idea to introduce speech recognition (33%), those who think it was not (31%) and those who are neutral (36%). In particular, the physicians felt that they spent much more time producing medical records than before, including time correcting the speech recognition, and that the overall quality of records had declined. Nevertheless, workflow improvements and the possibility to access the records immediately after dictation were almost unanimously appreciated. Physicians' affinity with the system seems to be quite dependent on their perception of the associated new work procedures.},

abstract = {Our everyday lives and specially our commercial transactions involve complex negotiations that incorporate decision-making in a multi-issue setting under utility constraints. Negotiation as a key stage in all commercial transactions has been proliferated by applying decision support facilities that AI techniques provide. Recently, Distributed Artificial Intelligence techniques have been evolved towards multi-agent systems (MASs) where each agent is an intelligent system that solves a specific problem. Incorporating MAS into e-commerce negotiation and bargaining has brought even more potential improvement in efficiency and effectiveness of business systems by automating several of the most time consuming and repetitive stages of the buying process. In bargaining, participants with opposing interests communicate and try to find mutually beneficial agreements by exchanging compromising proposals. However, recent studies on commercial bargaining and negotiation in MASs lack a personality model. Indeed, adding personality to intelligent agents makes them more human-like and increases their flexibility. We investigate the role of personality behaviors of participants in multi-criteria bilateral bargaining in a single-good e-marketplace, where both parties are OCEAN agents based on the five-factor (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Negative emotions) model of personality. We do not aim to determine strategies that humans should use in negotiation, but to present a more human-like model to enhance the realism of rational bargaining behavior in MASs. First, this study presents a computational approach based on a heuristic bargaining protocol and a personality model, and second, considers the issue of what personality traits and behaviors should be investigated in relation to automated negotiations. We show the results obtained via the simulation on artificial stereotypes. The results suggest and model compound personality style behaviors appropriate to gain the best overall utility in the role of buyer and seller agents and with regard to social welfare and market activeness. This personality-based approach can be used as a predictive or descriptive model of human behavior to adopt in appropriate situations in many areas involving negotiation and bargaining (e.g., commerce, business, politics, military, etc.) for conflict prevention and resolution. This model can be applied as a testbed for comparing personality models against each other based on human data in different negotiation domains.},

Assistive technology, in the form of navigation devices, are being developed that can support community navigation by delivering directional information. Selecting an effective mode to provide route-prompts is a critical design issue. This study evaluated the differential effects on pedestrian route following using different modes of prompting delivered via an electronic device for travelers with severe cognitive impairments. The research design used was a within subject comparison to evaluate potential differences in route-following performance when travelers received directions using four different prompt modes: (1) aerial map image, (2) point of view map image, (3) audio direction/no image and (4) text-based instructions/no image. Twenty travelers with severe cognitive impairments due to acquired brain injury walked four equivalent routes using four different prompting modes delivered via a wrist-worn navigation device. Navigation scores were computed that captured accuracy and confidence during navigation. Results of the repeated measures analysis of variance suggested that participants performed best when given prompts via speech-based audio directions. The majority of the participants also preferred this prompting mode. Findings are interpreted in the context of cognitive resource allocation theory.},

Although existing literature shows that adolescents use mobile phone e-mail to bond with intimate strong ties, the fluid nature of social networks during adolescence suggests that mobile phone e-mail may also be used to bridge to new ties and to break with old ties. Drawing on a stratified random sample survey of 501 high school students living in Tokyo, we find that mobile phone e-mail is used both to bond and bridge, but not to break with ties. We also find that the intensity with which Japanese adolescents use mobile phone e-mail is more fundamentally a result of bridging than bonding. These findings apply both to typical users and heavy users.},

abstract = {The past two decades have presented significant technological developments of mobile information and communication technology (ICT) such as portable technologies (e.g. mobile phones, notebook computers, personal digital assistants), and associated wireless infrastructures (e.g. wireless local area networks, mobile telecommunications infrastructures, bluetooth personal area networks). Mobile ICT offers a range of technical opportunities for organisations and their members to implement enterprise mobility. However, the challenges of unlocking the opportunities of enterprise mobility are not well understood. One of the key issues is to establish systems and associated working practices that are deemed usable by both individuals and the organisation. The aim of this paper is to show that the concept of organisational usability can enrich the understanding of mobile ICT in organisations. As an addition to the traditional understanding of individual usability, organisational usability emphasises the role of mobile ICT beyond individual support. A large-scale study of four different ways of organising foreign exchange trading in a Middle Eastern bank serves as the concrete foundation for the discussion. The empirical study showed how the final of the four attempts at establishing 24-h trading deployed mobile ICT to enable mobile trading and by providing a solution, which was deemed usable for both the organisation and the traders. The paper contributes to the understanding of how usability of mobile ICT critically depends on carefully balancing individual and organisational requirements. It also demonstrates the need for research in enterprise mobility to embrace both individual and organisational concerns in order to grasp the complexity of the phenomena.},

Thus, the current study focuses on how mobile work is conducted onboard trains, as a way of exploring general issues relating to mobility. Through survey and interview data, several constraints to mobile work on the train were revealed. These include the lack of reliable communications network, access to co-workers and lack of privacy which together restrict the types of communicative tasks people carry out. We found that the majority of tasks conducted were socially independent in nature (without the need for communication with others). However, people made some technological task and contextual adaptations which allowed them to work around these limitations to conduct some socially interdependent work (with the need for communication with others). We explain why and how specific technologies/media are used (and adapted) in this setting and explore the implications this has for technology design and our thinking about mobile work.},

Fitts' law models are created and serve as a basis for comparisons. The second study examines the orientation of shapes on the front and back of a mobile device. It shows that participants' expectations of visual feedback for finger movements on the back of a device reverse the direction of their finger movements to favor a ''transparent device'' orientation. The third study examines letter-like gestures made on the front and back of a device. It confirms the performance of the index finger on the front of the device, while showing limitations in the ability for the index finger on the back to perform complex gestures. Taken together, these results provide an empirical foundation upon which new mobile interaction designs can be based.

abstract = {One of the most challenging aspects of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) research is automation of collaboration and interaction analysis in order to understand and improve the learning processes. It is particularly necessary to look in more depth at the joint analysis of the collaborative process and its resulting product. In this article, we present a framework for comprehensive analysis in CSCL synchronous environments supporting a problem-solving approach to learning. This framework is based on an observation-abstraction-intervention analysis life-cycle and consists of a suite of analysis indicators, procedures for calculating indicators and a model of intervention based on indicators. Analysis indicators are used to represent the collaboration and knowledge building process at different levels of abstraction, and to characterize the solution built using models of the application domain, the problems to solve and their solutions. The analysis procedures combine analysis of actions and dialogue with analysis of the solution. In this way, the process and the solution are studied independently as well as together, enabling the detection of correlations between them. In order to exemplify and test the framework, the methodological process underlying the framework was followed to guide the implementation of the analysis subsystems of two existing CSCL environments. In addition, a number of studies have been conducted to evaluate the framework's approach, demonstrating that certain modes of collaborating and working imply particular types of solutions and vice versa.},

abstract = {This experiment extended the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm by examining how output modality (text plus cartoon character vs. synthetic speech), computer gender (male vs. female), and user gender (male vs. female) moderate the ways in which people respond to computers that flatter. Specifically, participants played a trivia game with a computer, which they knew might provide incorrect answers. Participants in the generic-comment condition received strictly factual feedback, whereas those in the flattery condition were given additional remarks praising their performance. Consistent with Fogg and Nass [1997. Silicon sycophants: the effects of computers that flatter. International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 46, 551-561] study, flattery led to more positive overall impressions and performance evaluations of the computer, but such effects were found only in the text plus character condition and among women. In addition, flattery increased participants' suspicion about the validity of the computer's feedback and lowered conformity to the computer's suggestions. Participants conformed more to the male than female computers when computer gender was manifested in gendered cartoon characters in the text condition, with no corresponding effects in the speech condition. Results suggest that synthetic speech output might suppress social responses to computers, such as flattery effects and gender stereotyping.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the design, implementation and evaluation of SOBA, a system for ontology-based information extraction from heterogeneous data resources, including plain text, tables and image captions. SOBA is capable of processing structured information, text and image captions to extract information and integrate it into a coherent knowledge base. To establish coherence, SOBA interlinks the information extracted from different sources and detects duplicate information. The knowledge base produced by SOBA can then be used to query for information contained in the different sources in an integrated and seamless manner. Overall, this allows for advanced retrieval functionality by which questions can be answered precisely. A further distinguishing feature of the SOBA system is that it straightforwardly integrates deep and shallow natural language processing to increase robustness and accuracy. We discuss the implementation and application of the SOBA system within the SmartWeb multimodal dialog system. In addition, we present a thorough evaluation of the different components of the system. However, an end-to-end evaluation of the whole SmartWeb system is out of the scope of this paper and has been presented elsewhere by the SmartWeb consortium.},

abstract = {This paper is an extension of previous work on capturing and modeling the affective state of entertainment (''fun'') grounded on children's physiological state during physical game play. The goal is to construct, using representative statistics computed from children's physiological signals, an estimator of the degree to which games provided by the playground engage the players. Previous studies have identified the difficulties of isolating elements of physical activity attributed to reported entertainment derived (solely) from heart rate (HR) recordings. In the present article, a survey experiment on a larger scale and a physical activity control experiment for surmounting those difficulties are devised. In these experiments, children's HR, blood volume pulse (BVP) and skin conductance (SC) signals, as well as their expressed preferences of how much ''fun'' particular game variants are, are obtained using games implemented on the Playware physical interactive playground. Given effective data collection, a set of numerical features is computed from these measurements of the child's physiological state. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that children's reported entertainment preferences correlate well with specific features of the recorded signals. Preference learning techniques combined with feature set selection methods permit the construction of user models that predict reported entertainment preferences given suitable signal features. The most accurate models are obtained through evolving artificial neural networks and are demonstrated and evaluated on a Playware game and a control task requiring physical activity. The best network is able to correctly match expressed preferences in 69.64% of cases on previously unseen data (p-value=0.0022) and indicates two dissimilar classes of children: those that prefer constantly energetic play of low mental/emotional load; and those that report as fun a dynamic play that involves high mental/emotional load independently of physical effort. The generality of the methodology, its limitations, its usability as a real-time feedback mechanism for entertainment augmentation and as a validation tool are discussed.},

We compared four interaction techniques representing combinations of these characteristics (Marking Menu, Two-handed Tool Palette, Toolglass, and Control Menu). Results suggest that the one-handed techniques selected for the present study produced a speed advantage over two-handed techniques, whereas the influence of merging was task dependent. A follow-up study examining Bimanual Marking Menu suggests that the performance of two-handed techniques may be reduced due to a split in visual attention required for certain techniques. Taken together, these findings have important implications for the design of command selection mechanisms for pen-based interfaces.},

abstract = {Traditionally, the main goal of teleoperation has been to successfully achieve a given task as if performing the task in local space. An emerging and related requirement is to also match the subjective sensation or the user experience of the remote environment, while maintaining reasonable task performance. This concept is often called ''presence'' or ''(experiential) telepresence,'' which is informally defined as ''the sense of being in a mediated environment.'' In this paper, haptic feedback is considered as an important element for providing improved presence and reasonable task performance in remote navigation. An approach for using haptic information to ''experientially'' teleoperate a mobile robot is described. Haptic feedback is computed from the range information obtained by a sonar array attached to the robot, and delivered to a user's hand via a haptic probe. This haptic feedback is provided to the user, in addition to stereoscopic images from a forward-facing stereo camera mounted on the mobile robot. The experiment with a user population in a real-world environment showed that haptic feedback significantly improved both task performance and user-felt presence. When considering user-felt presence, no interaction among haptic feedback, image resolution, and stereoscopy was observed, that is, haptic feedback was effective, regardless of the fidelity of visual elements. Stereoscopic images also significantly improved both task performance and user-felt presence, but high-resolution images only significantly improved user-felt presence. When considering task performance, however, it was found that there was an interaction between haptic feedback and stereoscopy, that is, stereoscopic images were only effective when no force feedback was applied. According to the multiple regression analysis, haptic feedback was a higher contributing factor to the improvement in performance and presence than image resolution and stereoscopy.},

abstract = {Generally, an experienced therapist continuously monitors the affective cues of the children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and adjusts the course of the intervention accordingly. In this work, we address the problem of how to make the computer-based ASD intervention tools affect-sensitive by designing therapist-like affective models of the children with ASD based on their physiological responses. Two computer-based cognitive tasks are designed to elicit the affective states of liking, anxiety, and engagement that are considered important in autism intervention. A large set of physiological indices are investigated that may correlate with the above affective states of children with ASD. In order to have reliable reference points to link the physiological data to the affective states, the subjective reports of the affective states from a therapist, a parent, and the child himself/herself were collected and analyzed. A support vector machines (SVM)-based affective model yields reliable prediction with approximately 82.9% success when using the therapist's reports. This is the first time, to our knowledge, that the affective states of children with ASD have been experimentally detected via physiology-based affect recognition technique.},

abstract = {The present study investigates automation misuse based on complacency and automation bias in interacting with a decision aid in a process control system. The effect of a preventive training intervention which includes exposing participants to rare automation failures is examined. Complacency is reflected in an inappropriate checking and monitoring of automated functions. In interaction with automated decision aids complacency might result in commission errors, i.e., following automatically generated recommendations even though they are false. Yet, empirical evidence proving this kind of relationship is still lacking. A laboratory experiment (N=24) was conducted using a process control simulation. An automated decision aid provided advice for fault diagnosis and management. Complacency was directly measured by the participants' information sampling behavior, i.e., the amount of information sampled in order to verify the automated recommendations. Possible commission errors were assessed when the aid provided false recommendations. The results provide clear evidence for complacency, reflected in an insufficient verification of the automation, while commission errors were associated with high levels of complacency. Hence, commission errors seem to be a possible, albeit not an inevitable consequence of complacency. Furthermore, exposing operators to automation failures during training significantly decreased complacency and thus represents a suitable means to reduce this risk, even though it might not avoid it completely. Potential applications of this research include the design of training protocols in order to prevent automation misuse in interaction with automated decision aids.},

The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants' eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high.},

In Experiment 1 the seating arrangement was manipulated so that the two audience members sat either behind or around the photographer. It was hypothesised that the former would lower levels of peripheral awareness within the groups, resulting in a more formal conversation and a poorer recreational experience. In Experiment 2, control over the photographs was manipulated so that either all three group members had access to a remote control (distributed control), or only the photographer did (single control). It was hypothesised that distributed control would result in less formal conversations and a better recreational experience. In both experiments, the hypotheses were supported: patterns of social interaction were significantly affected by the manipulation of awareness during storytelling, and by the manipulation of control during reminiscing. Additionally, the two manipulations were found to affect ratings of enjoyment and fun, respectively. The results are interpreted in terms of a causative model of unfolding and recounted experience.},

Ten adolescents diagnosed with autism used this software during 13 sessions, at the rate of one session per week. The first and last sessions were dedicated for evaluating participants' skills. The experiment was also performed by a group of 10 typically developing children matched on developmental age and academic level. Results show that participants with autism had poorer performances on the richer multimedia interfaces. They seemed to lack the initiative of organizing the available multimodal sources of information.

abstract = {Maps are currently the most common application domain for zoomable user interfaces (ZUIs). Standard techniques for controlling such interfaces on pen-operated devices usually rely on sequential interaction, i.e. the users can either zoom or pan. A more advanced technique is speed-dependent automatic zooming (SDAZ), which combines rate-based panning and zooming into a single operation and thus enables concurrent interaction. Yet another navigation strategy is to allow for concurrent, but separate, zooming and panning. However, due to the limitations of stylus input, this feature requires the pen-operated device to be enhanced with additional input dimensions. We propose one unimanual approach based on pen pressure, and one bimanual approach in which users pan the view with the pen while manipulating the scale by tilting the device. In total, we developed four interfaces (standard, SDAZ, pressure, and tilting) and compared them in a usability study with 32 participants. The results show that SDAZ performed well for both simple speed tasks and more complex navigation scenarios, but that the coupled interaction led to much user frustration. In a preference vote, the participants strongly rejected the interface and stated that they found it difficult and irksome to control. This result enhances previous research, which in most cases found a high user preference for SDAZ, but focused solely on simple speed tasks. In contrast, the pressure and tilt interfaces were much appreciated, which, considering the novelty of these approaches, is highly encouraging. However, in solving the test tasks the participants took hardly any advantage of parallel interaction. For a map view of 600x600 pixels, this resulted in task-completion times comparable to those for the standard interface. For a smaller 300x300 pixels view, the standard interface was actually significantly faster than the two novel techniques. This ratio is also reflected in the preference votes. While for the larger 600x600 pixels view the tilt interface was the most popular, the standard interface was rated highest for the 300x300 pixels view. Hence, on a smaller display, precise interaction may have an increased impact on the interface usability. Overall, we believe that the alternative interaction techniques show great potential for further development. In particular, a redesign should encourage parallel interaction more strongly and also provide improved support for precise navigation.},

Interviews were conducted in order to identify the daily activities of people living at home that might most usefully be supported. In Study 1, nine interviews and one focus group were conducted with occupational therapists and other professional caregivers. In Study 2, interviews were conducted with eight people with mild to moderate dementia in their own homes and 10 informal caregivers. A grounded theory analysis of the transcripts revealed specific areas where support was needed and suggestions concerning the kinds of prompting and sensing required to support: dressing, taking medication, personal hygiene, preparing food, and socialising. The findings demonstrate the value of consulting directly with people with dementia and their caregivers. The design challenge is to provide flexible prompting systems that are sensitive to the intentions, capabilities, and values of their users.},

Software development is an intensive cognitive task, which also constitutes an exercise in complex interrelationships. This paper presents a case study conducted to analyse ad hoc collaborative activities taking place between team-mates during an industrial software development cycle. Observations based on audio-video recording are analysed with a methodology from social sciences research. The paper describes the observational approaches, the various methods used to validate data and how quantitative data are extracted from the qualitative observations of team-mates. Patterns of ad hoc collaboration emerging from this study are revealed, which lead us to believe that both the implicit and explicit roles of partners have a definitive impact on their ad hoc interaction profiles. As a result, this study helps to provide an understanding of some of the pivotal aspects of software engineering, such as collaboration, coordination and, more generally, work team dynamics. Further details relating to our initial motivations are included, followed by a comprehensive description of the methodological approach designed specifically for this research. Finally, some results are presented, which shed light on a real ad hoc collaboration network and support the importance of the human and social aspects of software engineering in a more substantial way.},

abstract = {The opportunity for users to participate in design and development processes has expanded in recent years through such communication and information technologies as mailing lists, bug trackers, usage monitoring, rich interactions between users and service-center staff, remote usability testing, and so on. A key question, therefore, is deciding how to engage users in design and development through such technologies. This paper addresses this question by reviewing literature on end-user programming and open source development to develop a framework concerning user roles and discourse. The framework makes two claims: (1) user roles and a social structure emerge after the introduction of a software application (role differentiation); and (2) different roles demand different kinds of discourse for deciding what to do and for reflecting upon intended and unintended consequences (role discourse demands). To show its application, the framework is used to analyze the development of del.icio.us, a breakthrough application for social bookmarking. This development process is notable because it is a characteristic of open source software development in some respects, but the code is not made available publicly. This hybridization appears to be widely applicable and suggests how design and development processes can be structured as a service where the design and development of the system proceeds simultaneously with the formation and nurturing of a community of users.},

Focusing on the Python community, our study examines a ''pushed-by-users'' design proposal through the discussions occurring in two mailing-lists: one, user-oriented and the other, developer-oriented. To characterize the links between users and developers, we investigate the activities and references (knowledge sharing) performed by the contributors to these two mailing-lists. We found that the participation of users remains local to their community. However, several key participants act as boundary spanners between the user and the developer communities. This emerging role is characterized by cross-participation in parallel same-topic discussions in both mailing-lists, cohesion between cross-participants, the occupation of a central position in the social network linking users and developers, as well as active, distinctive and adapted contributions. The user championing the proposal acts as a key boundary spanner coordinating the process and using explicit linking strategies. We argue that OSS design may be considered as a form of ''role emerging design'', i.e. design organized and pushed through emerging roles and through a balance between these roles. The OSS communities seem to provide a suitable socio-technical environment to enable such role emergence.},

Story cards capture and embody the user stories which form the basis of implementation, while the Wall is a physical space used to organise and display the cards being implemented during the current development cycle (called an iteration). In this paper, we analyse the structure and use of story cards and the Wall in three mature XP teams, using a distributed cognition approach. The teams work in different commercial organisations developing different systems, yet we find significant similarities between their use of these two artefacts. Although simple, teams use the cards and the Wall in sophisticated ways to represent and communicate information that is vital to support their activities. We discuss the significance of the physical medium for the story cards and the Wall in an XP team and discuss the considerations that need to be taken into account for the design of technology to support the teams.},

One drawback of pair programming is its collocation requirement, which limits its use to situations where the partners can physically meet. A tool that supported distributed pair programming, in which the partners could pair from separate locations, would remove this impediment. This paper discusses the development and empirical evaluation of such a tool. A significant feature of this tool is the presence of a second cursor that supports gesturing. Students who used the tool in their introductory programming course performed as well as collocated students on their programming assignments and final exam. These students also spent less time working by themselves. They also felt that the gesturing feature was useful and used it regularly.},

The central question that this paper addresses is what policies should be enacted for structuring software teams to enhance cooperative as opposed to self-serving behavior? The contribution of this paper is in viewing software teams as being subject to a set of well-understood collective action problems: there are individual incentives to receive the joint rewards for a team-developed software project without contributing a fair share to its development. In this paper, an institutional analysis perspective is used in presenting a set of theoretical principles and an analytical framework recently developed in game theory, political economy, experimental economics, and natural resource governance for the understanding and resolution of these collective action problems. The principles and analysis framework are applied to an empirical case study of software teamwork within an academic setting. This case study shows, first, how to apply the analytic framework on an actual collective action situation. Second, it demonstrates how the theoretical understandings can be used as a basis to account for outcomes within this setting. And third, it provides an example of a particular institutional arrangement that elicits high levels of cooperation and low levels of free riding within a real-world setting. Understanding the importance of institutions for shaping individual and social behavior within software development teams makes these institutions more amenable to intentional human design.},

Relatively recently the potential benefits of collaborative software development have been formalised in the practice of pair programming. Here we attempt to 'unpick' the pair programming process through the analysis of verbalisations from a number of commercial studies. We focus particularly on the roles of the two programmers and what their key characteristics and behaviours might be. In particular, we dispute two existing claims: (i) that the programmer who is not currently typing in code (''the navigator'') is constantly reviewing what is typed and highlighting any errors (i.e. acting as a reviewer) and (ii) that the navigator focuses on a different level of abstraction as a way of ensuring coverage at all necessary levels (i.e. acting as a foreman). We provide an alternative model for these roles (''the tag team'') in which the driver and navigator play much more equal roles. We also suggest that a key factor in the success of pair programming may be the associated increase in talk at an intermediate level of abstraction.},

However, an offence may also be unintentional or exceptional, performed by a benevolent member of the community. This article examines whether a victim's decrease in trust towards an unintentional or occasional offender can be repaired in an online setting, by designing and evaluating systems to support forgiveness. We study which of three systems enable the victim of a trust breakdown to fairly assess this kind of offender. The three systems are: (1) a reputation system, (2) a reputation system with a built-in apology forum that may display the offender's apology to the victim and (3) a reputation system with a built-in apology forum that also includes a ''forgiveness'' component. The ''forgiveness'' component presents the victim with information that demonstrates the offender's trustworthiness as judged by the system. We experimentally observe that systems (2) and (3), endorsing apology and supporting forgiveness, allow victims to recover their trust after online offences. An apology from the offender restores the victim's trust only if the offender cooperates in a future interaction; it does not alleviate the trust breakdown immediately after it occurs. By contrast, the ''forgiveness'' component restores the victim's trust directly after the offence and in a subsequent interaction. The applicability of these findings for extending reputation systems is discussed.},

The usability of optically simulated haptic feedback (OSHF) was tested experimentally by measuring effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction of its users in a Fitts' type target-acquisition task and comparing the results with the usability of mechanically simulated force feedback and normal feedback. Results show that OSHF outperforms mechanically simulated haptic feedback and normal feedback, especially in the case of small targets.},

Our analysis of age-related differences included differences in background knowledge as an important independent factor. The results revealed that differences in age meaningfully affected the observed error frequency, the number of interaction steps, the rigidity of exploration, the success of physical operation methods, and subjective perception of temporal demand and performance. In contrast, trial-and-error behavior and frustration levels were influenced by background knowledge rather than age. These novel findings provide important new insights into user interaction characteristics between different age groups and may facilitate the design of age group-appropriate interfaces for complicated electronic devices.},

abstract = {Part of the challenge of designing systems to support knowledge work is to do so in a way which is sympathetic to users' uncertainty. NewsHarvester is a test-bed system designed to support news research and writing in a way that accommodates uncertainty in relation to information gathering. It does this using 'drag-and-link'; a simple feature by which text extracts copied from source locations are appended with hyperlinks to force the re-display of the source. We describe the rationale for using drag-and-link within NewHarvester based on a previous ethnographic study of journalists, describe its implementation within NewsHarvester, and report a user-evaluation which compared drag-and-link with printing and standard drag-and-drop as information gathering mechanisms. We found that users wanted to relocate information they had not previously identified as useful in order to include it in their report, to better understand the context of information already extracted, and as part of a more serendipitous search for information to add to a near-complete report. Users also considered drag-and-link an easier method for gathering information than printing, and considered that drag-and-link made it easier to relocate information. They also considered that drag-and-link promoted more flexible and dynamic working and increased user enjoyment. An assessment of the quality of their work showed a trend that favoured drag-and-link over the other two methods, although this was not statistically significant. We conclude that drag-and-link improves user-experience during research and writing tasks in the face of information gathering uncertainty.},

abstract = {There is a wealth of user-centred evaluation methods (UEMs) to support the analyst in assessing interactive systems. Many of these support detailed aspects of use-for example: is the feedback helpful? Are labels appropriate? Is the task structure optimal? Few UEMs encourage the analyst to step back and consider how well a system supports users' conceptual understandings and system utility. In this paper, we present CASSM, a method, which focuses on the quality of 'fit' between users and an interactive system. We describe the methodology of conducting a CASSM analysis and illustrate the approach with three contrasting worked examples (a robotic arm, a digital library system and a drawing tool) that demonstrate different depths of analysis. We show how CASSM can help identify re-design possibilities to improve system utility. CASSM complements established evaluation methods by focusing on conceptual structures rather than procedures. Prototype tool support for completing a CASSM analysis is provided by Cassata, an open source development.},

abstract = {Although existing models of e-learning effectiveness in information systems (IS) have increased our understanding of how technology can support and enhance learning, most of our models do not take into account the importance of social presence. Thus, this study extends previous research by developing a model of e-learning effectiveness which adds social presence to other oft studied variables including application-specific computer self-efficacy (AS-CSE), perceived usefulness, course interaction, and e-learning effectiveness. Using data from 345 individuals, this model was validated through a field study in an introductory IS survey course. Results indicate that AS-CSE and perceived usefulness were related to course performance, course satisfaction, and course instrumentality. In addition, course interaction was related to course performance and satisfaction. Finally, social presence was related to course satisfaction and course instrumentality. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

In an experiment, participants, namely five novices and five experts, made diagnoses on 13 CT images. We obtained two types of data concerning verbal protocols and manipulating computational systems. The segments related to perceptual and conceptual processing were extracted from these data, and the interrelations of the two components were analyzed. Consequently, we confirmed three salient features in the experts: (1) the experts verbalized more types of findings and more types of hypotheses than novices; (2) the experts generated several hypotheses in the early phases of the task; and (3) they newly verbalized many perceptual features during conceptual activities, and verbalized conceptual words during perceptual activities. These results suggest that expertise in medical image diagnosis involves not only the development of both perceptual and conceptual processing, but also the development of an ability to connect the two components.},

abstract = {This paper describes research exploring the use of haptics to support users collaborating remotely in a single-user shared application. Mediation of turn-taking during remote collaboration provides a context to explore haptic affordances for background communication as well as control negotiation in remote collaboration: existing turn-taking protocols are rudimentary, lacking many communication cues available in face-to-face collaboration. We therefore designed a custom turn-taking protocol that allows users to express different levels of urgency in their request for control from a collaborator; state of control and requests are communicated by touch, with the intent of offloading visual attention. To support it, we developed a set of haptic icons, tangible stimuli to which specific meanings have been assigned. Because we required an icon set which could be utilized with specified, varying levels of intrusiveness in real attentionally challenged situations, we used a perceptually guided procedure that consisted of four steps: initial icon set design, perceptual refinement, validation of learnability and effectiveness under workload, and deployment in an application simulation. We found that our haptic icons could be learned to a high degree of accuracy in under 3min and remained identifiable even under significant cognitive workload. In an exploratory observational study comparing haptic, visual, and combined haptic and visual support for our protocol, participants overall preferred the combined multi-modal support, and in particular preferred the haptic support for control changes and the visual support for displaying state. In their control negotiation, users clearly utilized the option of requesting with graded urgency. The three major contributions in this paper are: (1) the introduction and first case study using a systematic process for refining and evaluating haptic icons for background communication in a primarily visual application; (2) the usability observed for a particular set of icons designed with that process; and (3) the introduction of an urgency-based turn-taking protocol and a comparison of haptic, visual and multi-modal support of our implementation of that protocol.},

abstract = {This paper describes a user study on interaction with a mobile device installed in a driving simulator. Two new auditory interfaces were proposed and their effectiveness and efficiency were compared to a standard visual interface. Both auditory interfaces consisted of spatialized auditory cues representing individual items in the hierarchical structure of the menu. In the first auditory interface all items of the current level of the menu were played simultaneously. In the second auditory interface only one item was played at a time. The visual interface was shown on a small in-vehicle LCD screen on the dashboard. In all three cases, a custom-made interaction device (a scrolling wheel and two buttons) attached to the steering wheel was used for controlling the interface. The driving performance, task completion times, perceived workload and overall user satisfaction were evaluated. The experiment proved that both auditory interfaces were effective to use in a mobile environment, but were not faster than the visual interface. In the case of shorter tasks, e.g. changing the active profile or deleting an image, the task completion times were comparable for all interfaces; however, both the driving performance was significantly better and the perceived workload was lower when using the auditory interfaces. The test subjects also reported a high overall satisfaction with the auditory interfaces. The latter were labelled as easier to use, more satisfying and more adequate for performing the required tasks than the visual interface. The results of the survey are not surprising as there is a stronger competition for the visual attention between the visual interface and the primary task (driving the car) than in the case of using the auditory interface. So although both types of interfaces were proven to be effective, the visual interface was less efficient as it strongly distracted the user from performing the primary task.},

We built algorithms based on extracted points from the subjects' faces as well as their physiological responses. Strengths of the current approach are (1) we are assessing real behavior of subjects watching emotional videos instead of actors making facial poses, (2) the training data allow us to predict both emotion type (amusement versus sadness) as well as the intensity level of each emotion, (3) we provide a direct comparison between person-specific, gender-specific, and general models. Results demonstrated good fits for the models overall, with better performance for emotion categories than for emotion intensity, for amusement ratings than sadness ratings, for a full model using both physiological measures and facial tracking than for either cue alone, and for person-specific models than for gender-specific or general models.},

The theoretical framework of gift-giving correlates to semi-public contributions in that it envelopes social relationships, concerns for others and reciprocity, and was consequently adopted in order to reveal and classify qualitative semi-public end-user concerns with content contribution. The data collection was performed through online ethnographic methods in a large photo-sharing network. The main data-collection method used was forum message elicitation, combined with referential methods such as interviews and application observation and usage. The analysis of data resulted in descriptions concerning end-user intentions to address dynamic recipient groupings, the intentions to control the level of publicness of both digital content and its related social metadata (tags, contacts, comments and links to other networks) and the conclusion that users often refrained from providing material unless they felt able to control its direction.},

abstract = {Identifying information requirements is a well-understood activity, but the practice of converting data into visual form based on these requirements is less defined. The Ecological Interface Design (EID) framework attempts to bridge this design gap by offering a set of visual design principles. While these principles supply high-level goals to be achieved by the display, they do not describe the design process per se. EID case studies tend to report the work domain analysis, the design solution and the relationship between these two artefacts. Unfortunately, the presentation of a final solution does not reveal the rationale for decisions made during the design process. This, coupled with the complexity of the systems involved, can make it difficult to transfer design knowledge to other work domains. Here a methodology is proposed to guide the design of visual interface components that make up an ecological display. A structured approach for matching requirements to visual form based on work domain analysis, task analysis, scale matching, and data transformations is presented. A case study reveals the rationale behind the redesign of a process control health reporting system using this methodology.},

This paper documents the development of nine guidelines to construct an enhanced text user interface (ETI) as an alternative to the graphical user interface (GUI). An experimental design with 39 blind participants executing a search and a navigation task on a website showed that with the ETI, blind users executed the search task significantly faster, committing fewer mistakes, rating it significantly better on subjective scales as well as when compared to the GUIs from other websites they had visited. However, performance did not improve with the ETI on the navigation task, the main reason presumed to be labeling problems. We conclude that the ETI is an improvement over the GUI, but that it cannot help in overcoming one major weakness of most websites: If users do not understand navigation labels, even the best user interface cannot help them navigate.},

abstract = {The identification of basic emotions (anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) has been studied widely from pictures of facial expressions. Until recently, the role of dynamic information in identifying facial emotions has received little attention. There is evidence that dynamics improves the identification of basic emotions from synthetic (computer-animated) facial expressions [Wehrle, T., Kaiser, S., Schmidt, S., Scherer, K.R., 2000. Studying dynamic models of facial expression of emotion using synthetic animated faces. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 78 (1), 105-119.]; however, similar result has not been confirmed with natural human faces. We compared the identification of basic emotions from both natural and synthetic dynamic vs. static facial expressions in 54 subjects. We found no significant differences in the identification of static and dynamic expressions from natural faces. In contrast, some synthetic dynamic expressions were identified much more accurately than static ones. This effect was evident only with synthetic facial expressions whose static displays were non-distinctive. Our results show that dynamics does not improve the identification of already distinctive static facial displays. On the other hand, dynamics has an important role for identifying subtle emotional expressions, particularly from computer-animated synthetic characters.},

abstract = {Navigation designs in virtual environments often draw on research findings on human navigation behaviors in the real world, in particular the landmark-route-survey spatial knowledge model. Geographers and cognitive psychologists have argued that this model is insufficient to capture the complexity of spatial cognition related to navigation. They have suggested that new theories are needed to understand the integration of various kinds of spatial knowledge and their relationship with spatial activities, such as route planning, route choosing and so on. In virtual environments, users can scale up and down the virtual space to obtain different spatial knowledge and interaction domains. Such flexibility offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of the relationship between spatial knowledge and spatial action. This paper reports a study on how scaling in virtual environments can improve the integration of spatial knowledge and spatial action. This paper first proposes a multiscale progressive model that couples spatial knowledge and movement across scale in navigation in virtual environments. Then, the paper introduces the design of multiscale environments to support the coupling. Results of an experimental study show the benefits of the coupled spatial knowledge and movement for navigation involving subtasks at different scale levels. In addition to helping better understand the relationship between spatial knowledge and spatial action, this research also gives some insight into designs to support navigation in virtual environments as well as designs to support cross-scale spatial knowledge access in the real world.},

abstract = {Postcompletion errors, which are omissions of actions required after the completion of a task's main goal, occur in a variety of everyday procedural tasks. Previous research has demonstrated the difficulty of reducing their frequency by means other than redesigning the task structure [Byrne, M.D., Davis, E.M., 2006. Task structure and postcompletion error in the execution of a routine procedure. Human Factors 48, 627-638]. Nevertheless, finding a successful strategy for mitigation of this type of error may uncover important mechanisms underlying interactive behavior. Two experiments were carried out to test visual cues for their ability to reduce the frequency of postcompletion errors in a computer-based routine procedural task. A cue that was visually salient, just-in-time, and meaningful entirely eliminated the error, whereas cues that were not as specific were ineffective. These results are beyond the predictive capability of extant error identification methods and common design guidelines but are consistent with the work of Altmann and Trafton [2002. Memory for goals: an activation-based model. Cognitive Science 26, 39-83] and Hollnagel [1993. Human Reliability Analysis, Context and Control. Academic Press, London]. Finally, a computational model developed in ACT-R is presented as a first step towards validation of the major findings from the two experiments.},

The study was carried out on a driving simulator. Driving task performance data and responses to a trust questionnaire were analyzed in order to examine the relationship between driver reliance on ACC and such intervening variables as trust, perceived workload and perceived risk. The participants were divided a posteriori into two groups according to their use of the ACC device during the experimental run. The results show that high-use drivers seemed to cooperate more with ACC than low-use drivers, who tended to perceive more risk and a higher workload. These findings are discussed in the light of Riley's theory of operator reliance on automation.},

abstract = {Drivers need assistance when navigating an unfamiliar route. In-vehicle navigation systems have improved in recent years due to the technology advances, but are sometimes problematic because of information overload while driving. To address the attentional demands of reading a map while driving, we have developed the maps optimized for vehicular environments (MOVE) in-car navigation display, which provides situationally appropriate navigation information to the driver through optimization of map information. In this paper, we describe the iterative design and evaluation process that shaped the MOVE system. We describe early map reading and navigation studies that led to early designs for our system. We present a study on visual search tasks that refined the renditions used for the system. Finally, we present a study on the effectiveness of several variations of a contextually optimized route map visualization with a desktop steering system. The result of this study shows that MOVE's contextually optimized navigation information can reduce the driver's perceptual load significantly. Our laboratory experiment shows that the total map display fixation time was decreased six-fold, and the number of glances to interpret the map display were decreased about threefold, when comparing the contextually optimized display to a static display.},

abstract = {This work examines whether it is possible to compensate for the loss of vestibular information that is usually felt by drivers of modern cars when negotiating bends and which is associated with the load transfer of the car. Indeed, the absence of this information causes drivers to underestimate their speed and consequently increases the risk of road departure. This study tries to visually compensate for this loss of vestibular information through a tilt movement of the frame of reference of the driver. This tilt is the same as that perceived in a bend because of the load transfer of the car. The results indicate that most participants are influenced by this visual information and modify their speed accordingly whilst taking a bend. Nevertheless, only those participants uninformed about the presence of this assistance did slow down, whereas informed participants accelerated. This effect has been interpreted as a consequence of the level of processing implicated in the steering task (implicit versus explicit processing).},

abstract = {The concept of dynamically manipulating the optical looming cues of a lead vehicle's brake lights is investigated as a means of potentially reducing the frequency of rear-end collisions in automobile driving. In a low-fidelity driving simulator, 40 participants were instructed to follow a leading vehicle (LV) and appropriately respond to braking of the LV, under three visibility conditions: day, night-time with following vehicle (FV) headlights, and night-time without FV headlights. During some LV braking events, separation and size of the brake lights of the LV were expanded or contracted, by a nominally imperceptible amount, to simulate an effective virtual time shift in the headway of the LV. Results show that this manipulation was most effective for very poor visibility conditions: at night with no headlights, for which LV brake lights were most salient. When confronting a LV with expanding or contracting brake lights, subjects generally braked sooner or later respectively, in comparison with the no manipulation case. The concept shows some promise for causing drivers to brake sooner in emergencies.},

abstract = {An experimental study was conducted to determine if intersection behaviour benefited from advanced in-vehicle signs presented to older and younger drivers in a head-up display (HUD) format. The University of Calgary Driving Simulator (UCDS) was used to evaluate intersection performance. Measures of those who were able to stop or ran the yellow light, speed over the span of the intersection, perception response time, and eye movements were analyzed to determine if performance improved or whether undesirable adaptive behaviours occurred. In-vehicle signs facilitated an increase in the frequencies of stopping for both younger and older drivers at intersections with relatively short yellow onsets. The speed at the yellow light onset for both those who stopped and those who proceeded through the intersection was reduced by the presence of the in-vehicle signs. The primary behavioral influence of the in-vehicle signs was to cause the drivers' to reduce their velocity in advance of an intersection. Eye movement analyses indicated that younger drivers looked at the in-vehicles signs more often and for longer overall durations than older drivers. Older drivers had slower intersection approach speeds, stopped more accurately, and were more likely to not clear the intersection before the traffic light turned to an all-red phase than younger drivers. The implications of the in-vehicle sign results are discussed in terms of in-vehicle information systems (IVIS) design guidelines and evaluation methods.},

abstract = {Cars have changed from pure transportation devices to fully interactive, voice-based systems. While voice interaction in the car has previously required on-board processing, the growing speed and ubiquity of wireless technologies now enable interaction with a distant source. Will the perceived source of the information influence driver safety, responses to the information, and attitudes toward the computer system and car? A between-participants experimental design (N=40) of computer proximity-in-car vs. wireless-using an advanced car simulator, found that people's driving behavior, verbal responsiveness, and attitudes are affected by computer proximity. A path analysis shows two counterbalancing effects of computer proximity on driving behavior: drivers feel more engaged with the in-car system than the wireless system, which leads to safer driving behavior; however, drivers also drive faster while using the in-car system than the wireless system, which leads to more dangerous driving behavior. Consistent with greater feelings of engagement with the in-car system, people also feel less discontentment with the in-car system and self-disclose more to the in-car system. Positive perceptions of information content also lead drivers to be more persuaded by driving recommendations. Implications for the design of wireless systems are explored.},

abstract = {Web directories organize voluminous information into hierarchical structures, helping users to quickly locate relevant information and to support decision-making. The development of existing ontologies and Web directories either relies on expert participation that may not be available or uses automatic approaches that lack precision. As more users access the Web in their native languages, better approaches to organizing and developing non-English Web directories are needed. In this paper, we have proposed a semi-automatic framework, which consists of anchor directory boosting, meta-searching, and heuristic filtering, to construct domain-specific Web directories. Using the framework, we have built a Web directory in the Spanish business (SBiz) domain. Experimental results show that the SBiz Web directory achieved significantly better recall, F-value, efficiency, and satisfaction rating than the benchmark directory. Subjects provided favorable comments on the SBiz Web directory. This research thus contributes to developing a useful framework for organizing domain-specific information on the Web and to providing empirical findings and useful insights for end-users, system developers, and researchers of Web information seeking and knowledge management.},

Investigations have tended to focus on the media used to realize the pedagogical agent, e.g., the use of animated talking heads and voices, and the results have been mixed. This paper focuses instead on the manner in which a pedagogical agent communicates with learners, i.e., on the extent to which it exhibits social intelligence. A model of socially intelligent tutorial dialog was developed based on politeness theory, and implemented in an agent interface within an online learning system called virtual factory teaching system. A series of Wizard-of-Oz studies was conducted in which subjects either received polite tutorial feedback that promotes learner face and mitigates face threat, or received direct feedback that disregards learner face. The polite version yielded better learning outcomes, and the effect was amplified in learners who expressed a preference for indirect feedback, who had less computer experience, and who lacked engineering backgrounds. These results confirm the hypothesis that learners tend to respond to pedagogical agents as social actors, and suggest that research should focus less on the media in which agents are realized, and place more emphasis on the agent's social intelligence.},

In this paper, we present the results of an evaluation that compared three of these techniques to determine how they might affect performance and satisfaction of users. Two of the techniques are quite common on mobile devices: the first one (DoubleScrollbar) is the standard combination of two scrollbars for separate horizontal and vertical scrolling with zoom buttons to change the scale of the information space, the second one (Grab&amp;Drag) enables users to navigate the information space by directly dragging its currently displayed portion, while zooming is handled through a slider control. The last technique (Zoom-Enhanced Navigator or ZEN) is an extension and adaptation to mobile screens of Overview&amp;Detail approaches, which are based on displaying an overview of the information space together with a detail view of a portion of that space. In these approaches, navigation is usually supported by (i) highlighting in the overview which portion of space is displayed in the detail view, and (ii) allowing users to move the highlight within the overview area to change the corresponding portion of space in the detail area. Our experimental evaluation concerned tasks involving maps as well as web page navigation. The paper analyzes in detail the obtained results in terms of task completion times, number and duration of user interface actions, accuracy of the gained spatial knowledge, and subjective preferences.},

abstract = {Component technologies are perceived as an important means to keep software architectures flexible. Flexibility offered by component technologies typically addresses software developers at design time. However, the design of software which should support social systems, such as work groups or communities, also demands 'use-time', or technically spoken, 'run-time' flexibility. In this paper, we summarize a decade of research efforts on component-based approaches to flexibilize groupware applications at run-time. We address the user as a 'casual programmer' who develops and individualizes software for his work context. To deal with the challenges of run-time flexibility, we developed a design approach which covers three levels: software architecture, user interface, and collaboration support. With regard to the software architecture, a component model, called FlexiBeans, has been developed. The FreEvolve platform serves as an environment in which component-based applications can be tailored at run-time. Additionally, we have developed three different types of graphical user interfaces, enabling users to tailor their applications by recomposing components. To enable collaborative tailoring activities, we have integrated functions that allow sharing component structures among users. We also present different types of support techniques which are integrated into the user interface in order to enable users' individual and collaborative tailoring activities. We conclude by elaborating on the notion of 'software infrastructure' which offers a holistic approach to support design activities of professional and non-professional programmers.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the interplay between high level debugging strategies and low level tactics in the context of a multi-representation software development environment (SDE). It investigates three questions. 1. How do programmers integrate debugging strategies and tactics when working with SDEs? 2. What is the relationship between verbal ability, level of graphical literacy and debugging (task) performance. 3. How do modality and perspective influence debugging strategy and deployment of tactics? The paper extends the work of Katz and Anderson [1988. Debugging: an analysis of bug location strategies. Human-Computer Interaction 3, 359-399] and others in terms of identifying high level debugging strategies, in this case when working with SDEs. It also describes how programmers of different backgrounds and degrees of experience make differential use of the multiple sources of information typically available in a software debugging environment. Individual difference measures considered among the participants were their programming experience and their knowledge of external representation formalisms. The debugging environment enabled the participants, computer science students, to view the execution of a program in steps and provided them with concurrently displayed, adjacent, multiple and linked programming representations. These representations comprised the program code, two visualisations of the program and its output. The two visualisations of the program were available, in either a largely textual format or a largely graphical format so as to track interactions between experience and low level mode-specific tactics, for example. The results suggest that (i) additionally to deploying debugging strategies similar to those reported in the literature, participants also employed a strategy specific to SDEs, following execution, (ii) verbal ability was not correlated with debugging performance, (iii) knowledge of external representation formalisms was as important as programming experience to succeed in the debugging task, and (iv) participants with greater experience of both programming and external representation formalisms, unlike the less experienced, were able to modify their debugging strategies and tactics effectively when working under different format conditions (i.e. when working with either largely graphical or largely textual visualisations) in order to maintain their high debugging accuracy level.},

abstract = {Design involves the formulation of a solution, such as a product specification, from initial requirements. Design in industrial and other contexts often involves the building and use of models that allow the designer to test hypotheses and learn from possible design decisions prior to building the physical product. The building and testing of models is a design process in its own right. Previous work in knowledge management, design rationale and the psychology of design has demonstrated that designers often vary from prescriptive methodologies of the design process and have problems appropriately describing their design activity in order to support design collaboration and the reuse of design artefacts. Drawing on this work, we support design collaboration and reuse structured according to key transformational episodes in the design process and the design artefacts they produce. To support this, we characterise the design task as progressing through a series of worlds, each comprising its own concepts and vocabulary, and supported by its own design tools. The design process can then be described in terms of important transformations that are made from one world to the next. This allows a targeted approach to rationale capture integrated with work practice and associated with products of the design process. This approach has been successfully deployed and tested in two industrial engineering companies. Findings included improved collaboration in design teams, effective reuse and improved training for new members of the design team. This work has more general implications for the development of design rationale methods and tools to support the design process.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the results of an experimental study whose objective was twofold: (1) comparing three navigation aids that help users perform wayfinding tasks in desktop virtual environments (VEs) by pointing out the location of objects or places; (2) evaluating the effects of user experience with 3D desktop VEs on their effectiveness with the considered navigation aids. In particular, we compared navigation performance (in terms of total time to complete an informed search task) of 48 users divided into two groups: subjects in one group had experience in navigating 3D VEs while subjects in the other group did not. The experiment comprised four conditions that differed for the navigation aid that was employed. The first and the second condition, respectively, exploited 3D and 2D arrows to point towards objects that users had to reach; in the third condition, a radar metaphor was employed to show the location of objects in the VE; the fourth condition was a control condition with no location-pointing navigation aid available. The search task was performed both in a VE representing an outdoor geographic area and in an abstract VE that did not resemble any familiar environment. For each VE, users were also asked to order the four conditions according to their preference. Results show that the navigation aid based on 3D arrows outperformed (both in terms of user performance and user preference) the others, except in the case when it was used by experienced users in the geographic VE. In that case, it was as effective as the others. Finally, in the geographic VE, experienced users took significantly less time than inexperienced users to perform the informed search, while in the abstract VE the difference was significant only in the control and the radar conditions. From a more general perspective, our study highlights the need to take into specific consideration user experience in navigating VEs when designing navigation aids and evaluating their effectiveness.},

Eighty-one participants completed an information retrieval task where the visualization techniques were used to display a corpus consisting of 50 short news texts. Human pairwise similarity judgments for this corpus were used to create the three proximity-based displays. Results demonstrated an advantage in accuracy, the number of documents accessed, and, to a lesser extent, subjective confidence in these displays over the Random List condition and in the 2D over the 1D displays. Similar, but smaller, advantages were observed in the MDS display over ISOMAP however none of these pairwise comparisons were statistically significant. A sequential analysis of participant actions in terms of the proximity of document representations accessed provided some explanation for variations in performance between the displays as well as indicating strategic differences in interactions particularly between visualizations of different dimensionality.},

abstract = {To evaluate how top-down and bottom-up processes contribute to learning from animated displays, we conducted four experiments that varied either in the design of animations or the prior knowledge of the learners. Experiments 1-3 examined whether adding interactivity and signaling to an animation benefits learners in developing a mental model of a mechanical system. Although learners utilized interactive controls and signaling devices, their comprehension of the system was no better than that of learners who saw animations without these design features. Furthermore, the majority of participants developed a mental model of the system that was incorrect and inconsistent with information displayed in the animation. Experiment 4 tested effects of domain knowledge and found, surprisingly, that even some learners with high domain knowledge initially constructed the incorrect mental model. After multiple exposures to the materials, the high knowledge learners revised their mental models to the correct one, while the low-knowledge learners maintained their erroneous models. These results suggest that learning from animations involves a complex interplay between top-down and bottom-up processes and that more emphasis should be placed on how prior knowledge is applied to interpreting animations.},

abstract = {In situations of computer-mediated communication and computer-supported cooperation, a central challenge lies in increasing the willingness of those involved to share their information with the other group members. In the experimental work presented here, a shared-database setting is selected as a prototypical situation of net-based information exchange and examined from a social-dilemma perspective: the individual who contributes information to a shared database must reckon with costs and no benefits. The most efficient strategy from the perspective of the individual is thus to withhold information. Previous research has shown that a group-awareness tool which provides information about the contribution behavior of group members influences people's information-exchange behavior. In order to examine the psychological processes underlying these effects of group awareness in more detail, the present study adopts an interactional approach, according to which person-situation interaction is investigated. Certain personality traits (interpersonal trust, sensation seeking, and self-monitoring) were measured and several hypotheses tested regarding the reactions of individuals with high and low trait values to different types of awareness information. Results demonstrate that awareness tools providing information about highly cooperative group members encourage participants to trust one another and minimize the risk of being exploited. When an awareness tool additionally provides feedback about the contribution behavior of single individuals, it becomes an opportunity for self-presentation. In conclusion, an interactional approach which considers personality traits and situational factors in a net-based information-exchange situation provides new insights into both the influence processes of group awareness and the connection of these processes to specific personality traits with respect to contribution behavior.},

In the second experiment navigation support was offered in the visual modality and users positively evaluated it. Users navigated in a more structured way, judged the system as more usable, and perceived themselves as less disoriented. Support did also here lead to better task performance.

We then point out what tutoring and learning principles have been used to date in the acquisition literature, though unintentionally and implicitly, and discuss how a more thorough and explicit representation of these principles would help improve how computers learn from users. We present our design and an initial implementation of an acquisition dialogue system called SLICK that represents acquisition principles and goals explicitly and declaratively, making the system actively reason about various acquisition tasks and generate its interactions dynamically. Finally, we discuss promising directions in designing acquisition systems by structuring interactions with users according to tutoring and learning principles.},

abstract = {Bats are able to use active sonar as a mechanism for locating object in three dimensions and for generating spatial maps of their environments. Humans use passive sound cues to detect features of the space they occupy, as well as react to the spatial location of objects which generate sound. The system described in this paper allows free-ranging humans to locate a virtual sound location using active sonar. An emitted pulse, centred on the users head, serves as an intensity and time marker. The return pulse is rendered at the virtual target location and emitted after a time delay corresponding to the two-way path from sender to target and back again. The sonar system is modelled on those of bats, using ultrasonic frequency-modulated signals reflected from simple targets. The model uses the reflectivity characteristics of ultrasound, but the frequency and temporal structure used are scaled, with the speed of sound being set to 8.5ms^-^1 to bring the frequency range and temporal resolution within the capabilities of the human auditory system. Orientation with respect to the ensonified target is achieved by time-of-flight time delays to give target range, and binaural location information derived from interaural timing differences, interaural intensity differences, and head-related transfer functions. Subjects performed significantly better at a localization task when given temporal data based on echo delays with an outgoing reference pulse than without a reference pulse. Frequency-modulated signals sweeping from 1.5kHz-100Hz over 500ms provide the best localization cues, and users found them significantly easier to locate than continuous sounds.},

We report two experiments that compare these techniques to a point cursor; in one experiment participants use a touchpad for operating the input techniques, in the other a mouse. In both experiments, the bubble cursor is fastest and participants make fewer errors with it. Participants also unanimously prefer this technique. For small targets, the cell cursors are generally more accurate than the point cursor; in the second experiment the box cursor is also faster. The cell cursors succeed in letting participants select objects while the cursor is far away from the target, but are relatively slow in the final phase of target acquisition. We discuss limitations and possible enhancements of input techniques with activation areas that contain multiple objects.},

As cyberspace becomes a haven for deceptive behavior, human-computer interaction research will need to be carried out to study and understand these deceptive behaviors. The objective of this research is to investigate the behavior of deceivers and non-deceivers (or truth-tellers) in the cyberspace environment. We examine if the intention to deceive others influences one's choice of avatars in the online chat environment. We also investigate if communication medium (text-only vs. avatar-supported chat) influences one's perception of trustworthiness of the communication partner. A lab experiment was conducted in an online chat environment with dyads. The results indicate that in the text-only chat environment, subjects who were deceiving their partner experienced higher anxiety levels than those who were truthful to their partner; however, the same phenomenon was not observed in the avatar-supported chat environment. This suggests that ''wearing a mask'' in cyberspace may reduce anxiety in deceiving others. Additionally, deceivers are more likely to choose avatars that are different from their real selves. The results also show that the use of avatars in a computer-mediated chat environment does not have an impact on one's perceived trustworthiness.},

abstract = {Recently, application service provider (ASP), a new rental-based enterprise software business, has become a viable option. Although ASP has the potential to fundamentally change the manner in which IT services are provided for user firms, current ASPs often fail to show robust records in accumulating and maintaining customers. Therefore, this paper attempts to explore the main success factors for ASP-based information systems on the basis of past IS success models. Two hundred and three samples were collected from small and medium enterprises with ASP service experiences. Data analysis using LISREL shows that seven IS success factors-system quality, information quality, service quality, intention to use, user satisfaction, individual benefit, organizational benefit and an additional factor, trust, have good fit with data gathered. These factors, except for system quality, show significant coefficients and explanatory power. Furthermore, it is found that both service quality and information quality are significant for fostering user satisfaction, trust, and intention to use.},

abstract = {Developments in hardware and software have led to new innovative methods for visualising geospatial data. At the same time user-centred design (UCD) and usability engineering methods have a fundamental role in designing applications for new technical environments, which involve entirely new ways of interacting. However, applying methods from other research disciplines may not always be straightforward, as the product developers have to operate in a challenging interdisciplinary field. The aim of this study was to find out how usability engineering is currently included in the development of map services. Seven companies developing different types of map applications in Finland were interviewed. The results support the suitability of usability engineering for map application design, since by including the usability approach into the product design, while simultaneously taking into account the individuality and diversity of users and their tasks together with the characteristics of the maps, application developers are more likely to design products that have a higher quality of use. This study identifies the main occasions when the usability approach could be most beneficial. Furthermore, the benefits and challenges of including usability approaches in map application design are discussed. Preliminary ideas on what usability means in the context of map applications are also given. Finally, the importance for providing a basis for the further development of application-specific guidelines and techniques is addressed.},

In this study, we examined stylus-based tapping operations on a PDA under three mobility situations: seated, walking on a treadmill, and walking through an obstacle course. The results revealed that Fitts' Law continues to be effective even under the most challenging obstacle course condition. While target selection times did not differ between the various mobility conditions, overall task completion times, error rates, and several measures of workload differed significantly. Diminished performance under the obstacle course condition was attributed to increased demands on attention associated with navigating through the obstacle course. Results showed that the participants in the obstacle course condition were able to tap on a 6.4mm-diameter target with 90% accuracy, but they reduced their walking speed by 36% and perceived an increased workload. Extending earlier research, we found that treadmill-based conditions were able to generate representative data for task selection times, but accuracy differed significantly from the more realistic obstacle course condition.},

The most commonly used method for authenticating users who attempt to access such information is through the use of username-password combinations. However, this is a weak method of authentication because users tend to generate passwords that are easy to remember but also easy to crack. Proactive password checking, for which passwords must satisfy certain criteria, is one method for improving the security of user-generated passwords. The present study evaluated the time and number of attempts needed to generate unique passwords satisfying different restrictions for multiple accounts, as well as the login time and accuracy for recalling those passwords. Imposing password restrictions alone did not necessarily lead to more secure passwords. However, the use of a technique for which the first letter of each word of a sentence was used coupled with a requirement to insert a special character and digit yielded more secure passwords that were more memorable.},

We then report on an empirical study that attempted to validate the understand/transform world barrier in the paradigm model using an online questionnaire. We conclude that the used 'Attitude About Reality' scale was unsuitable for measuring this barrier, whereas information about the educational background of the participants was a good predictor for the self-reported profession (designer, engineer or scientist). Interestingly, among the three professions, engineers appear to be the cohesive element, since they often have dual backgrounds, whereas very few participants had dual science/design backgrounds. Engineers could, therefore, build a bridge between designers and scientists, and through their integrative role, could guide the HCI community to realizing its full potential.},

This paper presents the first automated method that assesses, using multiple channels of affect-related information, whether a learner is about to click on a button saying ''I'm frustrated.'' The new method was tested on data gathered from 24 participants using an automated Learning Companion. Their indication of frustration was automatically predicted from the collected data with 79% accuracy (chance=58%). The new assessment method is based on Gaussian process classification and Bayesian inference. Its performance suggests that non-verbal channels carrying affective cues can help provide important information to a system for formulating a more intelligent response.},

abstract = {An ontology is a powerful way of representing knowledge for multiple purposes. There are several ontology languages for describing concepts, properties, objects, and relationships. However, ontologies in information systems are not primarily written for human reading and communication among humans. For many business, government, and scientific purposes, written documents are the primary description and communication media for human knowledge communication. Unfortunately, there is a significant gap between knowledge expressed as textual documents and knowledge represented as ontologies. Semantic documents aim at combining documents and ontologies, and allowing users to access the knowledge in multiple ways. By adding annotations to electronic-document formats and including ontologies in electronic documents, it is possible to reconcile documents and ontologies, and to provide new services, such as ontology-based searches of large document databases. To accomplish this goal, semantic documents require tools that support both complex ontologies and advanced document formats. The Protege ontology editor, together with a custom-tailored documentation-handling extension, enables developers to create semantic documents by linking preexisting documents to ontologies.},

We demonstrate how Ontology Design Patterns (ODPs) can extend inherent limitations of this model. We give examples of relationships between more than two instances; lists and exceptions, and conclude by illustrating what OWL-DL and its underlying description logic either cannot handle in theory or because of lack of implementation. Finally, we present a research agenda that, if fulfilled, would help ensure OWL's wider take up in the life science community.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore the use of a formal ontology as a constraining framework for the belief store of a rational agent. The static beliefs of the agent are the axioms of the ontology. The dynamic beliefs are the descriptions of the individuals that are instances of the ontology classes. The individuals all have a unique identifier, an associated set of named classes to which they are believed to belong, and a set of property values. The ontology axioms act as a schema for the dynamic beliefs. Belief updates not conforming to the axioms lead to either rejection of the update or some other revision of the dynamic belief store to maintain consistency. Partial descriptions are augmented by inferences of property values and class memberships licensed by the axioms. For concreteness we sketch how such an ontology based agent belief store could be implemented in a multi-threaded logic programming language with action rules and object oriented programming features called Go!. This language was specifically designed for implementing communicating rational agent applications. We shall see that its logic rules allow us to extend an ontology of classes and properties with rule defined n-ary relations and functions. Its action rules enable us to implement a consistency maintenance system that takes into account justifications for beliefs. The pragmatics of consistency maintenance is an issue not normally considered by the ontology community. The paper assumes some familiarity with ontology specification using languages such as OWL DL and its subsets, and with logic programming.},

With current computational aids to science work, the human knowledge that creates meaning out of analyses is often only recorded when work reaches publication-or worse, left unrecorded altogether-for lack of an ontological model for scientific concepts that can capture knowledge as it is created and used. We argue for an approach to representing scientific concepts that reflects (1) the situated processes of science work, (2) the social construction of knowledge, and (3) the emergence and evolution of understanding over time. In this model, knowledge is the result of collaboration, negotiation, and manipulation by teams of researchers. Capturing the situations in which knowledge is created and used helps these collaborators discover areas of agreement and discord, while allowing individual inquirers to maintain different perspectives on the same information. The capture of provenance information allows historical trails of reasoning to be reconstructed, allowing end users to evaluate the utility and trustworthiness of knowledge representations. We present a proof-of-concept system, called Codex, based on this situated knowledge model. Codex supports visualization of knowledge structures through concept mapping, and enables inference across those structures. The proof-of-concept is deployed in the domain of geoscience to support distributed teams of learners and researchers.},

Due to the widespread adoption of the Object Management Group (OMG) standards for metamodel definition, model serialisation and programmatic access to models, many of these tools are interoperable. Currently this is not the case for ontology engineering tools. This paper discusses the potential benefits of making the OMG's model-driven architecture (MDA) technology applicable to ontology engineering, and in particular, describes a technique for converting ontologies serialised using the XML metadata interchange (XMI) format to an equivalent representation using the resource description framework (RDF), without any loss of information. The resulting models can then be analysed and transformed using existing RDF tools. The technique is applicable to any ontology modelling language that has its abstract syntax defined using the OMG's meta-object facility (MOF) model. This research helps to bridge the gap between the MDA and ontology engineering by providing a technique based on the familiar RDF language for defining transformations between other types of model (such as UML) and ontologies, between different ontology modelling languages, or to modify ontologies without changing the language.},

While the generalists typically attach philosophical sophistication to their approach, in supposed contrast to the narrow remit chosen by the application-bound knowledge engineers, we would like to indicate that the latter practice can often reflect a multi-faceted rationale, nuanced by the requirements of the domain. We demonstrate how the necessity of placing ontology-based systems with the work-practices of domain experts introduces unique demands on design rationales and enforces, often implicitly, a philosophical assessment of the necessary concepts and relations that balance the generality and specificity. Such demands are not addressed by generic approaches to modelling the reality of a domain. Indeed, we articulate the philosophical and practical considerations that we have taken into account when developing an application-specific ontology. We would certainly hope that our experiences can be of help to the development of ontologies in similar applications.},

However, rule acquisition is still a bottleneck in the utilization of rule-based systems. To extract rules from Web pages, the framework of eXtensible Rule Markup Language (XRML) has been developed. XRML allows the identification of rules from Web pages and generates rules automatically. However, the knowledge engineer's burden is still high because rule identification requires considerable manual work. In order to reduce the knowledge engineer's burden, we proposed an ontology-based methodology of enhanced rule identification.

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is twofold: (i) we argue that the structure of commonsense knowledge must be discovered, rather than invented; and (ii) we argue that natural language, which is the best known theory of our (shared) commonsense knowledge, should itself be used as a guide to discovering the structure of commonsense knowledge. In addition to suggesting a systematic method to the discovery of the structure of commonsense knowledge, the method we propose seems to also provide an explanation for a number of phenomena in natural language, such as metaphor, intensionality, and the semantics of nominal compounds. Admittedly, our ultimate goal is quite ambitious, and it is no less than the systematic 'discovery' of a well-typed ontology of commonsense knowledge, and the subsequent formulation of the long-awaited goal of a meaning algebra.},

A Dynamic Interviewing Programme (DIP) was employed in order to survey users of an instant messaging ICQ ('I seek you') client using both closed and open question formats. Analysis of 530 respondents' data illustrates the importance of establishing users' privacy concerns and the reasoning behind these concerns. Results indicate that Internet users are concerned about a wider range of privacy issues than surveys have typically covered. The results do not provide final definitions for the areas of online privacy, but provide information that is useful to gain a better understanding of privacy concerns and actions.},

In contrast, researchers in the diverse fields of human-computer interaction, medicine, psychology and marketing have begun to note the importance of feelings in understanding and predicting human behavior. Feelings are anticipated to be essential particularly in the context of modern applications, such as mobile Internet (M-Internet) services. Users of modern technology are not simply technology users but also service consumers and may consider both cognitive and emotional benefits. Drawing upon multidisciplinary findings, this study proposes a balanced thinking-feelings model of IS continuance. In the process of developing this model, the concepts of attitude, thinking and feelings are further articulated, defined and distinguished. The balanced thinking-feelings model is validated in a survey of M-Internet service users. To encourage continuance, companies should consider ways to enhance both cognitive and emotional benefits for users. The model could be also useful for balanced understanding of other behaviors.},

This study presents the team model called ''Team-Soar'' and describes how the model implements agent activeness at two levels (active and passive) and agent cooperativeness at three levels (cooperative, neutral, and selfish). Then a computational simulation experiment is described. Results of the simulation indicate that the impacts of the agent type depend on the amount of information to be processed and active style boosts the effects of agent cooperativeness on team efficiency. The results also indicate that active agents do not always contribute team efficiency more than passive agents.},

The aim of this study was to explore the effects of different forms of representation, by examining how users communicate via high quality video images and basic graphical representations in different communicative contexts. Communication analysis revealed that video images facilitate turn-taking, although they are not necessarily perceived very differently from basic avatars in terms of questionnaire responses. Using eye-tracking techniques, we found that while participants generally gaze more often at video images, this is dependent on the communicative context and is not necessarily an advantage in a problem-solving situation. This study has demonstrated the value of employing various measures and tasks in order to evaluate computer-mediated interactions. The results have implications for the use of video and graphical representations in computer mediated communication and suggest that the benefits of video must be considered in relation to the user's requirements (e.g. communication process versus outcome) and context in which the system is to be applied (e.g. problem-solving or social).},

abstract = {Serendipity is the making of fortunate discoveries by accident, and is one of the cornerstones of scientific progress. In today's world of digital data and media, there is now a vast quantity of material that we could potentially encounter, and so there is an increased opportunity of being able to discover interesting things. However, the availability of material does not imply that we will be able to actually find it; the sheer quantity of data mitigates against us being able to discover the interesting nuggets. This paper explores approaches we have taken to support users in their search for interesting and relevant information. The primary concept is the principle that it is more useful to augment user skills in information foraging than it is to try and replace them. We have taken a variety of artificial intelligence, statistical, and visualisation techniques, and combined them with careful design approaches to provide supportive systems that monitor user actions, garner additional information from their surrounding environment and use this enhanced understanding to offer supplemental information that aids the user in their interaction with the system. We present two different systems that have been designed and developed according to these principles. The first system is a data mining system that allows interactive exploration of the data, allowing the user to pose different questions and understand information at different levels of detail. The second supports information foraging of a different sort, aiming to augment users browsing habits in order to help them surf the internet more effectively. Both use ambient intelligence techniques to provide a richer context for the interaction and to help guide it in more effective ways: both have the user as the focal point of the interaction, in control of an iterative exploratory process, working in indirect collaboration with the artificial intelligence components. Each of these systems contains some important concepts of their own: the data mining system has a symbolic genetic algorithm which can be tuned in novel ways to aid knowledge discovery, and which reports results in a user-comprehensible format. The visualisation system supports high-dimensional data, dynamically organised in a three-dimensional space and grouped by similarity. The notions of similarity are further discussed in the internet browsing system, in which an approach to measuring similarity between web pages and a user's interests is presented. We present details of both systems and evaluate their effectiveness.},

abstract = {The investigation of innovative Human-Computer Interfaces (HCI) provides a challenge for future interaction research and development. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) exploit the ability of human communication and control bypassing the classical neuromuscular communication channels. In general, BCIs offer a possibility of communication for people with severe neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or complete paralysis of all extremities due to high spinal cord injury. Beyond medical applications, a BCI conjunction with exciting multimedia applications, e.g., a dexterity discovery, could define a new level of control possibilities also for healthy customers decoding information directly from the user's brain, as reflected in EEG signals which are recorded non-invasively from the scalp. This contribution introduces the Berlin Brain-Computer Interface (BBCI) and presents set-ups where the user is provided with intuitive control strategies in plausible interactive bio-feedback applications. Yet at its beginning, BBCI thus adds a new dimension in HCI research by offering the user an additional and independent communication channel based on brain activity only. Successful experiments already yielded inspiring proofs-of-concept. A diversity of interactive application models, say computer games, and their specific intuitive control strategies are now open for BCI research aiming at a further speed up of user adaptation and increase of learning success and transfer bit rates. BBCI is a complex distributed software system that can be run on several communicating computers responsible for (i) the signal acquisition, (ii) the data processing and (iii) the feedback application. Developing a BCI system, special attention must be paid to the design of the feedback application that serves as the HCI unit. This should provide the user with the information about her/his brain activity in a way that is intuitively intelligible. Exciting discovery applications qualify perfectly for this role. However, most of these applications incorporate control strategies that are developed especially for the control with haptic devices, e.g., joystick, keyboard or mouse. Therefore, novel control strategies should be developed for this purpose that (i) allow the user to incorporate additional information for the control of animated objects and (ii) do not frustrate the user in the case of a misclassification of the decoded brain signal. BCIs are able to decode different information types from the user's brain activity, such as sensory perception or motor intentions and imaginations, movement preparations, levels of stress, workload or task-related idling. All of these diverse brain signals can be incorporated in an exciting discovery scenario. Modern HCI research and development technologies can provide BCI researchers with the know-how about interactive feedback applications and corresponding control strategies.},

Therefore, such sensors allow for easier and more natural human-machine interaction. The approach is demonstrated in two applications. The first is an ''electronic tongue'', which performs quality assessment of food and water. In the second application we describe the development of an artificial hand for dexterous manipulation. We show that human-like functionality can be achieved even if the structure of the system is not completely biologically inspired.},

The answer to such questions is vital for outlier detection (terrorist networks, or illegal money-laundering rings), forecasting, and simulations (''how will a computer virus spread?''). The heart of the problem is finding the properties of real graphs that seem to persist over multiple disciplines. We list such patterns and ''laws'', including the ''min-cut plots'' discovered by us. This is the first part of our NetMine package: given any large graph, it provides visual feedback about these patterns; any significant deviations from the expected patterns can thus be immediately flagged by the user as abnormalities in the graph. The second part of NetMine is the A-plots tool for visualizing the adjacency matrix of the graph in innovative new ways, again to find outliers. Third, NetMine contains the R-MAT (Recursive MATrix) graph generator, which can successfully model many of the patterns found in real-world graphs and quickly generate realistic graphs, capturing the essence of each graph in only a few parameters. We present results on multiple, large real graphs, where we show the effectiveness of our approach.},

One of the challenges with designing new highly interruptive technologies is how to objectively assess their influence on human experience. This paper presents an assessment of a new mobile system that interrupts the wearer to support self-monitoring of stress. We utilize a diverse set of assessment techniques, including a newly proposed measure, relative subjective count, which compares the difference in perceived number of interruptions to actual number of interruptions. This measure, together with direct and indirect subjective reports, and a behavioral choice, is used to evaluate an empathetic version of the mobile system vs. a non-empathetic version. We found that post-experience direct questionnaire assessments such as ''how stressful has using the system been?'' do not significantly distinguish user experiences with the two systems; however, the new measure of relative subjective count, the behavioral choice, and another indirect questioning strategy, do point toward a preference for the empathetic system.},

abstract = {How we design and evaluate for emotions depends crucially on what we take emotions to be. In affective computing, affect is often taken to be another kind of information-discrete units or states internal to an individual that can be transmitted in a loss-free manner from people to computational systems and back. While affective computing explicitly challenges the primacy of rationality in cognitivist accounts of human activity, at a deeper level it often relies on and reproduces the same information-processing model of cognition. Drawing on cultural, social, and interactional critiques of cognition which have arisen in human-computer interaction (HCI), as well as anthropological and historical accounts of emotion, we explore an alternative perspective on emotion as interaction: dynamic, culturally mediated, and socially constructed and experienced. We demonstrate how this model leads to new goals for affective systems-instead of sensing and transmitting emotion, systems should support human users in understanding, interpreting, and experiencing emotion in its full complexity and ambiguity. In developing from emotion as objective, externally measurable unit to emotion as experience, evaluation, too, alters focus from externally tracking the circulation of emotional information to co-interpreting emotions as they are made in interaction.},

abstract = {Affective reasoning plays an increasingly important role in cognitive accounts of social interaction. Humans continuously assess one another's situational context, modify their own affective state accordingly, and then respond to these outcomes by expressing empathetic behaviors. Synthetic agents serving as companions should respond similarly. However, empathetic reasoning is riddled with the complexities stemming from the myriad factors bearing upon situational assessment. A key challenge posed by affective reasoning in synthetic agents is devising empirically informed models of empathy that accurately respond in social situations. This paper presents Care, a data-driven affective architecture and methodology for learning models of empathy by observing human-human social interactions. First, in Care training sessions, one trainer directs synthetic agents to perform a sequence of tasks while another trainer manipulates companion agents' affective states to produce empathetic behaviors (spoken language, gesture, and posture). Care tracks situational data including locational, intentional, and temporal information to induce a model of empathy. At runtime, Care uses the model of empathy to drive situation-appropriate empathetic behaviors. Care has been used in a virtual environment testbed. Two complementary studies investigating the predictive accuracy and perceived accuracy of Care-induced models of empathy suggest that the Care paradigm can provide the basis for effective empathetic behavior control in embodied companion agents.},

abstract = {Designs for everyday life must be considered in terms of the many facets of experience they affect, including their aesthetics, emotional effects, genre, social niche, and cultural connotations. In this paper, I discuss the use of cultural commentators, people whose profession it is to inform and shape public opinion, as resources for multi-layered assessments of designs for everyday life. I describe our work with a team of movie screenwriters to help interpret the results of a Cultural Probe study, and with film-makers to document the experiences of people living with prototype designs in their homes. The value of employing cultural commentators is that they work outside our usual community of discourse, and are often accustomed to reflecting issues of aesthetics, emotions, social fit or cultural implication that are difficult to address from traditional HCI perspectives. They help to focus and articulate people's accounts of their experiences, extrapolating narratives from incomplete information, and dramatising relationships to create powerful and provocative stories. In so doing, they create the grounds for a polyphonic assessment of prototypes, in which a multiplicity of perspectives encourages a multi-layered assessment.},

abstract = {We have designed and built a mobile emotional messaging system named eMoto. With it, users can compose messages through using emotion-signalling gestures as input, rendering a message background of colours, shapes and animations expressing the emotional content. The design intent behind eMoto was that it should be engaging physically, intellectually and socially, and allow users to express themselves emotionally in all those dimensions, involving them in an affective loop experience. In here, we describe the user-centred design process that lead to the eMoto system, but focus mainly on the final study where we let five friends use eMoto for two weeks. The study method, which we name in situ informants, helped us enter and explore the subjective and distributed experiences of use, as well as how emotional communication unfolds in everyday practice when channelled through a system like eMoto. The in situ informants are on the one hand users of eMoto, but also spectators, that are close friends who observe and document user behaviour. Design conclusions include the need to support the sometimes fragile communication rhythm that friendships require-expressing memories of the past, sharing the present and planning for the future. We saw that emotions are not singular state that exist within one person alone, but permeates the total situation, changing and drifting as a process between the two friends communicating. We also gained insights into the under-estimated but still important physical, sensual aspects of emotional communication. Experiences of the in situ informants method pointed to the need to involve participants in the interpretation of the data obtained, as well as establishing a closer connection with the spectators.},

There are few methods of assessing emotional state, and even fewer methods of quantifying emotion during play. This paper presents a novel method for continuously modeling emotion using physiological data. A fuzzy logic model transformed four physiological signals into arousal and valence. A second fuzzy logic model transformed arousal and valence into five emotional states relevant to computer game play: boredom, challenge, excitement, frustration, and fun. Modeled emotions compared favorably with a manual approach, and the means were also evaluated with subjective self-reports, exhibiting the same trends as reported emotions for fun, boredom, and excitement. This approach provides a method for quantifying emotional states continuously during a play experience.},

These methods were used in nine separate field experiments done in naturalistic settings. Based on our experiments, we can argue that all of these methods can be successfully used for collecting emotional responses to evaluate mobile applications in mobile settings. However, differences can be identified in the suitability of the methods for different research setups. Even though the self-report instruments provide a feasible alternative for evaluating emotions evoked by mobile applications, several challenges were identified, for example, in capturing the dynamic nature of mobile interaction usage situations and contexts. To summarise our results, we propose a framework for selecting and comparing these methods for different usage purposes.},

abstract = {Communication of affect across a distance is not well supported by current technology, despite its importance to interpersonal interaction in modern lifestyles. Touch is a powerful conduit for emotional connectedness, and thus mediating haptic (touch) displays have been proposed to address this deficiency; but suitable evaluative methodology has been elusive. In this paper, we offer a first, structured examination of a design space for haptic support of remote affective communication, by analyzing the space and then comparing haptic models designed to manipulate its key dimensions. In our study, dyads (intimate pairs or strangers) are asked to communicate specified emotions using a purely haptic link that consists of virtual models rendered on simple knobs. These models instantiate both interaction metaphors of varying intimacy, and representations of virtual interpersonal distance. Our integrated objective and subjective observations imply that emotion can indeed be communicated through this medium, and confirm that the factors examined influence emotion communication performance as well as preference, comfort and connectedness. The proposed design space and the study results have implications for future efforts to support affective communication using the haptic modality, and the study approach comprises a first model for systematic evaluation of haptically expressed affect.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model, called Scene-Driver, for the re-use of film and television material. We begin by exploring general issues surrounding the ways in which content can be sub-divided into meaningful units for re-use and how criteria might then be applied to the selection and ordering of these units. We also identify and discuss the different means by which a user might interact with the content to create novel and engaging experiences. The Scene-Driver model has been instantiated using content from an animated children's television series called Tiny Planets, which is aimed at children of 5-7-year old. This type of material, being story-based itself, lends itself particularly well to the application of narrative constraints to scene reordering, to provide coherence to the experience of interacting with the content. We propose an interactive narrative-driven game architecture, in which a user generates novel narratives from existing content by placing ''domino'' like tiles. These tiles act as ''glue'' between scenes and each tile choice dictates certain properties of the next scene to be shown within a game. There are three different game-types, based on three different ways in which tiles can be matched to scenes. We introduce algorithms for generating legal tile-sets for each of these three game-types, which can be extended to include narrative constraints. This ensures that all novel orderings adhere to a minimum narrative plan, which has been identified based on analysis of the Tiny Planets series and on narrative theories. We also suggest ways in which basic narratives can be enhanced by the inclusion of directorial techniques and by the use of more complex plot structures. In our evaluation studies with children in the target age-range, our game compared favourably with other games that the children enjoyed playing.},

abstract = {Advanced display design, such as Ecological Interface Design (EID), makes extensive use of complex graphical objects. Research has shown that by following EID methodologies, supervisory operators have better performance with the EID displays than with non-EID displays. However, the effect of particular dynamic graphical objects seen in EID displays has never been studied. In this study, we examined how different visual features of graphical objects affect the performance of the objects. We used a modified dynamic just noticeable difference task to investigate the graphical objects that show changes most sensitively. We also investigated the sensitivities of graphical objects in determining target levels, directional changes, and proportions. A commercial EID design company generated the graphical objects examined. We had subjects perform four tasks with graphical objects that varied in their visual features but were still representative of objects currently being used in ecological design. It was found that for simple dynamic objects such as bars and polygon objects, a line changing in angle was the most noticeable emergent feature to show a departure from ''normal'' state. For complex graphical objects, those target-indicator displays that mimic a ''bull's eye'' when at the target value should be used for displays that show observers when a target value has been reached. Abrupt changes in shape should be used in trend meters to show when variables or processes have changed direction. Finally, ''solid objects'' that make use of vertical lines and shading should be used for comparison meters that compare two values and keep them in a particular ratio. The findings provide guidance for designers of dynamic advanced graphical displays by encouraging the consideration of visual aspects of graphical objects, as well as prescribing graphical objects that should be used in the types of tasks investigated.},

In this study, we suggest an e-learning success model based on flow theory. A questionnaire-based empirical study was used to test the model. It used data from e-learners who participated in a program on Enterprise Resource Planning training with a web-based e-learning system supported by the Korea Ministry of Information and Communication. Results confirm the significant interdependent relationships between the characteristics of e-learning, flow experience, learners' attitude towards e-learning, and the resulting learning outcomes. In particular, it was revealed that flow experience plays a critical role as a central part of our research model, having direct and indirect impact on learning outcomes (i.e., the technology self-efficacy in ERP system usage in this study). This study should be of relevance to both researchers and practitioners alike, as a step towards a better understanding of e-learning, especially in the context of information system training.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown adaptive cruise control (ACC) can compromise driving safety when drivers do not understand how the ACC functions, suggesting that drivers need to be informed about the capabilities of this technology. This study applies ecological interface design (EID) to create a visual representation of ACC behavior, which is intended to promote appropriate reliance and support effective transitions between manual and ACC control. The EID display reveals the behavior of ACC in terms of time headway (THW), time to collision (TTC), and range rate. This graphical representation uses emergent features that signal the state of the ACC. Two failure modes-exceedance of braking algorithm limits and sensor failures-were introduced in the driving contexts of traffic and rain, respectively. A medium-fidelity driving simulator was used to evaluate the effect of automation (manual, ACC control), and display (EID, no display) on ACC reliance, brake response, and driver intervention strategies. Drivers in traffic conditions relied more appropriately on ACC when the EID display was present than when it was not, proactively disengaging the ACC. The EID display promoted faster and more consistent braking responses when braking algorithm limits were exceeded, resulting in safe following distances and no collisions. In manual control, the EID display aided THW maintenance in both rain and traffic conditions, reducing the demands of driving and promoting more consistent and less variable car-following performance. These results suggest that providing drivers with continuous information about the state of the automation is a promising alternative to the more common approach of providing imminent crash warnings when it fails. Informing drivers may be more effective than warning drivers.},

Using this model as a framework, the relationships among perceived goal difficulty, goal success, and self-efficacy were examined. Self-efficacy was conceptualized as a mediating mechanism and intrinsic motivation (IM) in the task was examined as a moderator. Data were collected as repeated measures over 20 cycles during an hour-long session of information seeking when students were given that task of designing a travel plan for a trip to China. The findings suggest that success in meeting information goals in one cycle resulted in an increase in self-efficacy, which in turn reduced the perceived difficulty of information goals in the upcoming cycle. At the same time, self-efficacy from previous cycles seemed to provide the impetus for formulating more challenging information goals in subsequent cycles. Besides this dual role of self-efficacy, the moderating role of IM was also evident. For participants relatively high in baseline IM for the task, the link between self-efficacy and goal success was weaker. However, for participants with relatively low levels of baseline IM for the task, goal success has a stronger effect on self-efficacy.},

abstract = {This study aimed to compare the efficacy of collaborative learning in face-to-face and online university courses in developing professional skills and social capital. One hundred and sixty-six psychology majors learnt professional skills in seminars taught by the same teacher online and face-to-face. The different groups of participants achieved similar growth in level of professional knowledge, social self-efficacy, self-efficacy for problem solving and empowerment. Instead, online students were top performers on competence-based tasks. Follow-up evaluation after 9 months showed that social ties, formed initially more in the face-to-face groups, lasted more among online students. Our results indicate that Computer Assisted Collaborative Learning could provide educational opportunities to new groups of learners as well as to more traditional campus-based students.},

abstract = {This paper presents CourseVis, a system that takes a novel approach of using Web log data generated by course management systems (CMSs) to help instructors become aware of what is happening in distance learning classes. Specifically, techniques from information visualization (IV) are employed to graphically render complex, multidimensional student tracking data. Several graphical representations are generated to help distance learning instructors get a better understanding of social, behavioural, and cognitive aspects related to learners. The evaluation of CourseVis shows that it can help instructors to quickly identify tendencies in their classes and discover individuals that might need special attention. This suggests that the effectiveness of CMSs can be improved by integrating IV techniques to generate appropriate graphical representations, similar to those produced in CourseVis.},

abstract = {This study extends previous media equation research, which showed that interdependence but not identity leads to team affiliation effects with computers. The current study used an identity manipulation that more closely replicated the manipulation used in traditional team and group formation research than the original media equation research in this area. The study also sought further evidence for the relationship between experience with computers and behaviour reflecting a media equation pattern of results. Sixty students from the University of Queensland voluntarily participated in the study. Participants were assigned to one of three conditions: control, human team (a team made of only humans) or human-computer team (a team made of computers and humans). Questionnaire measures assessing participants' affective experience, attitudes and opinions were taken. Participants of high experience with computers, but not low experience, when assigned to either of the team conditions enjoyed the tasks completed on the computer more than participants who worked on their own. When assigned to a team that involved a computer, participants of high experience, but not low experience, reacted negatively towards the computer (in comparison to high experience participants working on their own or on a team without a computer as a team member)-rating the information provided by the computer lower, rating themselves as less influenced by the computer and changing their own ratings and rankings to be less like those of the computer. These results are interpreted in light of the 'Black Sheep' literature and recognized as a media equation pattern of results.},

A conceptual model of the visualization support to DM modeling process and a novel interactive visual decision tree (IVDT) classification process have been proposed in this paper, with the aim of exploring humans' pattern recognition ability and domain knowledge to facilitate the knowledge discovery process. An IVDT for categorical input attributes has been developed and experimented on 20 subjects to test three hypotheses regarding its potential advantages. The experimental results suggested that, compared to the automatic modeling process as typically applied in current decision tree modeling tools, IVDT process can improve the effectiveness of modeling in terms of producing trees with relatively high classification accuracies and small sizes, enhance users' understanding of the algorithm, and give them greater satisfaction with the task.},

None of the strategies is effective and rapid enough to mitigate worm propagation. Therefore, it is extremely important for organizations to better understand worm behaviour and adopt a strategy to minimize the damage due to worm attacks. This paper describes an approach to minimize the damage due to worm infection in enterprise networks. The approach includes: (1) analyzing the effect of parameters influencing worm infection: openness, homogeneity, and trust, (2) predicting the number of infected nodes by fuzzy decision, and (3) optimizing the trust parameter to minimize the damage by fuzzy control. Experiments using real worm attacks show that the selected parameters are strongly correlated with actual infection rates, the damage prediction produces accurate estimates, and the optimization of the selected parameter can lessen the damage from worm infection.},

abstract = {Terrorists and extremists are increasingly utilizing Internet technology to enhance their ability to influence the outside world. Due to the lack of multi-lingual and multimedia terrorist/extremist collections and advanced analytical methodologies, our empirical understanding of their Internet usage is still very limited. To address this research gap, we explore an integrated approach for identifying and collecting terrorist/extremist Web contents. We also propose a Dark Web Attribute System (DWAS) to enable quantitative Dark Web content analysis from three perspectives: technical sophistication, content richness, and Web interactivity. Using the proposed methodology, we identified and examined the Internet usage of major Middle Eastern terrorist/extremist groups. More than 200,000 multimedia Web documents were collected from 86 Middle Eastern multi-lingual terrorist/extremist Web sites. In our comparison of terrorist/extremist Web sites to US government Web sites, we found that terrorists/extremist groups exhibited similar levels of Web knowledge as US government agencies. Moreover, terrorists/extremists had a strong emphasis on multimedia usage and their Web sites employed significantly more sophisticated multimedia technologies than government Web sites. We also found that the terrorists/extremist groups are as effective as the US government agencies in terms of supporting communications and interaction using Web technologies. Advanced Internet-based communication tools such as online forums and chat rooms are used much more frequently in terrorist/extremist Web sites than government Web sites. Based on our case study results, we believe that the DWAS is an effective tool to analyse the technical sophistication of terrorist/extremist groups' Internet usage and could contribute to an evidence-based understanding of the applications of Web technologies in the global terrorism phenomena.},

abstract = {Blogs, often treated as the equivalence of online personal diaries, have become one of the fastest growing types of Web-based media. Everyone is free to express their opinions and emotions very easily through blogs. In the blogosphere, many communities have emerged, which include hate groups and racists that are trying to share their ideology, express their views, or recruit new group members. It is important to analyze these virtual communities, defined based on membership and subscription linkages, in order to monitor for activities that are potentially harmful to society. While many Web mining and network analysis techniques have been used to analyze the content and structure of the Web sites of hate groups on the Internet, these techniques have not been applied to the study of hate groups in blogs. To address this issue, we have proposed a semi-automated approach in this research. The proposed approach consists of four modules, namely blog spider, information extraction, network analysis, and visualization. We applied this approach to identify and analyze a selected set of 28 anti-Blacks hate groups (820 bloggers) on Xanga, one of the most popular blog hosting sites. Our analysis results revealed some interesting demographical and topological characteristics in these groups, and identified at least two large communities on top of the smaller ones. The study also demonstrated the feasibility in applying the proposed approach in the study of hate groups and other related communities in blogs.},

This paper responds to this need by using an integrated knowledge-mapping framework that we developed to identify the core researchers and knowledge creation approaches in terrorism. The framework uses three types of analysis: (a) basic analysis of scientific output using citation, bibliometric, and social network analyses, (b) content map analysis of large corpora of literature, and (c) co-citation analysis to analyse linkages among pairs of researchers. We applied domain visualization techniques such as content map analysis, block-modeling, and co-citation analysis to the literature and author citation data from the years 1965 to 2003. The data were gathered from ten databases such as the ISI Web of Science. The results reveal: (1) the names of the top 42 core terrorism researchers (e.g., Brian Jenkins, Bruce Hoffman, and Paul Wilkinson) as well as their institutional affiliations; (2) their influential publications; (3) clusters of terrorism researchers who work in similar areas; and (4) that the research focus has shifted from terrorism as a low-intensity conflict to a strategic threat to world powers with increased focus on Osama Bin Laden.},

abstract = {In developing password policies, IT managers must strike a balance between security and memorability. Rules that improve structural integrity against attacks may also result in passwords that are difficult to remember. Recent technologies have relaxed the 8-character password constraint to permit the creation of longer pass-''phrases'' consisting of multiple words. Longer passphrases are attractive because they can improve security by increasing the difficulty of brute-force attacks and they might also be easy to remember. Yet, no empirical evidence concerning the actual usability of passphrases exists. This paper presents the results of a 12-week experiment that examines users' experience and satisfaction with passphrases. Results indicate that passphrase users experienced a rate of unsuccessful logins due to memory recall failure similar to that of users of self-generated simple passwords and stringent passwords. However, passphrase users had more failed login attempts due to typographical errors than did users of either simple or highly secure passwords. Moreover, although the typographical errors disappeared over time, passphrase users' initial problems negatively affected their end-of-experiment perceptions.},

abstract = {The rapid emergence of file sharing networks has enabled easier information dissemination and product access to potential consumers. At the same time, copyright protection technologies for securing digital products have been compromised repeatedly. To analyze the ensuing impacts on the market landscape for music products (a digital good), we develop a stochastic model of distribution of music album longevity on the Billboard Chart. We find that since the advent of file sharing networks and other market forces (such as legal changes in copyright laws, introduction of digital rights management systems and legitimate online music download offerings), the lifecycle of music albums has shortened with lowered probabilities of survival for each week. While the probability of survival past the first week is markedly lower, the future portends well for albums that do survive on the charts beyond the first week. This is consistent with the rapid diffusion of information on music albums in the changed market landscape. Integrating this insight with user activity on online computer networks, we estimate the continued success of albums on the charts. This analysis helps to create a more dynamic decision process on resource allocation to promote and market music products. Using the robust stochastic model parameters as a benchmark, we estimate a logistic regression model which helps us make quality decisions in an uncertain environment through early monitoring of the success of music albums.},

abstract = {It is well known that software errors may lead to information security vulnerabilities, the breach of which can have considerable negative impacts for organizations. Studies have found that a large percentage of security defects in e-business applications are due to design-related flaws, which could be detected and corrected during applications development. Traditional methods of managing software application vulnerabilities have often been ad hoc and inadequate. A recent approach that promises to be more effective is to incorporate security requirements as part of the application development cycle. However, there is limited practice of secure development of applications (SDA) and lack of research investigating the phenomenon. Motivated by such concerns, the goal of this research is to investigate the factors that may influence the intention of information systems (IS) professionals to practise SDA, i.e., incorporate security as part of the application development lifecycle. This study develops two models based on the widely used theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and theory of reasoned action (TRA) to explain the phenomenon. Following model operationalization, a field survey of 184 IS professionals was conducted to empirically compare the explanatory power of the TPB-based model versus the TRA-based model. Consistent with TPB and TRA predictions, attitude and subjective norm were found to significantly impact intention to practise SDA for the overall survey sample. Attitude was in turn determined by product usefulness and career usefulness of SDA, while subjective norm was determined by interpersonal influence, but not by external influence. Contrary to TPB predictions, perceived behavioural controls, conceptualized in terms of self-efficacy and facilitating conditions, had no significant effect on intention to practise SDA. Thus, a modified TRA-based model was found to offer the best explanation of behavioural intention to practise SDA. Implications for research and information security practice are suggested.},

Using politeness as an example, this study first investigated people's politeness orientations, and then their perceptions of websites containing error pages with messages featuring three different politeness strategies. Two hundred thirty-four senior high school students participated in this three (politeness orientations) by three (error messages) by two (frustration levels)-factorial experiment. Three-way ANOVAs and simple main effects analyses showed that people with different politeness orientations do respond differently to messages with different politeness strategies and different levels of associated frustration. This study shows that more research effort should be focused on whether and how the CASA phenomenon manifests itself in different computer-use situations and/or with different people.},

abstract = {Whilst multimedia technology has been one of the main contributing factors behind the Web's success, delivery of personalized multimedia content has been a desire seldom achieved in practice. Moreover, the perspective adopted is rarely viewed from a cognitive styles standpoint, notwithstanding the fact that they have significant effects on users' preferences with respect to the presentation of multimedia content. Indeed, research has thus far neglected to examine the effect of cognitive styles on users' subjective perceptions of multimedia quality. This paper aims to examine the relationships between users' cognitive styles, the multimedia quality of service delivered by the underlying network, and users' quality of perception (understood as both enjoyment and informational assimilation) associated with the viewed multimedia content. Results from the empirical study reported here show that all users, regardless of cognitive style, have higher levels of understanding of informational content in multimedia video clips (represented in our study by excerpts from television programmes) with weak dynamism, but that they enjoy moderately dynamic clips most. Additionally, multimedia content was found to significantly influence users' levels of understanding and enjoyment. Surprisingly, our study highlighted the fact that Bimodal users prefer to draw on visual sources for informational purposes, and that the presence of text in multimedia clips has a detrimental effect on the knowledge acquisition of all three cognitive style groups.},

Until now, nobody has tried to re-apply these modified techniques back into psychology. This paper describes work that addresses this matter. It focuses on the psychological knowledge possessed by all people that enables them to deal with everyday problems and make life decisions. We refer to this as 'personal knowledge'. To take a knowledge engineering approach to personal knowledge, we investigated the use of knowledge elicitation techniques to capture personal knowledge. We describe an empirical study involving ten participants and 80 knowledge acquisition sessions that assessed eight elicitation techniques in this context. The results revealed that each of the techniques showed promise at efficiently capturing and structuring aspects of an individual's personal knowledge. A content analysis of the acquired knowledge led to the construction of a meta-model (a primitive ontology) of personal knowledge and to the design for a new methodology for psychological research. From the perspective of psychology, the paper shows that knowledge engineering methods can be of value to psychologists. From the perspective of knowledge engineering and the wider computer science community, the paper shows that empirical methods used by psychologists can benefit the development and evaluation of ontologies and elicitation techniques.},

abstract = {Perception of universal facial beauty has long been debated amongst psychologists and anthropologists. In this paper, we perform experiments to evaluate the extent of universal beauty by surveying a number of diverse human referees to grade a collection of female facial images. Results obtained show that there exists a strong central tendency in the human grades, thus exhibiting agreement on beauty assessment. We then trained an automated classifier using the average human grades as the ground truth and used it to classify an independent test set of facial images. The high accuracy achieved proves that this classifier can be used as a general, automated tool for objective classification of female facial beauty. Potential applications exist in the entertainment industry, cosmetic industry, virtual media, and plastic surgery.},

Users of IRC are generally anonymous and involved with topic-based group discussions, whereas users of IM are known by their ''real'' names and communicate via one-on-one chitchatting. We found that avatars as symbols for users can have different characteristics in terms of self-identity and self-disclosure in different media. Gender is found to have significant moderation effect on avatar usage, whereas age is shown to have a mixed moderation effect.},

We argue that a perspective supported by semiotic and cognitively oriented discourse analyses offers both theoretical insights and motivates representational requirements for the semantics of tools for contesting meaning. We introduce our semiotic approach, highlighting its implications for discourse representation, before describing a research system (ClaiMaker) designed to support the construction of scholarly argumentation by allowing analysts to publish and contest 'claims' about scientific contributions. We show how ClaiMaker's representational scheme is grounded in specific assumptions concerning the nature of explicit modelling, and the evolution of meaning within a discourse community. These characteristics allow the system to represent scholarly discourse as a dynamic process, in the form of continuously evolving structures. A cognitively oriented discourse analysis then shows how the use of a small set of cognitive relational primitives in the underlying ontology opens possibilities for offering users advanced forms of computational service for analysing collectively constructed argumentation networks.},

To explore question order effects, user satisfaction was assessed prior to or after survey items. Data was collected from 517 employees using an ESS system. Results from partial least squares structural equation modelling suggests that (a) organizational support and information policy were positively related to ease of use, (b) usefulness was positively related to satisfaction and system usage, (c) ease of use and usefulness were negatively related to user strain and (d) ease of use fully mediates the relation between organizational support and strain as well as between information policy and strain. Evidence for a question order effect was found with increased satisfaction judgements, when satisfaction was assessed after the survey items.

Behaviour and Information Technology 25(2), 115-126] findings that users can form immediate aesthetic impression of web pages, and that these impressions are highly stable. Using explicit (subjective evaluations) and implicit (response latency) measures, the experiments demonstrated that, averaged over users, immediate aesthetic impressions of web pages are remarkably consistent. In Experiment 1, 40 participants evaluated 50 web pages in two phases. The average attractiveness ratings of web pages after a very short exposure of 500 ms were highly correlated with average attractiveness ratings after an exposure of 10 s. Extreme attractiveness evaluations (both positive and negative) were faster than moderate evaluations, landing convergent evidence to the hypothesis of immediate impression. The findings also suggest considerable individual differences in evaluations and in the consistency of those evaluations. In Experiment 2, 24 of the 50 web pages from Experiment 1 were evaluated again for their attractiveness after 500ms exposure. Subsequently, users evaluated the design of the web pages on the dimensions of classical and expressive aesthetics. The results showed high correlation between attractiveness ratings from Experiments 1 and 2. In addition, it appears that low attractiveness is associated mainly with very low ratings of expressive aesthetics. Overall, the results provide direct evidence in support of the premise that aesthetic impressions of web pages are formed quickly. Indirectly, these results also suggest that visual aesthetics plays an important role in users' evaluations of the IT artifact and in their attitudes toward interactive systems.},

The pervasive nature and ease of use associated with information display formats in wideiy used personal productivity software suggests that decision-makers are likely to create and/or use documents with both text-based and more visually oriented information displays. Past research has investigated the role of these displays on simple decision tasks; however, empirical research has not extended to more complex tasks, more comparable to the types of tasks decision-makers face every day. Results from the empirical analysis suggest that the relationship between information presentation format and decision performance is moderated by the complexity of the task. More specifically, spatial formats result in superior decision accuracy for simple- and complex-spatial tasks and faster decision time for all tasks except the complex-symbolic task where graphs and tables result in equivalent decision time.},

An interface agent is a reactive, collaborative, and autonomous visual computational system, which communicates directly with a person offering assistance and advice in performing computer-related tasks. The critical incident technique was employed to survey the actual users of an interface agent-based email notification application. Respondents were asked to provide the last most significant either positive or negative incident of the usage of interface agents in their email application. They were also asked to offer recommendations for designers and marketers of this technology. Sixty critical incidents were obtained and analysed. With regards to positive-outcome situations, one representative scenario was constructed. With respect to the negative-outcome events, three distinct scenarios were identified. Based on the critical incident technique, it is concluded that users acknowledge the quality of an agent when it acts reliably, an agent's intrusive behaviour results in an immediate agent usage termination, operability issues sometimes force people to reject the technology, and users attempt to preserve the employment of an agent under the negative impacts of external factors. A number of other practical recommendations for manufacturers and marketers are also outlined.},

Many studies focus on analysing cognitive processes and difficulties experienced by web users, but very few are interested in web designers' difficulties or in comparing their respective activities. Towards this end, the two experimental studies presented in this article compare the strategies developed both by professional web designers and (novice vs. experienced) web users while searching for information on web sites of varying ergonomic quality. More precisely, we investigated whether web designers can effectively use their own strategies as web users when designing web sites. We presented a comparison of novice web users, experienced web users and professional web designers searching behavior and cognitive load when using ergonomic and non-ergonomic web sites. In addition, we asked web designers to predict the strategy used by novice web users. Based on the results obtained in the two experiments, we conclude that web designers are not able to predict strategies of novice users and do not behave like novice users. Consequently, ways for supporting web designers in developing a user-centered activity are necessary, and certain ways are suggested at the end of this article.},

abstract = {One of the major challenges in computer vision is to create automated systems that perform tasks with at least the same competences as human experts. In particular for automated inspection of natural objects this is not easy to achieve. The task is hampered by large in-class variations and complex 3D-morphology of the objects and subtle argumentations of experts. For example, in our horticultural case we deal with quality assessment of young tomato plants, which requires experienced specialists. We submit that automation of such a task employing an explicit model of the objects and their assessment is preferred over a black-box model obtained from modelling input-output relations only. We propose to employ ontologies for representing the geometrical shapes, object parts and quality classes associated with the explicit models. Our main contribution is the description of a method to develop a white-box computer vision application in which the needed expert knowledge is defined by: (i) decomposing the task of the inspection system into subtasks and (ii) identifying the algorithms that execute the subtasks. This method describes the interaction between the task decomposition and the needed task-specific knowledge, and studies the delicate balance between general domain knowledge and task-specific details. As a proof of principle of this methodology, we work through a horticultural case study and argue that the method leads to a robust, well-performing, and extendable computer vision system.},

abstract = {The article describes two instruments for measuring Internet Usage and the changes in subjects' Internet usage following a controlled intervention. It focuses on the use of usage and lack of usage for measuring the digital gap. The ''digital gap'' is defined as the gap between individuals with and without access to technology (telephones, computers, Internet access) and related services. Since its emergence, the Internet has become the most important form of information and communication technology (ICT). The goal of the present research was to develop ways of measuring Internet usage for different segments of the Israeli population (it can also be used to measure Internet usage outside Israel). For the past few years, the Israeli government has sponsored programs designed to increase Internet usage in specific segments of the Israeli population. Some of these programs have been ''controlled programs''. Controlled Internet Usage Programs are planned and monitored programs, which use research methods to discover whether they have increased Internet usage and changed Internet habits. The population of Internet users in Israel is presently 45.8% (compared with 68.2% in the US population). The past 5 years has witnessed a significant rise in the number of Internet users in the West in general and in Israel specifically: an increase of 152% in the number of Israeli households connected to the Internet during the period 2000-2005. However, large differences are apparent between the stronger and weaker sections of the Israeli population where the Internet is concerned, and controlled intervention is therefore a very important means of reducing these discrepancies. The present article describes two measurement instruments: the first instrument examines on-line proficiency, while the second determines patterns of Internet use and the status of respondents' ''Internet awareness''. The instruments were built to determine the reduction in the digital divide associated with Internet usage following controlled intervention, and the population's Internet usage status before and after intervention. The difference between the two measurements represents the increase or decrease in Internet usage. These two instruments may be used by agencies making decisions about resource disbursement to reduce the digital divide in a variety of populations.},

Experiment 1 (N=32) shows positive effects of physical embodiment on the feeling of an agent's social presence, the evaluation of the agent, the assessment of public evaluation of the agent, and the evaluation of the interaction with the agent. A path analysis reveals that the feeling of the agent's social presence mediates the participants' evaluation of the social agent. Experiment 2 (N=32) shows that physical embodiment with restricted tactile interaction causes null or even negative effects in human-agent interaction. In addition, Experiment 2 indicates that lonely people feel higher social presence of social agents, and provide more positive social responses to social agents than non-lonely people. The importance of physical embodiment and tactile communication in human-agent interaction and the diverse role of social robots, especially for the lonely population, are discussed.},

abstract = {Typically, we have several tasks at hand, some of which are in interrupted state while others are being carried out. Most of the time, such interruptions are not disruptive to task performance. Based on the theory of Long-Term Working Memory (LTWM; Ericsson, K.A., Kintsch, W., 1995. Long-term working memory. Psychological Review, 102, 211-245), we posit that unless there are enough mental skills and resources to encode task representations to retrieval structures in long-term memory, the resulting memory traces will not enable reinstating the information, which can lead to memory losses. However, once encoded to LTWM, they are virtually safeguarded. Implications of the theory were tested in a series of experiments in which the reading of an expository text was interrupted by a 30-s interactive task, after which the reading was continued. The results convey the remarkably robust nature of skilled memory-when LTWM encoding speed is fast enough for the task-processing imposed by the interface, interruptions have no effect on memory, regardless of their pacing, intensity, or difficulty. In the final experiment where presentation time in the main task was notably speeded up to match the limits of encoding speed, interruptions did hamper memory. Based on the results and the theory, we argue that auditory rehearsal or time-based retrieval cues were not utilized in surviving interruptions and that they are in general weaker strategies for surviving interruptions in complex cognitive tasks. We conclude the paper by suggesting three ways to support interruption tolerance by the means of task and interface design: (1) actively facilitating the development of memory skills, (2) matching encoding speed to task processing demands, and (3) supporting encoding-retrieval symmetry.},

This paper reports on a study that attempts to expand the set of post-adoption beliefs in the ECM, in order to extend the application of the ECM beyond an instrumental focus. The expanded ECM, incorporating the post-adoption beliefs of perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment and perceived ease of use, was empirically validated with data collected from an on-line survey of 811 existing users of mobile Internet services. The data analysis showed that the expanded ECM has good explanatory power (R^2=57.6% of continued IT usage intention and R^2=67.8% of satisfaction), with all paths supported. Hence, the expanded ECM can provide supplementary information that is relevant for understanding continued IT usage. The significant effects of post-adoption perceived ease of use and perceived enjoyment signify that the nature of the IT can be an important boundary condition in understanding the continued IT usage behavior. At a practical level, the expanded ECM presents IT product/service providers with deeper insights into how to address IT users' satisfaction and continued patronage.},

abstract = {Agile Software Development methodologies have grown in popularity both among academic researchers and industrial practitioners. Among the various methodologies or practices proposed, pair programming, which is concerned with two programmers collaborating on design, coding and testing, has become a controversial focus of interest. Even though some success stories have been reported with the use of pair-programming in real software development environment, many people remain rather skeptical of the claims on pair-programming productivity. Previous studies in pair programming have only addressed the basic understanding of the productivity of pairs and they have not addressed the variation in productivity between pairs of varying skills and experience, such as between novice-novice and expert-expert. Statistical productivity measurements reported by different researchers also seem to lead to contradictory conclusions. Until now, the literature has not addressed how those results and experiments were related to each other. In this paper, we propose a controlled experiment called repeat-programming which can facilitate the understanding of relationships between human experience and programming productivity. Repeat-programming can be performed when controversial issues in non-traditional programming methodologies and development productivity need to be investigated into. To illustrate how the proposed empirical experiment can put arguable, divisive problems into perspective, we have examined the productivity in pair programming as a case study. With repeat-programming, we are able to (i) better understand why results of previous pair programming control experiments reached different conclusions as to the productivity of pair programming and (ii) most importantly, present a case in which novice-novice pairs against novice solos are much more productive than expert-expert pairs against expert solos.},

abstract = {The Internet is estimated to grow significantly as access to Web content in some non-English languages continues to increase. However, prior research in human-computer interaction (HCI) has implicitly assumed the primary language used on the Web to be English. This assumption is not true for many non-English-speaking regions where rapidly growing on-line populations access the Web in their native languages. For example, Latin America, where the majority of people speak Spanish, will have the fastest growing population in coming decades. However, existing Spanish search engines lack search, browse, and analysis capabilities. The research reported here studied human information seeking on the non-English Web. In it we developed a Spanish business Web portal that supports searching, browsing, summarization, categorization, and visualization of Spanish business Web pages. Using 42 Spanish speakers as subjects we conducted a two-phase experiment to evaluate this portal and found that, compared with a Spanish search engine and a Spanish Web directory, it achieved significantly better user ratings on information quality, cross-regional search capability, system performance attributes, and overall satisfaction. Subjects' verbal comments strongly favored the search and browse functionality and user interface of our portal. As the Web becomes more international, this research makes three contributions: (1) an empirical evaluation of the performance level of a Spanish search portal; (2) an examination of the information quality, cross-regional search capability and usability of search engines for the non-English Web; and (3) a better understanding of non-English Web searching.},

The I-PEFiC model provides an integrative perspective on human-character interaction, assuming that the processes of engagement and user interaction exchange information in explaining user responses with interface characters. An experiment using the Sims2 game was conducted to test the effects of aesthetics (beautiful versus ugly, as engagement factor) and affordances (help versus obstacle, as interaction factor) of interface characters on use intentions, user engagement, and user satisfaction. Results of the experiment showed that (1) people tended to use helpful characters more than obstructing characters, (2) user engagement was enhanced by beauty and perceived affordance of the character whereas (3) intentions to use the character were not affected by good looks, and (4) the most satisfied users were those that were engaged with the character as well as willing to use it. This stresses the importance of enhancing affordances so to increase user engagement with interface characters. The I-PEFiC model provided a valuable framework to study the (interdependent) effects of relevant factors in human-character interaction.},

abstract = {In a competitive environment of frequent and rapid change, electronic business (e-business), whose supply, production, and logistics and distribution networks are enabled digitally, is increasingly dependent on electronic interconnections that are innovative in their functionality. Conceivably, its ability to deliver functions and services is closely associated with and helpful for the completion of employees' tasks and jobs, leading to service quality being critically important for both the employees and e-business (EB). On the other hand, since EB utilizes enterprise applications, user satisfaction, as a surrogate measure of information system (IS) or information technology (IT) effectiveness/success is also important for enterprise applications success. Thus, this research attempts to extrapolate the results of marketing research concerning customers' perceptions of service quality and IS/IT research as to employees' perceptions of service quality with EB. First, we revise the SERVQUAL instrument to fit the new context of EB and measure employees' perceived service quality with EB. Based on a survey of 161 respondents practicing mostly in seven international electronic businesses in Taiwan, a 13-item EB-SERVQUAL instrument is proposed. This can be used to improve and diagnose the service quality of EB. Second, we examine user satisfaction with enterprise applications and its causal link in relation to service quality with EB. The instrument and our findings in this paper will be valuable to researchers and practitioners interested in designing, implementing, and managing EB.},

These factors, however, are insufficient to explain a user's continuance intention in the online shopping context. In this study we extended TPB with two EDT constructs-disconfirmation and satisfaction-for studying users' continuance intention in the online shopping context. By employing longitudinal method with two-stage survey, we empirically validated the proposed model and research hypotheses.},

The independent variable in experiment 1 was the watermark transparency (20%, 40% and 60%). The independent variable in experiment 2 was the music format with five levels: no music, vocal and instrumental version at high volume, vocal and instrumental version at low volume, instrumental version at high volume and instrumental version at low volume. The results showed that the watermarks transparency and format were effective in mobile advertising. The 60% watermark was found better than the 20% and 40% watermarks. The 40% watermark was found better than the 20% watermark for advertisement recall only. Music and vocal/instrumental music versions were effective in mobile advertisements. The vocal music version was found effective in mobile advertising. Music with both vocal and instrumental versions was more effective in advertisement recall than instrumental music for mobile device users.},

This study seeks to explore weblog success from a technology perspective, i.e. from the impact of weblog-building technology (or blogging tool). Based on an examination of 126 highly successful weblogs tracked over a period of 3 months, we categorized weblogs in terms of popularity rank and growth, and evaluated the relationship between weblog success (in terms of popularity) and technology use. Our analysis indicates that weblog success is associated with the type of blogging tool used. We argue that technology characteristics affect the presentation and organization of weblog content, as well as the social interaction between bloggers, and in turn, affect weblog success or popularity improvement. Based on this analysis, we propose a techno-social success model for weblogs. This model postulates that a weblog's success is mainly associated with its ability to provide value for its users and readers at the content, the technology, and the social levels.},

In this paper, we present a general unified decision-theoretic framework based on influence diagrams for simultaneously modeling user affect recognition and assistance. Affective state recognition is achieved through active probabilistic inference from the available multi modality sensory data. User assistance is automatically accomplished through a decision-making process that balances the benefits of keeping the user in productive affective states and the costs of performing user assistance. We discuss three theoretical issues within the framework, namely, user affect recognition, active sensory action selection, and user assistance. Validation of the proposed framework via a simulation study demonstrates its capability in efficient user affect recognition as well as timely and appropriate user assistance. Besides the theoretical contributions, we build a non-invasive real-time prototype system to recognize different user affective states (stress and fatigue) from four-modality user measurements, namely physical appearance features, physiological measures, user performance, and behavioral data. The affect recognition component of the prototype system is subsequently validated through a real-world study involving human subjects.},

Both the numbers of different types of identified problems and the severity of the problems are investigated. Based on this knowledge, practitioners could adapt the set up of their user tests to effectively find as many aspects of the game as possible that merit change, according to the aims of the developers. The study shows that usability problems caused by a lack of knowledge were more often identified during first use. Furthermore, fun problems related to a too-high challenge level may disappear after some practice, whereas fun problems caused by the game taking over control for too long while the user wants to proceed playing the game were identified more often after some practice. The study shows that the impact severity of problems detected during first use was higher than when children had more practice with a game. As a result of these changes in experienced problems the commonly used measures efficiency, effectiveness and satisfaction increased when children had practiced with the game. Finally, the study also shows that the set of most severe problems identified during first use may be radically different from the set of most severe problems identified after some practice.},

abstract = {This paper describes results of a usability study of contrasting user-interface designs for Internet Banking (eBanking). Two specific interface metaphors were compared in the first experiment, linear form filling and array editing interaction modes. Terminology in the interaction dialogue was compared in the second experiment, using typical banking language and a generic, plain language interface. This research aimed to perform usability evaluation and comparison of the alternative interface designs to illuminate the development of new eBanking services. This research involved sixty-one participants (Internet users and customers of the involved Bank) exploring the designs in controlled experiments involving hands-on experience. Banks are interested in ensuring their eBanking services are highly customer-centric and that the interface matches customer expectations in order to drive customers towards this lower cost channel. The results of the first experiment (N=32, where N indicates the number of participants in the cohort) concluded that the simple form-filling metaphor, taken from the traditional paper-based procedure, was generally more usable than a Spreadsheet metaphor. In the second experiment (N=29), it was found that although banking terminology was not completely understood across the cohort, the instructional language changes did not impact significantly on usability.},

abstract = {Three different versions of a voice-operated mobile city guide service with a hierarchically structured dialogue were evaluated in a mobile setting. One numbered menu style (standard) service, and two services which contained terms derived from underlying real-world referents, were implemented. The real-world referents (metaphors) used were: an office filing system and a computer desktop. It was hypothesized that the use of interface metaphors would allow more participants to visualize the service structure, leading to an improvement in performance relative to the standard service. Forty-two phone users undertook three different tasks with one of the three phone services. User performance and attitudes to the services were recorded, and post-task interviews were conducted. Results showed that significantly more participants using the metaphor-based services visualized the services. Visualizers performed significantly better than non-visualizers, with visualization emerging as a significant predictor of both attitude and performance. We argue that designing speech-based mobile phone services using an appropriate spatial metaphor leads to high levels of visualisation, which allows participants to orient themselves and to navigate more effectively within the hierarchical service architecture. The usability benefits afforded by visualization may become especially important when using phone services in cognitively demanding mobile settings.},

abstract = {Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) constitute an attractive knowledge-based methodology, combining the robust properties of fuzzy logic and neural networks. FCMs represent causal knowledge as a signed directed graph with feedback and provide an intuitive framework which incorporates the experts' knowledge. FCMs handle available information and knowledge from an abstract point of view. They develop behavioural model of the system exploiting the experience and knowledge of experts. The construction of FCMs is based mainly on experts who determine the structure of FCM, i.e. concepts and weighted interconnections among concepts. But this methodology may not be a sufficient model of the system because the human factor is not always reliable. Thus the FCM model of the system may requires restructuring which is achieved through adjustment the weights of FCM interconnections using specific learning algorithms for FCMs. In this article, two unsupervised learning algorithms are presented and compared for training FCMs; how they define, select or fine-tuning weights of the causal interconnections among concepts. The implementation and results of these unsupervised learning techniques for an industrial process control problem are discussed. The simulations results of training the process system verify the effectiveness, validity and advantageous characteristics of those learning techniques for FCMs.},

As a result, new group technologies have been introduced to enhance communication and decision-making in these settings. Unfortunately, little research examining the impact of these new collaborative technologies has been undertaken, and most of it has been undertaken in laboratory environments, rather than in operational or safety-critical settings. Two primary differences of the operational setting in this study suggest that results may differ from studies undertaken in laboratory environments: (1) the system has a strong hierarchical organization and culture with clearly defined roles and (2) roles in the system are associated with different information access privileges. This paper explores the impact of introducing new technology on communication and collaboration between dispersed decision-making groups in marine transportation, and focuses on the differences in results observed in this operational setting.},

The framework is then validated via a series of qualitative, longitudinal studies. In each study, genuine consumers searched online for information and advice concerning their specific health issue. They engaged in free searching and were directed towards sites previously reviewed using the framework. Thematic analysis of the group discussions provided support for the framework and for the staged model of trust wherein design appeal predicted rejection (mistrust) and credibility of information and personalization of content predicted selection (trust) of advice sites. The results are discussed in terms of the merits of the framework, its limitations and directions for future work.},

In the first experiment, 30 black and white geometric images were developed by systematically varying these three attributes in order to validate computational aesthetic quantification algorithms with subject ratings. The second experiment employed the same image layout as Experiment 1 but with realistic looking web pages as stimuli. The images were rated by 16 subjects in each experiment using the ratio-scale magnitude estimation method against a benchmark image with average balance and symmetry values and a standard number of elements. Subjects also established an ordered list of the images according to their aesthetic appeal using the Balanced-Incomplete-Block (BIB) ranking method. Results from both experiments show that subjects are adept at judging symmetry and balance in both the horizontal and vertical directions and thus the quantification of those attributes is justified. The first experiment establishes a relationship between a higher symmetry value and aesthetic appeal for the basic imagery showing that subjects preferred symmetric over non-symmetric images. The second experiment illustrates that increasing the number of groups in a web page causes a decrease in the aesthetic appeal rating.},

abstract = {Internet-based helpdesks for hardware and software are a common way to get expert advice. To communicate effectively with experts, laypersons should be able to provide the expert with a concise and comprehensive description of their computer problem. However, previous research on computer helpdesks has shown that laypersons' problem descriptions typically exhibit a number of unfavourable features making it difficult for the helpdesk expert to develop a correct understanding of the problem. Based on a discussion of these features, we developed a problem formulation script that supports laypersons in describing their computer problems. We conducted an experimental study (54 laypersons and 54 experts), which tested the effectiveness of different versions of the problem formulation script to improve the quality of laypersons' problem descriptions. The results show that computer experts were best able to reconstruct the actual problem from the layperson's description if they were prompted to describe successively (1) the goal of their interaction with the computer, (2) the steps they had undertaken so far and (3) a hypothesis why they had failed to reach the aim. The script helped the laypersons provide the relevant context information necessary to develop an adequate mental model of the problem. Hence, guiding laypersons' problem descriptions by a problem formulation script proved to be a successful approach to support Internet-based helpdesk communication between computer experts and laypersons.},

Most adaptive delivery mechanisms for streaming multimedia content do not explicitly consider user-perceived quality when making adaptation decisions. Equally, video quality evaluation techniques are not designed to evaluate instantaneous quality where the quality is changing over time. We propose that an Optimal Adaptation Trajectory (OAT) through the set of possible encoding exists, and that it indicates how to adapt encoding quality in response to changes in network conditions in order to maximize user-perceived quality. The subjective and objective tests carried out to find such trajectories for a number of different MPEG-4 video clips are described. Experimental subjective testing results are presented that demonstrate the dynamic nature of user perception with adapting multimedia. The results demonstrate that adaptation using the OAT out-performs conventional adaptation strategies in which only a single aspect of the video quality is adapted. In contrast, the OAT provides a mechanism to adapt multiple aspects of the video quality thereby giving better user-perceived quality in both the short and long term.},

They serve as educational and communicative vehicle for reaching the above goals. In this article, we provide a pattern language focusing on technical issues during groupware development.

Information elements include: knowing who changed the artifact, what those changes involve, where changes occur, when changes were made, how things have changed and why people made the changes. The framework accounts for people's need to view these changes from different perspectives: an artifact-based view, a person-based view and a workspace-based view. Each information element is further broken down into distinguishing features and matched against these perspectives, e.g., location history within the where category prompts the questions 'where was this artifact when I left' in the artifact-based view, 'where in the workspace has a person visited' in the person-based view and 'where have people been in the workspace' in the workspace-based view. The framework can be used both to inform and critique change awareness tools.},

Commercial groupware products now support millions of collaborations per year. Under certain circumstances teams that use group support systems perform far better than groups that do not. However, as impressive as the achievements are in this field, we can do better. A rigorous theoretical approach to the design of collaboration technology and process can lead us to non-intuitive design choices that produce successes beyond those possible with an intuitive, seat-of-the-pants approach. This paper explains the simple structure of a rigorous scientific theory and offers examples of theory-driven design choices that produced substantial benefits. It then differentiates rigorous theory from several classes of theory that have intuitive appeal, but cannot inform design choices. It concludes that the logic of the theory-driven design approach suggests that the most useful focus for collaboration technology researchers would be the technology-supported work-process, rather than just the technology.},

One of the key concepts in Collaboration Engineering is the thinkLet-a codified facilitation technique that creates a predictable pattern of collaboration. Because thinkLets produce a predictable pattern of interactions among people working together toward a goal they can be used as snap-together building blocks for team process designs.

abstract = {Evaluating on-line collaborative learning interactions is a complex task due to the variety of elements and factors that take place and intervene in the way a group of students comes together to collaborate in order to achieve a learning goal. The aim of this paper is to provide a better understanding of group interaction and determine how to best support the collaborative learning process. To that end, we propose a principled framework for the study and analysis of group interaction and group scaffolding which is built by combining different aspects and issues of collaboration, learning and evaluation. In particular, we define learning activity indicators at several levels of description which prompt to the application of a mixed interaction analysis scheme and the use of different data types and specific tools. At an initial layer, the basis of the approach is set by applying a qualitative process for evaluating the individual and group task performance as well as the group functioning and scaffolding. The interaction analysis process is completed by defining and applying two more layers: a social network analysis of the group activity and participation behaviour and a quantitative analysis of group effectiveness as regards task achievement and active interaction involvement. Our work defines a grounded and holistic conceptual model that describes on-line collaborative learning interactions sufficiently and applies it in a real, web-based, complex and long-term collaborative learning situation. An in-depth empirical evaluation of the conceptual model is fully discussed, which demonstrates the usefulness and value of the approach.},

This research examined a range of synthetic environment (SE) design features (viewpoint, auditory cue type and visual background) suspected to influence presence, and evaluated differences in presence, workload and task performance caused by manipulations of the factors and task difficulty in a virtual-reality-based basketball free-throw task. Thirty-two research participants were also required to perform secondary-monitoring tasks to assess attention allocation to the virtual and (surrounding) real environments, as an indicator of presence. Analysis of variance results demonstrated immersiveness (viewpoint) and auditory cue type to significantly influence the sense of subjective presence and perceptions of workload. Virtual task performance was significantly affected by task difficultly. This study also provided further evidence of significant positive relations between presence and workload, but no evidence of a correlation of objective presence and performance. These results have general applicability for the design of multimodal SE-based interfaces for real-world tasks, such as telerobot control.},

abstract = {Despite a reported recognition accuracy rate of 98%, speech recognition technologies have yet to be widely adopted by computer users. When considering hands-free use of speech-based solutions, as is the case for individuals with physical impairments that interfere with the use of traditional solutions such as a mouse, the considerable time required to complete basic navigation tasks presents a significant barrier to adoption. Several solutions were proposed to improve navigation efficiency based on the results of a previous study. In the current study, a longitudinal experiment was conducted to investigate the process by which users learn to use hands-free speech-based navigation in the context of large vocabulary, continuous dictation tasks as well the efficacy of the proposed solutions. Due to the influence initial interactions have on the adoption of speech-based solutions, the current study focused on these critical, initial, interactions of individuals with no prior experience using speech-based dictation solutions. Our results confirm the efficacy of the solutions proposed earlier while providing valuable insights into the strategies users employ when using speech-based navigation commands as well as design decisions that can influence these patterns.},

abstract = {The objective of this research was to assess the effectiveness of using a multi-modal interface for adaptive automation (AA) of human control of a simulated telerobotic (remote-control, semi-autonomous robotic) system. We investigated the use of one or more sensory channels to cue dynamic control allocations to a human operator or computer, as part of AA, and to support operator system/situation awareness (SA) and performance. It was expected that complex auditory and visual cueing through system interfaces might address previously observed SA decrements due to unannounced or unexpected automation-state changes as part of adaptive system control. AA of the telerobot was based on a predetermined schedule of manual- and supervisory-control allocations occurring when operator workload changes were expected due to the stages of a teleoperation task. The task involved simulated underwater mine disposal and 32 participants were exposed to four types of cueing of task-phase and automation-state changes including icons, earcons, bi-modal (combined) cues and no cues at all. Fully automated control of the telerobot combined with human monitoring produced superior performance compared to completely manual system control and AA. Cueing, in general, led to better performance than none, but did not appear to completely eliminate temporary SA deficits due to changes in control and associated operator reorienting. Bi-modal cueing of dynamic automation-state changes was more supportive of SA than modal (single sensory channel) cueing. The use of icons and earcons appeared to produce no additional perceived workload in comparison no cueing. The results of this research may serve as an applicable guide for the design of human-computer interfaces for real telerobotic systems, including those used for military tactical operations, which support operator achievement and maintenance of SA and promote performance in using AA.},

In phase 1, six expert news readers and a panel of HCI experts were solicited for input regarding genre-conforming and genre-violating web news page design, navigation, and story categorization. In phase 2, a longitudinal experiment with a group of 25 novice web news readers who were exposed to one of the two designs over 5 sessions is reported. During these sessions a variety of user data were captured, including: comprehension (recall, recognition), usability (time on task, accuracy, user satisfaction), and navigation (path length, category node hits). The between-group difference of web site design was significant for comprehension, usability, and navigation with the users of the genre-conforming design demonstrating better performance. The within-group difference of time was significant across these three measures as well, with performance improving over time. No interaction effect was found between web site design and time on comprehension or usability. However, a surprising interaction effect was found on navigation; specifically the breadth of navigation (i.e. the number of nodes visited for two classes of tasks) increased over time more dramatically for the genre-violating group than for the genre-conforming group. By examining the changes in these data over time and between the two designs, evidence for the development of users' mental representations of structure was captured.},

Results of our studies support the viability of gestural TAP as a usability evaluation method and provide additional evidence that the cognitive systems used to produce successful verbal protocols in people who are hearing seem to work similarly in people who speak with gestures. The challenges for adapting the TAP method for gestural language relate to how the data was collected and not to the data or its analysis.},

abstract = {We propose that in many contexts of text use, people need to consult a mental representation of the mapping between the content of documents and their structure. We report three experiments that investigate the construction and use of such 'structure maps.' In each experiment people read multiple on-line texts on the same topic, and then searched for specific pieces of information in those texts. Search performance was compared with people who had not read the texts. People who had read multiple texts were, to some extent, able to recall where information was in the texts as shown by the locations in which they first searched (Experiments 1 and 2) or the number of pages opened during a search (Experiment 3). We also found that readers of multiple texts were able to find facts in those texts faster than were people who had not read the texts, and that this speedup was not a simple effect of faster reading while scanning for facts (Experiments 1 and 2) or of greater familiarity with the general topic (Experiment 3). These incidental effects of reading occurred whether or not participants were warned before reading that they would have subsequently to search the texts and were not compromised by transformations in the appearance of text (double column to single column) that disrupted the positions of facts on pages (Experiment 2). We conclude that readers spontaneously construct structure maps of multiple electronic texts, even when their reading goal stresses abstraction of meaning across sources. Structure maps likely play a vital role in many aspects of text use, such as re-reading and knowledge updating, so that their support is an important consideration in the design of on-line texts.},

Despite the debate, limited research has focused on the impact these interfaces have on how people ascribe responsibility to computing technology. Drawing from social psychology, empirical work regarding social responses toward computing technology, and attribution theory, this research empirically tests a model developed by Marakas et al. [2000. A theoretical model of differential social attributions toward computing technology: when the metaphor becomes the model. International Journal of Human Computer Studies 52, 719-750] which identifies and explains several of the factors that contribute to differential social attributions toward computing technology. Using data from 240 students and professionals, results from a laboratory study indicate that attributions toward computing technology are influenced by an individual's core self-evaluations, their generalized beliefs about the social role of computing technology and the nature of the computer interface used. Specifically, the results provide support for the argument that certain individuals do indeed attribute independent agency to computing technology and respond accordingly, and that this propensity is magnified when exposed to a computer with a distinctly social interface.

In order to compensate the lack between the information presented by the supervisory control system and the information needed, operators tailor the information presentation. Currently, there is a lack of theoretical understanding of tailoring activities and hence fundamental principles for the design of supervisory control systems that support tailoring activities in a systematic manner. Any data being presented to the operator is on one of the four different scale types proposed by Stevens. The scale type of data is determined by how values are assigned to the dimensions of the system being supervised and each scale type specifies a set of operations that can be legitimately applied to data on this scale type. Based on the concept of scale transformation the paper proposes systematic principles for operator-initiated adaptation of the interpretation of system properties as presented by the supervisory control system. The value of the approach is illustrated by means of examples.},

abstract = {Advances in computing techniques, as well as the reduction in the cost of technology, have made possible the viability and spread of complex virtual environments (VEs). However, efficient navigation within these environments remains problematic for the user. Several research projects have shown that users of VEs are often disoriented and have extreme difficulty completing navigational tasks. Furthermore, there is often more than one route to get to a specified destination. Novice users often lack the spatial knowledge needed to pick an appropriate route due to the deficiency of experience with the system. A number of navigation tools such as maps, 3-D thumbnails, trails, and personal agents have been proposed. The introduction of these tools have met with some degree of success, but most researchers agree that new techniques need to be developed to aid users efficiently navigate within complex VEs. In this paper, we propose the frequent wayfinding-sequence (FWS) methodology that uses a modified sequence mining technique to discover a model of routes taken by experienced users of a VE. The model is used to build an interface that provides navigation assistance to novice users by recommending routes. We conducted both real world and simulation experiments using our methodology. Results from the real world experiment suggest that the FWS approach has the potential to improve the user's navigation performance and the quality of the human-computer interaction. Our simulation studies showed that our approach is scalable, efficient, and able to find useful route models for complex VEs.},

However, there is a dearth of research seeking to understand how users relate to this control set and how useful it actually is in practice. This paper details our empirical investigation of the issue. A digital video navigation system with a VCR-like control set was developed and subsequently used by a large sample of users (n=200), who were required to complete a number of goal-directed navigational tasks. Each user's navigational activity was tracked and recorded automatically by the system. Analysis of the navigational data revealed a range of results concerning how the VCR-like control set both enhanced and limited the user's ability to locate sequences of interest, including a number of searching and browsing strategies that were exploited by the users.},

abstract = {A well-established effect of animated agents in educational and other contexts is their potential to motivate and engage. ''Increased motivation in users'' is also one of the more frequent answers given to the question, ''What is gained by adding an animated pedagogical agent to an intelligent tutoring system?'' To further develop and exploit this potential, there are, however, several issues that need to be resolved. In this article we discuss the visual form and look of animated pedagogical agents. A survey is presented of how the area is approached (and, in particular, not approached) in research on animated pedagogical agents. Two possible reasons are proposed as to why visual form and look are so little addressed are also proposed. We also propose and discuss some key aspects of look that merit a systematic approach in future research. The main thesis of the paper is that users' visuo-aesthetic experience of animated pedagogical agents is too important with respect to the goals to motivate and engage, to be treated as a secondary issue. We do not deny that there are other pressing and fundamental issues that need to be solved, such as those concerning the content of the support and the competence level of agents, as well as various design elements that can contribute to making animated agents lifelike. But we argue that visual rendering issues are pressing and need to be seriously addressed as well.},

abstract = {A wide range of algorithms have been developed for various types of negotiating agents. In developing such algorithms the main focus has been on their efficiency and their effectiveness. However, this is only a part of the picture. Typically, agents negotiate on behalf of their owners and for this to be effective the agents must be able to adequately represent their owners' strategies and preferences for negotiation. However, the process by which such knowledge is acquired is typically left unspecified. To address this problem, we undertook a study of how user information about negotiation tradeoff strategies and preferences can be captured. Specifically, we devised a novel default-then-adjust acquisition technique. In this, the system firstly does a structured interview with the user to suggest the attributes that the tradeoff could be made between, then it asks the user to adjust the suggested default tradeoff strategy by improving some attribute to see how much worse the attribute being traded off can be made while still being acceptable, and, finally, it asks the user to adjust the default preference on the tradeoff alternatives. This method is consistent with the principles of standard negotiation theory and to demonstrate its effectiveness we implemented a prototype system and performed an empirical evaluation in an accommodation renting scenario. The result of this evaluation indicates the proposed technique is helpful and efficient in accurately acquiring the users' tradeoff strategies and preferences.},

abstract = {This paper reports an experiment that examined the comprehensibility of the LabVIEW programming representation. LabVIEW is a visual programming language (VPL) based on the dataflow paradigm. The experiment compared LabVIEW to a semantically equivalent textual language using three types of tasks: (1) tracing problems: given code and input values, subjects were asked what output the code would produce if executed. (2) Parallelism problems: given code with several program statements highlighted, subjects were asked about the sequence in which those statements could execute. (3) Debugging problems: given code and its specifications, subjects were asked to find a logic error in the code. The experiment measured the subjects' time to solve the problems and accuracy of the answers. The subjects were upper-level university students who were intermediate-level programmers with no prior exposure to LabVIEW. Their performances showed differences due to representation for all three task types. Subjects using the textual representation completed the tracing problems significantly faster than subjects using the visual representation. In contrast, subjects using the visual representation were significantly faster for the parallelism problems and significantly more accurate for both the parallelism and debugging problems. These results contribute clear evidence for selected benefits of a visual representation for small-sized code segments, evidence that LabVIEW succeeds in highlighting data dependencies, and evidence that LabVIEW helps programmers to maintain an overview of their code. The authors consider the implications of these results for VPLs more generally.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) has evolved in technology and applications within the last decade. Technical advances have led to the development of novel interaction devices, interaction concepts, more reliable and robust VR set-ups, advanced visualization and modeling software. However, decisions regarding which VR set-ups and devices are suitable for particular applications are becoming more difficult due to the rapid stream of technical development. In the ''VIEW of the Future'' project (IST-2000-26089), the development process was coupled with an extensive and multivariable evaluation procedure. The latter has taken advantage of direct neurophysiological and psychophysiological measurements and a variety of self-report tools administered in a set of different but closely linked experiments. Furthermore, the implementation of VR solutions in different applications was examined with a socio-economic perspective, by applying a multi-criteria analysis (MCA) using an analytical hierarchical model. The data collected during the experimental trials enabled us to reach general conclusions regarding the systems used, and to derive applicability guidelines to facilitate the implementation of VR products. This paper presents all aspects of the evaluation methodology: Usability Test Battery for neuro- and psycho-physiological measurements, VIEW-IT heuristic assessment tool, questionnaires, MCA methodology). A summary of the results includes usability and ergonomic findings for different VR set-ups, and the impact of VR implementation on a variety of applications.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of Virtual Prints (ViPs) as an intuitive metaphor for supporting interaction and navigation, as well as a number of additional tasks in virtual environments (VEs). Three types of ViPs are described: Virtual Footprints, which are used for tracking user navigation (position, orientation and movement), Virtual Handprints, which are used for tracing user interaction with the VE, and Virtual Markers, which are 'special' marks (usually coupled with information) that can be created upon user request. In a VE, the ViPs concept is instantiated and supported through a software mechanism (the ViPs mechanism) that allows users to create, manage and interact with their personal ViPs, as well as other users' ViPs. The paper presents the background and related work upon which the suggested concept builds, as well as the distinctive properties that differentiate ViPs from other related efforts. An account of how users can interact with ViPs is provided and related issues and challenges are discussed along with techniques and methods for addressing them. The paper also describes the process followed towards defining and experimenting with the concept of ViPs by means of iterative design and evaluation of an interactive prototype. This process involved exploratory studies, as well as several inspections and formal tests with both experts and potential end-users, in order to assess the usefulness of the concept and identify possible shortcomings, and also to evaluate and improve the usability of the proposed designs and software prototypes. In general, the findings of the studies reinforce the initial hypothesis that ViPs are an intuitive and powerful concept, and show that the related software is easy to learn and use. Overall, the results of the studies support strong evidence that an appropriately designed and implemented, fully functional ViPs mechanism can significantly increase the usability of VEs.},

This paper discusses the process of collecting feedback on prototype designs for VR/VE interaction devices from both expert users and non-expert users, and demonstrates how the information gained from human centred evaluation can be used to further the design process. Experiment 1 examined the usability of two magnetically tracked interaction devices with three different types of menus (Sphere, Linear and Fan). Quantitative and qualitative analysis was carried out on the results, and usability problems with the menus and devices are discussed. The findings from this experiment were translated into general design guidance, in addition to specific recommendations. A new device was designed on the basis of some of these recommendations and its usability was evaluated in Experiment 2. Feedback from participants in Experiment 2 demonstrated that the design recommendations emerging from Experiment 1 were successfully applied to develop a more usable and acceptable device.},

abstract = {The use of visualization technologies by the automotive industry is primarily aimed at increasing competitive advantage. Within the VIEW of the Future project (IST-2000-26089), two automotive companies, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Volvo Technology Corporation, had a need for targeted evaluation of practical issues in their potential use of VR/VE technology. PSA Peugeot Citroen would like to use visualization technology to accelerate and increase the efficiency of their product design cycle. A series of short experiments were conducted to enable PSA Peugeot Citroen to define the technological specifications of a CAVE-type system they would be purchasing to achieve their design goals. The results documented the fidelity of the visualization environment and user experience of the different configuration set-ups. For example, although passive stereo offered more brightness and better representation of colours, PSA Peugeot Citroen employees preferred active stereo due to the distracting ghosting effect present when using passive stereo. Thus PSA Peugeot Citroen chose to implement active stereo in their new system. There is a need for the engineers at the Volvo product companies to present more realistic vehicle components, e.g. car interior parts, in early product development phases. It is not known if the present computer graphics technology can represent vehicle components with high realism in practical applications. In the study reported here, we investigated the perception of visual appearance of virtual surface materials as well as real material samples by Volvo engineers. There was a general loss of information in the VE material representations, e.g. in terms of depth and colour information resulting in dull images. Further research needs to be conducted to examine different methods of producing virtual materials and compare the differently generated virtual materials, in addition to assessing their realism using different types of display technology. This would enable us to find the best method of virtual material production in conjunction with a system which best displays these virtual representations.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) systems and the virtual environments (VEs) experienced within them have presented challenges to human computer interaction over many years. The sheer range of different interfaces which might be experienced and of different behaviours which might be exhibited have caused difficulties in general understanding of participants' performance within VR/VE and in providing coherent guidance for designers. We have recently completed a European Information Society Technologies (IST) project, Virtual and Interactive Environments for Workplaces of the Future (VIEW of the Future), which has made great strides in developing improved VR systems and interaction concepts and devices, based upon good understanding of participation in VEs. Particular emphasis in the VIEW of the Future project has been upon mobility and multiple active collaboration in use of VR/VE. This paper introduces a special issue devoted to this project and overviews the project as a whole. In doing so it also reviews some of the human factors issues defined for VR/VE over the years and the contribution of VIEW of the Future to addressing these.},

VR facilities such as CAVEs or PowerWalls, among many others, seem to promise such collaboration but due to the special requirements in terms of 3D input and output devices and the physical configuration and layout, they are generally designed to support an active controlling participant-the immersed user-and a passive viewing only audience. In this paper we explore the integration of different technologies, such as small handheld devices and wireless networks with VR/VEs in order to develop a technical and conceptual interaction approach that allows creation of a more ad hoc, interaction rich, multimodal and multi-device environment, where multiple users can access certain interactive capabilities of VE and support co-located collaboration.},

Dedicated virtual reality (VR) systems have been utilized also in astronaut training. However there are no detailed descriptions of projection wall VR systems and related interaction techniques for astronaut assembly training in zero gravity conditions. Back projection technology tends to have certain advantages over head mounted displays including less simulation sickness and less restricted user movement. A prototype was built to evaluate the usefulness of projection technology VEs and interaction techniques for astronaut training. This was achieved by first constructing a PC cluster-based general purpose VE software and hardware platform. This platform was used to implement a testing prototype for astronaut assembly sequence training. An interaction tool battery was designed for the purposes of viewpoint control and object handling. A selected training task was implemented as a case study for further analysis based on laptop usage in the Fluid Science Laboratory (FSL) inside the Columbus module in the International Space Station (ISS). User tests were conducted on the usability of the prototype for the intended training purpose. The results seem to indicate that projection technology-based VE systems and suitably selected interaction techniques can be successfully utilized in zero gravity training operations.},

Discussions with users of VR installations have shown that there is a demand for smaller and more cost efficient VR installations. We have proposed the concept of a small VR system, PI-casso, based on user requirements, guidelines for office workplaces and some end-user tests which showed important limitations and the ergonomics problems of current VR installations. PI-casso is a compact, fully immersive VR system which complements the classic desktop workplace. In this paper we describe a set of user requirements and the results of the design in forming end-user tests, in addition to the concept and the technical specifications of the newly developed system. The first prototype of PI-casso was demonstrated at HCII 2003, where specialists from the human factors/ergonomics and the VR communities used our system and provided suggestions for improvement.

The experiment employs a three-way split-plot design with one between-subjects factor and two repeated-measures factors. The between-subjects factor contains two cultural groups, American and Thai. The two repeated-measures variables are a banner background color factor with six levels and a banner font color factor with two levels. Participants search for target words from text on Web pages that contain three animated banner graphics. The findings lead to the conclusion that users across cultures tend to ignore animated banner graphics when they look for specific information on highly informative Web pages. This study also suggests influences of culture on overall performance, overall retention, and overall self-reports on usability, regardless of differences in banner color combinations. Moreover, cultural differences on the self-report of attention drawing are also revealed in each banner color usage, except yellow banners with white text. This study does not aim at exploring superiority of participants between cultures. Rather, it attempts to explore some possible cultural differences in interacting with a computer interface that could facilitate cognition and perception of users from different cultural groups.},

Cognition, Technology &amp; Work 5, 127-139], we attempt to go beyond the traditional approach based on expertise levels. Instead, we refer to the notion of cognitive styles. First, we consider methodological issues raised by a posteriori identification of cognitive styles within this diagnosis task. Second, we present the results of our analysis showing that individual differences are related to a particular dimension of cognitive style in which a balance between task requirements and cognitive resources is managed. Finally, we draw conclusions on the importance of cognitive styles in Cognitive Ergonomics.},

abstract = {How to measure usability is an important question in HCI research and user interface evaluation. We review current practice in measuring usability by categorizing and discussing usability measures from 180 studies published in core HCI journals and proceedings. The discussion distinguish several problems with the measures, including whether they actually measure usability, if they cover usability broadly, how they are reasoned about, and if they meet recommendations on how to measure usability. In many studies, the choice of and reasoning about usability measures fall short of a valid and reliable account of usability as quality-in-use of the user interface being studied. Based on the review, we discuss challenges for studies of usability and for research into how to measure usability. The challenges are to distinguish and empirically compare subjective and objective measures of usability; to focus on developing and employing measures of learning and retention; to study long-term use and usability; to extend measures of satisfaction beyond post-use questionnaires; to validate and standardize the host of subjective satisfaction questionnaires used; to study correlations between usability measures as a means for validation; and to use both micro and macro tasks and corresponding measures of usability. In conclusion, we argue that increased attention to the problems identified and challenges discussed may strengthen studies of usability and usability research.},

abstract = {A home page is an entry interface of hyperdocuments for presenting a Website's information to visitors, which is mostly concerned with human perception in terms of users' comprehension and mental representation. As the theory of Gestalt psychology provides an important perspective in human perception, it is appropriate to apply this theory in evaluating the ''wholeness'' of a perceptual image. In home page design, organizing the visual pattern on the basis of Gestalt principles can lead to an efficient model for a better perception. However, human perception referring to the non-quantifiable, subjective, and affect-based experience is difficult to be objectively and uniformly measured by a conventional research approach. In this paper, we propose a Gestalt-like perceptual measure method by combining Gestalt grouping principles and fuzzy entropy. The purpose of this proposed method is not to evaluate the grades of alternatives, but to measure the Gestalt-like perceptual degrees for home page design. An experimental study was conducted to evaluate the practicability of this method. In Part 1 of the experiment, the weights of evaluated criteria were identified through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) operation. A Gestalt-like perceptual measure for six selected home pages was further implemented in Part 2 of the experiment. The experimental study has shown a credible result. In addition to measuring the Gestalt perception of a Web page design, the proposed method can also be applied to related design fields such as plane design and other visual interface design.},

The last two decades have seen user acceptance models being proposed, tested, refined, extended and unified. These models have contributed to our understanding of user technology acceptance factors and their relationships. Yet they have also presented two limitations: the relatively low explanatory power and inconsistent influences of the factors across studies. Several researchers have recently started to examine the potential moderating effects that may overcome these limitations. However, studies in this direction are far from being conclusive. This study attempts to provide a systematic analysis of the explanatory and situational limitations of existing technology acceptance studies. Ten moderating factors are identified and categorized into three groups: organizational factors, technological factors and individual factors. An integrative model is subsequently established, followed by corresponding propositions pertaining to the moderating factors.},

The present study sought to examine whether this type of inconsistency would effect perceptions of persuasive messages delivered by humans versus computers. We created a situation in which reactions to computer synthesized speech were compared to human speech when the speech was either from a person or a computer. This paper presents two studies, one using audio taped stimuli and one using videotaped stimuli, with type of speech (human versus computer synthesized) manipulated factorially with source (person versus computer). As hypothesized, both studies suggest that in the human as source condition, human voice is perceived more favorably than synthetic voice. However, in the computer as source condition, both human and computer voice were rated similarly. We discuss these findings in terms of consistency as well as group processes effects that may be occurring.},

The benefits of doing so include the ability to deliver relevant information to people at appropriate times and to enable 'hands-free' control. A downside, however, is that sensor control often displaces user control, resulting in the user not knowing how to or being able to control aspects of a system. While this can be frustrating in many situations, it provides new opportunities for enhancing or augmenting various kinds of activities, where uncertainty can be exploited to good effect. We describe how we designed an adventure game for young children that incorporated a number of sensor-based interactions. We also present a preliminary conceptual framework intended to help designers and researchers develop novel user experiences using sensor-based interactions. A set of concepts are provided that characterize salient aspects of the user experience involved in sensing together with a discussion of the core properties of sensor technologies.},

This work domain is more dynamic than those previously studied under EID because there is a constant potential for the addition and removal of devices, as well as changing configurations, making it important to study the generalizability of the framework. Two interfaces were created for the University of Toronto campus network consisting of 220 nodes: a P interface based on existing design practices which presented primarily physical information and a P + F interface based on EID which presented both physical and functional information identified by an abstraction hierarchy analysis. Participants used one of the two interfaces to detect and diagnose faults or disturbances in the simulated network in real-time. Network size and fault frequency were both manipulated as within-participants variables. The P + F interface led to faster detection times overall, as well as improved fault detection rate and more accurate fault diagnosis under higher fault loads. These results suggest that the EID framework may lead to more robust monitoring performance in computer network management compared to existing interfaces.},

Impact of spatial ability and prior experience on these measurements were also investigated. One group of older subjects (n = 24) and one group of younger subjects (n = 24) participated. An overall hypothesis for the work presented here was that differences in learning to and performing navigational tasks in the physical world are similar in learning and performing navigational tasks in the virtual world. The results showed that the older participants needed more time to solve the tasks; and similar to navigation in the physical world, the older participants were less likely to create configural knowledge. It could not be established that older participants benefited more from an overview map as cognitive support than younger subjects, except in the subjective sense: the older users felt more secure when the map was there. The map seemed to have supported the older users in creating a feeling of where objects were located within the environment, but it did not make them more efficient. The results have implications for design; in particular, it brings up the difficult issue of balancing design goals such as efficiency in terms of time and functionality, against maintaining a sense of direction and location in navigational situations.},

abstract = {This paper describes our approach for the design and development of application systems for early stages of information design tasks. We view a computational tool as something that provides materials with which a designer interacts to create a situation that talks back to the designer. The interaction design of a tool, that is, the representations a user can generate and how the user can manipulate them with the tool, influences a user's cognitive processes. The tool's interaction design thus either fosters or hinders creativity in the early stages of information design.Our approach toward the interaction design of a tool for fostering creativity is first to understand the nature of early stages of information design tasks. We discuss four issues in support of the early stages of design based on theories in design and in human-computer interaction: (1) that available means of externalizations influence designers in deciding which courses of actions to take: (2) that designers generate and interact with not only a partial representation of the final artefact but also various external representations: (3) that designers produce externalizations to express a solution as well as to interpret the situations: and (4) that a design task proceeds as a hermeneutic circle--that is. designers proceed with projected meanings of representations and gradually revise and confirm those meanings.The above theoretical account of early stages of information design tasks has led us to identify three interaction design principles for tools for the early stages of information design: interpretation-rich representations, representations with constant grounding and interaction methods for hands-on generation and manipulation of the representations.To illustrate our point, we take ART#001. a tool for the early stages of writing, to apply the interaction design principles and examine how the interaction design of the tool fosters creativity in the early stages of information design. The paper concludes with a discussion of how we generalize the approach and build a framework to design and develop application systems for fostering creativity in the early stages of information design.},

Although society often thinks of creative individuals as working in isolation, intelligence and creativity result in large part from interaction and collaboration with other individuals. Much human creativity is social, arising from activities that take place in a context in which interaction with other people and the artifacts that embody collective knowledge are essential contributors.This paper examines: (1) how individual and social creativity can be integrated by means of proper collaboration models and tools supporting distributed cognition; (2) how the creation of shareable externalizations ("boundary objects") and the adoption of evolutionary process models in the construction of meta-design environments can enhance creativity and support spontaneous design activities ("unselfconscious cultures of design"); and (3) how a new design competence is emerging one that requires passage from individual creative actions to synergetic activities, from the reflective practitioner to reflective communities and from given tasks to personally meaningful activities. The paper offers examples in the context of collaborative design and art practice, including urban planning, interactive art and open source. In the effort to draw a viable path "beyond binary choices", the paper points out some major challenges for the next generation of socio-technical environments to further increase the integration of individual and social creativity.},

abstract = {Creativity research is a large and varied field in which the subject is characterized on many different levels. The arrival of digital media and computational tools has opened up new possibilities for creative practice. The cutting edge in the digital arts is a highly fertile ground for the investigation of creativity and the role of new technologies. The demands of such work often reveal the limitations of existing technologies and open the door to developing new approaches and techniques. This provides the creativity researcher with opportunities to understand the multi-dimensional characteristics of the creative process. At the same time, it places new demands upon the creators of the technological solutions and pushes forward our understanding of the future requirements of creative technologies. This paper is concerned with the nature of creativity and the design of creativity enhancing computer systems. The research has multi-disciplinary foundations in human-computer interaction and creative practice in Art, Design, Science and Engineering. As a result of a series of studies of creative people and the associated developments in technology, a strategy for practice-based research has evolved in which research and practice are interdependent activities that have mutual benefits as well its distinctive outcomes. This paper charts the development of that co-evolutionary process from the foundation studies to recent outcomes of a major project in art and technology collaboration. The notion of the Studio as a laboratory in the field is introduced and a new methodology for systematic practice-based research is presented. From the results of the investigations that took place, opportunities for the development of technology environments for creative collaboration are proposed.},

abstract = {Developing learning experiences that facilitate self-actualization and creativity is among the most important goals of our society in preparation for the future. To facilitate deep understanding of a new concept, to facilitate learning, learners must have the opportunity to develop multiple and flexible perspectives. The process of becoming an expert involves failure, as well as the ability to understand failure and the motivation to move onward. Meta-cognitive awareness and personal strategies can play a role in developing an individual's ability to persevere through failure, and combat other diluting influences. Awareness and reflective technologies can be instrumental in developing a meta-cognitive ability to make conscious and unconscious decisions about engagement that will ultimately enhance learning, expertise, creativity, and self-actualization. This paper will review diverse perspectives from psychology, engineering, education, and computer science to present opportunities to enhance creativity, motivation, and self-actualization in learning systems.},

Our objective was to determine to what extent designers consider potential sources as useful for solving a specific design problem. Since the relevance of sources of inspiration may he appreciated differently according to the level of expertise in design, the experiment was performed with two groups of participants: experienced designers and inexperienced designers. The results show differences in the number and nature of the aspects selected by each group of designers as well as in the judgments of usefulness they expressed about the different types of suggested sources of inspiration. On this basis, we discuss how these findings may influence the design of a computational system supporting creative design tasks and we consider how to facilitate the progression from novices to experienced designers.},

abstract = {Creativity might be viewed as any process which results in a novel and useful product. People use computers for creative tasks; they flesh out ideas for text, graphics, engineering solutions, etc. Computer programming is an especially creative activity, but few tools for programming aid creativity. Computers can be designed to foster creativity as well. As a start, all computer programs should help users enumerate ideas, remember alternatives and support various ways to compare them. More sophisticated thinking aids could implement other successful techniques as well.Most computers are used in solitude; however, people depend on social supports for creativity. User scenarios can provide the important social support and gracious cues normally offered by collaborators that keep people motivated and help them consider alternatives. People also use computers to build community and to communicate. Computers should also support and filter these potentially creativity-enhancing communication acts.User-interface designers are so busy exposing features and fighting bugs that they might ignore their users' needs for motivation and creativity support. This paper develops the notion that creativity and motivation enhancement can easily be aligned with the design of high-quality human-computer interaction. User interface toolkits and evaluations should include support for motivation and creativity-enhancing approaches.},

It focuses on key factors to be considered in the design and development of any such user support environment regardless of the specific domain for which it may be implemented. The paper reviews psychological literature on how creativity, insight and innovation occur and how they can be fostered in working environments. Based on this discussion the paper then describes a generic set of user or functional requirements intended to apply or any domain-specific computer-based working environment for support of creative activities. The paper proposes the conceptual model of a Virtual Workbench as a way of capturing some of these requirements and as a way of organizing thinking about the design of creative problem solving environments (CPSEs) in general. Finally, the paper proposes one possible translation of the Virtual Workbench and some of the functional requirements into a view of a generic model for CPSEs by describing three component sets of functions that would be a subset of those needed in almost any domain-specific CPSE.},

(2) How important is it that emotional expressions are added in a way that is consistent with the content of the message, in animated agents? To address these questions, a positively framed healthy eating message was created which was variously presented via GRETA, a matched human actor, GRETA's voice only (no face) or as text only. Furthermore, versions of GRETA were created which displayed additional emotional facial expressions in a way that was either consistent or inconsistent with the content of the message. Overall, it was found that although GRETA received significantly higher ratings for helpfulness and likability, presenting the message via GRETA led to the poorest memory performance among users. Importantly, however, when GRETA's additional emotional expressions were consistent with the content of the verbal message, the negative effect on memory performance disappeared. Overall, the findings point to the importance of achieving consistency in animated agents.},

abstract = {Speed-dependent automatic zooming (SDAZ) has been proposed for standard desktop displays as a means of overcoming problems associated with the navigation of large information spaces. SDAZ combines zooming and panning facilities into a single operation, with the magnitude of both factors dependent on simple user interaction. Previous research indicated dramatic user performance improvements when using the technique for document and map navigation tasks. In this paper, we propose algorithmic extensions to the technique for application on small-screen devices and present a comparative experimental evaluation of user performance with the system and a normative scroll-zoom-pan interface. Users responded positively to the system, particularly in relation to reduced physical navigational workload. However, the reduced screen space reduced the impact of SDAZ in comparison to that reported in previous studies. In fact, for one-dimensional navigation (vertical document navigation) the normative interface out-performed SDAZ. For navigation in two dimensions (map browsing) SDAZ supports more accurate target location, and also produces longer task completion times. Some SDAZ users became lost within the information space and were unable to recover navigational context. We discuss the reasons for these observations and suggest ways in which limitations of SDAZ in the small-screen context may be overcome.},

abstract = {Evaluation of the appropriateness of information technical systems for complex professional usage in safety-critical contexts poses significant methodical and practical challenges. In this study, the usability of a Safety Information and Alarm Panel (SIAP) in a nuclear power plant control room was tested. An integrated validation concept was used that included a new approach to measuring system and operator performance in complex work environments. The tested system was designed to aid the operators in severe disturbance and emergency situations. It had already been implemented at a nuclear power plant. The study was conducted in a full-scope training simulator. The results verified that an acceptable level of performance could be achieved when using the SIAP. When the operators' practices were analysed by a habit-centred analysis, it was discovered that the effects of the SIAP differed between crews and between test scenarios. Thus, the SIAP tended to promote coherence of practices but reduce situatively attentive action. In diffuse task contexts the tool failed to support the shift supervisor's control of the overall process situation, his awareness of the crew's work load and his ability to update the crew's awareness of the process. The operators reported that the system supported their process control activity and reduced stress in the situation, but the shift supervisors and operators also noticed some possible negative effects of the tool. These subjective evaluations corresponded to the effects observed in practice. The results revealed the complexity of the implementation of new tools into professional practice. It was proposed that a validation project should focus on the trajectory of development of the entire distributed cognitive system instead of comprehending validation studies as tests of the effects of information systems on a pre-defined process output. Formative evaluation criteria are needed in projecting distributed cognitive systems.},

abstract = {An understanding of 'communities of practice' can help to make sense of existing security and privacy issues within organizations; the same understanding can be used proactively to help bridge the gap between organizational and end-user perspectives on these matters. Findings from two studies within the health domain reveal contrasting perspectives on the 'enemy within' approach to organizational security. Ethnographic evaluations involving in-depth interviews, focus groups and observations with 93 participants (clinical staff, managers, library staff and IT department members) were conducted in two hospitals. All of the data was analysed using the social science methodology 'grounded theory'. In one hospital, a community and user-centred approach to the development of an organizational privacy and security application produced a new communication medium that improved corporate awareness across the organization. User involvement in the development of this application increased the perceived importance, for the designers, of application usability, quality and aesthetics. However, other initiatives within this organization produced clashes with informal working practices and communities of practice. Within the second hospital, poor communication from IT about security mechanisms resulted in their misuse by some employees, who viewed them as a socially controlling force. Authentication mechanisms were used to socially exclude users who were formally authorized to access systems but whose access was unacceptable within some local communities of practice. The importance of users' security awareness and control are reviewed within the context of communities of practice.},

abstract = {Computer system security is traditionally regarded as a primarily technological concern; the fundamental questions to which security researchers address themselves are those of the mathematical guarantees that can be made for the performance of various communication and computational challenges. However, in our research, we focus on a different question. For us, the fundamental security question is one that end-users routinely encounter and resolve for themselves many times a day--the question of whether a system is secure enough for their immediate needs.In this paper, we will describe our explorations of this issue. In particular, we will draw on three major elements of our research to date. The first is empirical investigation into everyday security practices, looking at how people manage security as a practical, day-to-day concern, and exploring the context in which security decisions are made. This empirical work provides a foundation for our reconsideration of the problems of security to a large degree as an interactional problem. The second is our systems approach, based on visualization and event-based architectures. This technical approach provides a broad platform for investigating security and interaction, based on a set of general principles. The third is our initial experiences in a prototype deployment of these mechanisms in an application for peer-to-peer file sharing in face-to-face collaborative settings. We have been using this application as the basis of an initial evaluation of our technology in support of everyday security practices in collaborative workgroups.},

abstract = {The weakness of knowledge-based authentication systems, such as passwords and Personal Identification Numbers (PINs), is well known, and reflects an uneasy compromise between security and human memory constraints. Research has been undertaken for some years now into the feasibility of graphical authentication mechanisms in the hope that these will provide a more secure and memorable alternative. The graphical approach substitutes the exact recall of alphanumeric codes with the recognition of previously learnt pictures, a skill at which humans are remarkably proficient. So far, little attention has been devoted to usability, and initial research has failed to conclusively establish significant memory improvement. This paper reports two user studies comparing several implementations of the graphical approach with PINs. Results demonstrate that pictures can be a solution to some problems relating to traditional knowledge-based authentication but that they are not a simple panacea, since a poor design can eliminate the picture superiority effect in memory. The paper concludes by discussing the potential of the graphical approach and providing guidelines for developers contemplating using these mechanisms.},

This paper reports on a study in which (1) user concerns were analysed more deeply and (2) what users said was contrasted with what they did in an experimental e-commerce scenario. Eleven independent variables were shown to affect the online behavior of at least some groups of users. Most significant were trust marks present on web pages and the existence of a privacy policy, though users seldom consulted the policy when one existed. We also find that many users have inaccurate perceptions of their own knowledge about privacy technology and vulnerabilities, and that important user groups, like those similar to the Westin "privacy fundamentalists", do not appear to form a cohesive group for privacy-related decision making.In this study we adopt an experimental economic research paradigm, a method for examining user behavior which challenges the current emphasis on survey data. We discuss these issues and the implications of our results on user interpretation of trust marks and interaction design. Although broad policy implications are beyond the scope of this paper, we conclude by questioning the application of the ethical/legal doctrine of informed consent to online transactions in the light of the evidence that users frequently do not consult privacy policies.},

abstract = {Support for strong electronic mail security is widely available yet only few communicants appear to make use of these features. Apparently, the operational overhead of security outweighs its perceived benefits. Towards increasing the benefits versus overhead ratio we follow an approach that considers security and usability tradeoffs from the outset. We separate key exchange from binding keys to identities. The best effort key exchange and key maintenance scheme that we devise operates transparently for the user. We also describe complementary visualization and interaction techniques that communicate the security state of sent and received mail to users in a non-intrusive fashion. Structured interviews were conducted with 19 users to assess the usability of the metaphors and the complementary visualizations of the security state. Towards a practical assessment of the overheads of binding keys to identities, we conducted a quantitative analysis of 17 users' anonymized mailbox extracts to determine which security mechanisms would be most appropriate for their communication patterns. We argue that for individual non-commercial users, out-of-band verification of keys could be more economical than building trust in public key certificates issued by third parties.},

We employed a variety of user-centered design methods with 109 target users across the four steps of the research reported here. This case study highlights the work of identifying organizational privacy requirements, iteratively designing and validating a prototype with target users, and conducting laboratory tests to guide specific design decisions to meet the needs of providing flexible privacy enabling technologies. Each of the four steps in our work is identified and described, and directions for future work in privacy are suggested.},

abstract = {Computer security depends largely on passwords to authenticate human users. However, users have difficulty remembering passwords over time if they choose a secure password, i.e. a password that is long and random. Therefore, they tend to choose short and insecure passwords. Graphical passwords, which consist of clicking on images rather than typing alphanumeric strings, may help to overcome the problem of creating secure and memorable passwords. In this paper we describe PassPoints, a new and more secure graphical password system. We report an empirical study comparing the use of PassPoints to alphanumeric passwords. Participants created and practiced either an alphanumeric or graphical password. The participants subsequently carried out three longitudinal trials to input their password over the course of 6 weeks. The results show that the graphical password users created a valid password with fewer difficulties than the alphanumeric users. However, the graphical users took longer and made more invalid password inputs than the alphanumeric users while practicing their passwords. In the longitudinal trials the two groups performed similarly on memory of their password, but the graphical group took more time to input a password.},

Cleartext is mistakenly sent to correspondents, sensitive files are left unprotected, and erroneously configured systems are left vulnerable to attackers. Such mistakes may be blamed on human error, but the regularity of human error suggests that mistakes may be preventable through better interface design. Certain user-interface constructs drive users toward error, while others facilitate success.Two security-sensitive user interfaces were evaluated in a laboratory user study: the Windows XP file-permissions interface and an alternative interface, called Salmon, designed in accordance with an error-avoiding principle to counteract the misleading constructs in the XP interface. The alternative interface was found to be more dependable; it increased successful task completion by up to 300%, reduced commission of a class of errors by up to 94%, and provided a nearly 3\texttimes{} speed-up in task completion time. Moreover, users spent less time searching for information with the alternative interface, and a greater proportion of time on essential task steps. An explanatory theory in its early stages of development is presented.},

Our analysis of privacy protection in ubicomp has identified four layers through which users must navigate: the regulatory regime they are currently in, the type of ubicomp service required, the type of data being disclosed, and their personal privacy policy. We illustrate and compare the protection afforded by regulation and by some major models for user control of privacy. We identify the shortcomings of each and propose a model which allows user control of privacy levels in a ubicomp environment. Our model balances the user's privacy preferences against the applicable privacy regulations and incorporates five types of user controlled "noise" to protect location privacy by introducing ambiguities. We also incorporate an economics-based approach to assist users in balancing the trade-offs between giving up privacy and receiving ubicomp services. We conclude with a scenario and heuristic evaluation which suggests that regulation can have both positive and negative influences on privacy interfaces in ubicomp and that social translucence is an important heuristic for ubicomp privacy interface functionality.},

abstract = {Walker and Smelcer (Proceedings of the CHI 90, ACM, New York, 1990, pp. 221-225) found that menus could be selected faster if they were placed against the edge of the screen. Doing so creates an impenetrable border between the menu and the edge of the screen that the mouse cursor cannot penetrate. This changes how users move the mouse, so that selection times quicken compared to menus with a penetrable border. Experiment 1 investigated the effect that practice has on the acquisition of objects with and without impenetrable borders. The findings suggest that excessive practice was not necessary to demonstrate border type differences; thus, the advantage of having impenetrable borders seems to be relatively instantaneous. However, it was not readily apparent whether or not participants would realize the advantages of impenetrable borders without instruction. Thus, the primary purpose of Experiment 2 was to assess whether or not users would discover the benefits of impenetrable borders spontaneously. Participants were assigned to either the penetrable or impenetrable border condition. Additionally, participants received either full instruction concerning the benefits of the target placement, or limited instruction that simply informed the participant about the nature of the task. The results demonstrated that participants receiving limited instruction selected targets with impenetrable borders faster than participants who selected objects with a penetrable border. However, an exploratory comparison suggests that only 50% of participants who received limited instruction actually detected the impenetrable border. An additional comparison suggests that with practice the participants who were successful at detecting the impenetrable border selected the targets as quickly as participants who received full instruction concerning the benefits of impenetrable borders. The findings suggest that with full instruction, all users will perform reduced selection times. Given that not all participants discovered the impenetrable border it suggests that, whenever possible, users should receive instruction pertaining to the benefits of the impenetrable borders.},

The initial adoption of on-line tax is the important driving force to further influence the use and continued use of this service. The model of Trust and technology acceptance model (TAM) in Gefen et al. (2003a, MIS Quarterly 27(1), 51-90) has been well studied in on-line shopping and showed that understanding both the Internet technology and trust issue is important in determining behavioral intention to use. Besides, the diffusion of on-line tax could also be influenced by the potential antecedents such as individuals, organizational members, and social system while the issue for innovative technology is well discussed in Rogers (1995, The Diffusion of Innovation, fourth ed. Free Press, New York). Theory of planned behavior (TPB) is the model widely used to discuss the effect of these antecedents in behavioral intention. An extension of Trust and TAM model with TPB would be in more comprehensive manner to understand behavioral intention to use on-line tax. Furthermore, a large sample survey is used to empirically examine this framework.},

In the intervention phase, students imagined themselves in a scenario where, had they chosen to act differently, they could have avoided a negative outcome. They then considered how regretful they would feel in that situation. The results showed that, for backing up, students showed more positive attitudes and data-protective behavioural choices immediately after the intervention and at follow-up, compared to their baseline measures. The second scenario was less effective at changing participants' attitudes and behaviour in relation to disabling active scripting.

The quality of spatial-semantic mapping was manipulated as was the number of dimensions (two versus three) in which document nodes were arranged. Participants were required to browse the information space and identify all documents relevant to a specified topic. Results indicated that participants were able to use three-dimensional spatial mapping of semantic information to facilitate task performance, with performance being better when the quality of the mapping was higher. Strategy differences were identified, with participants adopting a more 'exhaustive' approach when searching two-dimensional node arrangements, and a more 'focused' approach for three-dimensional arrangements. Cognitive ability was not strongly associated with task performance, but participants of relatively lower cognitive ability tended to out-perform those of higher cognitive ability in three-dimensional conditions.

abstract = {The vision of ubiquitous computing is that the addition of computation and communication abilities to the artefacts that surround people will enable the users to set up their living spaces in a way that will serve them best minimising at the same time the required human intervention. The ontologies can help us to address some key issues of ubiquitous computing environments such as knowledge representation, semantic interoperability and service discovery.The GAS Ontology is an ontology that was developed in order to describe the semantics of the basic concepts of a ubiquitous computing environment and define their inter-relations. The basic goal of this ontology is to provide a common language for the communication and collaboration among the heterogeneous devices that constitute these environments. The GAS Ontology also supports the service discovery mechanism that a ubiquitous computing environment requires.In this paper, we present the GAS Ontology as well as the design challenges that we faced and the way that we handled them. In order to select the language and the tool that we used for the development of the GAS Ontology, we designed a prototype ontology and evaluated a number of languages and tools. The ontology development tool that proved to be the most suitable from this evaluation was Prot\'{e}g\'{e}-2000. We also present how we use the GAS Ontology in our eGadgets project achieving semantic interoperability and service discovery. Finally, we present the GAS Ontology manager, which runs on each device, manages the device's ontology and processes the knowledge that each device acquires over time.},

We present some proposed solutions that could address the problems we identified, and in addition, discuss how our own tool, called Jambalaya, could be applied to provide cognitive support.

abstract = {A medical terminological system (TS) is essentially an ontology consisting of concepts, attributes and relationships pertaining to medical terms. There are many TSs around today, most of which are essentially frame-based. Various efforts have been made to get a better understanding of the requirements and the conceptual and formal structures of TSs. However, the actual implementation of a TS consisted so far of ad hoc approaches starting from scratch and, due to ad hoc semantics of the representation, the interoperability with external applications of the knowledge represented is diminished. In recent years, PROT\'{E}G\'{E} has been gaining in popularity as a software environment for the development of knowledge-based systems. It provides an architecture for integrating frame-based ontologies with knowledge acquisition and other applications operating on these ontologies. In its recent version, PROT\'{E}G\'{E} provides the ability to specify meta-classes and -slots. This contributes to an explicit separability of knowledge levels and allows for an increased modeling flexibility. These properties, and the fact that it complies with a standard knowledge model, enable PROT\'{E}G\'{E} to be an attractive candidate for the implementation of frame-based TSs. This paper investigates how to specify a TS in PROT\'{E}G\'{E} and demonstrates this in a specific application in the domain of intensive care. Our approach is characterized by the utilization of a conceptual framework for understanding TSs and mapping its components onto PROT\'{E}G\'{E} constructs. This results in specifications of knowledge components for the implementation of terminological systems. The significance of our work stems from the generality of these specifications. This facilitates their reuse, leading to a principled process for the development of terminological systems for a broad spectrum of medical domains.},

abstract = {We study the general question of how ontologies and reference terminologies can be used to make development of knowledge bases more manageable, taking into account the methodologies and tools available nowadays. For this, we have carried out a case study on designing a knowledge base oriented to support a diagnosis-aid application in ophthalmology. Ideally, starting from a pre-existing domain ontology, development of knowledge bases is centred only on collecting specific knowledge for a particular application. In practice, this is a very time-consuming approach, as ontology repositories do not usually provide many information-seeking facilities. In addition, it is unlikely to find an ontology that includes all the required knowledge. Consequently, design of knowledge bases requires the combination and adaptation of one or more source ontologies. In this work, particular attention is paid to the proper merging of two ontologies using the tool PROMPT. Our study emphasizes the advantages of using PROMPT for merging ontologies containing closely related portions of knowledge, as well as some proposals for improvement. In a second step, our approach extends the evolving ontology, with a new component that holds both a meta-model representing a very simplified structure of a terminology system into Prot\'{e}g\'{e}-2000 and a set of constraints expressed using the Prot\'{e}g\'{e} Axiom Language. This set of constraints allows us to check the consistency and coherence of the imported information. Defining meta-classes in Prot\'{e}g\'{e}-2000 links this component to the rest of the models in the knowledge base. We report our experience in the reuse of several knowledge sources using Prot\'{e}g\'{e}-2000 and several of the plug-ins.},

The core of this architecture is a working knowledge system, called KASIMIR, using an object-based representation formalism and classification-based reasoning. The ontology editor PROT\'{E}G\'{E} is connected with the KASIMIR system, and is adapted to the particular requirements of KASIMIR. The PROT\'{E}G\'{E} system enables the integration of several editing and visualization modules. A first knowledge editing module relies on classification-based reasoning for detecting mismatches and redundancies in the edited knowledge hierarchy. A second knowledge editing module also uses classification-based reasoning for comparing two versions of the knowledge base for maintenance purposes. This last module is particularly useful for extracting and analysing the changes occurred during an editing session. Three modules are combined to visualize hierarchies, based on three different techniques having complementary advantages. All these modules--including KASIMIR and PROT\'{E}G\'{E}--are integrated in a semantic portal architecture based on semantic Web principles. The proposed architecture takes advantage of the semantic Web technologies for integrating the different modules, and for providing a reusable environment for distributed knowledge management in oncology.},

abstract = {Many ontology-development tools allow users to supplement frame-based representations with arbitrary logical sentences. However, few users actually take advantage of this opportunity. For example, in the Ontolingua ontology library, only 20% of the ontologies have any user-defined axioms. We believe the difficulty of composing axioms primarily accounts for the lack of axioms in these knowledge bases: Many domain experts cannot translate their thoughts into abstract and symbolic representations. We attempt to remedy the difficulties by identifying groups of axioms that manifest common patterns, creating "templates" that allow users to compose axioms by "filling in the blanks." We studied axioms in two public ontology libraries, and derived 20 templates that cover 85% of all the user-defined axioms. We describe our methodology for identifying the templates and present examples. We constructed an interface that allows users to create constraints on knowledge bases by "filling in blanks;" our usability testing shows that users could use templates to encode axioms with a success rate similar to that of experts writing directly in an axiom language. Our approach should foster the introduction of axioms and constraints that are currently missing in many ontologies.},

abstract = {This paper examines team work over time in video-mediated non-collocated and traditional face-to-face same-room teams.In a longitudinal between-groups design, 22 three-person teams were tested in 4 1-h test sessions at 2-week intervals. A paper-folding task was designed for the experiment that had the potential to induce differences in team work under different communication environments. Results showed that near the end of the experiment, initial differences between groups on cooperative task performance in favour of the face-to-face teams had disappeared. These findings are explained in terms of a technological adaptation effect, which occurs when people learn how to use the technological tools available despite technological limitations. No differences were found between groups on cohesion and satisfaction. Likewise, cohesion did not increase over time as participants gained experience. In comparison, satisfaction did increase over time for both groups as teams gained experience with fellow team members and the task at hand. In contrast to what was expected, mental effort was higher for face-to-face teams than for video-mediated teams. Furthermore, initial differences between groups on mental effort did not disappear as participants gained experience. This paper concludes with a discussion of the results in terms of their implications for natural work teams, the design of video-communication technologies and suggestions for future research.},

abstract = {Researchers have classified differing time-related behaviours as Monochronicity (M) and Polychronicity (p). The objective of this study was to evaluate control strategy and control performance differences between M and P persons in a process control domain. Forty-two people participated in an experimental study. Time-related behaviour was evaluated using the Modified Polychronic Attitude Index 3 (M/P score) scale. Each participant was asked to monitor and control two processes at the same time using the Control Station® software. A 2 (control system order)*5 (trials) factorial experiment was used. Performance was quantified using overall mean error and overall Root-Mean-Square (RMS) error. Control strategy was quantified using the number of switches between the two processes and the number of magnitude changes within each of the processes. Correlation and regression analyses showed that the M/P score was significantly correlated with the strategy variables and performance variables. When the participants were split into the three groups, M (M/P score greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 3), neutral (M/P score between 3 and 5) and P (M/P score greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 7), there were significant differences in the performance and strategy measures among the three groups. The strategy variables indicated that monochrons attempted to control the two processes serially, while polychrons controlled both processes somewhat simultaneously. The neutral group was in-between the M and P groups. The results also showed that the overall mean error and overall RMS error of polychrons were significantly smaller than that of the monochrons. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the NASA-Task Load Index score between monochrons and polychrons, even though there were significant correlations between the M/P score and some of the scale dimensions' weightings. The results of this study can have important implications for the training and selection of personnel in multitask situations, such as industrial process control.},

This study aims to validate the appropriateness of two evaluation methods that vary in representativeness of mobility, one that uses a treadmill to simulate motion and another that uses a controlled walking scenario.The results lead to preliminary guidelines based on study objectives for researchers wishing to use more appropriate evaluation methodologies for empirical, data-driven mobile computing studies. The guidelines indicate that using a treadmill for mobile evaluation can yield representative performance measures,whereas a controlled walking scenario is more likely to adequately simulate the atual user experience.},

abstract = {User interface (UI) design is one of the most challenging problem-solving activities that the modern industry faces.The cognitive complexity of design problems and the time pressure due to shortened product life cycles force designers to pursue efficient processes and strategies. For efficiency, UI designers can benefit from their prior design experience that associates target user tasks with available interface means.The practical design activity thus tends to be case-based rather than analytic and linearly deductive.In this paper we develop a framework for a case-based design aid that enables effective reuse of prior design cases in a way that is compatible with practical strategies of designers. In the centre of the framework lies designcase representation at multiple levels of abstraction.The multi-level representation supports the bi-directional and opportunistic strategies of UI designers by enabling easy retrieval of cases at a focused abstraction level and strategy-compatible navigation to related design cases at other levels. A diagrammatic interaction model and a retrieval algorithm based on the model to represent and select design cases are described. It is experimentally verified that the multi-level representation of design cases with the diagrammatic model is useful to UI designers. The overall framework is implemented in a prototype system and the usefulness of the system is shown by examples.},

While much of this research focuses on increasing users' trust, we present a framework that shifts the perspective towards factors that support trustworthy behavior. In a second step, we analyze how the presence of these factors can be signalled. We argue that it is essential to take a systemic perspective for enabling well-placed trust and trustworthy behavior in the long term. For our analysis we draw on relevant research from sociology, economics, and psychology, as well as HCI. We identify contextual properties (motivation based on temporal, social, and institutional embeddedness) and the actor's intrinsic properties (ability, and motivation based on internalized norms and benevolence) that form the basis of trustworthy behavior. Our analysis provides a frame of reference for the design of studies on trust in technology-mediated interactions, as well as a guide for identifying trust requirements in design processes. We demonstrate the application of the framework in three scenarios: call centre interactions, B2C e-commerce, and voice-enabled on-line gaming.},

abstract = {An electronic book is a new means of presenting text, allowing downloading of documents and multiple readings on a portable computer. On the basis of an ecological and functional analysis of paper and electronic books with the Abstraction Hierarchy method, we tested the ability of a mobile e-book device to be an external memory trigger, assisting the recall of information content through its presence as a contextual index. In contrast to the classical experimental approach for research on reading and comprehension, we consider screen and paper as relevant cognitive tools per se. Specifically, we compare a book on a pocket computer and a paper book. Hypothesising that the physical reading support could serve as a contextual cue for memory, we experimented with groups of participants who could or could not see the support during recall. We measured the reading time, and the material later recalled was classified according to its cognitive nature. After recall, participants had to assess the sensory-motor properties of the reading support with the Osgood semantic differential and to note the humour level of the text. Results show that the e-book presence hinders recall of assimilated information whilst the presence of the paper support tends to facilitate it. Finally, we observed some correlation between sensory-motor assessment of the support and certain aspects of text cognitive processing: humour scoring, reading time and recall performance. These results lead us to conclude there is a critical relation between the sensory-motor experience of the support and the cognitive processing of the text content. This relationship might explain the positive or negative contextual effect of the support on recall performance.},

We are interested in whether a robot's physical body produces some differences in the effect or not. Previous research investigated the advantage of a physical body; however, the advantage was not clarified quantitatively and there was not enough evidence to give the results credibility. Our method based on quantitative evaluation clarifies the effect of a robot's and on-screen agent's behavior on user decision-making. Comparing a robot's behavior with an on-screen agent's, we show that the degree of the effect firmly depends on the interaction environment and that geometrical consistency between the interaction environment and embodied social agents (ESAs), which include robots and on-screen agents, is important in the recommendation situation.},

The character acts as a quizmaster in the context of a mathematical game. This application was chosen as a simple, and for the sake of the experiment, highly controllable, instance of human-computer interfaces and software. Subtle expressivity refers to the character's affective response to the user's performance by emulating multimodal human-human communicative behavior such as different body gestures and varying linguistic style. The impact of em-pathic behavior, which is a special form of affective response, is examined by deliberately frustrating the user during the game progress. There are two novel aspects in this investigation. First, we employ an animated interface agent to address the affective state of users rather than a text-based interface, which has been used in related research. Second, while previous empirical studies rely on questionnaires to evaluate the effect of life-like characters, we utilize physiological information of users (in addition to questionnaire data) in order to precisely associate the occurrence of interface events with users' autonomic nervous system activity. The results of our study indicate that empathic character response can significantly decrease user stress and that affective behavior may have a positive effect on users' perception of the difficulty of a task.},

abstract = {For years, people have sought more natural means of communicating with their computers. Many have suggested that interaction with a computer should be as easy as interacting with other people, taking advantage of the multimodal nature of human communication. While users should, in theory, gravitate to such anthropomorphic embodiments, quite the contrary has been experienced; users generally have been dissatisfied and abandoned their use. This suggests a disconnect between factors that make human-human communication engaging and those used by designers to support human-agent interaction. This paper discusses a set of empirical studies that attempted to replicate human-human non-verbal behavior. The focus revolved around behaviors that portray a credible fa\c{c}ade, thereby helping embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to form a successful cooperative dyad with users. Based on a review of the non-verbal literature, a framework was created that identified trustworthy and credible non-verbal behaviors across five areas and formed design guidelines for character interaction. The design suggestions for those areas emanating from the facial region were experimentally supported but there was no concordant increase in perceived trust when bodily regions (posture, gesture) were added. In addition, in examining the importance of demographic elements in embodiment, it was found that users prefer to interact with characters that match their ethnicity and are young looking. There was no significant preference for gender. The implications of these results, as well as other interesting consequences are discussed.},

It is expected that people, when using their natural communicational skills, can perform cognitive tasks with computers in a more enjoyable and effective way. For these reasons, human-like embodied conversational agents (ECAs) as components of user interfaces have received a lot of attention. It has been shown that the style of the agent's look and behaviour strongly influences the user's attitude. In this paper we discuss our GESTYLE language making it possible to endow ECAs with style. Style is defined in terms of when and how the ECA uses certain gestures, and how it modulates its speech (e.g. to indicate emphasis or sadness). There are also GESTYLE tags to annotate text, which has to be uttered by an ECA to prescribe the usage of hand, head and facial gestures accompanying the speech in order to augment the communication. The annotation ranges from direct, low level (e.g. perform a specific gesture) to indirect, high level (e.g. take turn in a conversation) instructions, which will be interpreted with respect to the style defined. Using style dictionaries and defining different aspects like age and culture of an ECA, it is possible to tune the behaviour of an ECA to suit a given user or target group the best.},

abstract = {Embodied computer agents are becoming an increasingly popular human-computer interaction technique. Often, these agents are programmed with the capacity for emotional expression. This paper investigates the psychological effects of emotion in agents upon users. In particular, two types of emotion were evaluated: self-oriented emotion and other-oriented, empathic emotion. In a 2 (self-oriented emotion: absent vs. present) by 2 (empathic emotion: absent vs. present) by 2 (gender dyad: male vs. female) between-subjects experiment (N = 96), empathic emotion was found to lead to more positive ratings of the agent by users, including greater likeability and trustworthiness, as well as greater perceived caring and felt support. No such effect was found for the presence of self-oriented emotion. Implications for the design of embodied computer agents are discussed and directions for future research suggested.},

abstract = {Research on humanoid robots has produced various uses for their body properties in communication. In particular, mutual relationships of body movements between a robot and a human are considered to be important for smooth and natural communication, as they are in human-human communication. We have developed a semi-autonomous humanoid robot system that is capable of cooperative body movements with humans using environment-based sensors and switching communicative units. Concretely, this system realizes natural communication by using typical behaviors such as: "nodding," "eye-contact," "face-to-face," etc. It is important to note that the robot parts are NOT operated directly; only the communicative units in the robot system are switched. We conducted an experiment using the mentioned robot system and verified the importance of cooperative behaviors in a route-guidance situation where a human gives directions to the robot. The task requires a human participant (called the "speaker") to teach a route to a "hearer" that is (1) a human, (2) a developed robot that performs cooperative movements, and (3) a robot that does not move at all. This experiment is subjectively evaluated through a questionnaire and an analysis of body movements using three-dimensional data from a motion capture system. The results indicate that the cooperative body movements greatly enhance the emotional impressions of human speakers in a route-guidance situation. We believe these results will allow us to develop interactive humanoid robots that sociably communicate with humans.},

However, previous work does not specifically address either the coordination of event dimensions with the types of tasks involved or the way that visualizing different event dimensions can benefit human analysis. In this paper, we propose a taxonomy of event visualization and present a methodology for evaluating a coordinated event visualization tool called COPLINK Spatio-Temporal Visualizer (STV). The taxonomy encompasses various event dimensions, application domains, visualization metaphors, evaluation methods and performance measures. The evaluation methodology examines different event dimensions and different task types, thus juxtaposing two important elements of evaluating a tool. To achieve both internal and external validity, a laboratory experiment with students and a field study with crime analysis experts were conducted. Findings of our usability study show that STV could support crime analysis involving multiple, coordinated event dimensions as effectively as it could analyze individual, uncoordinated event dimensions. STV was significantly more effective and efficient than Microsoft Excel in performing coordinated tasks and was significantly more efficient in doing uncoordinated tasks related to temporal, spatial and aggregated information. Also, STV had compared favorably with Excel in completing uncoordinated tasks related to temporal and spatial information, respectively. Subjects' comments showed STV to be intuitive, useful and preferable to existing crime analysis methods.},

abstract = {Virtual reality applications consist of an integrated combination of elements, such as hardware devices, interaction techniques, and content, in different modalities and qualities. Designers of virtual reality applications select combinations of such elements that allow users to accomplish their tasks, and it is feasible that more than one combination of such values will satisfy the user's needs. Unfortunately, current development environments, methodologies, and techniques in the field of virtual reality often preclude the exploration of the design alternatives, due to coverage or cost limitations. A limited number of options are covered by any given software development environment, and the development cost of new prototypes in such development platforms is too high to be considered as an evaluation tool. In this paper, we present a methodology for partial (i.e. hardware and interaction techniques alternatives) exploration of the design space of a virtual reality application, based on the creation of reusable components and a standard evaluation of alternatives. Since the cost of developing several versions of an application can be reduced by reusing elements from others, this method allows designers to evaluate the performance and user preferences of several implementations. As a proof of concept, we developed four versions of a simple matching application in different virtual reality platforms. Results of this study show how users react to each prototype and how the different solutions can be compared, no matter how different in technology they are.},

Schemas support this strategy and are implemented in such a way that perfection is disregarded at the profit of an intuitive trade-off between performance and cognitive resources savings. As a consequence, humans have a strong inclination to fit well-known solution procedures into new problems. For this reason, changes in work environments can cause accidents when they allow operators to interact with a new device if the latter is erroneously perceived as familiar. This research issue originates from an industrial background. The suspected cause of a fatal error performed by an operator in a steelworks factory is replicated in an experiment. The results support the hypothesis according to which errors (and possible subsequent accidents) due to changes in the interface are more likely when the latter does not inhibit former modes of interaction modes. This main result is discussed under the angle of cognitive ergonomics and used as a basis to provide design guidelines.},

abstract = {System-initiated digressive proposals may be used to introduce new and unexpected information into automated telephone services. These digressions may be viewed as particularly pronounced forms of unsolicited interruptions as they contain information not directly related to the caller's intended activity. In human-human conversation, interruptions are considered to be speech acts which intrinsically threaten both the positive and negative face wants of the addressee and conversants adopt specific verbal strategies to mitigate the negative impact of their interruptions. A question therefore arises whether the introduction of faceredressive expressions, based on human-human conversational strategies, into the design of system-initiated proposals in automated services can mitigate the negative impact of the interruptions. A usability experiment was conducted to examine the effectiveness of three contrasting politeness strategies for system-initiated digressions in a mass-market telephone banking dialogue using speech recognition technology. Participants (N = 111) experienced these proposals while using the automated service to perform banking tasks. Results indicated that all these system-initiated digressions--irrespective of politeness strategy employed--had a negative impact on the user attitudes towards the service. This paper reports these results and explores participants' perceptions of the politeness styles and registers employed in the system-initiated proposals.},

abstract = {Pointing tasks in human-computer interaction obey certain speed-accuracy tradeoff rules. In general, the more accurate the task to be accomplished, the longer it takes and vice versa. Fitts' law models the speed-accuracy tradeoff effect in pointing as imposed by the task parameters, through Fitts' index of difficulty (Id) based on the ratio of the nominal movement distance and the size of the target. Operating with different speed or accuracy biases, performers may utilize more or less area than the target specifies, introducing another subjective layer of speed-accuracy tradeoff relative to the task specification. A conventional approach to overcome the impact of the subjective layer of speed-accuracy tradeoff is to use the a posteriori "effective" pointing precision We in lieu of the nominal target width W. Such an approach has lacked a theoretical or empirical foundation. This study investigates the nature and the relationship of the two layers of speed-accuracy tradeoff by systematically controlling both Id and the index of target utilization Iu in a set of four experiments. Their results show that the impacts of the two layers of speed-accuracy tradeoff are not fundamentally equivalent. The use of We could indeed compensate for the difference in target utilization, but not completely. More logical Fitts' law parameter estimates can be obtained by the We adjustment, although its use also lowers the correlation between pointing time and the index of difficulty. The study also shows the complex interaction effect between Id and Iu, suggesting that a simple and complete model accommodating both layers of speed-accuracy tradeoff may not exist.},

abstract = {Throughput (TP), also known as index of performance or bandwidth in Fitts' law tasks, has been a fundamental metric in quantifying input system performance. The operational definition of TP is varied in the literature. In part thanks to the common interpretations of International Standard ISO 9241-9, the "Ergonomic requirements for office work with visual display terminals-- Part 9: Requirements for non-keyboard input devices", the measurements of throughput have increasingly converged onto the average ratio of index of difficulty (ID) and trial completion time (MT), i.e. TP=ID/MT. In lieu of the complete Fitts' law regression results that can only be represented by both slope (b) and intercept (a) (or MT=a+b ID), TP has been used as the sole performance characteristic of input devices, which is problematic. We show that TP defined as ID/ MT is an ill-defined concept that may change its value with the set of ID values used for the same input device and cannot be generalized beyond specific experimental target distances and sizes. The greater the absolute value of a is, the more variable TP (=ID/MT) is. ID/MT only equals a constant 1/b when a = 0. We suggest that future studies should use the complete Fitts' law regression characterized by (a, b) parameters to characterize an input system, a reflects the noninformational aspect and b the informational aspect of input performance. For convenience, 1/b can be named as throughput which, unlike ID/MT, is conceptually a true constant.},

abstract = {Since the advent of graphical user interfaces, electronic information has grown exponentially, whereas the size of screen displays has stayed almost the same. Multiscale interfaces were designed to address this mismatch, allowing users to adjust the scale at which they interact with information objects. The technology has progressed quickly and the theory has lagged behind. Multiscale interfaces pose a stimulating theoretical challenge: reformulating the classic target-acquisition problem from the physical world into an infinitely rescalable electronic world. We address this challenge by extending Fitts' original pointing paradigm: we introduce the scale variable, thus defining a multiscale pointing paradigm. This article reports on our theoretical and empirical results. We show that target-acquisition performance in a zooming interface must obey Fitts' law and, more specifically, that target-acquisition time must be proportional to the index of difficulty. Moreover, we complement Fitts' law by accounting for the effect of view size on pointing performance, showing that performance bandwidth is proportional to view size, up to a ceiling effect. Our first empirical study shows that Fitts' law does apply to a zoomable interface for indices of difficulty up to and beyond 30 bits. whereas classical Fitts' law studies have been confined in the 2-10 bit range. Our second study demonstrates a strong interaction between view size and task difficulty for multiscale pointing, and shows a surprisingly low ceiling. We conclude with implications of these findings for the design of multiscale user interfaces.},

The so-called Fitts' law states that MT = a + b ID, with ID being a logarithmic function of the D/W ratio. With the rising importance of pointing in human-computer interaction, Fitts' law is nowadays an important tool for the quantitative evaluation of user interface design. We show that changes in ID give rise to systematic changes in the kinematics patterns that determine MT, and provide evidence that the observed patterns result from the interplay between basic oscillatory motion and visual control processes. We also emphasize the generality and abstract nature of Fitts' robust model of human psychomotor behavior, and suggest that some adaptations in the design of the (computer-mediated) coupling of perception and production of movement might improve the efficiency of the interaction.},

The survey suggests that while the techniques developed to date are promising, particularly when applied to the selection of single isolated targets, many of them do not scale well to the common situation in graphical user interfaces where multiple targets are located in close proximity.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web provides a convenient and inexpensive infrastructure for Computer-Supported Cooperative Work. Groupware systems allow distant users to work together in a shared virtual workspace. Awareness of group members' actions is a basic feature and key functionality for groupware. Many times a group of people work together researching information on the Web about a topic. This type of collaboration can be decomposed into two tasks. First, team members have to access, process and filter by importance the Web pages gathered. Second, they have to synthesize and present them either as a whole in the form of a report, or in an organized way in the form of Web directories. A key issue that strongly affects this particular type of cooperative work is the revisiting of pages and, consequently, the time spent on accessing and processing the same information sources, which may be relevant or not to the topic. We propose group member URL traversal awareness (GMUTA) as significant functionality for Web-based collaboration tools in order to avoid conflicting or repetitive actions by group members. We then present a prototype system we developed, the Web Collaborative Searching Assistant (WCSA), which exploits GMUTA and helps distributed group members to work more efficiently. Experimental evaluation of the WCSA indicated that the functionality provided overcomes the above-mentioned problem, improves searching efficiency and adds substantial value to the collaboration.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effects of two different display modes head-up display (HUD) vs. head-down display (HDD) on the driving performance and psychological workload ratings of drivers operating commercial vehicles in Taiwan. Twelve commercial lorry drivers participated in a 2 (high/low driving load road) \texttimes{} 2 (head-up/head-down display) \texttimes{} 2 (different arrangements of display sequences used) mixed-factor driving simulation experiment. Participants were divided into two groups according to the level of driving load conditions within each driving load group; the participants were further divided into another 2 subgroups based on two arrangements of display sequences used. For each driving load condition, there were two 20-min driving simulation experiments, separated by a display sequence using head-up first and then head-down or vice versa. The subjects were asked to perform four tasks: "commercial goods delivery", "navigation", "speed detection and maintenance" and "response to an urgent event". Results indicated that for the first task, commercial goods delivery, the two display types showed no significant performance difference in terms of average accuracy rate. However, in terms of response time to an urgent event, it was faster with the HUD (with a low driving load-head-up vs. head-down: 1.0073 vs. 1.8684 s; with a high driving load--head-up vs. head-down: 1.3235 vs. 2.3274 s) and speed control was more consistent (having low speed variations) than with the HDD. In addition, using the HUD caused less mental stress for the drivers than the HDD and was easier for first-time users to become familiar with; with a high driving load, however, the difference between the two displays was not significant.},

abstract = {The use of automation within high-risk industrial production systems has increased markedly during the last 50 years. Automatic systems have gained in autonomy and authority, whereby the activity of the systems has become less dependent on operator interventions. This has brought forward the suggestion that human-automation transactions should be conceptualized within the framework of cooperation, and consequently that automatic systems should be designed to be cooperative. The question is then how design can promote human-automation cooperation, and how the quality of cooperation can be assessed. The OECD Halden Reactor Project performed two closely related experiments, which allowed assessments of whether the quality of human-automation cooperation would be promoted by a human-machine interface designed to increase the observability of the automatic system's activity using graphical and verbal feedback, as compared to a conventional human-machine interface. The experiments were performed in a full-scale nuclear power plant simulator, using licensed operators as subjects, and applied a 2 \texttimes{} 2 within-subject design. The quality of human-automation cooperation was assessed from subjective operator judgements. The experiments demonstrated a clear improvement in human-automation cooperation quality when the observability of the automatic system's activity was increased. The relationship between human-automation cooperation quality and the effectiveness of the joint human-machine system's performance was furthermore explored, but no clear results were found. As the trend in automation design seems to imply an increase in system autonomy and authority, the issue of human-automation cooperation can be expected to further gain in importance in the future settings.},

abstract = {Current trends in e-business are creating opportunities for automation of business processes across business boundaries. However, lack of standards has caused difficulties for industry players in exploiting resources and coordinating activities in the context of e-business. ebXML--an emerging e-business standard framework to unite competing factions under a banner of international trade--has been developed within an industry consortium using an open, collaborative process with no barriers to entry, whose approach is very different from traditional approach to create standards. Drawing on socio-technological perspective, this paper attempts to gain deeper understanding of such phenomenon by using a case study methodology. This paper uses data drawn mostly from email discussions and minutes of teleconference and face-to-face meeting. Our exploration of the ebXML standardization process generates specific propositions. In summary, our analysis found that the 'openness' of standardization process helps to create a more comprehensive standard than proprietary standards--effectively leading to convergence of technologies, and that the unfolding dynamics of standardization process varies depending on the characteristics of standards to be developed. We also discuss user participation as an important factor that influences the dynamics of standardization process in such an open, collaborative standardization process. Surprisingly, user participation seems to be more effective in creating technical infrastructure oriented standards rather than business process oriented standards.},

First, we developed a framework for the classification of image descriptions by users, based on various classification methods from the literature. The classification framework distinguishes three related viewpoints on images, namely nonvisual metadata, perceptual descriptions and conceptual descriptions. For every viewpoint a set of descriptive classes and relations is specified. We used the framework in an empirical study, in which image descriptions were formulated by 30 participants. The resulting descriptions were split into fragments and categorized in the framework. The results suggest that users prefer general descriptions as opposed to specific or abstract descriptions. Frequently used categories were objects, events and relations between objects in the image.},

abstract = {In this work we present a framework for multi-agent system design which is based both on human organizational notions and principles for distributed intelligent systems design. The framework elaborates on the idea that notions from the field of organizational design can be used as the basis for the design of distributed intelligent systems. Concepts such as task, control, job, operation, management, coordination and organization are framed into an agent organizational framework. A collection of organizational design activities is presented that assist in a task oriented decomposition of the overall task of a system into jobs and the reintegration of jobs using job allocation, coordination mechanisms and organizational structuring. A number of coordination mechanisms have been defined in the organizational design literature. For the scope of this work we concentrate on: Direct Supervision where one individual takes all decisions about the work of others, Mutual Adjustment that achieves coordination by a process of informal communication between agents, and Standardization of Work, Output and Skills. Three organizational structures are discussed, that coordinate agents and their work: Machine Bureaucracy, Professional Bureaucracy and Adhocracy. The Machine Bureaucracy is task-driven, seeing the organization as a single-purpose structure, which only uses one strategy to execute the overall task. The Professional Bureaucracy is competence-driven, where a part of the organization will first examine a case, match it to predetermined situations and then allocate specialized agents to it. In the Adhocracy the organization is capable of reorganizing its own structure including dynamically changing the work flow, shifting responsibilities and adapting to changing environments. A case study on distributed supply chain management shows the process from task decomposition via organizational design to three multi-agent architectures based on Mintzberg's organizational structures.},

abstract = {We present a Prolog programming technique-based approach to guided programming and automated error analysis in Prolog tutoring. The concept of Prolog programming technique is used to characterize and classify programs. Each class of programs use the same programming technique and share the common pattern of code. A set of programming technique grammar rules are defined for each class of programs. These rules are used for programming technique recognition, program construction, and program parsing. A programming technique frame is used to represent the programming technique-related knowledge for each class of programs. A program frame is used to represent the coding-related knowledge for the reference program of each of the most specialized programming techniques. The representation of the programming technique grammar rules, programming technique-related knowledge, and coding-related knowledge provides the basis for guided programming and automated error analysis in tutoring. Our approach to error analysis however does not rely on the representation of buggy versions of the program. Automated error analysis in our approach is done on the basis of comparing the parsings of both the student program and the reference program. Our approach has been implemented in a Prolog tutoring system called the Prolog Tutor, which has been tested on a collection of 125 programs for list reversal. The Prolog Tutor performs well on these tests in terms of programming technique recognition, error detection, and error correction.},

Prior research has shown that the design of product listing pages, where information on multiple products are displayed together to allow further exploration of any of them, has a great influence on the traffic and sales volume on a website. In this paper, we focus on two design features, presentation mode and information format, and examine their impact on users' interaction with websites. An experiment was conducted to compare text-only versus image-text presentation modes, based on the dual coding theory (DCT), and list versus array information formats, based on the proximity compatibility principle (PCP). In general, the findings support the application of the DCT and the PCP to the e-commerce domain. Specifically, the image-text presentation mode and the list information format were found to outperform the text-only presentation mode and the array information format respectively in terms of shorter information search time, better recall of brand names and product images, and more positive attitudes towards the screen design and using the website. Given the same information content, the spatial arrangement of products and the hierarchical placement of images can make a difference to users' online shopping performance and attitudes.},

abstract = {It is well known that conceptual database design is an unusually difficult and error-prone task for novice designers. To address the problem, at least two training approaches--rule-based and pattern-based--have been suggested. A rule-based approach prescribes a sequence in modelling the conceptual modelling constructs, and the action to be taken at each stage. A pattern-based approach presents data modelling structures that occur frequently in practice, and prescribes guidelines on how to recognize these structures. This paper describes the conceptual framework, experimental design, and results of a laboratory study that employed novice designers to compare the effectiveness of the two training approaches (between-subjects) at three levels of task complexity (within subjects). Results indicate an interaction effect between treatment and task complexity. The rule-based approach was significantly better in the low-complexity and the high-complexity cases; there was no statistical difference in the medium-complexity case. Designer performance fell significantly as complexity increased. Overall, although the rule-based approach was not significantly superior to the pattern-based approach, the study still recommends the rule-based approach for novice designers given the significantly better performance at two out of three complexity levels.},

This paper provides a theoretical underpinning for understanding the relevance of user embodiments and copresence within such three-dimensional collaborative computer interfaces. Firstly, the issue of embodiment is traced back through its origins in philosophy and psychology literature, and theories are identified, potentially helpful in understanding key issues concerning user embodiments in collaborative virtual environments. A hybrid avatar/agent model to achieve permanent user embodiments in such environments is discussed. Since copresence of other users within such environments has been shown to be an important factor for the experience of presence, a prototype embodied conversational agent has been designed to simulate copresence. A series of controlled experiments involving the prototype agent is discussed, highlighting the effects of simulated copresence on users' experience of presence. Results suggest that, despite its shortcomings, the prototype agent does seem to have increased participants' experience of presence. Evidence was found that even limited copresence as provided by the current prototype agent is sufficient to help users feel presence in the environment. The results seem to confirm that copresence simulated by agents can complement avatar technology and therefore that a hybrid avatar/ agent model can potentially achieve permanent virtual presence of all participants.},

The work reported here extends the study of situation awareness into the domain of emergency medical dispatch (EMD). The study was conducted in one of the largest ambulance services in the world. In this study, we encountered development and exploitation of situation awareness, particularly among the more senior EMD operators called allocators. In this paper we describe the notion of a 'mental picture' as an outcome of situation awareness, how an awareness of the situation is developed and maintained, the cues allocators attend to, and the difficulties they face in doing so. One of the key characteristics of ambulance control is that relatively routine behaviour is periodically interspersed with incidents that demand much higher levels of attention, but that the routine work must still be completed; operators exhibit contrasting levels of situation awareness for the different kinds of incidents. Our findings on situation awareness are related to those of others, particularly Endsley and Wickens. The observations and interviews enable us to propose high-level requirements for systems to support appropriate situation awareness, to enable EMD staff to complete their work effectively.},

The experiments are conducted using both computer-supported systems and physical models that vary the depth and perspective cues in spatial arrangements of interface items. The physical models were used to escape some of the dimensional ambiguities that are hard to control using computer displays. Results strongly suggest that adding a third dimension to computer displays does not aid users" spatial memory. Although there were no significant differences between the effectiveness of spatial memory when using two- and three-dimensional computer interfaces, participants" memory for the location of cards representing web-pages was reliably better when using a two-dimensional physical model than when using an equivalent three-dimensional physical model.},

Neilsen argued for offering a slightly apologetic statement before an error message provided by web servers, but the notion of a computer apologizing to its users inevitably triggers a debate about the appropriateness of providing humanized messages to users. To understand how users react to computers' apologies (presented by textual or visual formats), a computer-guessing game was designed to test users' reactions. The game features three treatments (difficulty levels, feedback types, and emotional icons), each having two levels (difficult vs. easy, apologetic feedback vs. non-apologetic feedback, with emotional icons vs. without emotional icons). Two-hundred and sixty nine high school students participated in this study and were randomly assigned to one of eight groups. The results show that while the computers' actual performances still dominated the users' assessments of the program, the computer apologies help to create more desirable psychological experiences for the users, and emotional icons help to improve the aesthetic quality of the program.},

abstract = {This study examined how users acquire spatial cognition in 3D user interfaces depicting an on-screen virtual environment. The study was divided into two main phases: learning and a test of learning transfer. The learning phase consisted of participants directly navigating (search for objects) in the on-screen virtual environment using one of two navigation aids: a visual map or a route list. In addition, there were two virtual environments, one with landmarks and the other without landmarks. Learning transfer was examined by testing both navigation and orientation tasks (relative-direction pointing) in the environment without the use of the navigation aids. Findings show that while the initial navigation with a map appeared to be harder, with longer navigation times and more navigation steps than with a route list, this difference became insignificant at the end of the learning phase. Moreover, performance degradation upon removal of the navigation aids was less for those that navigated with a map as compared to route list. A similar pattern was found for the impact of landmarks, Initial navigation with landmarks appeared to be harder than without landmarks, but this difference became insignificant at the end of the learning phase. Moreover, performance degradation upon removal of the navigation aid was less for those that navigated with landmarks as compared to no landmarks. Finally, the combined impact of both the navigation aid used in the learning and the presence of landmarks was primarily evident in the orientation task. Relative direction pointing was better for those who learnt with a map without landmarks, or with route list with landmarks. The findings are discussed in terms of the impact of navigations aids and landmarks on the acquisition of route and survey knowledge in spatial cognition. In addition, some gender differences are discussed in terms of different strategies in spatial cognition acquisition.},

abstract = {Although electronic communication plays an important role in the modern workplace, the interruptions created by poorly-timed attempts to communicate are disruptive. Prior work suggests that sharing an indication that a person is currently busy might help to prevent such interruptions, because people could wait for a person to become available before attempting to initiate communication. We present a context-aware communication client that uses the built-in microphones of laptop computers to sense nearby speech. Combining this speech detection sensor data with location, computer, and calendar information, our system models availability for communication, a concept that is distinct from the notion of presence found in widely-used systems. In a 4 week study of the system with 26 people, we examined the use of this additional context. To our knowledge, this is the first-field study to quantitatively examine how people use automatically sensed context and availability information to make decisions about when and how to communicate with colleagues. Participants appear to have used the provided context to as an indication of presence, rather than considering availability. Our results raise the interesting question of whether sharing an indication that a person is currently unavailable will actually reduce inappropriate interruptions.},

abstract = {This study extends previous media equation research, which showed that the effects of flattery from a computer can produce the same general effects as flattery from humans. Specifically, the study explored the potential moderating effect of experience on the impact of flattery from a computer. One hundred and fifty-eight students from the University of Queensland voluntarily participated in the study. Participants interacted with a computer and were exposed to one of three kinds of feedback: praise (sincere praise), flattery (insincere praise), or control (generic feedback). Questionnaire measures assessing participants' affective state, attitudes and opinions were taken. Participants of high experience, but not low experience, displayed a media equation pattern of results, reacting to flattery from a computer in a manner congruent with peoples' reactions to flattery from other humans. High experience participants tended to believe that the computer spoke the truth, experienced more positive affect as a result of flattery, and judged the computer's performance more favourably. These findings are interpreted in light of previous research and the implications for software design in fields such as entertainment and education are considered.},

abstract = {In designing a human-computer interface (interface for short) for a complex work domain, the first question to be answered is what information should be presented on the interface display. The simplest answer may be: it depends on tasks to be performed by the human operator. In the past two decades, several studies towards a satisfactory answer to this question have been reported in literature, among which a study called ecological interface design framework is most sound. Motivated by a discussion with a nuclear power plant builder (in Canada) five years ago, we have conducted a study on the interface framework and obtained very interesting results. One of the salient findings is that the current implementation of the notion of the abstract function in the ecological interface design framework is worthy of further exploration. More fundamentally, one of its basic methods, called the five-level abstraction hierarchy used for work domain analysis, can be more commented on its architecture. Our findings are based on a critical analysis of published articles on the ecological interface design framework. We further postulated an alternative framework called function behavior-state (FBS). We have conducted an experiment to compare these two frameworks, which positively supported our findings. The present article reports the critical analysis of the ecological interface design framework and describes the FBS framework. The experimental study has been reported separately in this journal.},

abstract = {Well-defined symbolic notations are essential for communication between teams of people working on any application. For large software implementations, UML is commonly used, for databases, entity relationship (ER) diagrams are useful. However, the form of notation used in texts, papers, and documentation and learning materials is often different, and tends to reflect the personal preference of the author or publisher. The choice between semantically equivalent notations does not appear to be based on any consideration of the ease with which human readers could understand the notation. This paper addresses this notation comprehension issue by proposing an experimental methodology for determining which of two complete notations is easier to comprehend. The methodology also allows individual notational variants to be targeted. This methodology has been applied to two types of ER notations: our experiment required subjects to indicate whether a supplied textual specification of objects and relationships matched each of a set of Chen (Chen, ACM Trans. Database Systems 1 (1976) 9) and SSADM (Weaver, Practical SSADM Version 4-A Complete Tutorial Guide, Pitman, London, 1993) ER diagrams. The results reveal both better performance and higher preference for the more concise overall notation, with partial results with respect to individual variants within the notations.},

Other work has shown that breakdowns in the accurate sharing of goals are a significant contributor to bugs, delays and design flaws. This paper discusses one mechanism by which teams unify their vision of a solution. It describes how the mental imagery used by a key team member in constructing an abstract solution to a design problem can be externalized and adopted by the rest of the team as a focal image. Examples drawn from in situ observations of actual design practice of a number of computer system design teams are offered. The examples illustrate how the images were introduced, how they were used to coordinate subsequent design discussions, hence how they evolved, and how shorthand references to them were incorporated into the team's 'jargon'.},

Our approach to data collection was to use semi-structured interviews and to encourage interviewees to talk about their experiences of quality management and software development in their own organizations. We analysed this data using discourse analysis, informed by ethnographic observation, and identified a number of themes, one of which was the tensions that exist around the adoption and evolution of SQMS. In this paper, we present and discuss our approach to discourse analysis and some results that illustrate the tensions we found. We hope, thereby, to demonstrate how software engineers may use a technique from the social sciences to better understand their own practices.},

MBA students carried out an on-line Question-Posing Assignment (QPA) that consisted of two components: <i>Knowledge Developement</i> and <i>Knowledge Contribution</i>. The students also performed self- and peer-assessment and took an on-line examination, all administered by QSIA-an on-line system for assessment and knowledge sharing. Our objective was to explore student's learning and knowledge sharing while engaged in the above. findings indicated that even controlling for the students' prior knowledge or abilities, those who were highly engaged in on-line question-posing and peer-assessment activity received higher scores on their final examination Compared to their counter peers. The results provide evidence that web-based activities can serve as both learning and assessment enhancers in higher education by promoting active learning, constructive criticism and knowledge sharing. We propose the on-line QPA as a methodology, and QSIA system as the technology for merging assessment and knowledge sharing in higher education.},

A connectionist filtering algorithln is used to capture the textual continuity as one of the structural backbone of text. As a result, the content conveyed by text with discontinuous topic sequence is. on average, most unlikely to be included in the resultant discourse structure.

It involves the evaluation of a large number of parameters and requires context evaluation. In this paper, the approach adopted in a justification engine of a European Research project is presented. The approach solves many of the problems of music justification: alignment of simultaneous symbols in polyphonic music, spacing dependent from the duration of the figures, compactness and readability of the resulting measure. justification of both main scores and parts. In the paper, several justification algorithms are described and compared. Stretching and shrinking of measures is also possible, while keeping the justification through a tuning parameter. The resulting algorithm can also handle automatically many music notation exceptions: for example time inconsistency of the justified measure and presence of non-durational figures, grace notes, change of clef/key signature, etc. The solution proposed presents a module for music line-breaking. This is included in the justification engine as an option for visualizing and printing right margined music sheets, Several examples are reported to highlight both the problems and the solutions adopted.},

abstract = {While current Web technologies have allowed us to publish intellectual assets in world-wide repositories, and to browse the resulting massive accumulation, we have no effective tools yet to flexibly re-edit and redistribute such intellectual assets for their reuse in different contexts. Open Hypermedia Systems addressed the problem of augmenting third-party applications in 90s, and more recently Web augmentation. We need extended OHS technologies for the advanced reuse of Web-published intellectual assets through re-editing and redistributing them. Meme media and meme pool technologies will work as such extended Open Hypermedia Systems technologies to annotate, re-edit, and redistribute Web-published assets. This paper reviews the IntelligentPad and IntelligentBox meme media architectures together with their potential applications, and proposes both the use of XML/XSL or XHTML to define two-dimensional meme media objects. When applied to Web contents, meme media technologies make the World Wide Web operate as a meme pool, where people can publish their intellectual assets as Web pages, access some Web pages to extract some of their parts as meme media objects through drag-and-drop operations, visually combine these meme media objects together with other meme media objects to compose new intellectual assets, and publish these assets again as Web pages. Our framework creates a new vista in the circulation and reuse of our knowledge represented as multimedia documents and/or application programs, especially in the field of science.},

This is because the natural language interface allows users to articulate their requests directly and intuitively, and charts and graphics have many benefits when analysing a large amount of data in order to determine overall characteristics or to resolve user questions. The proposed method resolves the conundrum that the appropriateness of a chart depends on the context. In this method, two factors are considered in choosing chart type so as to satisfy the user requirement represented in a natural language: the type of chart displayed and the type of user utterance. Our proposed method allows the data to be visualized interactively to match the changes in the user's viewpoint without interrupting the thinking process.},

abstract = {FreeWalk is a social interaction platform where people and agents can socially and spatially interact with one another. FreeWalk has evolved to support heterogeneous interaction styles including meetings, cross-cultural encounters, and evacuation drills. Each of them is usually supported by an individual virtual environment. This evolution extended the capability to control social interaction. The first prototype only provides people with an environment in which they can gather to talk with one another while the third prototype provides them with a whole situation to behave according to their assigned roles and tasks. FreeWalk1 is a spatial videoconferencing system. In this system, the positions of participants make spontaneous simultaneous conversations possible. Spatial movements are integrated with videomediated communication. FreeWalk1 is able to make social interaction more casual and relaxed than telephone-like telecommunication media. In contrast to conventional videoconferencing systems, people formed concurrent multiple groups to greet and chat with others. In FreeWalk2, a social agent acts as an in-between of people to reduce the problem of the low social context in virtual spaces. When the agent notes an awkward pause in a conversation, it approaches those involved in the conversation with a suggestion for a new topic to talk about. We used this agent to support cross-cultural communication between Japan and US. Our agent strongly influenced people's impressions of their partners, and also, their stereotypes about their partner's nationality. FreeWalk3 is a virtual city simulator to conduct virtual evacuation drills. This system brings social interaction into crisis management simulation. People can join a virtual scene of a disaster at home. Social agents can also join to play their roles assigned by simulation designers. The system architecture has a split control interface to divide control of multiple agents into high-level instruction for them and simulation of their low-level actions. The interface helps simulation designers to control many agents efficiently.},

abstract = {Our research focuses on the nature of voice interaction and activation of psychological tendencies in humans by the power of prosody sounds. This study examines whether people's impressions and behaviours are affected by variations in the speed of hummed sounds. The sounds consist of just prosodic components similar to continuous humming on the open vowel /a/ or /o/ without any language information. In interaction between individuals as well as among animals, temporal structures including voice speed or duration contribute rhythmic interaction and are closely connected to the participants' dynamics of mental or emotional states. We think that this phenomenon can be applied to human-computer interaction, even through the variation in temporal structures of hummed sounds used to reduce the influence of content or meaning in language. Our interactive system mimics the prosodic features of the human voice by using humming-only sounds under three different voice speed conditions: (a) faster, (b) normal, and (c) slower than the original speaker. We examine whether the variation in the sound's speed gives rise to both psychological and behavioural influences in the relationship between the computer and the subject through interaction. Subjects tend to prefer a computer with a normal or faster speaking rate to that with a slower rate on both usefulness and familiarity. Moreover, the speech rate of the subjects changed inversely to the variation in a computer's hummed sounds. This study demonstrates the importance of temporal structure and emphasizes the need for an investigation of the fundamentals at work in interaction.},

After a general discussion on web site design issues, we present a short survey of evaluation methods currently used for web sites. We next introduce a new taxonomy of site categories in a three-dimensional space, derived from Aristotle's rhetorical triangle, including different aspects of the site designer's goals. In our approach, we use this taxonomy to identify a number of sites belonging to the same category, in order to carry out a comparative analysis of their features. This analysis is the basis for a two-shot generation of a form for the evaluation of that category of sites. In the first shot, the users fill a generic evaluation form, acquainting them with sites characteristics. They are next asked to perform specific tasks of their choice, according to what they expect from a site of the given category. They note their impressions and list those features they found useful; the analysis of their comments is exploited to formulate statements specific to the given category, to be added to the initial form (second shot). We found that the responses to the second, expanded form, provide more comprehensive criteria for site evaluation, and turn helpful to precisely locate flaws in site functionalities. After testing, our methodology has proved very promising and may be applied for the evaluation of any other site category, most of all those providing a set of special services.},

The results indicate that a team's cultural composition is a sign1ificant predictor of its performance on programming projects. Cultural attributes most strongly correlated to group performance included those related to attitudes about organizational hierarchy, organizational harmony, trade-offs between future and current needs, and beliefs about how much influence individuals have on their fate. Moreover, the type of programming task affected the strength of the relationship between individual cultural attributes and performance. Participants in the study included computer science students from the University of North Texas (Texas, USA) and students from the Middle East Technical University in Ankara, Turkey. Students were divided into culturally diverse work-teams and assigned programming projects to be completed using special collaborative software. The programming tasks ranged from simple design projects to more complicated programs that required extensive collaboration. Cultural distinctions between work-teams were based upon the students' responses to the CPQ. Project performance was evaluated with respect to programming accuracy, efficiency, completeness, and style. The results presented here have important implications for the formation of distributed collaborations and, in particular, to educational institutions offering distance-learning programs that require team projects.},

The primary environmental characteristics were layout orthogonality (using paths that intersected at either oblique or 90° angles), lines of sight (controlled using computer-generated "fog"), a visually defined perimeter and global landmarks. Participants travelled less far in orthogonal than oblique environments, even when fog was used to make the distance that participants could see equivalent. The removal of fog caused a further, substantial reduction in the distance participants travelled, indicating the importance of extended lines of sight, as predicted by the architectural theory of space syntax. Global landmarks promoted a similar rate of spatial learning to a visual perimeter.},

abstract = {Despite its centrality to human thought and practice, aesthetics has for the most part played a petty role in human-computer interaction research. Increasingly, however, researchers attempt to strike a balance between the traditional concerns of human-computer interaction and considerations of aesthetics. Thus, recent research suggests that the visual aesthetics of computer interfaces is a strong determinant of users' satisfaction and pleasure. However, the lack of appropriate concepts and measures of aesthetics may severely constraint future research in this area. To address this issue, we conducted four studies in order to develop a measurement instrument of perceived web site aesthetics. Using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses we found that users' perceptions consist of two main dimensions, which we termed "classical aesthetics" and "expressive aesthetics". The classical aesthetics dimension pertains to aesthetic notions that presided from antiquity until the 18th century. These notions emphasize orderly and clear design and are closely related to many of the design rules advocated by usability experts. The expressive aesthetics dimension is manifested by the designers' creativity and originality and by the ability to break design conventions. While both dimensions of perceived aesthetic are drawn from a pool of aesthetic judgments, they are clearly distinguishable from each other. Each of the aesthetic dimensions is measured by a five-item scale. The reliabilities, factor structure and validity tests indicate that these items reflect the two perceived aesthetics dimensions adequately.},

The experience is characterized by some common elements: a balance between the challenges of an activity and the skills required to meet those challenges; clear goals and feedback; concentration on the task at hand; a sense of control; a merging of action and awareness; a loss of self-consciousness; a distorted sense of time; and the autotelic experience.The grounded theory research method that was employed in this study is a primarily inductive investigative process in which the researcher formulates a theory about a phenomenon by systematically gathering and analysing relevant data. The aim of this research method is building theory, not testing theory.

The research followed the students for 2 months, and consisted of both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the students' performance. We found that most of the students had a rich understanding of various synchronization problems. However, many of them developed a pattern-based technique that successfully solved synchronization problems, thus elegantly exempting them from dealing with the dynamics of the synchronization mechanisms; consequently, concepts regarding this theme became inert. Moreover, we were able to uncover reasonable, yet faulty connections that many students had made between the new knowledge and their existing knowledge; these connections were the source of their difficulties. From the findings, we were able to make valuable recommendations for the next version of the course: (a) encouraging alternative connections to existing knowledge by redesigning the instruction, such as representing semaphores in a way that resembles a complex data structure rather than as variables of type integer, and (b) integrating knowledge found to be productive by the students into the instruction to anchor more advanced knowledge, for example utilizing the pattern-based technique as a tool for correctness verification.},

As an alternative, a Web-based document management and retrieval system has been developed aimed at small communities in specialized domains. The system is based on the free annotation of documents by users and is browsed using the concept lattice of formal concept analysis (FCA). A number of knowledge acquisition techniques were developed to aid the annotation process. Experiments were conducted using the system to assist in finding staff and student home pages at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of New South Wales. Results indicated that the annotation tools provided a good level of assistance so that documents were easily organized and a lattice-based browsing structure that evolves in an ad hoc fashion provided good efficiency in retrieval performance. Results also indicated that the concept lattice helped take users beyond a narrow search to find other useful documents. These findings suggest that the concept lattice of FCA, supported by annotation techniques is a useful way of supporting the flexible open management of documents required by individuals, small communities and in specialized domains.},

abstract = {Models of interactive systems can be used to answer focused questions about those systems. Making the appropriate choice of modelling technique depends on what questions are being asked. We present two styles of interactive system model and associated verification method. We show how they contrast in terms of tractability, inspectability of assumptions, level of abstraction and reusability of model fragments. These trade-offs are discussed. We discuss how they can be used as part of an integrated formal approach to the analysis of interactive systems where the different formal techniques focus on specific problems raised by empirical investigations. Explanations resulting from the formal analyses can be validated with respect to the empirical data.The first modelling style, which we term 'operational', is derived directly from principles of rationality that constrain which user behaviours are modelled. Modelling involves laying out user knowledge of the system and task, and their goals, then applying the principles to reason about the space of rational behaviours. This style supports reasoning about user knowledge and the consequences of particular knowledge in terms of likely behaviours. It is well suited to reasoning about interactions where user knowledge is a key to successful interaction. Such models can readily be implemented as computer programs; one such implementation is presented here.Models of the second style, 'abstract', are derived from the operational models and thus retain important aspects of rationality. As a result of the simplification, mathematical proof about selected properties of the interactive system, such as safety properties, can be tractably applied to these models. This style is well suited to cases where the user adopts particular strategies that can be represented succinctly within the model.We demonstrate the application of the two styles for understanding a reported phenomenon, using a case study on electronic diaries.},

In this work we adopt a different approach to personalization: how to personalize the interaction between interface agents and users in a mixed-initiative interaction context. We have empirically studied a set of interaction issues that agents have to take into account to achieve this goal and we present our results in this article. Some of these personalization issues are: discovering the type of assistant a user wants, learning when (and if) to interrupt the user, discovering how the user wants to be assisted in different contexts. As a result of our experiments, we have defined the components of a user interaction profile that models a user's interaction and assistance preferences. This profile will enable interface agents to enhance and personalize their interaction with users by discovering how to provide each user assistance of the right sort at the right time.},

However, consecutive events can happen as a random co-occurrence, for reasons that actually differ from the ones believed by the operator. Nonetheless, because of the consistency between the environmental data and the operator's expectations, one event can be taken to be the cause of the other. When this false belief happens, the mental model is erroneously assumed to be valid. We discuss this phenomenon and its potential disastrous consequences using the example of a real commercial air crash. We finally address some implications for systems' design and support tools.},

The major problems in building ontologies are the bottleneck of knowledge acquisition and time-consuming construction of various ontologies for various domains/ applications. Meanwhile moving toward automation of ontology construction is a solution.We proposed an automatic ontology building approach. In this approach, the system starts from a small ontology kernel and constructs the ontology through text understanding automatically. The kernel contains the primitive concepts, relations and operators to build an ontology. The features of our proposed model are being domain/application independent, building ontologies upon a small primary kernel, learning words, concepts, taxonomic and non-taxonomic relations and axioms and applying a symbolic, hybrid ontology learning approach consisting of logical, linguistic based, template driven and semantic analysis methods.Hasti is an ongoing project to implement and test the automatic ontology building approach. It extracts lexical and ontological knowledge from Persian (Farsi) texts.In this paper, at first, we will describe some ontology engineering problems, which motivated our approach. In the next sections, after a brief description of Hasti, its features and its architecture, we will discuss its components in detail. In each part, the learning algorithms will be described. Then some experimental results will be discussed and at last, we will have an overview of related works and will introduce a general framework to compare ontology learning systems and will compare Hasti with related works according to the framework.},

Commun. 42(4) (1992) 73) and Rheingold' (The Virtual Community, ACM/Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1993) arguments on perceptual experience in the virtual space, we present a theoretical framework that highlights the relative importance of interactivity, immersion, and connectivity for attracting customers through a Web site. Interactivity has been measured through the speed of interactivity, range of interactivity, and significance. Immersion has been measured through the breadth of immersion and depth of immersion. Connectivity has been measured through the scope of connectivity. Through an experimental study, the features of amazon.com, ebay.com, schwab.com, and victoriasecret.com have been analysed with respect to interactivity, immersion, and connectivity. We argue that in order to attract customers through their Web sites, dot-coms are required to balance a trade-off between interactivity, immersion, and connectively, depending on their business objectives.},

abstract = {A human-machine interface framework provides general guidelines for what information should be put on an interface display screen. The framework is thus a first step towards the design of an effective and efficient interface. This paper reports on an experimental study of two proposed frameworks: the ecological interface design framework and the function behaviour-state framework. In order to provide an unbiased comparative evaluation for both interfaces, the same application problem is used. The interfaces, based on each of the two frameworks, are implemented with as similar look-and-feel forms as possible in the presentation of information contents. Only the normal control operation and fault detection situations are considered at this stage of the study. In addition, in this study three categories of measures are used, namely: the performance measure; the physiological measure (the eye movement measure: the eye fixation and the pupil diameter change, in particular); and the subjective (or the user-rated) measure. The major results obtained from the study includes the following: (1) the information called the abstract function in the ecological interface design framework may not positively correlate to the performance improvement yet may increase the mental workload, (2) the function-behaviour-state framework seems more agreeable with the operator's mental model, and (3) operators may perform equally well with a function-behaviour-state interface but with a reduced mental workload. It is also found that the eye fixation measure is highly consistent with the performance measure and the subjective measure. The pupil diameter measure is found not to be significantly sensitive to the mental workload information; however, it appears sensitive to the mental workload information among individual participants and shows a consistent result with the other measures used.},

abstract = {This paper addresses a sensitive issue, of presence experienced by people interacting with a virtual environment (VE). Understanding 'presence', both theoretically and empirically, is important for designers interested in building effective computer-mediated environments for learning and work activities. The concept of presence has been treated mostly as a state of mind, to be investigated through 'objective' and 'subjective' measurement devices. The authors propose to add a different approach, which can address presence as an action-based process. This approach considers presence as the ongoing result of the actions performed in an environment and the local and cultural resources deployed by actors. In this sense, 'presence' can be captured by monitoring the sequence of participants' actions and the aspects of the environment that are involved in this process; discourse/interaction analysis represents a fitting method for this goal. Sequences of interaction with a virtual library are used to illustrate some core aspects of an ethnographic, action-based approach to presence, such as the action possibilities envisaged by participants, the configuration of the virtual objects, the norms that regulate the interaction, the resources that are imported in the VE. These aspects are a necessary step to understand users' presence in the VE and to plan consequent interventions to ameliorate the design of the interface.},

A method is also provided for automatic generation of both types of instructions based on the learning of user experience in web browsing. An experiment was conducted to test the effect of types of instruction, sources of instruction, and task complexity setting on performance variables in web browsing. The results of the experiment indicated that (1) by using web annotations, guided instructions resulted in better performance and satisfactions than narrative instructions in web browsing, (2) based on learning of web browsing activities, automatically generated guided instructions are comparable to expert-created guided instructions in terms of their effect on the performance of web browsing.},

These suite provides users with a uniform framework for comparing, aligning, and merging ontologies, maintaining versions, translating between different formalisms. Two of the tools in the suite support semi-automatic ontology merging: IPROMPT is an interactive ontology-merging tool that guides the user through the merging process, presenting him with suggestions for next steps and identifying inconsistencies and potential problems. ANCHORPROMPT uses a graph structure of ontologies to find correlation between concepts and to provide additional information for IPROMPT.},

These characteristics imply that a note-taking system should use pen, keyboard and mouse-or-equivalent; allow the swift entry of text at any desired position; and minimize the need to switch between input tools. A system with these properties was built and used by 10 subjects in a controlled study and by four users in their classes. Some users preferred our system to pencil and paper, suggesting that taking class notes with the computer is feasible.},

Results showed significant differences across conditions with regard to the confidence attached by groups to their decisions, the degree to which groups were able to improve upon the best individually arrived at decision, and the self-reported enjoyment of group members. Compared to face-to-face groups, video-conferencing groups showed lower levels of confidence in their decisions, especially if they were instructed to discuss their beliefs and assumptions underlying their estimates and not the estimates themselves. However, this lower level of confidence was more appropriate than that of the face-to-face groups. Groups interacting face-to-face were more likely to improve upon the best individual solution, and, on average, improved to a greater degree. Further, video-conferencing groups reported modifying more of their beliefs during discussion. However, there were no significant differences between the two interaction media on the following outcome dimensions: accuracy; overconfidence; commitment to the group decision; size of credible intervals; improvement over average initial individual estimates; and the number of beliefs discussed or learned. Implications for the design and application of advanced systems for decision-making support and research are discussed.},

This research aims to identify quantitative relationships between key design factors and generic dimensions of secondary emotions so that we may develop homepages which target emotions more effectively. In order to achieve this goal, we conducted three related studies. In the first study, we identified 13 generic dimensions of secondary emotions that people usually feel when viewing diverse homepages. In the second study, we identified key design factors that professional designers frequently use in their attempts to develop emotionally evocative homepages. Finally, in the third study, we identified quantitative relationships between the key design factors and the 13 emotional dimensions. This paper describes these three studies and concludes with the implications and limitations of the study results.},

The language of the application is often at variance with the native language of its users. This issue is frequently addressed through localization. In turn, localization generates a range of new problems. We propose an alternative to localization that is analogous to cinematic subtitles. This has the potential to reduce the user interaction defects that otherwise arise with localization whilst benefiting users through an additional channel of information in their own language. This paper outlines a prototype implementation and describes our initial evaluation of this approach. We suggest that our complementary 'subtitles' promise consistent support for all applications in the user's computing environment and yield a system that is expandable and much easier to maintain than pre-localized software.},

abstract = {As in many other applications, the rapid proliferation and unrestricted Web-based publishing of health-related content have made finding pertinent and useful healthcare information increasingly difficult. Although the development of healthcare information retrieval systems such as medical search engines and peer-reviewed medical Web directories has helped alleviate this information and cognitive overload problem, the effectiveness of these systems has been limited by low search precision, poor presentation of search results, and the required user search effort. To address these challenges, we have developed a domain-specific meta-search tool called Cancer Spider. By leveraging post-retrieval document clustering techniques, this system aids users in querying multiple medical data sources to gain an overview of the retrieved documents and locating answers of high quality to a wide spectrum of health questions. The system presents the retrieved documents to users in two different views: (1) Web pages organized by a list of key phrases, and (2) Web pages clustered into regions discussing different topics on a two-dimensional map (self-organizing map). In this paper, we present the major components of the Cancer Spider system and a user evaluation study designed to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. Initial results comparing Cancer Spider with NLM Gateway, a premium medical search site, have shown that they achieved comparable performances measured by precision, recall, and F-measure. Cancer Spider required less user searching time, fewer documents that need to be browsed, and less user effort.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of an observational study of industrial logic designers at Lamb Technion. The purpose of this study was to determine the current methods of logic design used in industry. These observations can be used to evaluate recent academic proposals of methods for generating controllers for machines, as well as suggesting new methods.By observing the logic designers it was determined that designing logic for machining systems is substantially different than writing computer code, both in the specification and in the people who will design and use the system. In addition, recent academic developments in Discrete Event Systems are difficult to apply to the problems of industrial logic control. Even methods which researchers design specifically for industrial logic design are difficult to apply, both due to the lack of support for the methods, and the unsuitability of the methods to solve problems in this domain.The primary observations of this study are the following. • The observed Logic designers need to at least: determine acceptable machine behavior, foresee potential error conditions, predict user behavior, and design the logic needed for a machine. This is a greater range of responsibilities than expected. • Logic for one machine is generally copied directly from a previous project. However, copying logic generally involves manually retyping everything due to incompatibilities in the development environments. • Customers continue to ask for more features, and it is unlikely that this trend will stop. Some of these features are extremely difficult to implement using existing methods. Such features include: detailed part tracking, more sophisticated user interfaces, and greater diagnostic ability.},

Ontologies describing customers, products, typical shopping tasks and the external context form the basis for the Alice architecture. We also build upon two novel interface metaphors originally developed for navigating databases: the Guides metaphor and Dynamic Queries. The Guides metaphor was developed at Apple to reduce the cognitive load on learners navigating a large hypermedia database. Within Alice we use the Guides metaphor to allow online shoppers to interact with the system in a variety of ways. In effect, by choosing these options they are classifying themselves for the purpose of customizing system responses. We discuss the link between Alice Guides and Kozinets' notion of e-tribes or Virtual Communities of Consumption. Our second interface metaphor Dynamic Queries (coupled with Starfield displays) allows users to very quickly find relevant items by displaying the results of queries, posed via specialized slider widgets, within 100 ms, We have constructed a tool, Quiver, which constructs Dynamic Query interfaces on-the-fly as the result of queries to knowledge models stored on the Alice server.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that a computer tool can change the way children approach the task of writing and improve their writing performance. HARRY, a web-based computer tutor, provides a Vygotskian-like scaffolding of the knowledge transforming mature writing process and presents it to children individually in a conference situation. The effects of the computer tutor are analysed by comparing stories produced by three children of varied writing ability, who wrote a control and a HARRY-assisted story, and by observing the children as they wrote. A control group also wrote two stories without receiving assistance for either story. The study's hypothesis was confirmed. With HARRY's assistance, the children wrote better stories and employed the revision process characteristic of mature writers. Vygotsky's work suggests that children will learn to adopt the mature approach from repeated use of the system and that the scaffolding should be reduced gradually. However, as the system relied upon the children's willingness to first request, then act upon the available guidance, the system would benefit from further development to ensure children interact sufficiently with HARRY.},

abstract = {The future of human-computer interfaces may include systems which are human-like in abilities and behavior. One particularly interesting aspect of human-to-human communication is the ability of some conversation partners to sensitively pick up on the nuances of the other's utterances, as they shift from moment to moment, and to use this information to subtly adjust responses to express interest, supportiveness, sympathy and the like. This paper reports a model of this ability in the context of a spoken dialog system for a tutoring-like interaction. The system used information about the user's internal state--such as feelings of confidence, confusion, pleasure and dependency--as inferred from the prosody of his utterances and the context, and used this information to select the most appropriate acknowledgement form at each moment. Although straight-forward rating reveals no significant preference for a system with this ability, a clear preference was found when users rated the system after listening to a recording of their interaction with it. This suggests that human-like, real-time sensitivity can be of value in interfaces. The paper further discusses ways to discover and quantify such rules of social interaction, using corpus-based analysis, developer intuitions and feedback from naive judges; and further suggests that the technique of "evaluation after re-listening" is useful for evaluating spoken dialog systems which operate at near-human levels of performance.},

abstract = {Data visualization has the potential to assist humans in analysing and comprehending large volumes of data, and to detect patterns, clusters and outliers that are not obvious using nongraphical forms of presentation. For this reason, data visualizations have an important role to play in a diverse range of applied problems, including data exploration and mining, information retrieval, and intelligence analysis. Unfortunately, while various different approaches are available for data visualization, there have been few rigorous evaluations of their effectiveness. This paper presents the results of three controlled experiments comparing the ability of four different visualization approaches to help people answer meaningful questions for binary data sets. Two of these visualizations, Chernoff faces and star glyphs, represent objects using simple icon-like displays. The other two visualizations use a spatial arrangement of the objects, based on a model of human mental representation, where more similar objects are placed nearer each other. One of these spatial displays uses a common features model of similarity, while the other uses a distinctive features model. The first experiment finds that both glyph visualizations lead to slow, inaccurate answers being given with low confidence, while the faster and more confident answers for spatial visualizations are only accurate when the common features similarity model is used. The second experiment, which considers only the spatial visualizations, supports this finding, with the common features approach again producing more accurate answers. The third experiment measures human performance using the raw data in tabular form, and so allows the usefulness of visualizations in facilitating human performance to be assessed. This experiment confirms that people are faster, more confident and more accurate when an appropriate visualization of the data is made available.},

Determining the psychometric properties of key constructs such as disorientation, ease of use and flow is of paramount importance in establishing the quality of users' interactions with web sites. The current study used techniques of experimental research and on-line surveys to investigate the psychometric properties of existing instruments for measuring these constructs using two response formats: visual analogue scale and Likert scale. A 2 \texttimes{} 2 design with response format and orientation support as independent variables was used. Ninety participants carried out an information retrieval task using an experimental on-line shopping site before completing the scales. Factor analysis confirmed the existence of three distinct scales that possessed high reliability. Evidence for validity, and to a lesser extent, sensitivity, was found. Although psychometric results generally converged, some differences between the two response formats were found. A framework for the comprehensive investigation of response formats of on-line questionnaires is proposed as a basis for future research. Practical implications for the on-line measurement of the quality of users' interactions with web-based systems are discussed.},

Dependent measures included outcome quality, time-to-decision, consensus of pattern recognition, and the number of resource allocation moves required to reach consensus. All groups received significant financial rewards in direct proportion to their outcome quality. Groups supported with the patternsharing tool had significantly higher outcome quality and significantly less resource movements.

We found that three primary dimensions explain the variation in perceptions of home pages. These are the layout of the page, its navigation support, and its information density. Over the years, variation in navigation support declined and variation in information density increased. We discovered that four types of state government home page have existed continuously from 1997 to 2001. These are the 'Long List of Text Links', the 'Simple Rectangle', the 'Short L', and the 'High Density/Long L'. To this taxonomy, two other page types can be added: the 'Portal' page and the 'Boxes' page. The taxonomy we have identified allows for a better understanding of the design of US state home pages, and may generalize to other categories of home pages.},

abstract = {Flow theory has been applied to computer-mediated environments to study positive user experiences such as increased exploratory behavior, communication, learning, positive affect, and computer use. However, a review of the existing flow studies in computer-mediated environments in Psychology, Consumer Behavior, Communications, Human-Computer Interaction, and Management Information Systems shows ambiguities in the conceptualization of flow constructs and inconsistency in the flow models. It thus raises the question of whether the direct adoption of traditional flow theory is appropriate without a careful reconceptualization to consider the uniqueness of the computer-mediated environments. This paper focuses on flow antecedents and identifies the importance of separating the task from the artefact within a computer-mediated environment. It proposes a component-based model that consists of person (P), artefact (A), and task (T), as well as the interactions of these components. The model, named the PAT model, is developed by understanding the original flow theory, reviewing existing empirical flow studies within computer-mediated environments, and analysing the characteristics of computer-mediated environments. A set of propositions is constructed to demonstrate the predictive power of the model.},

This paper discusses issues and approaches for integrating HCI topics into masters level MIS/EC programs. Research on HCI topics related to MIS provides a theoretical foundation for student learning. By bridging research with these curricula, researchers are challenged to examine how HCI approaches can improve user acceptance of new systems. A case study illustrates how HCI topics can be taught as a stand-alone course or incorporated in existing MIS/EC courses. Drawing from the case study, the paper also addresses pedagogical challenges regarding student skill sets, learning outcomes, innovative pedagogies, tools and technology, and HCI issues for advanced IS/EC topics.},

With the expansion of Internet access we are now witnessing an expansion of the use of information technology in the form of electronic commerce. This current study tests the applicability of one prominent information technology uptake model, the Technology Acceptance Model (Int. J. Man Mach. Stud. 38 (1993) 475), within an electronic commerce setting. Specifically, the relationship between the perceived ease of use, usefulness and three electronically recorded indicators of use were assessed within the context of an electronic supermarket. A total of 247 participants completed the attitudinal measures. Electronically recorded indicators of use in the form of deliveries, purchase value and number of log-ons to the system were also recorded for the month the participants completed the questionnaire and 6 further months. Results indicated that the Technology Acceptance Model could be successfully applied to an electronic supermarket setting, providing empirical support for the ability of the Technology Acceptance Model to predict actual behaviour. The Technology Acceptance Model explained up to 15% of the variance in the behavioural indicators through perceived ease of use and usefulness of the system. However, the perceived ease of use of the system did not uniquely contribute to the prediction of behaviour when usefulnes's was considered, indicating a mediation effect. Future research should now focus on product and service attributes to more fully explain the use of electronic commerce services.},

Ethnographic accounts of their experiences with the Internet were also obtained. Findings indicate that attitudes about privacy and reliability of information on the Internet predict Internet use, but not as expected. Participants who believed less in privacy and reliability of information used the Internet more, even after the contributions of demographic characteristics (race and age), pre-trial experience using the Internet, and actual Internet use during the preceding time period were considered.

Task performance on the two tasks did not to correlate (p &gt; 0.05), indicating that the visual search task may lack external validity. Results of the interactive search task suggest that the design convention of blue links (Nielsen, 1999a) should be retained as responses for blue were found to be significantly quicker than red, F(1, 117) = 14.526, p &lt; 0.001, MScolour = 89.866.

In turn this provides a foundational structure for positioning the special issue and sets up the papers to provide readers with a broad exposure to the potential (and hazards) involved with affective computing as it impacts cognate areas of emphasis. Finally, the hope is put forth that affective computing must be developed as a user-centered technology to be of value for unexplored frontiers of the digital global economy.},

abstract = {Accounting for a patient's emotional state is integral in medical care. Tele-health research attests to the challenge clinicians must overcome in assessing patient emotional state when modalities are limited (J. Adv. Nurs. 36(5) 668). The extra effort involved in addressing this challenge requires attention, skill, and time. Large caseloads may not afford tele-home health-care (tele-HHC) clinicians the time and focus necessary to accurately assess emotional states and trends. Unstructured interviews with experienced tele-HHC providers support the introduction of objective indicators of patients' emotional status in a useful form to enhance patient care. We discuss our contribution to addressing this challenge, which involves building user models not only of the physical characteristics of users--in our case patients--but also models of their emotions. We explain our research in progress on Affective Computing for tele-HHC applications, which includes: developing a system architecture for monitoring and responding to human multimodal affect and emotions via multimedia and empathetic avatars; mapping of physiological signals to emotions and synthesizing the patient's affective information for the health-care provider. Our results using a wireless non-invasive wearable computer to collect physiological signals and mapping these to emotional states show the feasibility of our approach, for which we lastly discuss the future research issues that we have identified.},

abstract = {Models of affective behavior are critical for the development of training systems that are designed to exercise social interactions. Potential applications include various security-oriented operations such as police interrogation, airport security, border crossings, and military peacekeeping. Aside from speech, humans also communicate through vocalizations and inflections, as well as with body language. Such nonverbal communication can convey affect such as anger or nervousness that is important in identifying deception. In this research, a trainee is asked to perform checkpoint duty and question drivers of vehicles about their identity and reasons for entering a secured area. Most of the encounters are routine and innocuous, but occasionally a scenario unfolds that requires additional interrogation and rapid decision-making the part of the trainee. These special scenarios require the individual to draw upon his/her knowledge of social interactions in order to make the proper decisions and act appropriately. Virtual environments that address this form of training are few. Accordingly, the present paper describes an ongoing program of research designed to generate affective states for intelligent agents, create affective component behaviors to convey cues for anger, nervousness, and deception, and provide a complex interrogative training environment to exercise judgment-based decision-making.},

The gestures are interpreted according to a scheme found through two different user studies: one Wizard of Oz study and one study with a fully functioning SenToy. Different gestures express one of the following emotions: anger, fear, surprise, sadness, gloating and happiness. Depending upon the expressed emotion, the synthetic character in the game will, in turn, perform different actions (trading, duelling, etc.). The evaluation of SenToy acting as the interface to the computer game Fantasy A has shown that the users were able to express the desired emotions to influence the synthetic characters, and that overall players liked the doll as an interface.},

abstract = {This paper describes the results of a research project aimed at implementing a 'realistic' 3D Embodied Agent that can be animated in real-time and is 'believable and expressive': that is, able to coherently communicate complex information through the combination and the tight synchronisation of verbal and nonverbal signals. We describe, in particular, how we 'animate' this Agent (that we called Greta) so as to enable her to manifest the affective states that are dynamically activated and de-activated in her mind during the dialog with the user. The system is made up of three tightly interrelated components: • A representation of the Agent Mind: this includes long and short-term affective components (personality and emotions) and simulates how emotions are triggered and decay over time according to the Agent's personality and to the context, and how several emotions may overlap. Dynamic belief networks with weighting of goals is the formalism we employ to this purpose. • A mark-up language to denote the communicative meanings that may be associated with dialog moves performed by the Agent. • A translation of the Agent's tagged move into a face expression, that combines appropriately the available channels (gaze direction, eyebrow shape, head direction and movement etc). The final output is a 3-D facial model that respects the MPEG-4 standard and uses MPEG- 4 Facial Animation Parameters to produce facial expressions. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the results obtained, with an example of dialog in the domain of 'Advice about eating disorders'. The paper concludes with an analysis of advantages of our cognitive model of emotion triggering and of the problems found in testing it. Although we did not yet complete a formal evaluation of our system, we briefly describe how we plan to assess the agent's believability in terms of consistency of its communicative behaviour.},

abstract = {Physiological indicators of arousal have long been known to be sensitive to mental events such as positive and negative emotion, changes in attention and changes in workload. It has therefore been suggested that human physiology might be of use in the evaluation of software usability. To this, there are two main approaches or paradigms: (i) comparisons of physiological readings across periods of time to indicate different arousal levels under different circumstances, and (ii) the detection of short-term (occurring in seconds) physiological changes in response to specific events. Both approaches involve methodological, analytical and interpretational difficulties. Also, the tight experimental controls usually adopted in psychophysiological experimentation can be at odds with the needs of applied usability testing. This paper reports initial investigations of these approaches and difficulties in the evaluation of software interfaces. From exploratory data, a preliminary model is proposed which combines the two paradigms for identifying significant HCI events. Explorations of the model within the context of a web-related task are then discussed. These explorations suggest techniques and procedures for applied usability testing, and the results point to ways in which physiological data may be informative about software usability. However, further investigations involving variations in task and procedure are required.},

We first evaluate the robot's expressive displays in isolation. Next, we evaluate the robot's overall emotive behavior (i.e. the coordination of the affective recognition system, the emotion and motivation systems, and the expression system) as it socially engages nave human subjects face-to-face.},

Thirty subjects' (15 females and 15 males) pupil responses were measured while listening to 10 negative and 10 positive highly arousing sounds (e.g. a baby crying and laughing), and 10 emotionally neutral sounds (e.g. regular office noise). The subjects also rated their subjective experiences related to the stimuli. The results showed that the pupil size was significantly larger during both emotionally negative and positive stimuli than during neutral stimuli. The results for the time period of 2s following the stimulus offset showed that pupil size was significantly larger after both negative and positive than neutral stimulation. These results suggest that the autonomic nervous system is sensitive to highly arousing emotional stimulation. The subjective ratings confirmed that the stimuli influenced the subjects' emotional experiences as expected. Further analyses showed that female subjects had significantly larger pupil responses than males only to neutral stimuli and only during the auditory stimulation. In sum, our results showed that systematically chosen stimuli significantly affected the subjects' physiological reactions and subjective experiences. It could be possible to use pupil size variation as a computer input signal, for example, in affective computing. Auditory emotion-related cues could also be utilized to modulate the user's emotional reactions.},

Also, we present the first large-scale data mining experiment about the automatic recognition of basic emotions in informal everyday short utterances. We focus on the speaker-dependent problem. We compare a large set of machine learning algorithms, ranging from neural networks, Support Vector Machines or decision trees, together with 200 features, using a large database of several thousands examples. We show that the difference of performance among learning schemes can be substantial, and that some features which were previously unexplored are of crucial importance. An optimal feature set is derived through the use of a genetic algorithm. Finally, we explain how this study can be applied to real world situations in which very few examples are available. Furthermore, we describe a game to play with a personal robot which facilitates teaching of examples of emotional utterances in a natural and rather unconstrained manner.},

During the last four years a number of empirical studies have investigated the role of trust in the specific context of e-commerce, focusing on different aspects of this multi-dimensional construct. However, empirical research in this area is beset by conflicting conceptualizations of the trust construct, inadequate understanding of the relationships between trust, its antecedents and consequents, and the frequent use of trust scales that are neither theoretically derived nor rigorously validated. The major objective of this paper is to provide an integrative review of the empirical literature on trust in e-commerce in order to allow cumulative analysis of results. The interpretation and comparison of different empirical studies on on-line trust first requires conceptual clarification. A set of trust constructs is proposed that reflects, both institutional phenomena (system trust) and personal and interpersonal forms of trust (dispositional trust, trusting beliefs, trusting intentions and trust-related behaviours), thus facilitating a multi-level and multi-dimensional analysis of research problems related to trust in e-commerce.},

The most popular experimental paradigm currently employed by HCI researchers are social dilemma games based on the Prisoner's Dilemma (PD), a technique originating from economics. HCI researchers employing this experimental paradigm currently interpret the rate of cooperation--measured in the form of collective pay-off--as the level of trust the technology allows its users to develop. We argue that this interpretation is problematic, since the game's synchronous nature models only very specific trust situations. Furthermore, experiments that are based on PD games cannot model the complexity of how trust is formed in the real world, since they neglect factors such as ability and benevolence. In conclusion, we recommend (a) means of improving social dilemma experiments by using asynchronous Trust Games, (b) collecting a broader range of data (in particular qualitative) and (c) increased use of longitudinal studies.},

We then turn to an examination of the causes of on-line trust. Relevant findings in the human-computer interaction literature are identified.

abstract = {The concept of trust is believed by some to compensate for feelings of uncertainty. Therefore, trust is considered to be crucial in people's decision to rely on a complex automated system to perform tasks for them. This experiment aimed to study the effects of errors on control allocation, and the mediating role of trust and self-confidence in the domain of route planning. Using a computer-based route planner, participants completed 10 route-planning trials in manual mode, and 10 in automatic mode, allowing participants to become equally experienced in operating both modes. During these so-called fixed trials, the numbers of errors in automatic as well as manual mode were systematically varied. Subsequently, participants completed six free trials, during which they were free to choose between modes. Our results showed that high automation error rates (AERs) decreased levels of system trust compared to low AERs. Conversely, high manual error rates (MERs) resulted in lower levels of self-confidence compared to low MERs, although to a lesser extent. Moreover, the difference between measures of trust and self-confidence proved to be highly predictive of the number of times automatic mode was selected during the six free trials. Additionally, results suggest a fundamental bias to trust one's own abilities over those of the system. Finally, evidence indicating a relationship between trust and self-confidence is discussed.},

abstract = {A recent and dramatic increase in the use of automation has not yielded comparable improvements in performance. Researchers have found human operators often underutilize (disuse) and overly rely on (misuse) automated aids (Parasuraman and Riley, 1997). Three studies were performed with Cameron University students to explore the relationship among automation reliability, trust, and reliance. With the assistance of an automated decision aid, participants viewed slides of Fort Sill terrain and indicated the presence or absence of a camouflaged soldier. Results from the three studies indicate that trust is an important factor in understanding automation reliance decisions. Participants initially considered the automated decision aid trustworthy and reliable. After observing the automated aid make errors, participants distrusted even reliable aids, unless an explanation was provided regarding why the aid might err. Knowing why the aid might err increased trust in the decision aid and increased automation reliance, even when the trust was unwarranted. Our studies suggest a need for future research focused on understanding automation use, examining individual differences in automation reliance, and developing valid and reliable self-report measures of trust in automation.},

This paper will explain why one city has chosen to take an entrepreneurial approach to networking and the other city has chosen a more collaborative approach, promoting equal access for its citizens. Based on interviews, focus groups, and surveys in the two cities, we find that these divergent approaches are related to fundamental cultural differences in the two communities. One city seems to have a more pronounced reservoir of social capital, meaning that people in this community tend to be more trusting, have more cohesive social ties and are prone toward collaboration. Cooperation and social trust, particularly among community leaders, seem to have played large roles in triggering the development of a community electronic network. Moreover, we discover that political engagement and interpersonal trust among the citizenry in this city seem to be pivotal in sustaining and perpetuating the community endeavor.},

abstract = {Information technology continues to evolve rapidly. We see this particularly in the evolution of embedded intelligent systems--knowledge-based systems deployed in larger hosts with real-time response requirements, which provide real-time advice, guidance, information, recommendations and explanations to their users. These systems have recently been deployed in safety-critical large-scale systems, where humans and technology are jointly responsible for executing tasks, monitoring operations, and providing system safety. Thus, human interaction with intelligent technology in safety-critical systems has important implications. Those interactions can enhance or reduce system efficiency, enhance or compromise safety, and augment or negate the other benefits that technology provides. In this paper, we focus on interactions between human operators and embedded intelligent systems. We first consider the role of technology in safety-critical systems, and discuss studies of the impact of technology on human operators in such systems. We then describe embedded intelligent systems, and studies of their impacts on human operators. To illustrate these points, we consider the case of embedded intelligent technology introduction in one such setting, and the results of an empirical investigation of the impact of the technology on human performance in that system. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of the study and of the importance of understanding the impact of embedded intelligent technology on human operators in safetycritical systems.},

abstract = {Notification systems attempt to deliver current, important information to the computer screen in an efficient and effective manner. All notification systems require that the user attends to them to at least some degree if they are to succeed. Examples of notification systems include instant messaging systems, system and user status updates, email alerts and news and stock tickers. The benefits of notification systems are numerous, including rapid availability of important information, access to nearly instantaneous communication and heightened awareness of the availability of personal contacts. While the popularity of these systems has skyrocketed in recent years, the effects of incoming notifications on ongoing computing tasks have been relatively unexplored. The investigation of the costs, benefits and the optimal display of instant messages and all notifications in the context of desktop or mobile computing tasks falls in the general arena of psychological research on alerting and disruptions, but also requires research contributions from design, computer science and information visualization. To date, much of the psychological research on interruption leverages theoretical task constructions. In this special issue, we focus on the nature of interruptions such as messaging while computing and how to optimize the user experience.},

Based on memory theory, we propose that resumption of a task after interruption is facilitated by preparation during the interruption lag, or the interval between an alert to a pending interruption (e.g. the phone ringing) and the interruption proper (the ensuing conversation). To test this proposal, we conducted an experiment in which participants in a Warning condition received an 8-s interruption lag, and participants in an Immediate condition received no interruption lag. Participants in the Warning condition prepared more than participants in the Immediate condition, as measured by verbal reports, and resumed the interrupted task more quickly. However, Immediate participants resumed faster with practice, suggesting that people adapt to particularly disruptive forms of interruption. The results support our task analysis of interruption and our model of memory for goals, and suggest further means for studying operator performance in dynamic task environments.},

abstract = {Designing and evaluating notification systems represents an emerging challenge in the study of human-computer interaction. Users rely on notification systems to present potentially interruptive information in an efficient and effective manner to enable appropriate reaction and comprehension. Little is known about the effects of these systems on ongoing computer tasks. As the research community strives to understand information design suitable for opposing usage goals, few existing efforts lend themselves to extensibility.However, three often conflicting design objectives are interruption to primary tasks, reaction to specific notifications, and comprehension of information over time. Based on these competing parameters, we propose a unifying research theme for the field that defines success in notification systems design as achieving the desirable balance between attention and utility. This paradigm distinguishes notification systems research from traditional HCI by centering on the limitations of the human attention system.In a series of experiments that demonstrate this research approach and investigate use of animated text in secondary displays, we describe two empirical investigations focused on the three critical parameters during a browsing task. The first experiment compares tickering, blasting, and fading text, finding that tickering text is best for supporting deeper comprehension, fading best facilitates reaction, and, compared to the control condition, none of the animated displays are interruptive to the browsing task. The second experiment investigates fading and tickering animation in greater detail with similar tasks--at two different speeds and sizes. Here, we found smaller displays allowed better reaction but were more interruptive, while slower displays provides increased comprehension. Overall, the slow fade appears to be the best secondary display animation type tested. Focusing research and user studies within this field on critical parameters such as interruption, reaction, and comprehension will increase cohesion among design and evaluation efforts for notification systems.},

Our initial studies show that icons with simple motions, termed moticons, are effective coding techniques for notification and in fact are often better detected and identified than colour and shape codes, especially in the periphery. A subsequent experiment compared the detection and distraction effects of different motion types in several task conditions. Our resutts reveal how different attributes of motion contribute to detection, identification and distraction and provide initial guidelines on how motion codes can be designed to support awareness in information-rich interfaces while minimizing unwanted side effects of distraction and irritation.},

abstract = {Human performance in Chinese character handwriting recognizers is critical to the satisfaction and acceptance of their users. Based on Teal's [CHI'92 (1992) p. 295] interactive model, a static model describing the independent factors in determining the task completion time was set up with a simple mathematical inference; in addition, a dynamic model describing these factors' direct and indirect causal relationship was established by the path analytic method. Results in Experiment 1 indicated that both the static model and the dynamic model could fit observed task completion time satisfactorily with minor modifications. In addition, with users' average writing time around 1500 ms for each frequently used character, it was found that the user's performance was impaired significantly when segmentation time was longer than 1040 ms. An integrated model was devised after combining the static and dynamic models. Experiment 2 testified the integrated model in another handwriting recognizer and found that it could still fit human performance data with users in three different training conditions. Implications of the integrated model are that: (1) when recognition accuracy and number of inputting characters are constant, the weights of average writing time for each character, segmentation time, recognition time in determining task completion time are equal but bigger than the weight of the repairing time; (2) when the repairing time, average writing time for each character, segmentation time and recognition time are constant, there is an inverse model between task completion time and recognition accuracy; when recognition accuracy is from 50% to 93%, every 1% increase of recognition accuracy will reduce task completion time from 1989 to 1915 ms; when recognition accuracy increases from 94% to 100%, every 1% increase of recognition accuracy will reduce task completion time from 1895 to 1392 ms. Guidelines in designing these recognizers were given based on these implications.},

VE designers must enhance presence, immersion, and system comfort, while minimizing sickness and deleterious after effects. Through the development of a multi-criteria assessment technique, the current effort categorizes and integrates these VE attributes into a systematic approach to designing and evaluating VE usability. Validation exercises suggest this technique, the Multicriteria Assessment of Usability for Virtual Environments (MAUVE) system, provides a structured approach for achieving usability in VE system design and evaluation.

abstract = {The Domain Name System (DNS) is a special kind of distributed directory service for people to create and access the network information systems by (1) allowing local control of its segments and (2) making each segment's data available on the Internet using a client-server scheme. However, few administrators have the expertise to do the jobs well since this distributed mechanism is a double-edged sword; it allows DNS not only to scale to Internet size but also allows for incredible mis-configurations. The presented study is an analysis of what problems and difficulties most DNS administrators might encounter and provides the insights into how various DNS assistant sub-systems could be designed and deployed to solve the complex problems or alleviate these DNS administration job loadings. Ontologies become an important mechanism to build information systems. The role of ontologies is to capture domain knowledge and provide a commonly agreed upon understanding of a domain. The advantages include the sharing and re-use of knowledge, and the better engineering of knowledge-based systems with respect to acquisition, verification and maintenance. In this paper, we propose a unifying framework (e.g. including configuration, outstanding traffic monitoring and analysis, planning and management, tutoring, etc.) for supporting intelligent DNS management using web interface and expert system technology to help inexperienced administrators in insuring the smooth operation of their DNS systems. To help extract knowledge, we propose an efficient DNS Ontology Construction Algorithm to fast conceptualize DNS domain knowledge through a hybrid method of brainstorming and use cases modeling. While some sub-systems are still under development, others have been prototyped and deployed for everyday use. As our experience with a first simple prototype has shown, the paradigm of using DNS ontology to build a unifying framework for intelligent DNS management works good and effective. It is supposed that all these might become an integral part of the DNS administration activities of an organization in the near future.},

This capability has been investigated in contexts such as intelligent interface designs and operation support systems. While some progress has been demonstrated, efforts to date have focused on a single operator. In large and complex artefacts such as power plants or aircrafts, however, a team generally operates the system, and team intention is not reducible to mere summation of individual intentions. It is therefore necessary to develop a team intention inference method for sophisticated team-machine communication. In this paper a method is proposed for team intention inference in process domains. The method uses expectations of the other members as clues to infer a team intention and describes it as a set of individual intentions and beliefs of the other team members. We applied it to the operation of a plant simulator operated by a two-person team, and it was shown that, at least in this context, the method is effective for team intention inference.},

This research investigates the effects of interactivity level on Web user's attitude towards commercial Web sites. It extends existing Web interface design and usability literature by empirically examining the critical roles of interactivity. Three Web sites with different levels of interactivity were compared in a controlled laboratory experiment. Three eighteen-person groups completed each treatment. The independent variable is the incremental levels of interactivity. The dependent variables are satisfaction, effectiveness, efficiency, value, and attitude towards the Web site. Results suggest that increased level of interactivity on a Web site have positive effects on user's perceived satisfaction, effectiveness, efficiency, value, and overall attitude towards a Web site. Implications for Web site designers and researchers are discussed.},

We hypothesized that hierarchical representations, but not network representations, may help low prior knowledge students organize their representation of the text contents. Forty-seven students with low or high prior knowledge in Social Psychology were asked to read a hypertext using one of three content representations: a hierarchical map, a network map and an alphabetic list. Then, the participants performed a multiple choice comprehension task, a summary task and a concept map drawing task. The hierarchical map improved comprehension for the low knowledge participants at the global, but not at the local level. There was no effect of content representation on the comprehension of high prior knowledge students. We discuss the implications of these results for a theory of the comprehension processes involved in reading hypertext.},

abstract = {College and university environments offer one of the best opportunities for the adoption of smart card technology. This study explores the possibility of developing smart card as a university application and investigates whether it will help to reduce the university business administration procedures as well as increase their service efficiency. This involved investigating the response of two groups (experienced and non-experienced) towards the adoption or the intention to embrace the technology of a university smart card. Studying the experiences gained by Nanyang Technological University (NTU, Singapore) students using smart card application in their university may provide an insightful picture for a university that is considering adopting such a technological innovation.Results show that compatibility pre-adoption construct is the key element that plays the most influential factor in motivating local students for adoption. This suggests that to ensure adoption, it is important to guarantee that the university smart cards are socially acceptable among the university students (fit well with the students' norm and environment). Another implication of this study is that Murdoch University (MU, Australia) students would most probably be willing to accept the adoption of a university smart card given that the results show MU students' response of (probability= 168/200) and NTU students' response of 100% (probability= 50/50) acceptance toward using their university smart card. The results also show a significant culture difference between MU students and NTU students, indicating that smart card manufacturer should take note of the ranking of user preference when designing a university smart card in order to optimize the adoption process.},

There are three basic mechanisms to integrate diverse applications: data interchange, application program interfaces (API), and shared repositories. Standards and standardization efforts play important roles in all three areas. XML is a standard for defining data interchange standards. Web services are a set of standards for calling remote procedures over the Internet. UDDI and other e-business registries are examples of shared repositories. This paper discusses the XML and Web Services (including UDDI) standard-related technologies in the context of e-business systems. A technology adoption life cycle model is adapted to analyse various stages of standards adoption. Organizations that tend to adopt e-business standards in each stage are identified. Based on our study of e-business standards and research of relevant literatures, several factors that affect the adoption decision of e-business standards are identified. The implications of these factors are discussed. Two case studies of the implementation of e-business standards are presented. Further studies of how standards may affect the success of e-business strategies and how companies should evaluate and implement e-business standards are proposed.},

Additionally, it provided a platform for what might be termed a spirited, enduring, and enlightening--albeit occasionally frustrating-- rounds of debate on a broad range of questions. Turing, who proved to be much ahead of his time in more ways than one, predicted that it would be possible to develop machines capable of passing the TT in about 50 years time, that is just about now. Perhaps, Turing overestimated the rate of progress of technology, or of transformation of deeply entrenched paradigms of thought; but whatever the reason, his prediction about the feasibility of "thinking machines" is yet to come true in an engineering or in a symbolic-semantic sense. This paper presents a set of reflections on this and other predictions made by Turing and relates them to what has actually transpired in the 50 years since his original paper was published. Contributions of TT to the field of AI are assessed and directions for the future are presented.},

abstract = {Scenarios have gained acceptance in both research and practice as a way of grounding software-engineering projects in the users' work. However, the research on scenario-based design (SBD) includes very few studies of how scenarios are actually used by practising software engineers in real-world projects. Such studies are needed to evaluate current SBD approaches and advance our general understanding of what scenarios contribute to design. This longitudinal field study analyses the use of scenarios during the conceptual design of a large information system. The role of the scenarios is compared and contrasted with that of three other design artefacts: the requirements specification, the business model, and the user interface prototype. The distinguishing features of the scenarios were that they were task based and descriptive. By being task based the scenarios strung individual events and activities together m purposeful sequences and, thereby, provided an intermediate level of description that was both an instantiation of overall work objectives and a fairly persistent context for the gradual elaboration of subtasks. By being descriptive the scenarios preserved a real-world feel of the contents, flow, and dynamics of the users' work. The scenarios made the users' work recognizable to the software engineers as a complex but organized human activity. This way the scenarios attained a unifying role as mediator among both the design artefacts and the software engineers, whilst they were not used for communication with users. The scenarios were, however, discontinued before the completion of the conceptual design because their creation and management was dependent on a few software engineers who were also the driving forces of several other project activities. Finally, the software engineers valued the concreteness and coherence of the scenarios although that entailed a risk of missing some effective reconceptions of the users' work.},

Influencing complex system designs in ways cognizant of human-system integration principles requires work products that are timely and tightly coupled to other elements of the design process. Because analyses were conducted simultaneously with the design processes regarding ship functionality and staffing, it was necessary to select and adapt cognitive work analysis methods to fit the demands of a time pressured and information-limited design situation. Interviews were conducted and analyzed based on aspects of an abstraction hierarchy and control task models. An abstraction hierarchy, a series of cross-linked matrices, and a set of decision ladder models were developed to provide a principled mapping between system function decompositions produced by system engineering teams and cognitive tasks, information needs, automation requirements, and concepts for displays. Cross-referencing the matrices supported design traceability and facilitated the integration of cognitive analyses with functional analyses being performed by other design teams. Results fed into design recommendations with respect to level of automation, human roles and initial display prototypes for the ship combat command center. The case study illustrates the utility of cognitive work analysis models (specifically, abstraction hierarchies and decision-ladder models) in the design of large-scale, first-of-a-kind systems, and presents new design artifacts that link concepts used in cognitive analyses to those used in systems engineering for more effective integration within the systems engineering process.},

abstract = {The interactive visual simulation is the integration of real-time computer graphics with multimodalities, such as acoustic display and force feedback, to create a realistic simulation scenario to the user. This paper presents a method to design an interactive visual simulation on a cluster of desktop computers for the mobile crane training. This mobile crane training simulation is a project sponsored by Employment and Vocational Training Administration, Council of Labor Affair, Executive Yuan, Taiwan, to build a low-cost yet effective vehicle for training and licensing. To achieve this goal, a set of locally networked PCs is employed to form a parallel computing environment for the mobile crane simulation.The most important issue of developing a high-fidelity interactive visual simulator is its integration system for communication and monitoring among functional modules. This paper presents a peer-to-peer architecture on a cluster of PCs to develop the required integration system for the mobile crane simulator. In addition, the developed integration system uses the push-and-pull model to seamlessly communicate the messages among distributed functional modules. This push-and-pull model effectively achieves the parallelism among the distributed functional modules of a mobile crane simulator. With the push-and-pull model on the peer-to-peer architecture, we can easily achieve the modularity and reusability of the functional modules of the simulating system. The presented push-and-pull model satisfies four essential attributes for the parallel computing, which are concurrency, scalability, locality and modularity. Our experience also successfully verifies the effectiveness of the presented simulator with the system response rate of 16 times per second which is larger than human acceptable perception rate as suggested by the human factors studies.},

abstract = {We compare user navigation performance using two hypertext information sites of identical node structure but embedded in different metaphors. The first is based upon the layout of a house and is consistent with Euclidean space. The second represents social links between people for which a spatial metaphor is not apparent. Search for targets within the structures, and the speed of their subsequent retrieval on a second search, is compared in a 2 \texttimes{} 4 \texttimes{} 2 factorial design manipulating: metaphor (spatial or non-spatial); navigation, tools (participants have both a site map and bookmark tool, one of these, or no tools at all) and the time pressure under which navigation is carried out (paced or unpaced). A strong main effect is found in which the spatial metaphor produces higher performance under all conditions. Similarly, time pressure has the general effect of trading-off a faster initial search with less efficient retrieval later. However, navigation tool use is highly context dependent and sometimes counterintuitive: certain conditions show poorer performance with two navigation aids than one. We argue that navigation tools are mediating structures for activities, such as bookmarking and learning the structure of the site, which represent cognitive investment for future retrieval. In this view, user performance is optimized by the balance of two potentially antagonistic conditions. First, the usability of tools and metaphor must free cognitive resources for planning; but also, the difficulty of the task and the need for planning must remain visible to the user. The implications for design are discussed.},

Several researchers have proposed the use of multiple metaphors in the design of computer systems. This study set out to compare the effects of structural cues derived from single versus multiple metaphors used in designing hypertext systems. A total of 54 undergraduate students were asked to perform selected information search tasks. The results show that the provision of metaphorical cues helped subjects to find a greater number of accurate answers in a shorter period of time. The more complete mapping between the base and target domains in the design of the interface, along with cues from multiple metaphors, may have helped subjects to develop more sophisticated representations of the hypertext structure.},

abstract = {The next evolutionary step in wireless Internet information management is to provide support for tasks, which may be collaborative and may include multiple target devices, from desktop to handheld. This means that the information architecture supports the processes of the task, recognizes group interaction, and lets users migrate seamlessly among internet-compatible devices without losing the thread of the session. If users are free to migrate amongst devices during the course of a session then intelligent transformation of data is required to exploit the screen size and input characteristics of the target appliance with minimal loss of task effectiveness.In this paper we first review general characteristics related to the performance of users on small screens and then examine the navigation of full tables on small screens for users in multidevice scenarios. We examine the methodologies available for access to full tables in environments where the full table cannot be viewed in its entirety. In particular, we examine the situation where users are collaborating across platform and referring to the same table of data. We ask three basic questions: Does screen size affect the performance of table lookup tasks? Does a search function improve performance of table lookup based tasks on reduced screen sizes? Does including context information improve the performance of table lookup based tasks on reduced screen sizes? The answers to these questions are important as individual and intuitive responses are used by the designers of small screen interfaces for use with large tables of data. We report on the results of a user study that examines factors that may affect the use of large tables on small display devices. The use of large tables on small devices in their native state becomes important in at least two circumstances. First, when collaboration involves two or more users sharing a view of data when the individual screen sizes are different. Second, when the exact table structure replication may be critical as a user moves quickly from a larger to a smaller screen or back again mid-task. Performance is measured by both effectiveness, correctness of result, and efficiency, effort to reach a result.},

abstract = {Advances in technologies to create ever more sophisticated robots is outpacing our understanding of how such robots and humans successfully interact to accomplish specific tasks. In particular, it is now possible for humans to control the navigation of certain classes of robots via the Internet. Yet, we know little about how individual differences variables such as spatial ability and prior knowledge of the navigational space contribute to the success of human-robot interactions. Nor has there been much research on the kinds of interfaces that facilitate effective and efficient interaction, and whether these are differentially effective across the spectrum of spatial ability. In this study, an Internet control mechanism for an RWI B-14 mobile robot called "TourMate" was used to investigate the differences and similarities in how humans teleoperated the robot from two locations (intermediate and remote). Thirty-two participants who were assessed on spatial albility and prior knowledge of the space in which the robot was being controlled directed the robot in simple spatial navigation tasks. Time to comptete the task, number of steps, and errors were collected. Results indicated that spatial ability and location, but not prior knowledge, were reliable predictor of efficiency of robot teleoperation. Information was also obtained about the utility of various features of the interface and suggested that individual difference characteristics of robot operators are related to the utility of different interface features. Implications for design of human-robot interaction systems are discussed.},

abstract = {Most visual search studies have been restricted to alphanumeric stimulus materials. Research related to scanning patterns of Chinese characters is sparse. This study is an attempt to understand the differences and similarities in visual search of Chinese characters having a varying degree of complexity among Hong Kong Chinese, Mainland Chinese and Chinese reading non-Chinese people. Eighteen participants were tested on Chinese character screens with three layouts (row, column, and uniform separation) and two word complexities (high and low). The 18 participants comprised six Hong Kong Chinese, six Mainland Chinese and six non-native Chinese readers. Performance data and eye movement data were recorded. The percent correct and search time were the two performance measures. A new measure, called HV-ratio was developed to characterize eye movements. The results show that Hong Kong Chinese use predominantly horizontal search patterns while the Mainland Chinese change their search pattern depending on the layout presented. Non-native Chinese readers, on the other hand, do not seem to show any preference on scanning strategy for a given layout. Word complexity did not show any significant effect on search time. Potential reasons for these differences and design implications are discussed.},

abstract = {The goal of our ARKTOS project is to build an intelligent knowledge-based system to classify satellite sea ice images. It involves acquiring knowledge from sea ice experts, quantifying such knowledge as computational entities and ultimately building an intelligent classifier. In this paper we describe a two-stage knowledge engineering approach that facilitates explicit knowledge transfer, converting implicit visual cues and cognition of the experts to explicit attributes and rules implemented by the engineers. First, there is a prototyping stage that involves interviewing sea ice experts, transcribing the sessions, identifying descriptors and rules, designing and implementing the knowledge and delivering the prototype. The objective of this stage is to obtain a modestly accurate classification system quickly. Second, there is a refinement stage that involves evaluating the prototype, refining the knowledge base, modifying the design and re-evaluating the improved system. Since the refinement is evaluation-driven, the experts and the engineers are motivated explicitly to improve the knowledge base and are able to communicate with each other using a common, consistent platform. Moreover, since the classification result is immediately available, both sides are able to efficiently assess the correctness of the system. To facilitate the knowledge engineering of the second stage, we have designed and built three Java-based graphical user interfaces: arktosGUI, arktosViewer and arktosEditor. arktosGUI concentrates on feature-based refinement of specific attributes and rules. arktosViewer deals with regional evaluation. arktosEditor has a rule indexing and search mechanism and knowledge base editing capabilities.},

Several common requirements emerged including the need for a sense of control of one's workspace, the ability to create privacy on-demand to improve concentration and minimize unwanted interruptions, as well as in-place support for dyadic interactions. Many other common workplace complaints (e.g. too hot, too cold, too noisy) were found to be derivative of the major requirements for individual control and privacy.},

This paper describes the evaluation of a "temporal" alternative to the normal "stack-based" behaviour of Back and Forward. The main difference of the temporal scheme is that it maintains a complete list of previously visited pages. The evaluation compares the efficiency of the stack and temporal schemes in an "out of the box" scenario in which participants were asked to use a "new" version of a commercial browser without any explanation of the presence or absence of new features. This scenario allows us to predict the likely usability impact if commercial browsers were released supporting the temporal scheme. The results showed that the relative efficiency of the two schemes differed across different types of navigational task. In particular, the temporal system poorly supported backtracking to parent pages, but performed better for more distant navigation tasks. The temporal scheme also caused extreme usage patterns, with the subjects either solving tasks very efficiently or very inefficiently, depending on whether they used the Back menu. This observation indicates that adaptations of the temporal system that improve the effectiveness of the Back menu may enhance web navigation.},

A referential communication task is described which involves exclusively graphical dialogue. In this task subjects communicate about pieces of music by drawing. The drawings produced fall into two basic types: Abstract and Figurative. Three hypotheses are developed about the factors influencing the use of these drawing types: efficiency of production, suitability for the task and level of communicative interaction. Experimental evidence is presented which indicates that the drawing types do not differ in the amount of effort required to produce them. The results indicate that (1) Abstract drawings are more effective than Figurative drawings for comparative tasks and (2) a key constraint on their use is level of direct communicative interaction. It is argued that these observations result from differences in the underlying semantic models of music associated with the drawing types and the consequences these differences have for communicative coordination.},

abstract = {This study investigates the evolution of the graphical representations used to specify information systems in a community of novice designers supported by a shared design memory, adopting the paradigm of distributed cognition. The nature of the relationship between design notations, quality of design and communication is explicated by considering the interplay of actors, representations, design task and an evolving social and cultural context. An account is provided of how meaningful representational features are transmitted and transformed across generations of designers, and combined in a design language that improves design quality and accommodates varied communication needs and interactional constraints. Diffusion and creation of novel representational features start from a process of critical imitation steered by criteria of instrumental utility set by the individual design teams to address both their needs, concerning level of understanding and desired expressiveness of the design, and the socially regulated expectations about what is required in a good design. These tendencies result in an organizational phenomenon according to which the language of the community evolves by incorporating more sophisticated representational modes, i.e. patterns of features that are used in a socially clever way, in particular to reduce the cognitive load involved in interpretation, and to sustain interaction with the instructor during the exam. It is argued that the cognitive fit between the general characteristics of design task and the expressive modalities allowed by the medium used for the design specifications, plus the individual differences between the novice designers are key factors in sustaining the evolution of the language.},

abstract = {Computer-based multimedia technologies allow designers to construct interactive and animated graphical presentations to communicate dynamic information. The conventional wisdom is that such presentations are more effective than printed materials. This paper presents research that critically examines this assumption. Design guidelines and principles were derived from a cognitive process model of multimodal comprehension. These guidelines and principles were used to create several expository presentations in two domains-the concrete domain of mechanical systems and the abstract domain of computer algorithms. A series of experiments evaluated the efficacy of these presentations and compared them with other kinds of presentations such as books, CD-ROMs and animations. The experiments also compared computer-based interactive graphical presentations and static printed presentations containing the same information. Experimental results suggest that the communicative efficacy of multimodal presentations is more related to their match with comprehension processes than with the interactivity and dynamism of the presentation media. The results support a model-based approach to the design of multimodal expository presentations of dynamic information. The comprehension model and corresponding design guidance should aid designers in building interactive graphical presentations that are more effective than intuitive designs in communicating dynamic content.},

The advantages of drawing over other forms of non-verbal communication for this population are detailed, followed by discussion of different approaches to communicative drawing with reference to descriptive reports, treatment studies and review papers. The two main approaches differ in their view of drawing either as an alternative to speech or as an augmentative tool in multimodal communication. In the former approach the focus is on drawing skill or quality. Successful transmission of messages is the goal, and this depends on the production of recognizable drawings. In contrast, in the latter approach quality of drawings is secondary to its value as an interactive medium. The focus is on interpersonal aspects of communication and drawing is used alongside other modalities as a medium of social connectedness. The main principles of interactive drawing are discussed with examples from recent therapy studies. These are: the importance of drawing "economically" rather than producing "good" drawings; the contribution of the communication partner in facilitating, developing and maintaining a shared interaction; and the importance of using interactive drawing within natural communication contexts, in particular conversation.},

abstract = {Graphics have been used since ancient times to portray things that are inherently spatiovisual, like maps and building plans. More recently, graphics have been used to portray things that are metaphorically spatiovisual, like graphs and organizational charts. The assumption is that graphics can facilitate comprehension, learning, memory, communication and inference. Assumptions aside, research on static graphics has shown that only carefully designed and appropriate graphics prove to be beneficial for conveying complex systems. Effective graphics conform to the Congruence Principle according to which the content and format of the graphic should correspond to the content and format of the concepts to be conveyed. From this, it follows that animated graphics should be effective in portraying change over time. Yet the research on the efficacy of animated over static graphics is not encouraging. In cases where animated graphics seem superior to static ones, scrutiny reveals lack of equivalence between animated and static graphics in content or procedures; the animated graphics convey more information or involve interactivity. Animations of events may be ineffective because animations violate the second principle of good graphics, the Apprehension Principle, according to which graphics should be accurately perceived and appropriately conceived. Animations are often too complex or too fast to be accurately perceived. Moreover, many continuous events are conceived of as sequences of discrete steps. Judicious use of interactivity may overcome both these disadvantages. Animations may be more effective than comparable static graphics in situations other than conveying complex systems, for example, for real time reorientations in time and space.},

Three system interface characteristics, three organizational context variables, and three individual differences are identified as critical external variables that have impact on adoption intention through perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of the digital library. Data was collected from 397 users of an award-winning digital library. The findings show that both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are determinants of user acceptance of digital libraries. In addition, interface characteristics and individual differences affect perceived ease of use, while organizational context influences both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of digital libraries.},

abstract = {Relations between mental and physical aspects of an agent can be of various types. Sensing and acting are among the more commonly modelled types. In agent modelling approaches often this is the only interaction between the physical and mental; other possible types of interactions are abstracted away. If it is also taken into account that the agent's mind has a materialization in the form of a brain, the relations between mind and matter may become more complex. An explanation of a dynamic pattern may involve mental aspects, physical aspects, and interactions between mental and physical aspects. An explanatory perspective sometimes advocated for such more complex phenomena is explanatory pluralism. According to this perspective an explanation can consist of parts of a different signature, for example, a partial physical explanation and a partial mentalistic explanation. Each of these partial explanations is insufficient to explain the whole phenomenon, but together they do explain the whole, if some interaction is assumed. How for such explanations the different types of interaction between mind and matter of an agent and the material world can be modelled in a conceptually and semantically sound manner, and how the overall explanation is composed from the parts, using these interactions, is the main topic of this paper. The generic model presented can be used to model, explain and simulate a variety of phenomena in which multiple mind-matter interactions occur, including, for example, sensing and acting, (planned) birth and death, bacterial behaviour, getting brain damage, psychosomatic diseases and applications of direct brain-computer interfaces.},

abstract = {Social navigation exploits the knowledge and experience of peer users of information resources. A wide variety of visual-spatial approaches become increasingly popular as a means to optimize information access as well as to foster and sustain a virtual community among geographically distributed users. An information landscape is among the most appealing design options of representing and communicating the essence of distributed information resources to users. A fundamental and challenging issue is how an information landscape can be designed such that it will not only preserve the essence of the underlying information structure, but also accommodate the diversity of individual users. The majority of research in social navigation has been focusing on how to extract useful information from what is in common between users' profiles, their interests and preferences. In this article, we explore the role of modelling sequential behaviour patterns of Users in augmenting social navigation in thematic landscapes. In particular, we compare and analyse the trails of individual users in thematic spaces along with their cognitive ability measures. We are interested in whether such trails can provide useful guidance for social navigation if they are embedded in a visual-spatial environment. Furthermore, we are interested in whether such information can help users to learn from each other, for example, from the ones who have been successful in retrieving documents. In this article, we first describe how users' trails in sessions of an experimental study of visual information retrieval can be characterized by Hidden Markov Models. Trails of users with the most successful retrieval performance are used to estimate parameters of such models. Optimal virtual trails generated from the models are visualized and animated as if they were actual trails of individual users in order to highlight behavioural patterns that may foster social navigation. The findings of the research will provide direct input to the design of social navigation systems as well as to enrich theories of social navigation in a wider context. These findings will lead to the further development and consolidation of a tightly coupled paradigm of spatial, semantic and social navigation.},

abstract = {The Italian Public Administration (PA) represents an important testbed for fulfilment of software usability in real settings. This is due to the volume of existing applications, the various types of ongoing projects and the potential users to whom the produced applications are addressed (both internal PA users and citizen-users). Most acquisitions of computer products in the PA are made in terms of ad hoc developments. This type of development could provide, in principle, the best condition for usability purposes, i.e. a constant contiguity between designers and users. Unfortunately, this does not lead to user-centred projects and usable products in reality.To analyse the current situation and propose improvements, the Italian authority which controls the software diffusion in PAs (Autorit\`{a} per l'Informatica nella Pubblica Amministrazione--AIPA) created a working group, the Usability Working Group-UWG. Among the various activities of the group, two tests carried out for the PA on two different development designs of interactive systems gave several hints. The UWG also produced the guidelines for setting up PA contracts including usability as a key requirement for the interactive systems to be supplied. This paper reports the tests, compares the results with the ISO 13407 (1999) standard, and outlines the main indications coming from the proposed guidelines. Finally, the outcome and influence of the UWG activities on the PA contracts is discussed.},

Loglinear models are used to model these transactions in terms of their time, origin and destination components and to detect the signature and stability of patterns of navigation through an Internet-based digital library. Through the use of metric multidimensional scaling, transaction patterns are then visualized and interpreted. The methods are applied to a 12-month time Series of transaction logs taken from the Alexandria Digital Library, a web-based digital library of maps and other cartographic materials. Among other things, results show that transaction patterns do not change significantly despite changes in the user interface and that user training has a significant impact on people's navigation of the library.},

This framework is based on a set of well-defined assumptions that guarantee the consistency of the ontology derived from the ontology integration process. Moreover, in the approach presented here, every (expert) user may consult the so-derived ontology constructed until a given moment in order to refine his or her private ontology. In addition to this, the model proposed in this work allows the experts involved in the construction of the ontology to use their own terminology when querying the global ontology obtained until a given instant from their own co-operative work. The validation of the framework is also included in this work.},

abstract = {The interest in ontology may peter out unless three problems are addressed: What are the boundaries of ontology? What types are there of ontology? What is the structure of ontology? After distinguishing three main kinds of information (ontological, quasi-ontological and non-ontological) and three types of ontologies (descriptive, formal and formalized), the paper presents a few basic ontological sub-theories (theory of particulars, of levels of reality, of wholes, parts and boundaries, and the intensive-extensive opposition for determinations). The methodology of domain analysis is further addressed and the distinction between a domain's structure and the scheme of the canonical item of a domain is introduced.},

abstract = {In this paper we use sensor-annotated abstraction hierarchies (Reising &amp; Sanderson, 1996, 2002a, b) to show that unless appropriately instrumented, configural displays designed according to the principles of ecological interface design (EID) might be vulnerable to misinterpretation when sensors become unreliable or are unavailable. Building on foundations established in Reising and Sanderson (2002a) we use a pasteurization process control example to show how sensor-annotated AHs help the analyst determine the impact of different instrumentation engineering policies on a configural display that is part of an ecological interface. Our analyses suggest that configural displays showing higher-order properties of a system are especially vulnerable under some conservative instrumentation configurations. However, sensor-annotated AHs can be used to indicate where corrective instrumentation might be placed. We argue that if EID is to be effectively employed in the design of displays for complex systems, then the information needs of the human operator need to be considered while instrumentation requirements are being formulated. Rasmussen's abstraction hierarchy--and particularly its extension to the analysis of information captured by sensors and derived from sensors--may therefore be a useful adjunct to upstream instrumentation design.},

abstract = {In this paper we establish a foundation for understanding the instrumentation needs of complex dynamic systems if ecological interface design (EID)-based interfaces are to be robust in the face of instrumentation failures. EID-based interfaces often include configural displays which reveal the higher-order properties of complex systems. However, concerns have been expressed that such displays might be misleading when instrumentation is unreliable or unavailable. Rasmussen's abstraction hierarchy (AH) formalism can be extended to include representations of sensors near the functions or properties about which they provide information, resulting in what we call a "sensor-annotated abstraction hierarchy". Sensor-annotated AHs help the analyst determine the impact of different instrumentation engineering policies on higher-order system information by showing how the data provided from individual sensors propagates within and across levels of abstraction in the AH. The use of sensor-annotated AHs with a configural display is illustrated with a simple water reservoir example. We argue that if EID is to be effectively employed in the design of interfaces for complex systems, then the information needs of the human operator need to be considered at the earliest stages of system development while instrumentation requirements are being formulated. In this way, Rasmussen's AH promotes a formative approach to instrumentation engineering.},

There is no published evidence that either these features or principles have been empirically tested for their suitability from the users' perspective. This paper reports on an empirical study which aimed to assess the usability of a set of on-line help features and principles, in the context of users performing real application tasks. The results reveal that the more general principles associated with understandability are considered the most relevant, and that while users may complain about the design of existing on-line help features, they tend to value them more than features with which they are unfamiliar. A follow-up study showed that only minor changes need to be made to the existing defacto standard for users' concerns to be addressed, without sacrificing the advantages of familiarity. The study addresses questions of context sensitivity, obtrusiveness and the importance of definitions, and highlights the usefulness of questioning emerging defacto standards that have not been based on empirical studies.},

abstract = {This paper presents the design and implementation of KJ3 (Knowledge Judgment, version 3) which is an assisting tool for formal validation of knowledge-based systems (KBSs). The KJ3 project is motivated by two main obstacles to knowledge validation, the lack of a uniform representation and a comprehensive validation procedure. KJ3 combines Petri Nets and theorem proving techniques to solve these difficulties. In KJ3, the Enhanced High-Level Petri Net (EHLPN) is employed as a meta representation scheme to describe different KBS formalisms in a uniform format. With EHLPN, there is only one type of problems, the reachability problems, to be solved for all validation tasks. The kernel of KJ3 is a hyper-linking-based theorem prover which serves as the inference engine for checking the correctness of the transformed reachability problems. Because of the versatility of EHLPN and the soundness and completeness of the hyper-linking proof procedure, KJ3 is a reliable and robust platform for formal validation. Users can apply KJ3 to validate different types of KBSs without concerning the inference process involved in the validation procedure. Other main features of KJ3 include a friendly user interface for describing and transforming KBSs and defining the validation tasks, a mechanism for explaining the validation results, and facilities for analysing the behaviour of KBSs and defining new types of KBSs and validation tasks.},

Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered from 540 students via a web-based survey. Partial support was found for the hypotheses.

abstract = {In this paper we present a machine-learning algorithm that computes a small set of accurate and interpretable rules. The decisions of these rules can be straight-forwardly explained as the conclusions drawn by a case-based reasoner. Our system is named F AN, an acronym for f inding a ccurate i n ductions. It starts from a collection of training examples and produces propositional rules able to classify unseen cases following a minimum-distance criterion in their evaluation procedure. In this way, we combine the advantages of instance-based algorithms and the conciseness of rule (or decision-tree) inducers. The algorithm followed by F AN can be seen as the result of successive steps of pruning heuristics. The main tool employed is that of the impurity level, a measure of the classification quality of a rule, inspired by a similar measure used in IB3. Finally, a number of experiments were conducted with standard benchmark datasets of the UCI repository to test the performance of our system, successfully comparing F AN with a wide collection of machine-learning algorithms.},

abstract = {The virtual team is an increasingly common strategic work unit of many organizations. The virtual team, via various computer-based media (e.g. email, groupware) and noncomputer-based media (e.g. telephone), can interact and collaborate though separated by distance and time. One approach to their study is determining whether factors that drive conventional team performance also exist in the virtual environment. Interaction style has been shown to have a great effect on conventional teams' ability to achieve solution quality and solution acceptance on collaborative decision tasks (Hirokawa, 1985; Watson &amp; Michaelsen 1988; Hirokawa &amp; Gouran, 1989; Cooke &amp; Szumal, 1994). Group interaction styles affect communication and thus team performance by facilitating or hindering the exchange of information among group members. These styles reflect an aggregation of behavioral traits of individual team members, rooted in their individual personalities. The interaction style of conventional teams can be reliably assessed, and from that assessment, performance on collaborative decision tasks can be predicted. This study investigated whether or not virtual teams who collaborate via computer-mediated communication also exhibit similar interaction styles, and whether the styles have the same effects on their decision performance and process outcomes as they do with conventional teams. Members of 42 virtual teams completed an intellective decision first individually and then collaboratively. Post-task measures captured individual and team performance data (e.g. solution quality) as well as process perceptions (individual acceptance of the team solution). An additional post-task tool was able to accurately capture the teams' interaction style. Results show that the interaction styles of virtual teams affect both performance and process outcomes in ways that are directionally consistent with those exhibited by conventional face-to-face teams. Implications include recommending the methodology for virtual team management, and suggestions for future research are offered.},

abstract = {This paper describes Adaptive Presentation Environment for Collaboration Knowledge Structuring (APECKS), an experimental tool for collaborative ontology construction. APECKS takes a different line to most ontology servers, in that it is designed for use by domain experts, possibly in the absence of a knowledge engineer, and its aim is to foster and support debate about domain ontologies. To that end, it does not enforce ideals of consistency or correctness, and instead allows different conceptualizations of a domain to coexist. The system architecture and life cycle are introduced, and three extensive scenarios are outlined, showing how APECKS supports ontology construction, learning, ontology comparison and discussion. APECKS has also been used by several subjects during an evaluation experiment, and the results of this experiment are described. A particular factor about APECKS is that, as well as providing internal KA support, it is designed to interface with web-accessible KA tools, thereby allowing theoretically unlimited KA support for users. The prototype used WebGrid-II as external KA support, and the issues involved in integrating APECKS and WebGrid are discussed in detail.},

abstract = {Clarity is a functional schematic programming language currently freely available to the community http://www.sis.port.ac.uk/research/clarity/index.html.. It is a programming environment that allows a user to draw a program as a set of directed graphs. The term schematic is drawn from the traditions of engineering where the diagrams that represent electronic circuits or those of physical objects are often referred to as schematic drawings. A schema is a set of pictures or graphs that represent a program or working model. A schematic is taken as a system of tokens and structuring rules that expresses a program, model or concept; it is a graphical language. This paper introduces the principles behind design and issues to be considered when dealing with complex systems. The reasons why a “functional” representation provides a non-invasive approach to design and forms the basis of “good” design are described. In particular, the advantages of using diagrams is shown to be because the schema constructions make the structure of complex systems explicit as well as make a functional representation more intelligible than its sentential equivalent.},

In particular, from a design viewpoint, it is necessary to be able to move from the extensive observational data that is often collected during a field study to information that is relevant for design. In this paper, we discuss the use of theories and models of human machine interaction to guide the analysis of information gathered during field studies, and illustrate the application of an artefact-based theory with the results from two different and independently conducted case studies. This approach was valuable in structuring information collected in flexible environments, in which models that rely on the normative procedures found in more causal environments may be less useful. In addition to shaping the interpretation of data from the two studies, the use of an artefact-based theory also proved useful in integrating results across the two field studies, to suggest more domain-independent design criteria.},

The KADS model we consider specifies the functional architecture of the knowledge-based system called SACHEM, designed for blast furnace control. The operationalizing process we propose allows the KADS model to be completed and validated. Upon execution of the operational model, the dynamics of the system can be simulated. Thus the proposed operationalizing process contributed to the validation and verification of the SACHEM conceptual model.},

abstract = {The physical context of architectural design includes large workspaces, typically drafting tables covered with piles of images and sketches. We are investigating if and how a large computerized workspace can be integrated usefully into such a design environment. To this end, we compared a large computerized desktop (digital desk) to a standard desktop computer and a small tablet environment for two typical architecture design tasks: sketching and image sorting. For the sketching task, the participants' preferences were evenly divided between the digital desk and the tablet. For the image sorting task, the desk was the least preferred environment, and produced significantly higher sorting times and more mistakes. Investigation into the causes of this difference yielded several interesting findings, including: the height of the participant was significantly associated with their speed on the sorting task, the larger image size available on the desk compensated for its poorer resolution in subjective preferences, and the quality of the alignment of the pen was an important factor both for preference and scoring results in the sketching task. Highly responsive pen input devices seem critical for user satisfaction not only for sketching, but also for image sorting; the effects of large display spaces are difficult to isolate from the limitations of input device. This paper elaborates on these findings and considers the implications for the design of user interfaces for image manipulation, in particular interaction techniques appropriate to using pen-input with large display surfaces.},

abstract = {We present a study of how awareness of presence affects content of instant messaging sent between students using WebWh o, an easily accessible web-based awareness tool. WebWho visualizes where people are located in a large university computer lab and allows students to virtually locate one another and communicate via an instant messaging system. As WebWho is there to be accessed through any web browser, it requires no programming skills or special software. It may also be used from outside the computer lab by students located elsewhere. The sender's user name is normally automatically added to the instant messages, but the messages can also be sent anonymously. We were interested in finding out if the sender's conscious hiding of his or her identity seemed to be reflected in the content of anonymous messages, and how these differed from those with identified senders. Awareness of presence seems to be one of several factors influencing message composition, both content and structural aspects. At this stage, we have primarily focused on examining how different factors affects the content of the messages. We cross-analysed the messages for content in relation to parameters such as sender location (collocated, distributed and distant) and sender status (anonymous vs. identified), in order to find out whether awareness of presence seems to be an influencing factor. Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is often claimed to be a sort of hybrid between spoken and written interaction c.f. Ferrara, Brunner &amp; Whittemore (1991) and and several others]. We compared the messages that were sent using the instant messaging tool in WebWho with data from other types of CMC (email, chat) and also with corpora of spoken language and traditionally written language. The aim of the study was primarily to investigate awareness of presence affects on instant messaging, and only secondarily to investigate spoken vs. written features of the texts. Results show that awareness of both physical and virtual presence affects the content of the messages, and that these factors affects the text differently. Sender status, the nature of the computer-mediated medium, and the written mode shape the messages as well. Results show that the students use the messaging system to support collaborative work and coordinate social activities, and extensively for playful behaviour.},

During the deployment of our Portholes system, we conducted a naturalistic study by soliciting user feedback and evolving the system in response. Many of the initial reactions of potential users indicated that our system projected the wrong image so that we designed a new version that provided explicit cues about being in public and who is looking back to suggest a social rather than information interface. We implemented the new design as a Java applet and evaluated design choices with a preference study. Our experiences with different Portholes versions and user reactions to them provide insights for designing awareness tools beyond Portholes systems. Our approach is for the studies to guide and to provide feedback for the design and technical development of our system.},

Next, we describe I2I, an extension of Watson that builds communities of practice on the fly, based on the work that its users do, so that users with similar goals and interests can discover each other and communicate both synchronously and asynchronously. Both Watson and I2I operate given some knowledge of the user's current task, gleaned automatically from the behavior of users in software tools. As a result, the systems can provide users with useful resources in the context of the work that they are performing. We argue that the systems can foster a greater sense of awareness of the resources available, while minimizing the effort required to discover them.},

From this study, we infer general requirements for web awareness support, based on which we have designed two systems aimed to promote more awareness of web activity and visitors. The first is a system supporting ambient notification of web events, end-user configurability, and ambient display for overview and comparison of activity in a web place. The second system moves beyond awareness of web activity to provide glances into the visitors' sites, introducing reciprocity to the host visitor relationship. Both systems have been prototyped and deployed in work environments for an evaluation in everyday use.},

abstract = {With the increasing proliferation of chat applications on the web, the old vision of “adding people” to the web is becoming a reality. Along with collaboration tools, more and more sites offer people awareness mechanisms to let the site visitors know about each other. This reflects the dual nature of the web as a place for virtual meetings as well as an information repository. While standalone chat tools became the killer application of the Internet, site-related awareness applications did not quite catch on. In this work, we suggest possible reasons for this phenomenon and propose a new paradigm for awareness and social navigation. We identify three main obstacles to the existing site-related awareness applications: high sensitivity to the “critical mass” requirement, inflexible meeting place granularity and poor visitor visibility. To address these issues, we extend the well-known “document awareness” concept to a more general one that we call “collection awareness”, which better reflects the graph structure of the web. We introduce a new tool for high-level awareness and collaboration, called Livemaps, which projects live information onto a web site map. We demonstrate how Livemaps addresses the obstacles we pointed out and describe a user study conducted on a “fan” web site for the “Friends” comedy series, so as to verify whether Livemaps actually improves social awareness.},

abstract = {Strategic (control) knowledge typically specifies how a target task is solved. Representing such knowledge declaratively remains a difficult and practical knowledge engineering challenge. The key to addressing this challenge rests on two observations. One, strategic knowledge comprises two finer types of knowledge: subgoaling knowledge used to construct the goal structure for each problem situation pertaining to a target task, and goal-sequencing knowledge used to choose which subgoal in this goal structure is to be pursued at any given moment. Second, when subgoaling knowledge is explicit and expressed in declarative ontological terms, it is possible to fully express goal-sequencing knowledge in the same declarative terms. Building on these observations, we achieve three things. First, we analyse several conventional knowledge-based applications whose subgoaling and goal-sequencing knowledge is implicit, showing that making their subgoaling knowledge explicit permits (re)representing their goal-sequencing knowledge declaratively. Among the applications analysed are MORE and NEOMYCIN. Second, upon studying the roles of goal-sequencing knowledge vis- -vis subgoaling knowledge, we develop a declarative formalism for representing goal-sequencing knowledge. Finally, we discuss and illustrate key benefits from using our declarative formalism, including an enhanced ability to validate and reuse goal-sequencing knowledge.},

Although there exist many reports in the media regarding the unhealthy Internet use among students, research is still limited and has mainly relied upon on-line self-selected reports on Internet dependency or “Internet addiction”. This paper attempts to look into the alleged Internet dependency within the Eriksonian psychosocial development framework. The results of a survey of the Internet use among 217 students in an Australian regional university are reported. The measures of patterns of the Internet use were correlated with that of psychosocial maturity and self-efficacy. The results showed that the Internet dependency seemed to be independent of the psychosocial maturity and the general perceived self-efficacy. A factor analysis extracted six factors from a set of 28 Internet experience-related questions and indicated that the Internet dependency could be of a multifaceted nature. The findings and their implications were discussed and a contextual perspective was proposed.},

Then, big efforts are often required when the application has to be successively modified or extended. In this paper, we present a finite-automaton-based formalism for the specification of rapid application development (RAD) visual applications, which provides a formal basis in the visual application generation.

Two informationally equivalent versions of a financial analysis knowledge-based system (KBS) were compared in a laboratory experiment, one with contextualized access to the underlying task domain knowledge (deep explanations) via hypertext-style links and the other without such access. Results indicate that contextualized access had significant advantages. It afforded a major portion of the requests for deep explanations to occur in the context of problem-solving, as opposed to in the abstract, and led to a significant increase in the number of requests. The increased utilization of deep explanations and contextualized use were associated with a greater degree of congruence between users' judgement and KBS. The conclusion is that availability of knowledge alone is not sufficient;contextualized accessibility is the key for knowledge dissemination and for influencing performance.},

Designers cannot always control the delays in a system's responses (e.g. when accessing remote servers), but it is possible to design human-computer interactions so that theapparent duration of intervals will seem minimal. One way of achieving this goal is to structure tasks so that their apparent duration is reduced, partly by altering the number of choices and actions required for performing the task. Two laboratory experiments assessed the effects of the number of choices and the number of ballistic (simple) steps in a menu search on the apparent duration of the search. Results showed that the apparent duration increased with an increasing number of ballistic steps, while the number of choices had no effect on estimates. However, apparent durations were the shortest when the ratio of choices to ballistic steps was maximized. The implications of these findings for interface design are discussed.},

However, icon design is still predominantly artistic in nature and as a result icon selection is generally based on usability evaluations after a set of alternative icons are developed. This process tends to be time-consuming and costly. In this research, we address the issues ofwhat should be depicted in an icon, given the function it should represent, and how training affects the performance of novice users when using an iconic interface. A set of 36 concrete icons (12 functions) were selected and tested with a total of 30 participants. The experimental results indicate that complete representations are generally superior for both untrained and trained participants. Results also show that trained participants had shorter response times when compared to untrained participants. Further analysis suggests that ambiguity, uniqueness and dominance are three important aspects to consider when designing and developing icons. Applications of this research include the design of appropriate icons for graphical user interfaces prior to usability testing and the importance of a short training period to illustrate the composition of an icon in an effort to improve the mental model associated with each design.},

This paper reviews why this occurs and the failure of many B2C and B2B website executives to understand that appropriate decision support and search technology cannot be fully bought off-the-shelf. Our contention is that significant investment and effort is required at any given website in order to create the decision support and search agents needed to properly support buyer decision-making. We provide a framework to guide such effort (derived from buyer behavior choice theory); review the open problems that e-catalog sites pose to the framework and to existing search engine technology; discuss underlying design principles and guidelines; validate the framework and guidelines with a case study; and discuss lessons learned and steps needed to better support buyer decision behavior in the future. Future needs are also pinpointed.},

abstract = {Computer-based training (CBT) has become an important training tool and is used effectively in providing part-task activities. In the military domain virtual environments (VEs) have long been exploited, mainly through virtual reality (VR), to create realistic working environments. More recently, augmented reality (AR) and advanced embedded training (AET) concepts have also emerged and the development of “AR-AET” and “VR-CBT” concepts promise to become essential tools within military training. Whilst the advantages of both AR and VR are attractive, the challenges for delivering such applications are, generally, technology led. Equally as important, however, is the incorporation of human factors design and implementation techniques and this has been recognized by the development and publication of International Standard ISO 13407, Human-Centred Design Processes for Interactive Systems. Examples described in this paper serve to review Human Factors issues associated with the use of both AR and VR training systems. Whilst there are common issues between AR and VR applications in considering the potential of synthetic training environments, it is also necessary to address particular human-centred design issues within each application domain.},

Such machines are readily capable of exploiting the power of real-time interactive 3D computer graphics, popularly referred to asvirtual reality (VR). VR has rapidly evolved into a technology that today offers a cost-effective means of supporting the development of human skills in all manner of applications, from automotive engineering to defence, surgery to education, retail, petrochemical exploration, and heritage to micro-robotics.

Task analysis tools which break tasks down into component and measurable parts are used as a means of clarifying the support that a system should provide. This paper uses the practical example of work carried out in the agricultural sector to describe the potential of a specific approach to task analysis for the support of crop management decisions. The approach is based on the work of Arinze (1992), who proposes that the basic cognitive element of the decision task is a question, a user enquiry of the environment or system. This paper describes how his approach to the collation and organization of information was successfully used within the DESSAC project as a means of ensuring that the decision support system (DSS) adequately supported the decision task and more recently within the requirements phase of three smaller projects. The incorporation of the approach into a practical and flexible method for use within time and cost constrained DSS development projects is outlined.},

abstract = {Human-centred design processes for interactive systems are defined in ISO 13407 and the associated ISO TR 18529. The publication of these standards represents a maturing of the discipline of user-centred design. The systems development community see that (at last) Human Factors has processes which can be managed and integrated with existing project processes. This internationally agreed set of human-centred design processes provides a definition of the capability that an organization must possess in order to implement user-centred design effectively. It can also be used to assess the extent to which a particular development project employs user-centred design. As such, it presents a challenge to the Human Factors community, and indeed a definition of good practice may even be regarded by some as an unwelcome constraint. This paper presents the background to the process-level definition of user-centred design and describes how it relates to current practice. The challenges, benefits and use of a defined human-centred design process are presented. The implications for Human Factors and other disciplines are discussed. In Appendices A D, the process terminology and the contents of ISO 13407 and ISO TR 18529 are described in more detail, and three examples are given (in Appendix D) of using this process improvement approach to improve the actual design methods in three organizations.},

It first recalls the early 19th-century origins and history of Luddism and then gives a brief sketch of the recent unease and protest about new technologies, indicated by a revival of the term. Some problems of Information Technology are discussed: first, research on IT implementation suggests that policy initiatives and “visions” of what may be achieved do not take the operational realities involved seriously or pay enough attention to them. Second, the evolution of IT is such that the tool itself is a constant preoccupation; keeping up with its frequent changes distracts from the task which it is intended to serve. Third, its potential is best realized if different parties agree on the systems to be used, so that inherent in the technology are issues of centralized control. Research on control systems has shown that people respond to being controlled by reasserting controls of their own, and there are examples of this in IT implementations. The paper ends with a plea for raising the status of operational reality, and finding structural ways to link vision and operation.},

Given the ease and readiness with which we talk and write to each other, and the rapidly increasing use of computer technology in the developed world, it could be argued that the development of speech and pen technologies comprises a logical and worthwhile progression in HCI (human computer interaction). It could also be argued, as many individuals have, that the naturalness of these activities in human-to-human communication makes them an obvious choice for machine interactions. The question being considered here is the extent to which speech and pen input provide a natural means of communicating with machines. No one would dispute their naturalness in human-to-human communication, but does this extend to human machine interaction__ __ Moreover, does the fact that we are so skilled at these activities actually work against us when we come to try these emerging technologies__ __ And finally, how can future research lead towards achieving greater naturalness__ __},

abstract = {If you approach someone in the street and ask for directions then, provided that person knows the way and speaks the same language as you do, it should be easy for him to help you. But often, when you try to follow the directions, you become more confused and lost. Perhaps the person giving the directions has assumed that you know about a local landmark or has forgotten to mention that there is another small street on the left before the one you are seeking. Or maybe the director has not understood your request and has sent you to a place with a similar name there are so many reasons why the transfer of information from one person to another is fraught with difficulties.When you try to discover the requirements for any kind of product the difficulties are even more complex because the source of the requirements is not just one person, it is all of the people who are stakeholders in the project. Moreover, all of these people have their own view of what is important, along with their own experience, prejudices and views of the world. Considering the variations between your sources of requirements (stakeholders) it makes sense to have a variety of techniques for discovering the requirements. We call these as trawling techniques because, like fishing, we run a net through the organization and trap as many requirements as we can. Then, using the appropriate technique, we identify the relevant requirements (the juicy codfish) and separate them from the irrelevant (the minnows). We also look for rare and amazing fish that nobody has ever seen before. We are not just concerned with finding existing requirements, we are also concerned with generating new requirements by using techniques that encourage creativity. This paper summarizes a number of techniques that we have found useful when trawling for requirements.},

abstract = {This paper argues that it is possible to gain good design information from low-cost user trials of low-fidelity prototypes early in the design process, and that simple prototyping is a valuable tool in the user-centred design of new technology especially “smart” consumer products. The value of that design information depends on the stage of the design process at which user testing is carried out and the associated level of realism or fidelity of the prototype. The first stages involve testing simple prototypes which examine the cognitive, or information processing, needs of the user, followed by higher-fidelity prototypes which examine the physical (visual, auditory and tactile) needs of the user.The results of four studies are discussed to illustrate: the extent and nature of the design information gathered, the relative merits of varying the fidelity of the prototypes, and the benefits and costs associated with using different levels of fidelity of prototypes in a user-centred approach to design. Finally, and based on that discussion, an appropriate and practical design strategy is suggested.},

abstract = {According to standard procedure, building a classifier using machine learning is a fully automated process that follows the preparation of training data by a domain expert. In contrast, interactive machine learning engages users in actually generating the classifier themselves. This offers a natural way of integrating background knowledge into the modelling stage as long as interactive tools can be designed that support efficient and effective communication. This paper shows that appropriate techniques can empower users to create models that compete with classifiers built by state-of-the-art learning algorithms. It demonstrates that users even users who are not domain experts can often construct good classifiers, without any help from a learning algorithm, using a simple two-dimensional visual interface. Experiments on real data demonstrate that, not surprisingly, success hinges on the domain: if a few attributes can support good predictions, users generate accurate classifiers, whereas domains with many high-order attribute interactions favour standard machine learning techniques. We also present an artificial example where domain knowledge allows an “expert user” to create a much more accurate model than automatic learning algorithms. These results indicate that our system has the potential to produce highly accurate classifiers in the hands of a domain expert who has a strong interest in the domain and therefore some insights into how to partition the data. Moreover, small expert-defined models offer the additional advantage that they will generally be more intelligible than those generated by automatic techniques.},

abstract = {Many organizations need to respond quickly to change and their workers need to regularly develop new knowledge and skills. The prevailing approach to meeting these demands is on-the-job training, but this is known to be highly ineffective, cause stress and devalue workplace autonomy. Conversely, organizational learning is a process through which workers learn gradually in the work context through experience, reflection on work practice and collaboration with colleagues. Our approach aims to support and enhance organizational learning around enriched work representations. Work representations are tools and documents used to support collaborative working and learning. These are enriched through associations with formal knowledge models and informal discourse. The work representations, informal discourse and associated knowledge models together form on organizational memory from which knowledge can be retrieved later. Our methodological approach to supporting organizational learning is drawn from three industrial case studies concerned with machine maintenance, team planning and hotline support. The methodology encompasses development and design activities, a description of the roles and duties required to sustain the long-term use of the tools, and applicability criteria outlining the kind of organizations that can benefit from this approach.},

The equations and mechanisms to enable such synchronization then follow. Finally, the frame synchronization mechanism that was implemented with experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness is also given at the end of the paper.

Cognitive engineering is viewed, in this project, as a symbiosis between cognitive science and design practice. A range of methodologies has been used: interviews with neonatal staff, ward observations and experimental techniques. The results of these investigations are reported, focusing specifically on the differences between junior and senior physicians in their interpretation of monitored physiological data. It was found that the senior doctors made better use of the different knowledge sources available than the junior doctors. The senior doctors were able to identify more relevant physiological patterns and generated more and better inferences than did their junior colleagues. Expertise differences are discussed in the context of previous psychological research in medical expertise. Finally, the paper discusses the potential utility of these outcomes to inform the design of computerized decision support in neonatal intensive care.},

abstract = {Normally, people use a keyboard to interact with a computer. This type of interaction has two main problems; typing speed and typing error. This paper proposes a non-keyboard computer interaction by using a write-pen or mouse to write Thai handwritten characters and words, using a feature-based, fuzzy logic and object-oriented approach (FBFLOOA) to recognize on-line handwritten Thai characters and words. The feature-based concept is used to extract handwritten character features, the fuzzy logic set is used to identify uncertain handwritten character shapes and the object-oriented approach is used to analyse, design and implement a handwritten character and word recognition program.Two phases of Thai handwritten character and word recognition are proposed. The first phase uses only the FBFLOOA to recognize a handwritten character and the second phase uses FBFLOOA combined with a Thai dictionary file to seek a correct answer for a rejected recognition character. The first phase experimental results show a recognition accuracy of 89.24%, 9.20% misrecognition and 1.56% rejection. The second phase precision results are 97.82%, 0.62% misrecognition and 1.56% rejection. Both phases have an average recognition speed of 6.72s per character. The FBFLOOA-executed program size is 189 KB and the Thai dictionary file is 853 KB, which makes FBFLOOA available for notebooks, mobile phones, calculators and pocket computers.},

abstract = {Virtual environment and multimedia technology are developing rapidly in many areas. These include visual complexity, the opportunity to provide multi-sensory input and output, affordability and a variety of system designs and applications. Involving the users in the design and development process can result in more appropriate and usable interfaces. In addition, an iterative evaluation throughout the process of technology development can result in a large amount of useful information being gathered from users. However, there can be problems with this the data collection and analysis process can be time consuming; it can be difficult to report information back to the developers in a meaningful form, and thus the results of the evaluation may not get incorporated into interface design; and some evaluation techniques can be specific to the application (e.g. assessment of learning from an educational virtual environment application) or user group (e.g. people with learning disabilities).This paper presents an evaluation method that has been successfully used in virtual environment and multimedia evaluation at the Virtual Reality Applications Research Team (VIRART), and has overcome some of these problems. Theme-based content analysis (TBCA) is a qualitative method that provides useful, detailed information about user opinions or behaviour, and can also provide general indications of results in the user population by the grouping of data into meaningful categories. A number of different data collection methods can be used (e.g. short interview, open-ended questionnaire questions, observation) allowing the time and expertise of the virtual environment researcher to be most usefully employed, and the needs and abilities of the user population to be met. The analysis process is less time-consuming, and allows both summarization of the results and retention of the raw data. As described in the paper, this flexible method can be applied in a number of different circumstances, with a variety of different virtual reality technologies (desktop, projection or head mounted display (HMD) systems). In addition, the results from this method can be presented in a simple format to allow an easy feedback of user opinions and behaviours to virtual environment developers, providing contextual examples and an indication of the proportion of users experiencing usability problems. This facilitates a direct input of the evaluation data into the virtual environment development process.},

abstract = {Usability problems associated with virtual environments are a serious obstacle to their successful development. One source of these problems is that virtual environment toolkits provide only a small number of predefined interaction techniques that are expected to be used regardless of context, hence developers are not encouraged to consider interaction. In addition, there are no generally accepted development methodologies for virtual environments. Therefore, even when developers do consider interaction, it is likely to be in an ad hoc fashion driven by technology rather than requirements. If virtual environments are to be useful in a wider context, it is important to provide developers with methods (and tools to support the methods) by which interaction techniques can be systematically designed, tested and refined.In this paper we present the Marigold toolset which supports such a development process. The process begins with a visual specification of the technique being designed. This is requirements centred because it abstracts from implementation issues. Using the toolset, this specification is refined to a prototype implementation so that the technique can be explored in the context of the other elements of the environment. In this way, the developer can verify the technique against requirements in both the specification and prototype. Additionally, because the specification is readily understandable, users can be involved at both stages of the process.},

abstract = {While researchers have made great strides in evaluating and comparing user interfaces using computational models and frameworks, their work has focused almost exclusively on interfaces that serve as the only or primary task for the user. This paper presents an approach of evaluating and comparing interfaces that users interact with as secondary tasks while executing a more critical primary task. The approach centers on the integration of two computational behavioral models, one for the primary task and another for the secondary task. The resulting integrated model can then execute both tasks together and generate a priori predictions about the effects of one task on the other. The paper focuses in particular on the domain of driving and the comparison of four dialing interfaces for in-car cellular phones. Using the ACT-R cognitive architecture (Anderson &amp; Lebiere, 1998) as a computational framework, behavioral models for each possible dialing interface were integrated with an existing model of driver behavior (Salvucci, Boer &amp; Liu, in press). The integrated model predicted that two different manual-dialing interfaces would have significant effects on driver steering performance while two different voice-dialing interfaces would have no significant effect on performance. An empirical study conducted with human drivers in a driving simulator showed that while model and human performance differed with respect to overall magnitudes, the model correctly predicted the overall pattern of effects for human drivers. These results suggest that the integration of computational behavioral models provides a useful, practical method for predicting the effects of secondary-task interface use on primary-task performance.},

Existing uses of models include predicting time and errors for users to perform tasks, acting as embedded assistants to help users perform their tasks, and serving as surrogate users. Treating the design of human computer interfaces as a form of engineering design requires the development and application of user models. A recent trend is for models to be built within the fixed framework of a cognitive architecture, which has been extended by the addition of simulated eyes and hands, enabling the construction of embodied models. Being embodied allows models to interact directly with interfaces. The resulting models can be used to evaluate the interfaces they use, and serve as explanations of users' behavior. The papers in this Special Issue point to a new route for the future, one in which models built within embodied cognitive architectures provide information for the design of better interfaces.},

abstract = {Understanding the interaction of a user with a designed device such as a GUI requires clear understanding of three components: the cognitive, perceptual and motor capabilities of the user, the task to be accomplished and the artefact used to accomplish the task. Computational modeling systems which enable serious consideration of all these constraints have only recently begun to emerge. One such system is ACT-R/PM, which is described in detail. ACT-R/PM is a production system architecture that has been augmented with a set of perceptual-motor modules designed to enable the detailed modeling of interactive tasks. Nilsen's (1991) random menu selection task serves two goals: to illustrate the promise of this system and to help further our understanding of the processes underlying menu selection and visual search. Nilsen's original study, two earlier models of the task, and recent eye-tracking data are all considered. Drawing from the best properties of the previous models considered and guided by information from the eye-tracking experiment, a series of new models of random menu selection were constructed using ACT-R/PM. The final model provides a zero-parameter fit to the data that does an excellent, though not perfect, job of capturing the data.},

abstract = {This field study examining the effects of organizational status and multimedia audio communications technology on communication patterns in business meetings confirms that high status group members verbally dominate discussions and have more control over the flow of the proceedings. However, it reveals a new and surprising finding: multimedia communications technology can in fact exaggerate status constraints in contrast to findings that there is no effect or an equalizing effect on status inequalities of text-based conferencing technology. It appears that in audio conferences, the lack of non-verbal cues that can aid turn-taking combined with (1) the participants' knowledge of the group's status hierarchy and (2) the tendency to compare oneself unfavourably to those of higher status, makes it more difficult for lower status individuals to contribute verbally to discussions than in face-to-face interactions. Such status constraints may have both positive and negative impacts on group communication effectiveness, these and implications for the design and implementation of multimedia communications technology are discussed.},

abstract = {This article describes part of a research programme whose goal is to develop a better understanding of how operators monitor complex, dynamic systems under normal operations. In a previous phase, field observations were made at two older nuclear power plant control rooms (CRs) consisting primarily of analogue, hard-wired instrumentation. In this phase, additional field observations were conducted in a newer computer-based CR to determine the impact of CR technology on operator monitoring. Eleven different operators were observed in situ for a total of approximately 88 h. The findings indicate that there are many similarities in the monitoring strategies adopted by operators in the two types of CRs. However, in most cases, these same strategies are performed using different behaviours, thereby showing the shaping effect of the CR technology. A new way of conceptualizing the difference between traditional analogue CRs and modern computer-based CRs is proposed.},

abstract = {Contemporary information technology (IT)-related research has focused on use or user acceptance as a key dependent measure for valuing IT. By understanding the determinants of IT use, we gain descriptive information about successful IT, and prescriptive information for better deploying IT resources and improving their utility. Although there are several competing theories regarding IT use, research findings often cite their inability to account for temporal changes in usage behaviors. Furthermore, contemporary human computer interaction perspectives often focus on the robust and growing literature surrounding usability and likeability; however, few studies have provided insight into the components of, or antecedents to, the utility dimension. This research attempts to address these gaps by introducing the construct of users'quality of experience as a potential mediator between the determinants of use and actual usage behaviors and their outcomes. A pilot survey concerning Internet usage generated potentially relevant items which were later refined into a questionnaire assessing each item's relative importance to perceptions of quality of experience. Initial indications suggest 10 of the items represent a temporally stable and unidimensional construct. Findings are also interpreted within the context of IT and cognitive/behavioral science perspectives, further providing for face validity of the quality of experience construct.},

The results update and extend prior empirical characterizations of web use. Among the results we show that web page revisitation is a much more prevalent activity than previously reported (approximately 81% of pages have been previously visited by the user), that most pages are visited for a surprisingly short period of time, that users maintain large (and possibly overwhelming) bookmark collections, and that there is a marked lack of commonality in the pages visited by different users. These results have implications for a wide range of web-based tools including the interface features provided by web browsers, the design of caching proxy servers, and the design of efficient web sites.},

Towards this goal we bring together research from psychology of programming and image processing. According to current theories of imagery processing imagery facilitates a quicker access to semantic information. Thus, visual programming languages should allow for quicker construction of a mental representation based on data flow relationships of a program than procedural languages. To test this hypothesis the mental models of C and spreadsheet programmers were assessed in different program comprehension situations. The results showed that spreadsheet programmers developed data flow based mental representations in all situations, while C programmers seemed to access first a control flow and then data flow based mental representations. These results could help to expand theories of mental models from psychology of programming to account for the effect of imagery.},

abstract = {The cognitive activities performed by systems designers during systems development include problem understanding, problem decomposition and solution specification. One aspect of object-oriented (OO) approaches to system design that appeals to many adopting organizations is the purported naturalness, i.e. the consistency of OO approaches with these cognitive activities of problem solving. Essentially, OO aims to abstract components of the problem of system development to a high level that parallels problem solving in the world the system represents. In other words, knowing how a problem is solved in the real world informs one about how the OO system solves the problem. Thus, the OO development process and the resulting OO model are believed to be consistent with innate cognitive activities and consistent with the problem/real world, respectively. A cognitive mapping method was used to ask graduate students experienced with OO techniques about their perceptions of what is complex (difficult to understand) about OO systems. Their responses include a set of concepts, categories of similar concepts and cognitive maps that reveal what they believe is difficult about using OO techniques. Evaluating these perceptions in terms of the cognitive activities of system design reveals problem decomposition was perceived as the activity that caused the most difficulties related to learning OO techniques. Problem understanding was the goal of the participants, while the solution activity ranked lower in importance but contained many issues essential to systems development and influenced problem understanding.},

abstract = {With the introduction of information and communication technologies into our homes and the different physical and communicative expressions this implies for our living spaces the concepts of being private and of beingpublic become crucial. In this paper, we introduce A Pattern Language, developed by Christopher Alexander in the 1970s, in order to handle these problems systematically. The presentation formally follows Alexander's structure in five cases all related to practical experiments on being private and public at home. We start with a number of concrete user situations related to human computer interaction. Social and communicative phenomena or possibilities end up in novel design patterns at the interface between an architectural and a technological perspective. The novel patterns presented are primarily based on experiences from practical work on the development of a conceptual dwelling of the future, comHOME, designed and constructed as a full-scale model of a flat. By creating different zones for video-mediated communication, comZONES, the user can control the private and public digital areas varying in time and space. The novel patterns refer to two separate levels. On the first level a specific pattern, called “PRIVATE AND PUBLIC DIGITAL SPACES”, is designed as a conceptual floor plan layout. This plan distributes private and public digital spaces for video-mediated communication over the flat. At a second level, four patterns show the integration of the specific comZONES aiming at solving four specific problems with video-mediated communication at home. Our intention is to describe the application of design patterns as a method for analysing and solving novel problems encountered with the introduction of information and communication technologies in our homes. The video-mediated set-ups are not dealt with in depth. They serve mainly as designs that make it possible to apply the design patterns.},

Some predict increasing sales of home PCs while others predict the break-up of the PC into a variety of information appliances. In this paper, we report a study of home PC use which illuminates this issue from the perspective of existing PC-owning families. Eleven PC-owning families from the Boston area were interviewed at home about their current PC use, their attitudes to computers and the location of technology in their homes. We found that the general-purpose nature of the home PC offers something for everybody in the household, and quickly becomes an established part of family life. Indeed, it was so popular in the households we visited that it had resulted in widespread competition for PC time, and had caused parents to worry about how best to control PC and internet access and influence. These behaviours and concerns led adults and children to express quite different preferences for relocating their computing experience around the house. However in both cases the needs were for better access to multifunctional extensions of the main PC. The implications of these findings for home PC and appliance evolution are discussed.},

We investigate the effects of two reading speeds (normal and fast) and different line lengths on comprehension, reading rate and scrolling patterns. Scrolling patterns are defined as the way in which readers proceed through the text, pausing and scrolling. Comprehension and reading rate are also examined in relation to scrolling patterns to attempt to identify some characteristics of effective readers. We found a reduction in overall comprehension when reading fast, but the type of information recalled was not dependent on speed. A medium line length (55 characters per line) appears to support effective reading at normal and fast speeds. This produced the highest level of comprehension and was also read faster than short lines. Scrolling patterns associated with better comprehension (more time in pauses and more individual scrolling movements) contrast with scrolling patterns used by faster readers (less time in pauses between scrolling). Consequently, effective readers can only be defined in relation to the aims of the reading task, which may favour either speed or accuracy.},

A central thesis of this study is that such “interactive multimedia learning systems” would significantly improve users' attitudes, and that this, in turn, would enhance their learning achievement. An additional thesis of the study is that the “learning style” of the users will moderate the relationship between interactivity and attitude. This article reports the findings of a controlled quasi-experimental study of the influences of “interactivity” on six different dimensions of user attitude (content, format, user-control, feedback, ease of use and motivation) and performance improvement (achievement-gain). The results indicate that interactivity positively influences user attitude, and some dimensions of attitude translate into enhanced user performance. The study finds some interesting support for the moderating effects of learning styles. Implications and future research directions are discussed.},

In this paper, the concept of “habitability” is explored in relation to the design of dialogues for speech-based systems. Two studies investigating the role of habitability in speech systems for banking applications are reported. The first study employed a speech-driven automated teller machine (ATM), using a visual display to indicate available vocabulary. Users made several distinct types of error with this system, indicating that habitability in speech systems cannot be achieved simply by displaying the input language. The second study employed a speech input/speech output home banking application, in which system constraints were indicated by either a spoken menu of words or a “query-style” prompt (e.g. “what service do you require?”). Between-subjects comparisons of these two conditions confirmed that the “menu-style” dialogue was rated as more habitable than the “query-style”. It also led to fewer errors, and was rated as easier to use, suggesting that habitability is a key issue in speech system usability. Comparison with the results of the first study suggests that for speech input, spoken menu prompts may be more habitable than similar menus shown on a visual display. The implications of these results to system design are discussed, and some initial dialogue design recommendations are presented.},

As part of a project on diagrammatic knowledge acquisition we have formulated principles that can underpin the construction, interpretation and use of Cartesian graphs in general and in the specific context of knowledge acquisition. Cartesian graphs are distinguished from other forms of representations by the manner in which they use two-dimensional space to encode quantities on interval or ratio scales. An ontological approach to the analysis of graphs was adopted in which a framework for mapping between the EngMath ontology for engineering mathematics and an ontology of visual components of graphs was developed, the GraphRep framework. GraphRep considers the roles of physical dimensions, measurement units, scales of measurement, functional relations amongst quantities and magnitudes in the generation and interpretation of graphs. It provides a topology of standard graphs and rules for the construction of composite graphs. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by using it: (1) to explain why a particular type of complex composite graph is often used for problem solving in thermodynamics; (2) to analyse the limitations of existing software packages for visualizing data, such as spreadsheets, and to suggest the improvements in their design; and (3) to provide constraints and guidelines for the design of procedures and software to support diagrammatic knowledge acquisition with Cartesian graphs.},

In contrast, the new research domains of computer- supported cooperative work (CSCW) or human machine cooperation are harder to develop because the problems to be solved are more complex and the theoretical frameworks more heterogeneous. However, dynamic situations with high temporal constraints create occasions where small teams (including humans and machines) can cooperate on an almost cognitive basis, reducing social or emotional effects. This paper reviews the state of the art on cognitive cooperation to extend an individual cognitive architecture and deal with these situations, combining private and cooperative activities that are highly task-oriented. Cooperation is taken as the management of interference between individual activities to facilitate the team members' sub-tasks and the team's common task when there is one. This review of the literature is a step towards a theoretical approach that could be relevant to evaluate cooperation and to design assistance in diverse domains such as air traffic control or aircraft piloting.},

abstract = {In this paper, the concept of multimodal human-computer interaction is explored. It is proposed that multimodality can be defined from human or technology perspectives, which place emphasis on different attributes of the system. Furthermore, in this paper it is argued that the most effective definition of multimodality concentrates on task and goal dependencies. Not only does this permit consideration over and above the technology/human distinction, but also allows consideration of multiple tasks. In order to explore this notion, critical path analysis is used to develop models of multimodal systems. The model describes multimodal HCI, and allows consideration of the effects of modality dependency. The models allow prediction of transaction time under various conditions. Predictions arising from these models are shown to be good fits with data obtained from user trials. Thus, it is proposed that one can develop and evaluate preliminary versions of multimodal systems prior to prototype development.},

abstract = {Force-sensitive multilevel input elements are introduced as the basic building blocks for compact-size input devices in mobile environments. Compared with switch-type keys, multilevel elements can decrease the number of keys on a keyboard while maintaining the input capacity. A multilevel input mechanism using force-sensitive sensor pads is demonstrated in a three-level three-element tactile chording system with multimodal feedback. Two schemes are introduced to segment the output range of the sensor into levels. For relatively unpracticed users, the scheme based on maximum finger forces gives an average error rate of 20.2% and an input time of 2.24 s for a chord of three inputs. Reclassification of the experimental data using Gaussian segmentation shows that significant improvement of the performance can be expected.},

The agent-based architecture can be used to create multimodal interaction. The generic process model has been designed, implemented and used to simulate different types of interaction between verbal and non-verbal communication processes: a non-verbal communication process can add and modify content to a verbal communication process, but can also provide a protocol for the (control of the) verbal communication process. With respect to the communication protocol both stimulus response behaviour and deliberative behaviour have been modelled and simulated. The semantics of the model has been formalized by three-levelled partial temporal models, covering both the material and mental proceses and their relations.},

abstract = {Human experts tend to introduce intermediate terms in giving their explanations. The expert's explanation of such terms is operational for the context that triggered the explanation; however, term definitions remain often incomplete. Further, the expert's (re) use of these terms is hierarchical (similar to natural language). In this paper, we argue that a hierarchical incremental knowledge acquisition (KA) process that captures the expert terms and operationalizes them while incompletely defined makes the KA task more effective. Towards this we present our knowledge representation formalism Nested Ripple Down Rules (NRDR) that is a substantial extension to the (Multiple Classification) Ripple Down Rule (RDR) KA framework. The incremental KA process with NRDR as the underlying knowledge representation has confirmation holistic features. This allows simultaneous incremental modelling and KA and eases the knowledge base (KB) development process.Our NRDR formalism preserves the strength of incremental refinement methods, that is the ease of maintenance of the KB. It also addresses some of their shortcomings: repetition, lack of explicit modelling and readability. KBs developed with NRDR describe an explicit model of the domain. This greatly enhances the reuseability of the acquired knowledge.This paper also presents a theoretical framework for analysing the structure of RDR in general and NRDR in particular. Using this framework, we analyse the conditions under which RDR converges towards the target KB. We discuss the maintenance problems of NRDR as a function of this convergence. Further, we analyse the conditions under which NRDR offers an effective approach for domain modelling. We show that the maintenance of NRDR requires similar effort to maintaining RDR for most of the KB development cycle. We show that when an NRDR KB shows an increase in maintenance requirement in comparison with RDR during its development, this added requirement can be automatically handled using stored past seen cases.},

This information can be used by the designers of future programming languages to guide the selection and generation of language features.

Learning about algorithms, just like learning to program, is difficult, however. A number of prior studies have found that using animation to help teach algorithms had less beneficial effects on learning than hoped. Those results surprise many computer science instructors whose intuition leads them to believe that algorithm animations should assist instruction. This article reports on a study in which animation is utilized in more of a “homework” learning scenario rather than a “final exam” scenario. Our focus is on understanding how learners will utilize animation and other instructional materials in trying to understand a new algorithm, and on gaining insight into how animations can fit into successful learning strategies. The study indicates that students use sophisticated combinations of instructional materials in learning scenarios. In particular, the presence of algorithm animations seems to make a complicated algorithm more accessible and less intimidating, thus leading to enhanced student interaction with the materials and facilitating learning.},

abstract = {Several studies have suggested that the mental structures of programmers of procedural languages have a close relationship with a model of structural knowledge related to functional information known as programming Plans. It also has been claimed that experienced programmers organize this representation in a hierarchical structure where some elements of Plans are focal or central to them. However, it is not clear that this is the case for other types of programming languages, especially for those which are significantly different from the procedural paradigm.The study reported in this paper investigates whether these claims are true for Prolog, a language which has important differences to procedural languages. Prolog does not have obvious syntactic cues to mark blocks of code (begin/end, repeat/until, etc). Also, its powerful primitives (unification and backtracking) and the extensive use of recursion might influence how programmers comprehend Prolog code in a significant way.The findings of the study suggest that Plans and functional information are important for Prolog programmers, but that there is also at least another model of structural knowledge valid for this language. This model of structural knowledge, Prolog schemas, is related to data structure information and it seems that a hierarchical organisation that highlights the relevance of some of its elements as focal is valid for Prolog. These results support the view that comprehension involves the detection of varying aspects of the code and that each of the structures related to these aspects might have their own organization and hierarchical relations.},

abstract = {Near-term memory (NTM) is proposed as a construct for analysing the memory that experts build up and use as they solve a problem in their domain of expertise. Large amounts of information are processed in such situations, and any particular detail could become important later, so performance is facilitated by maintaining long-term memory access to as much detail as possible. Precise analysis of such memory is difficult to achieve with experimentation or observation alone, so computational simulation is used as the analytical method. A computational process model grounded in cognitive theory (Soar) is constructed to fit extensive fine-grained behavioral data from an expert programmer. The model's structures and processes are then inspected for insights into NTM. Structurally, the model's NTM consists of fine-grain perceptual, semantic, and episodic items whose availability is tied to cues from the encoding context. Quantitatively, much more detail enters NTM than is ever retrieved, but when retrieval does occur it can change the course of behavior. To illustrate applications of the construct, the model is used to examine how a cluttered interface might impose cognitive costs by increasing retrieval demands on memory.},

Software architectures which can assemble knowledge from networked sources coherently according to the requirements of a particular task or perspective will be at a premium in the next generation of web services. We argue that the ability to generate task-relevant ontologies efficiently and relate them to web resources will be essential for creating a machine-inferencable “semantic web”. The Internet-based multi-agent problem solving (IMPS) architecture described here is designed to facilitate the retrieval, restructuring, integration and formalization of task-relevant ontological knowledge from the web. There are rich structured and semi-structured sources of knowledge available on the web that present implicit or explicit ontologies of domains. Knowledge-level models of tasks have an important role to play in extracting and structuring useful focused problem-solving knowledge from these web sources. IMPS uses a multi-agent architecture to combine these models with a selection of web knowledge extraction heuristics to provide clean syntactic integration of ontological knowledge from diverse sources and support a range of ontology merging operations at the semantic level. Whilst our specific aim is to enable on-line knowledge acquisition from web sources to support knowledge-based problem solving by a community of software agents encapsulating problem-sloving inferences, the techniques described here can be applied to more general task-based integration of knowledge from diverse web sources, and the provision of services such as the critical comparison, fusion, maintenance and update of both formal informal ontologies.},

Consequently, analysis and reporting of usability data are ad hoc and do not live up to their potential in cost effectiveness, and usability engineering support tools are not well integrated. We developed the User Action Framework, a structured knowledge base of usability concepts and issues, as a framework on which to build a broad suite of usability engineering support tools. The User Action Framework helps to guide the development of each tool and to integrate the set of tools in the practitioner's working environment. An important characteristic of the User Action Framework is its own reliability in term of consistent use by practitioners. Consistent understanding and reporting of the underlying causes of usability problems are requirements for cost-effective analysis and redesign. Thus, high reliability in terms of agreement by users on what the User Action Framework means and how it is used is essential for its role as a common foundation for the tools. Here we describe how we achieved high reliability in the User Action Framework, and we support the claim with strongly positive results of a summative reliability study conducted to measure agreement among 10 usability experts in classifying 15 different usability problems. Reliability data from the User Action Framework are also compared to data collected from nine of the same usability experts using a classic heuristic evaluation technique.},

abstract = {Operator training in fault diagnosis of complex systems has taken several forms including heuristics, decision flow charts and qualitative plant modelling. Having to comply to a specific learning strategy, however, may increase workload in remembering instructions, constrain people in accommodating their own styles and deny opportunities for exploiting other strategies. A means for increasing learning flexibility and adaptability would be to manipulate the design of the interface in ways that prompt operators to recall past instructions or develop their own strategies. In this study, instructions are madevisible on the interface by presenting trainees with a set of tell-tale signs derived from diagnostic heuristics.A group of subjects T (new) was trained in using this interface while verbal instructions (e.g. plant theory) were provided to guide discovery of diagnostic rules; a second group T (old) received the same plant theory but practised on a conventional interface. Two other groups used the conventional interface and were trained to apply a set of heuristics with or without the support of a plant theory (H+T and H groups, respectively). Making instructions visible helped the T (new) group to achieve higher accuracy scores than the T (old) group on a subset of fault scenarios. On a near-transfer task, both the T (new) and T (old) groups were superior to the heuristics (H) group. On transfer to another plant, the T (new) group maintained superiority to the heuristics (H) group and exceeded the T (old) group only in a subset of fault scenarios; the differences between theT (new) and the H+T groups were not significant. The results may indicate that making instructionsvisible could enhance acquisition and also the transfer of complex skills while allowing for flexibility and adaptability in the learning environment.},

It is suggested that although the concept of cognitive style is a useful starting point, it is unable to account for many findings in the literature, and that any model of strategy usage that confines itself to mechanisms governing strategy selection is incomplete. In addition, it is necessary to take account of strategy availability: Which strategies do people possess, and how do people discover new strategies? Several findings in the literature indicate that strategy discovery is related to general abilities. Specifically, those who are best able to execute a current strategy are those who are the most likely to identify new, more effective methods. It is suggested that many findings that support the notion of cognitive style can be reinterpreted in this light.},

This article describes an investigation of the role of explanations in cooperative problem solving. An experimental field study was performed with 41 users and an operational system for personal financial planning. The experiment showed a requirement for cooperative problem solving was associated with greater use of explanations. This effect was more marked with those users who had more fully explored the use of explanations during a preliminary stage of guided problem solving. The frequency of use of explanations in total was positively related to problem-solving performance. There was some evidence that the positive relationship between explanations and improved performance was more noticeable when problems requiring cooperation were undertaken.},

abstract = {This exploratory study examines the nature of program understanding strategies employed during a series of comprehension and maintenance activities carried out over time. Two dimensions of comprehension were examined: the direction of comprehension and the breadth of comprehension. Thirty expert procedural and object-oriented (OO) programmers studied a program and then performed modifications during two sessions held 1 week apart. The results showed that the direction of comprehension was mixed. The OO programmers tended to use a strongly top-down approach to program understanding during the early phase of familiarization with the program but used an increasingly bottom-up approach during the subsequent maintenance tasks. The procedural programmers used a more bottom-up orientation even during the early phase, and this bottom-up approach became even stronger during the maintenance tasks. The breadth of the programmers' comprehension was found to be greater for the procedural programmers than for the object-oriented programmers. However, after carrying out a series of tasks, all programmers had examined the majority of the program code. The results suggest that, regardless of paradigm, expert programmers eventually build a broad systematic, rather than a localized, view of a program over time.},

abstract = {This study examines the efficacy of a consulting system for designing conceptual databases in reducing data modelling errors. Seventy-two subjects participated in an experiment requiring modelling of two tasks using the consulting system. About half the subjects used the treatment version and the other half used the control version. The control version resembled the treatment version in the look and feel of the interface; however, it did not embed the rules and heuristics that were included in the treatment version.Research findings suggest that subjects using the treatment version significantly outscored their control version counterparts. There was an interaction effect between system and prior knowledge subjects who scored low in a pre-test benefited the most from the treatment version.This study has demonstrated that a consulting system can significantly reduce the incidence of errors committed by designers engaged in conceptual database modelling. Further, the system is robust and can prevent errors even in the presence of redundancy in user requirements.},

ASTRA has found apparently novel reactions that involve proton and neutron capture, as well as novel fusion reactions that produce neutrons and deuterium. The system has also generated reaction pathways for helium, carbon and oxygen that do not appear in the scientific literature. However, ASTRA also finds many other reaction pathways that are less interesting and that suggest priorities for future research.},

abstract = {Acting cooperatively in a communicative situation requires the computer agents to behave collaboratively. This activity is complicated by many sorts of conflicts that may arise in complex interaction environments. In order to capture essential forces driving dialogues in these environments, a number of formal models have been proposed, which focus on choosing among action and reaction types in comparably simple sequences. In this paper, we propose a method to enhance these models by the capability to produce longer dialogue contributions, which is done through tailoring variations in richly structured system actions and choosing among them, guided by quantitative and partially conflicting cooperativity principles based on the Gricean conversation maxims. We have elaborated this model in the context of an interactive, formal proof presentation system. Acting cooperatively for that system means collaborating with the human user by considerably manipulating a proof as produced by a theorem prover to obtain a human-adequate form, and to resolve conflicts between completeness of detail, length of the descriptions given and degree of explicitness required. Our approach complements models of cooperativity and collaboration that are grounded in basic principles of rationality by mediating between partially conflicting conversation goals in producing more complex dialogue contributions.},

It is not always possible, and maybe not even desirable, to “solve” this kind of conflict, as the sources are subjective. The communicating agents can, however, use knowledge of the opponent's preferences, to try and convince the partner of a point of view which they wish to promote. To deal with these situations requires an argumentative capacity, able to handle not only “demonstrative” arguments but also “dialectic” ones, which may not necessarily be based on rationality and valid premises. This paper presents a formalization of a theory of informal argumentation, focused on techniques to change attitudes of the interlocutor, in the domain of health promotion.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the empirical correlates of the agreement process. Informally, the agreement process is the dialog process by which collaborators achieve joint commitment on a joint action. We propose a specific instantiation of the agreement process, derived from our theoretical model, that integrates the IRMA framework for rational problem solving (Bratman, Israel &amp; Pollack, 1988) with Clark's (1992, 1996) work on language as a collaborative activity; and from the characteristics of our task, a simple design problem (furnishing a two-room apartment) in which knowledge is equally distributed among agents, and needs to be shared. The main contribution of our paper is an empirical study of some of the components of the agreement process. We first discuss why we believe the findings from our corpus of computer-mediated dialogs are applicable to human human collaborative dialogs in general. We then present our theoretical model, and apply it to make predictions about the components of the agreement process. We focus on how information is exchanged in order to arrive at a proposal, and on what constitutes a proposal and its acceptance/rejection. Our corpus study makes use of features of both the dialog and the domain reasoning situation, and led us to discover that the notion of commitment is more useful to model the agreement process than that of acceptance/rejection, as it more closely relates to the unfolding of negotiation.},

abstract = {In a collaborative planning environment in which the agents are autonomous and heterogeneous, it is inevitable that discrepancies in the agents' beliefs result in conflicts during the planning process. In such cases, it is important that the agents engage in collaborative negotiation to resolve the detected conflicts in order to determine what should constitute their shared plan of actions and shared beliefs. This paper presents a plan-based model for conflict detection and resolution in collaborative planning dialogs. Our model specifies how a collaborative system should detect conflicts that arise between the system and its user during the planning process. If the detected conflicts warrant resolution, our model initiates collaborative negotiation in an attempt to resolve the conflicts in the agent's beliefs. In addition, when multiple conflicts arise, our model identifies and addresses the most effective aspect in its pursuit of conflict resolution. Furthermore, by capturing the collaborative planning process in a recursive Propose Evaluate Modify cycle of actions, our model is capable of handling embedded negotiation during conflict resolution.},

This model rests on a theory of collaborative discourse, and allows for cooperative human machine communication in written dialogues. We show how cooperative behaviour, illustrated by the analysis of a dialogue corpus and formalized by an underlying theory of cooperation, is interpreted and produced in our model. We describe and illustrate in detail the main algorithms used to model the reasoning processes necessary for interpretation, planning, generation, as well as for determining which actions to perform and when. Finally, we present our implemented system.Our data are drawn from a corpus of human human dialogues, selected and transcribed from a day-long recording of phone calls at a phone desk in an industrial setting (Castaing, 1993). We present an analysis of this corpus, focusing on dialogues which require, in order to succeed, helpful behaviour on the part of both the caller and the operator.The theoretical framework of our model rests on the theory of collaborative discourse developed by Grosz and Sidner (1986, 1990), Grosz and Kraus (1993, 1996), and further extended by Lochbaum (1994, 1995). An important objective guiding the design of our dialogue model was to allow the agent being modelled to interpret and manifest a type of cooperative behaviour which follows Grosz and Kraus's formalization of the commitment of each collaborative agent towards the actions of the other collaborative agents. The model we propose extends Lochbaum's approach to discourse processing in extending her interpretation algorithm to allow for the treatment of a wider range of dialogues, and in providing an algorithm of task advancement which guides the generation process and allows for the interleaving of execution and planning, thereby facilitating cooperation among agents. The cooperative behaviour of the agent being modelled rests on the use of communicative actions allowing agents to share additional knowledge and assist each other in performing their actions.},

abstract = {This paper describes some of the basic cooperative mechanisms of dialogue. Ideal cooperation is seen as consisting of four features (cognitive consideration, joint purpose, ethical consideration and trust), which can also to some extent be seen as requirements building on each other. Weaker concepts such as “coordination” and “collaboration” have only some of these features or have them to lesser degrees. We point out the central role of ethics and trust in cooperation, and contrast the result with popular AI accounts of collaboration. Dialogue is also seen as associated with social activities, in which certain obligations and rights are connected with particular roles. Dialogue is seen to progress through the written, vocal or gestural contributions made by participants. Each of the contributions has associated with it both expressive and evocative functions, as well as specific obligations for participants. These functions are dependent on the surface form of a contribution, the activity and the local context, for their interpretation. We illustrate the perspective by analysing dialogue extracts from three different activity types (a travel dialogue, a quarrel and a dialogue with a computer system). Finally, we consider what kind of information is shared in dialogue, and the ways in which dialogue participants manifest this sharing to each other through linguistic and other communicative behaviour. The paper concludes with a comparison to other accounts of dialogue and prospects for integration of these ideas within dialogue systems.},

Participants performed typical file/directory search and analysis tasks using the two tools. In general, performance trends favored the Sunburst tool with respect to correct task performance, particularly on initial use. Performance with Treemap tended to improve over time and use, suggesting a greater learning cost that was partially recouped over time. Each tool afforded somewhat different search strategies, which also appeared to influence performance. Finally, participants strongly preferred the Sunburst tool, citing better ability to convey structure and hierarchy.},

The effects of individual differences in spatial ability and associative memory ability also were considered. Results indicated that performance equivalence, between two- and three-dimensional interfaces, could be achieved when the two-dimensional interface accounted for between 50 and 70% of the semantic variance accounted for by the three-dimensional solution. A second study, in which automatic text analysis was used to generate two- and three-dimensional solutions for document sets of varying sizes and types, supported the conclusion that, for the purpose of information search, the amount of additional semantic information that can be conveyed by a three-dimensional solution does not outweigh the associated additional cognitive demands.},

abstract = {An integrated visual thesaurus and results browser to support information retrieval was designed using a task model of information searching. The system provided a hierarchical thesaurus with a results cluster display representing similarity between retrieved documents and relevance ranking using a bullseye metaphor. Latent semantic indexing (LSI) was used as the retrieval engine and to calculate the similarity between documents. The design was tested with two information retrieval tasks. User behaviour, performance and attitude were recorded as well as usability problems. The system had few usability problems and users liked the visualizations, but recall performance was poor. The reasons for poor/good performance were investigated by examining user behaviour and search strategies. Better searchers used the visualizations more effectively and spent longer on the task, whereas poorer performances were attributable to poor motivation, difficulty in assessing article relevance and poor use of system visualizations. The bullseye browser display appeared to encourage limited evaluation of article relevance on titles, leading to poor performance. The bullseye display metaphor for article relevance was understood by users; however, they were confused by the concept of similarity searching expressed as visual clusters. The conclusions from the study are that while visual user interfaces for information searching might seem to be usable, they may not actually improve performance. Training and advisor facilities for effective search strategies need to be incorporated to enhance the effectiveness of visual user interfaces for information retrieval.},

abstract = {Visualizing information structure plays an increasing role in hypertext systems. Empirical evidence shows that such visualizations support the users or readers of hypertext systems. The following study investigates whether such information visualizations in the form of two-dimensional graphical overview maps also support the writers of hypertext documents. It also seems plausible to assume that the process of writing text changes when graphical overview maps integrated into hypertext systems are used. We also analysed the relationship between the authoring process and the character of the finished documents. In general, it can be said that visualizing the information structure inherent in a document plays an important role in hypertext authoring. It was the only innovative feature of the hypertext authoring system we developed which was used intensively by almost all the authors. In contrast to that, the finished documents were rather traditional. Authors did not exploit the novel features of hypertext/hypermedia systems like, e.g. introducing pictures, movies or sounds. On the basis of the analysis of the hypertext authoring process guidelines can be formulated to support writers of hypertext documents.},

abstract = {We present a discussion and initial empirical investigation of user-interface designs for a set of three Web browsers. The target end-user population we identified were experienced software engineers who maintained large Web sites or portals. The user study demonstrated the strengths and weaknesses of two conventional 2D browsers for this target user, as well as that of XML3D, a novel browser that integrates an interactive 3D hyperbolic graph view with a more traditional 2D list view of the data. A standard collapse/expand tree browser and a Web-based hierarchical categorization similar to Yahoo!, were competitively evaluated against XML3D. No reliable difference between the two 2D browsers was observed. However, the results showed clear differences between XML3D and the 2D user interfaces combined. With XML3D, participants performed search tasks within existing categories reliably faster with no decline in the quality of their responses. It was informally observed that integrating the ability to view the overall structure of the information space with the ability to easily assess local and global relationships was key to successful search performance. XML3D was the only tool of the three that efficiently showed the overall structure within one visualization. The XML3D browser accomplished this by combining a 3D graph layout view as well as an accompanying 2D list view. Users did opt to use the 2D user-interface components of XML3D during new category search tasks, and the XML3D performance advantage was no longer obtained in those conditions. In addition, there were no reliable differences in overall user satisfaction across the three user-interface designs. Since we observed subjects using the XML3D features differently depending on the kind of search task, future studies should explore optimal ways of integrating the use of novel focus+context visualizations and 2D lists for effective information retrieval. The contribution of this paper is that it includes empirical data to demonstrate where novel focus+context views might benefit experienced users over and above more conventional user-interface techniques, in addition to where design improvements are warranted.},

abstract = {Although visualizations are components of many information interfaces, testing of these visual elements is rarely undertaken except as a part of overall usability testing. For this reason, it is unclear what role, if any, visualizations actually perform. Our method involves the creation of simple visual prototypes and task sets based on a visual taxonomy which allows testing of the visualization in isolation from the rest of the system. By defining tests using a visual taxonomy rather than customary tasks from the application domain, our method circumvents the problems of restricting evaluation of newer more capable systems to only those tasks which might be accomplished with older, less capable ones. This paper will discuss methods for exhaustively testing the capabilities of a visualization by mapping from a domain-independent taxonomy of visual tasks to a specific domain, i.e. information retrieval. Experimental results are presented illustrating this approach to determining the role visualizations may play in supporting users in information-seeking environments. Our methods could easily be extended to other domains including data visualization.},

We used the web sites for the automobile manufacturers VW, Ford and Toyota so we could vary the origin of the site. We used well-known constructs from advertising and marketing research to measure various aspects of the subjects and their reactions to the web site.Our basic finding is that there are fewer differences between subjects than have typically been observed by paper-based marketing experiments. There is no evidence that the origin of the site interacts with the individual. However, after performing a factor analysis on how subjects reported their purpose for using the Internet, we found considerable differences in purpose of use between US and Hong Kong subjects. American subjects are inclined to use the Internet for information search purposes, and the Hong Kong subjects are more inclined to use the Internet for social communication purposes. Further, in both countries there is a relationship between these purposes and subjects having their views on the product transformed.},

Four experiments are described in which participants repeatedly navigated VEs that were either conventional (i.e. obeyed the laws of Euclidean space), or contained hyperlinks. Participants learned spatial knowledge slowly in both types of environment, echoing the findings of previous studies that used conventional VEs. The detrimental effects on participants' spatial knowledge of using hyperlinks for movement were reduced when a time-delay was introduced, but participants still developed less accurate knowledge than they did in the conventional VEs. Visual continuity had a greater influence on participants' rate of learning than continuity of movement, and participants were able to exploit hyperlinks that connected together disparate regions of a VE to reduce travel time.},

abstract = {Despite its uses, the Internet is liable to be abused. “Internet Addiction” is a newly proposed construct, derived form DSM-IV criteria for substance abuse. As a very recent phenomenon, excess internet use probably arises through pre-existing mechanisms. The addictive element may be the search for stimulation through interactive services, or the Internet may serve the purpose of an escape from real-life difficulties. We therefore considered the extent to which sensation seeking or poor self-esteem predicts heavier Internet use. Fifty participants, recruited through the Internet or the Internet Addiction Support Group, completed an Internet Related Problem Scale, the MMPI-2 Addiction Potential Scale, the Coopersmith Self-Esteem Inventory and the Sensation Seeking Scale. The Internet Related Problem Scale showed a moderate level of internal consistency and demonstrated construct validity, predicting hours of Internet use and having a relationship with the Addiction Potential Scale. While poorer self-esteem predicted greater scores on the Internet Related Problem Scale, impulsivity did not. Researchers need to re-assess previous conceptualizations of the typical “computer addict” as a highly educated, male introvert with a constant need for intellectual stimulation (Shotton, 1991).},

abstract = {The paper presents the design and evaluation of an adaptive signal processing procedure based on human skill. The focus is on interpreting probe signals detected in gas liquid flow in the presence of noise where existing signal interpretation techniques may encounter difficulties. Interpretation of a probe signal requires construction of a corresponding two-state signal that denotes the presence of the phases, i.e. gas and liquid, at the probe tip. To develop a computer procedure that would imitate a skilled operator in probe signal interpretation, manual knowledge acquisition and evolutionary optimization were employed. First, a prototype signal interpretation procedure based on operator skill was designed, and the procedure parameters were then optimized with a genetic algorithm. In the optimization process, a two-state signal reconstructed from the probe signal by an operator was used as a reference. The robustness of the approach was tested in a series of numerical experiments. They included local evaluation on training and test signals, calculation of global void fraction values, and an assessment of variability among different experts. The results showed that the developed technique is highly consistent with the operator way of signal interpretation and represents a reliable prerequisite for gas liquid flow measurements.},

abstract = {Natural language (NL) interfaces for database (DB) query formulation have always been recognized as a much-needed enhancement for DB end-users. NL systems, however, have shortcomings that have led some DB researchers to question their practicality. The drawbacks stem primarily from their weak interpretative power. This weakness is, to a large extent, due to their inability to deal with the nuances in human use of natural language. Some studies, however, show that NL database systems are practical and useful in narrow domains like DB querying. One way of addressing the difficulty with NL database query languages (DBQLs) is to combine concept-based DBQL paradigms with NL approaches to enhance the overall ease-of-use of the query interface. In this study, the conceptual query language-with-natural language (CQL/NL) is proposed. CQL/NL uses information extraction methods to filter NL query statements for search predicates that are derived from constructs on conceptual schemas. In this way, it avoids the computational difficulty with full-fledged NL parsing. In the main, we draw on certain concepts in natural language processing and computational linguistics to develop CQL/NL.},

abstract = {The challenge for the World Wide Web user is to discover and rediscover useful information from very rich but also very diversified sources in the Web environment. The Web browser is a key interface to facilitate Web information access. In this paper, a framework is proposed to identify and investigate key factors that determine the Web browser's ability to assist users in performing various information-retrieval tasks. Design guidelines to help overcome the limitations associated with human information processing and the Web environment are introduced. Based on these guidelines, an on-line history tool (MEMOS) is developed to support user browsing, organization, and rediscovery tasks in both intra- and inter-sessional information retrieval. Empirical tests of user performance with the MEMOS tool are analysed in the context of our framework. We show that the MEMOS tool was perceived to be more useful than the history mechanisms used in popular Web browsers, but its benefit was most significant for inter-sessional support. Using sessions previously saved through the MEMOS tool to tackle specific retrieval questions was significantly faster and more accurate than trying to use standard rediscovery methods.},

Little is known, however, about the factors that affect efficient and rapid acquisition of knowledge using this technology. Five experiments examined the influence of gender, passive/active navigation, cognitive style, hemispheric activation measured by electroencephalography and display information on the acquisition of two types of navigational knowledge using a VE: route and survey knowledge. Males acquired route knowledge from landmarks faster than females. In situations where survey knowledge must be used, proficiency in visual-spatial cognition is associated with better performance. The right cerebral hemisphere appears to be more activated than the left during navigational learning in a VE. In identifying cognitive factors that influence VE navigation, these results have a number of implications in the use of VEs for training purposes and may assist in linking processes involved in navigation to a more general framework of visual-spatial processing and mental imagery.},

abstract = {Within the field of multimedia there are few methods, criteria or standards for evaluating the experiential impact of a design. This paper offers six propositions for structure, causality, visibility and interaction, which appear to produce cognitive, emotive and sensory engagement in users' reactions to a narrative multimedia design. The developmental approach was phenomenological. The propositions derive from a focus group study in which 12 users played with four commercial computer games, then we (and they) analysed their reactions. Two observations from the study inform the morphology of narrative. Firstly, there is a fundamental conflict between narrative in its traditional form and interactivity, and secondly, the primal features of narrative causality, temporality and linearity are disrupted within a hyper structure. The first set of propositions suggests solutions for such conflicts. These are spatial containment, causality, and demands on user's skills. Further propositions for engaging interaction are causality of dialogue, apparent intelligence of the program and hiding the delivery medium.},

abstract = {This study examined whether people would interpret and respond to verbal (text) and non-verbal cues (posture) of personality in interactive characters just as they interpret cues from a person. In a balanced, between-subjects experiment (N=40), introverted and extroverted participants were randomly paired with one of two types of consistent computer characters: (1) matched participants' personality with both verbal and non-verbal cues or (2) completely mismatched the participant, or one of two types of inconsistent characters: (3) matched with verbal cues but not with non-verbal cues or (4) matched with non-verbal but not with verbal cues. Participants accurately identified the character's personality type in their assessment of its verbal and non-verbal cues. Preference was for consistent characters, regardless of participant personality. Consistent characters also had greater influence over peoples' behavior interaction with consistent characters led to greater changes in people's answers than interaction with inconsistent characters. Finally, contrary to previous research, participants tended to prefer a character whose personality was complementary, rather than similar, with their own. This study demonstrates the importance of orchestrating the overall set of cues that an interactive computer character presents to the computer user, and emphasizes the need for consistency among these cues.},

In the past, each has used case studies to describe and defend its point of view. However, comparisons are made difficult by the fact that these studies are usually based on different work settings. This paper describes the application of each framework to exactly the same setting. We believe our approach shows the features that are emphasized and those that are ignored in each framework, enabling us to differentiate their relevant questions. We discuss the effects of a theoretical filter on understanding the work setting, the differences in the concept of activity, the tools and interactions between humans and tools, the concept of representation, and we look at how a plurality of viewpoints may broaden any interpretation.},

abstract = {The idea for this paper came from a debate at the 1998 ISCRAT conference in Denmark on cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT). A leading activist in the movement to bring CHAT into systems design, Bonnie Nardi, asked the question; would design not benefit more from training better ethnographers than from burdening them with such a complex set of theoretical concepts and debates as CHAT__ __ This paper seeks to answer that question on the basis of our experiences applying CHAT concepts in a long-term design ethnography at a UK newspaper. It examines the history of the often controversial triadic relationship between ethnography, theory and systems design and argues that the CHAT framework provided us with the opportunity to move from ethnographic intuition to design insight, and that therefore the answer to Nardi's question is no simply training good ethnographers is unlikely to be enough for a number of reasons (not least of which is the problem of how inexperienced fieldworkers become design ethnographers). The explicit use of theoretical frameworks, at least those such as CHAT which are particularly suited to design issues, discourages the tendency for ethnographers to see themselves as “proxy users” by encouraging greater reflexivity about the researcher's role in constructing the object of study. At a more pragmatic level, it helps the fieldworker navigate the apparently never-ending mass of “potentially interesting material” any field experience throws up.},

abstract = {Why are developers, in many cases, unable to identify user problems, even when the information is ready and available? How do such miscommunication situations actually emerge and how could research and information technology help developers and users to overcome this problem? To tackle these questions, we examine a critical phase in the lifespan of a technological innovation: the transfer of a new medical technology from developers to users. Such a phase emerges especially in the early stages of implementation and diffusion, prior to the stabilization and expansion of user networks, and presupposes collaborative performance between otherwise loosely connected actors and activity systems. The innovation under scrutiny is a neuromagnetic measuring system (MEG), developed and manufactured by a Finnish start-up company. We use an activity-theoretical perspective in which the unit of analysis is a collective object-oriented activity system, a community of practitioners sharing a common object. Based on an analysis of a breakdown situation and the ensuing interactions between the users and the developers of the device, we present an enriched model of developmental contradictions in the implementation phase of the neuromagnetometer device. We argue that the anticipated outcome of the critical phase of the innovation process, the shift toward a mature customer-intelligent product driven by co-configuration work, will require a major effort to resolve developmental contradictions within and between the parties of the implementation process. As part of this re-mediation effort, shared meta-tools for dialogical diagnosis, problem solving and system redesign are needed. We suggest that these functions could conceivably be delegated to intelligent software agents, built into the MEG computer system, which would operate as boundary-crossing agents that facilitate interaction and mutual intelligibility between the perspectives of users and developers.},

These scenarios are distinctive in their repair costs and impacts and can be used to highlight the implications of design decisions in collaborative work settings.

abstract = {The underlying premise of this paper is that the defining constraint in the design of technology to enable people in different physical spaces to work together is the essential corporeality of human cognition. Its empirical basis is a long-term field study of cooperative design in a small distributed company. The paper is not a descriptive account of the work practices of the designers but instead structures the results of a field study in such a way that they might bridge, or reduce, the gap between the description of the work and the design of technology to support that work. The central conclusion from the field study was that the cooperative design of a software product was enabled and achieved by the work the designers did communicating with each other. The basic argument of this paper is that what needs to be supported, mediated and enabled by CSCW technology used to support cooperative design over distance is the mutual perception, for the actor and others, of the embodied actions of the participants in the process. These actions are considered as classes of cognitive practices that are simultaneously available to perceptions of the actor and others in a shared physical workspace. The public availability of these actions to the perceptions of the participants in a cooperative process enables their communicative functions. A taxonomy of embodied actions is defined that identifies and describes the embodied actions of the designers that enabled a cooperative design process. It is presented as a bridging structure between the field study of cooperative work and the design of technology that might support that work over distance.},

abstract = {The methods of ethnography and cognitive psychology are frequently set in opposition to each other. Whilst such a view may be appropriate in defining pure, or prototypical, classes of each activity, the value and necessity of such a distinction is broken down when researchers are goal-directed to study complex work domains in order to foster technological change. In this paper, we outline a rapprochement of these methods, which we term cognitive ethnography. The value of qualifying ethnography in this way is to emphasize systematically the differences between ethnography as a radial category and the kinds of legitimate method used to study work practices which are often referred to as ethnographic, but which in practice differ in important ways from prototypical ethnographic studies. Features of cognitive ethnography such as observational specificity, verifiability and purposivenes challenge many of the tenets of a pure ethnographic method, yet they are essential for studies that are undertaken to inform technological change. We illustrate our arguments with reference to a project to develop a tool for supporting design re-use in innovative design environments.},

abstract = {Studying the organization of work has become an important element in the design of systems and artefacts for work settings. However, although studies of work have had an influence on design, there is still some concern about the nature of the relationship between the study of work and design. Concern has been variously expressed in terms of gaps between social science and systems engineering, formality and informality, prescription and negotiation and there have been a number of attempts to bridge those gaps. In contrast, the aim of this paper is to re-view the gap and to characterize it in such a way that bridging may not be an issue. This requires a reconceptualization of the relationship between designing artefacts and understanding work. Using Bateson's levels of analysis, an account of the paradox of framing the study of work by the norms and expectations of a rationalist approach to design, exemplified by software engineering, is developed. The study of work is characterized as inevitably involving self-referential observation and inscription, characteristics which create paradox when framed by the demands of rationalist design. However, Bateson's treatment of paradox allows us to see this relationship, not as a gap to be bridged, but as an opportunity to create new forms of punctuation for design, studying work, and relations between them. Many current attempts to reconceptualize design and its relationship with understanding work emphasize the dialogical aspects of practice and theory. Bakhtin's philosophy is used here to advance consideration of the dialogical aspects of “understanding work for design” with particular reference to the use of representations such as scenarios. A critique of exemplar representations is used to exemplify dimensions, such as addressivity and unfinalisability, that would characterize a dialogical punctuation of understanding work and design.},

abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that human, social, and political factors have a significant impact on software systems design. To address this, ethnographic studies of work have been used to inform the systems design process, especially in cooperative work settings where systems support several users working together. Based on our experience of these studies, we have investigated the integration of social analysis into the systems design process by developing an integrated approach to social and object-oriented analysis. New methods are unlikely to be adopted in industry unless they can be integrated with existing practice. Our approach, called Coherence, addresses this issue by helping identify use cases, generating initial use case models, and by using the Unified Modelling Language (UML) to represent social aspects of work that may have an impact on the design of computer-based systems. Coherence is the fusion of two well-established strands of research on ethnographically informed design and viewpoint-oriented requirements engineering. This paper introduces Coherence, and focuses on the support provided for social analysis. We have identified three social viewpoints, namely a distributed coordination viewpoint, a plans and procedures viewpoint and an awareness of work viewpoint. Coherence is illustrated using a case study based on an air traffic control system.},

We present an integrated process involving evaluation of usability, attractiveness and feature contribution, the latter two being the focus. To illustrate attractiveness evaluation, we assess whether CODE4 has met its objective of having users not trained in logical formalisms choose the tool to represent and manipulate knowledge in a computer. By studying use of the tool by its intended users, we conclude that it has met this objective. To illustrate feature contribution evaluation, we assess what aspects of CODE4 have in fact led to its success. To do this, we study what tasks are performed by users, and what features of both knowledge representation and user interface are exercised. We find that features for manipulating the inheritance hierarchy and naming concepts are considered the most valuable. Our overall conclusion is that those developing or researching CTAs would benefit from using the three types of evaluation in order to make effective decisions about the evolution of their products.},

This research assesses two training methods that can be used to help teleworkers develop skill sets for using these technologies. The results suggest that using a game-based training method facilitates the training process by increasing users' intrinsic motivation resulting in increased intention to use the technology. This can be particularly important in enhancing the effective completion of team and individual telework while at the same time providing a mechanism to minimize teleworkers social isolation.},

This article reviews a representative calculator that is “state of the art” and shows it has an execrable design. The design is shown to be confusing and essentially non-mathematical. Substantial evidence is presented that illustrates the inadequate documentation, bad implementation, feature interaction, and feature incoherence. These problems are shown to be typical of calculators generally. Despite the domain (arithmetic) being well defined, the design problems are profound, widespread, confusing and needless. Worrying questions are begged: about design quality control, about consumer behaviour, and about the role of education both at school level (training children to acquiesce to bad design) and at university level (training professionals to design unusable products).

Tracking head movements is important in the design of an eye-controlled human/computer interface. A vision-based head tracking system is proposed to allow the user's head movements in the design of the eye-controlled human/computer interface. We propose an efficient camera calibration method to track the three-dimensional position and orientation of the user's head accurately. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed method and the influence of the configuration of calibration points on the performance. The experimental error analysis results showed that the proposed method can provide more accurate and stable pose (i.e. position and orientation) of the camera than the direct linear transformation method which has been used in camera calibration. The results for this study can be applied to the tracking of head movements related to the eye-controlled human/computer interface and the virtual reality technology.},

Consequently, an extensive literature exists concerning the technical means of virus prevention, detection and disinfection. By contrast, in this paper we consider the human dimensions and implications behind the invention and release of computer viruses. We examine and discuss some possible conscious motivations: these include political, commercial and malicious. However, the paper is also concerned with unconscious motivations and goes on to look at possible meanings for these disruptive activities from within a psychodynamic framework based on the work of Melanie Klein. The paper draws upon previously published information about viruses and their makers in order to furnish material for these discussions. Of equal import in understanding the effect that virus infection has upon computer users. A personal anecdote illustrates the disruption to peace of mind brought about simply by the fear of virus infection. We conclude that virus creation means different things for different perpetrators, but that generally it is a destructive act aimed at dismantling what is apparently `whole and satisfactory. This reflects the reality that human life involves a constant struggle with processes of destructiveness as well as creativity. Paradoxically, the orderly, constructed world may become stronger through the process of learning and defending against each new virus, but this strengthening of defences may itself inflame the problem. We conclude by considering some concrete consequences for computer users, and areas for future investigation.},

abstract = {The importance of overhearing, and other ways of monitoring communicative behaviour not explicitly directed at oneself, has been illustrated in numerous ethnographic studies of computer-supported cooperative work. This paper is concerned with a particular form of monitoring. A “peripheral participant” is defined as someone who has a legitimate interest in monitoring a joint task (being carried out by some “primary participants”) but who is not actively involved in carrying out the task themselves. The concept is illustrated through field studies of telemedical consultation and related to other analyses of overhearing. Two experiments are reported where participatory status was manipulated using a role-play task. Ratings of interpersonal awareness, measures of gaze direction and recall of the conversation all indicate that the task successfully operationalized the distinction between primary and peripheral participation. In addition, the experiment manipulated the visibility of the peripheral participant to a remote primary participant. This was shown to have an effect on the remote primary participant's interpersonal awareness of the peripheral participant. Potential mechanisms for this effect are considered. It is concluded that peripheral participation is a potentially important form of involvement that needs to be considered when designing and configuring equipment for video-mediated cooperative work.},

By performing laboratory experiments using MIS major students, quality was evaluated on five constructs of a data model (i.e. entity/object, descriptor, identifier, relationship and generalization hierarchy) and six facets of a relationship (i.e. unary one-to-one, unary one-to-many, binary one-to-one, binary one-to-many, binary many-to-many and ternary many-to-many-to-many).The research focused on two major issues: data model design and data model conversion. The first issue investigated the differences in user performance between the RM, the EERM and the OOM. The second investigated the differences in user performance between the RM and the relational conversions of the EERM and the OOM models. For the first issue, EERM and OOM scored much higher than the RM in correctness scores of binary one-to-many and binary many-to-many relationships, but only the EERM led to significance. The RM and OOM scored much higher than EERM for unary one-to-one relationships, however, only the RM resulted in significance. The OOM required significantly less time for task completion than EERM. For the second issue, RM and the relational conversion of OOM scored significantly higher than the relational conversion of EERM for unary one-to-one relationships.},

Experimental and post hoc survey research methodologies have typically used a large number of variables to record search activity. However, as these are usually considered in aggregate, there is little opportunity for the researcher to overview the search style of a consumer. To date, the diagrammatic illustration of search behaviour has been limited to experimental environments in which the available information was strictly bounded, for example, within databases or when information display boards have been used. This paper, which focuses largely on inter-site world wide web (WWW) search behaviour, discusses web search paradigms and the variables used to capture WWW search. It also provides a conceptual framework for the representation of external information search behaviour in diagrammatic form. The technique offers researchers an opportunity to holistically interpret information search data and search styles. The benefits include the identification of particular search styles, more precise interpretation of web search activity numeric data and the potential application for the training of web users to improve their search effectiveness.},

abstract = {Functional programming presents new challenges in the design of programming environments. In a strongly typed functional language, such as ML, much conventional debugging of runtime errors is replaced by dealing with compile-time error reports. On the other hand, the cleanness of functional programming opens up new possibilities for incorporating sophisticated correctness-checking techniques into such environments. CYNTHIA is a novel editor for ML that both addresses the challenges and explores the possibilities. It uses an underlying proof system as a framework for automatically checking for semantic errors such as non-termination. In addition, CYNTHIA embodies the idea of programming by analogy whereby users write programs by applying abstract transformations to existing programs. This paper investigatesCYNTHIA 's potential as a novice ML programming environment. We report on two studies in which it was found that students using CYNTHIA commit fewer errors and correct errors more quickly than when using a compiler/text editor approach.},

The first experiment examined the potential of this multimodal combination to increase performance by engaging concurrent multiple resources. Speech and mouse responses were compared when using menu and direct (toolbar icon) commands, making for a fairer comparison than in previous research which has been biased against the mouse. Only a limited basis for concurrent resource use was found, with speech leading to poorer task performance with both command types. Task completion times were faster with direct commands for both speech and mouse responses, and direct commands were preferred. In the second experiment, participants were free to choose command type, and nearly always chose to use direct commands with both response modes. Speech performance was again worse than mouse, except for tasks which involved a large amount of hand and eye movement, or where direct speech wasused but mouse commands were made via menus. In both experiments recognition errors were low, and although they had some detrimental effect on speech use, problems in combining speech and manual modes were highlighted. Potential verbal interference effects when using speech are discussed.},

abstract = {The division of labour, in its turn, implies interaction; for it consists not in the sheer difference of one man's kind of work from that another, but in the fact that the different tasks and accomplishments are parts of a whole to whose product all, in some degree, contribute. And wholes, in the human social realm as in the rest of the biological and in the physical realm, have their essence in interaction. Work as social interaction is the central theme of sociological and social psychological study of work.Hughes (1958)In an interaction with a computer the user receives information that is output by the computer, and responds by providing input to the computer the user's output becomes the computer's input and vice versa.Dix, Finlay, Abowd and Beale (1993, p. 11)In this paper, we examine the details of the use of a computer system in situ. Drawing from recent developments in the social sciences, we adopt an analytic orientation that is distinctive from much current work in human computer interaction and cognitive engineering. Rather than focusing on a circumscribed activity of an individual at a computer system, we explore how the production of computer-based activities is sensitive to the ongoing work and interaction of the participants in the setting. The study utilizes materials including fieldwork and audio-visual recordings to explore how one particular technology is used, a system for automatically controlling trains on an urban transportation system. We focus on the “uses” of this system, a fairly conventional command-and-control system, in the Control Room, and examine how the technology is immersed within the action and interaction of the participants. In particular, we explore how the entry of commands into the system by one controller is coordinated with the conduct of colleagues, and how their conduct is inextricably embedded in their colleague's use of the system. It also reveals how the activities of controllers are managed from moment to moment, so that a division of labour emerges through the course of their interaction. Although in drawing upon naturalistic materials, this study contributes to the growing corpus of “workplace studies” within the field of computer-supported cooperative work, by examining the details of computer-based activities it continues the tradition within human-computer interaction of being concerned with the detailed use of technologies. Indeed, the emerging distinction between the two fields, one considered as focusing on matters associated with the individual “user”, and the other on the “group”, may be false.},

The present analysis found positive support for the influence of all nine variables on end-user IT satisfaction but to varying degrees. The most significant relationships were found to be user involvement in systems development, perceived usefulness, user experience, organizational support and user attitude toward the IS. This has implications for IS analysis and design as well as user training and the development of training support packages.},

Results indicated that making participants accountable for either their overall performance or their decision accuracy led to lower rates of “automation bias”.

This common and seemingly intuitive practice (it “reads”, “writes”, “thinks”, “is friendly”, “catches and transmits viruses”, etc.) has become the standard by which we formulate our daily communications, and often our formal training mechanisms, with regard to the technology. Both anecdotal and empirical sources have reported numerous scenarios in which computers have played a noticeably social role, thus being positioned more as a social actor than as a machine or “neutral tool.” In these accounts, human behavior has ranged from making social reference to the device (“It's really much smarter than me,”), to more overt social interactions including conversational interplay and display of common human emotions in response to an interaction. Drawing from behavioral psychology and attribution theory, a theoretical model of the phenomenon is offered from which several propositions are advanced regarding the nature of the behavior, positive and negative implications associated with extended use of this metaphor, and recommendations for research into this ubiquitous social phenomena. I have encountered these situations before, and in every case they were the result of human error.-HAL 9000 from Arthur C. Clarke's 2001: A Space Odyssey},

The approach we propose makes it possible to analyze an explain in a uniform way several apparently unrelated linguistic phenomena, which have been often studied separately and treated via ad-hoc methods in the models of dialogue presented in the literature. Our model of linguistic interaction is based on the idea that dialogue can be seen as any other interaction among agents: therefore, domain-level and linguistic actions are treated in a similar way.Our agent architecture is based on a two-level representation of the knowledge about acting: at the metalevel, the agent modelling (AM) plans describe the recipes for plan formation and execution (they are a declarative representation of a reactive planner); at the object level, the domain and communicative actions are defined. The AM plans are used to identify the goals underlying the actions performed by an observed agent; the recognized plans constitute the dialogue context, where the intentions of all participants are stored in a structured way, in order to be used in the interpretation of the subsequent dialogue turns.},

In this study, the definition of browsing combines aspects of both concepts to define browsing as an activity in which one gathers information while scanning an information space without an explicit purpose. The objective of this research was to examine how browsers interact with their browsing environment while manipulating two types of interface tools constructed from the content.Forty-seven adults (24 males) performed the two types of tasks (one with no purpose and the second, a control, purposeful) in four sessions over a period of four weeks. Participants scanned and/or searched the textual content of current issue plus three months of back issues of the Halifax Chronicle Herald/Mail Star using a system designed specifically for this research. At any one time only one of each type of tool was available.Those with no assigned goal examined significantly more articles and explored more menu options. They made quick decisions about which articles to examine, spending twice as much time reading the content. They tended not to explore the newspaper to a great extent, examining only 24% of the articles in a single issue. About three-quarters of what they examined was new information on topics that they had not known about before being exposed to the paper. The type of menu had no impact on performance, but differences were discovered between the two items-to-browse tools. Those with no goal selected more articles from the Suggestions and found more interesting articles when the Suggestions were available.},

abstract = {This study aims at identifying the optimal link structure, which is an essential requirement for convenient and pleasant cyber shopping. To achieve the goal, this paper presents a research framework in which different types of links are hypothesized to cause different patterns of customer navigation, which in turn is expected to influence cognitive convenience and emotional pleasure of cyber shopping. Based on two dimensions of links, link direction and link target, various links are classified into five types; NBR (Neighbourhood), PAR (Parent), TOP, NEP (Nephew), and IND (Index). Two consecutive experiments were conducted in order to evaluate the cognitive and emotional usability of various combinations of the five link types. Experimental results clearly indicated that different combinations of link types influenced customers' navigation patterns, which in turn had effects on the convenience and pleasure of shopping. It was found that the combination of NBR, TOP and IND generated the optimal link structure, whereas PAR and NEP rather decreased the degree of shopping pleasure and convenience. This paper concludes with its limitations and implications on the construction of effective cyber shopping malls.},

In contrast, side effects such as sickness may be produced in some virtual environments, detracting from the enjoyment or usefulness of the VE and from subsequent performance of the participant. Both presence and sickness in virtual environments are multifactorial phenomena not easily amenable to understanding or measurement. The first experiment reported here compares use of direct performance measures and rating scales to assess presence, whilst varying the VE display medium (head mounted and desktop displays) and whether or not sound was used in the VE. The second experiment addresses associations between presence, sickness and enjoyment of virtual environment participation. There was enough comparability between a reflex response within the VE and the rating scales to justify future exploration of the former measure of presence. A number of explanations are given for the partial association found between presence and sickness.},

abstract = {The motivation for the work reported in this paper is the belief that not only is it beneficial to reuse knowledge but it is essential if we wish to build knowledge-based systems (KBS) that meet the needs of users. The focus of most KBS research is on complex modelling at the knowledge level which requires a knowledge engineer to act as the intermediary between the expert and the system. The type of reuse primarily considered is the reuse of ontologies or problem-solving methods so that improvements can be made in system quality and development time. However, there is little focus on the needs of users to access the knowledge in a variety of ways according to the individual's decision style or situation. The system described in this paper seeks to support the user in a number of different activities including knowledge acquisition, inferencing, maintenance, tutoring, critiquing, “what-if” analysis, explanation and modelling. The ability to ask different types of questions and to explore the knowledge in alternative ways is a different type of knowledge reuse. The knowledge acquisition and representation technique used as the foundation is known as ripple-down rules (RDR). To support the exploration activities, RDR have been combined with formal concept analysis which automatically generates an abstraction hierarchy from the low-level RDR assertions. The paper suggests that rapid and incremental KA together with retrospective modelling can be used to provide the user with a system that they can own, build and explore without the difficulties associated with capturing and validating the conceptual models of experts via the mediation of a knowledge engineer.},

The information that can be extracted from the textual event stream is compared to that which can be deduced from a comparison of the candidate's submitted answer with the model answer(s) generated by the examiner. For many examinations, document comparison is simpler and more efficient than event stream analysis but it is not always possible to fully analyse errors from document comparison; hence a mixture of document comparison and event stream analysis is desirable for computer-based word-processing assessment.},

abstract = {The development of highly effective heuristics for search problems is a difficult and time-consuming task. We present a knowledge acquisition approach to incrementally model expert search processes. Though, experts do not normally have complete introspective access to that knowledge, their explanations of actual search considerations seem very valuable in constructing a knowledge-level model of their search processes.Furthermore, for the basis of our knowledge acquisition approach, we substantially extend the work done on Ripple-down rules which allows knowledge acquisition and maintenance without analysis or a knowledge engineer. This extension allows the expert to enter his domain terms during the KA process; thus the expert provides a knowledge-level model of his search process. We call this framework nested ripple-down rules.Our approach targets the implicit representation of the less clearly definable quality criteria by allowing the expert to limit his input to the system to explanations of the steps in the expert search process. These explanations are expressed in our search knowledge interactive language. These explanations are used to construct a knowledge base representing search control knowledge. We are acquiring the knowledge in the context of its use, which substantially supports the knowledge acquisition process. Thus, in this paper, we will show that it is possible to build effective search heuristics efficiently at the knowledge level. We will discuss how our system SmS1.3 (SmS for Smart Searcher) operates at the knowledge level as originally described by Newell. We complement our discussion by employing SmS for the acquisition of expert chess knowledge for performing a highly pruned tree search. These experimental results in the chess domain are evidence for the practicality of our approach.},

abstract = {The aim of the paper is to discuss the use of knowledge models to formulate general applications. First, the paper presents the recent evolution of the software field where increasing attention is paid to conceptual modelling. Then, the current state of knowledge modelling techniques is described where increased reliability is available through the modern knowledge-acquisition techniques and supporting tools. The knowledge structure manager (KSM) tool is described next. First, the concept of knowledge area is introduced as a building block where methods to perform a collection of tasks are included together with the bodies of knowledge providing the basic methods to perform the basic tasks. Then, the CONCEL language to define vocabularies of domains and the LINK language for methods formulation are introduced. Finally, the object-oriented implementation of a knowledge area is described and a general methodology for application design and maintenance supported by KSM is proposed. To illustrate the concepts and methods, an example of system for intelligent traffic management in a road network is described. This example is followed by a proposal of generalization for reuse of the resulting architecture. Finally, some concluding comments are made regarding the feasibility of using the knowledge modelling tools and methods for general application design.},

abstract = {Three important factors that determine user performance during database retrieval are representation realism, expressive ease, and task complexity. Representation realism is the level of abstraction used when formulating queries. Expressive ease is the syntactic flexibility permitted when formulating queries. Task complexity is the level of difficulty of queries. A controlled laboratory experiment was conducted to assess the effects of these three factors on user productivity during database retrieval. The independent variables were representation realism (high versus low), expressive ease (high versus low), and query complexity (simple versus complex). The dependent variables were query accuracy and query time. Results show that all these three factors significantly affected user performance during database retrieval. However, their relative impact on query accuracy and query time differed. Moreover, these factors interacted in unique ways to moderate query accuracy and query time. Besides verifying prior empirical findings, these results offer several suggestions for future research and development work in the area of database retrieval.},

abstract = {One of the most difficult problems in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is to construct a natural language processing system which can interact with users through a natural language dialogue. The problem is difficult because there are so many ways by which a user can phrase his/her utterances to such a system. An added problem is that different types of users have different types of intentions and will conduct different exchanges with the system. While many have proposed theories and models of the processing of intentions in dialogue, few of these have been incorporated within working systems and tested empirically. Here, an experiment is conducted to test what we call the Intention-Computer Hypothesis: that the analysis of intention in natural-language dialogue facilitates effective natural-language dialogue between different types of people and a computer. The experiment provides evidence to support the hypothesis. In turn, the hypothesis provides evidence for a theory of intention analysis for natural-language dialogue processing. A central principle of the theory is that coherence of natural-language dialogue can be modelled by analysing sequences of intention. A computational model, called Operating System CONsultant (OSCON), implemented in Quintus Prolog, makes use of the theory and hypothesis to understand, and answer in English, English questions about computer operating system.},

abstract = {In experimental studies on query languages, subjects are required to write queries using different query languages. User query performance is usually measured by query accuracy. There is no clearly defined objective method of applying findings to other queries. This study examines the suitability of using a software metric based on lines of code to estimate user query accuracy. Lines of code have been measured in various ways, such as physical source code lines, logical source code lines or compiled bytes. A method of counting lines of code for database queries is proposed and applied to two query languages. The new method counts Boolean conditions as well as other statements. The relationship between lines of code and user query accuracy was examined with regression models. The results show that lines of code can explain a high percentage of the variance in accuracy, with R2&gt;0.8 for the standard relational model query language SQL, and R2&gt;0.9 for the entity relationship model query language KQL. The common assumption that more lines of code will lead to lower accuracy is only partly validated. The findings show a nonlinear relationship, with a possible recovery in accuracy for queries with many lines of code. The results indicate that lines of code can be usefully applied in the study of query languages.},

abstract = {With the proliferation of large, complex software systems, reuse of previous software designs and software artifacts, such as operation concepts, requirements, specifications and source code, is an important issue for both industry and government. Reuse has long been expected to result in substantial productivity and quality gains. To date, this expectation has been largely unmet. One reason may be the lack of tools to support software reuse.This research proposes the development of one such tool, the Design Browser. The Design Browser is a software architecture intended to support designers of large software systems in the early stages of software design, specifically conceptual design. The Design Browser is based on principles derived from cognitive engineering (e.g. Woods &amp; Roth, 1988 a); naturalistic decision-making, particularly Klein's (1989) recognition-primed decision making model; and Kolodner's (1993) approach to case-based reasoning.As a proof-of-concept demonstration, the Design Browser was implemented for a NASA satellite control sub-system the command management system (CMS). An empirical evaluation was conducted. It used the CMS Design Browser and participants who were part of the three user groups often involved in large-scale commercial software development. These groups are the software design team, the users and management. The results of the evaluation show that all three groups found the CMS Design Browser quite useful as demonstrated by actual performance and subjective rating.},

Participants in non-automated settings out-performed their counterparts with a very but not perfectly reliable automated aid on a monitoring task. Participants with an aid made errors of omission (missed events when not explicitly prompted about them by the aid) and commission (did what an automated aid recommended, even when it contradicted their training and other 100% valid and available indicators).

abstract = {Hypermedia systems and knowledge systems can be viewed as flip-sides of the same coin. The former are designed to convey information and the latter to solve problems; developments beyond the basic techniques of each system type requires techniques from the other type. In this paper, we introduce the concept of knowledge-based or intelligent hypermedia and analyse various constellations of merged hypermedia and knowledge systems. A hypermedia system deals with informal and formalized theories and the relations between and within these. Therefore, the corner stones of our analysis are the very basic notions involved in formalizing domain knowledge: an informal domain theory, a formal object theory axiomatizing the informal theory and a metatheory analysing the properties and interrelations between and within these. We integrate these notions into a system architecture which is to serve as a programmable system schema for supporting the composition of actual intelligent hypermedia systems. Programming in the large is supported by the schema which defines the overall system structure whereas programming in the small is supported by knowledge modelling techniques. The application of the system architecture is illustrated by the construction of an interactive diagnosis system which involves knowledge-based reasoning both for navigation in hyperspace and problem-solving within the domain.},

In our work, we have been investigating another potential use for PSMs, namely, supporting the redesign of systems that fail to exhibit the behaviours desired of them, that is, behaviours similar to, but slightly different from, the ones they were originally designed to exhibit. To this end, we have defined a PSM modeling language and a failure-driven redesign process based on this language, both of which were implemented in the A UTOGNOSTIC system. In this paper, we report on a sequence of experiments performed with A UTOGNOSTIC. Some of them were exploratory and their goal was to enable the precise characterization of issues relating to the problem of system redesign, while others were designed to evaluate the PSM language and the redesign process implemented in A UTOGNOSTIC.},

The organization of the library and its deployment processes are then briefly introduced. Taking account of the recurring modification of the library, the stability and productivity are investigated with respect to the code-size changes and the number of person-hours spent on the maintenance. Finally, it is concluded that the stability of a domain model is ensured by module dependency, and facilitates productive reuse of the domain-oriented library.},

GivenPre-disaster knowledge, a CSM can be used while the expert system is in routine use, without compromising the operation of the system. A general CSM experiment is defined using pre-disaster points which can compare (e.g.) human to expert system performance.

In this paper, the validation field is briefly surveyed, and we take a look at what the validation process should consist of. Then, an analytical model is proposed for obtaining the optimum number of test cases for validating the knowledge-based system under study. This mathematical model takes into account the v-type (knowledge-based system classed according to the validation process) defined in this paper, the expected degree of confidence in the validation process and previous results from similar knowledge-based system validation processes. It should be mentioned here that a theoretical result is given to solve eminently practical problem, a rare occurrence in the field of artificial intelligence as a whole and especially in knowledge engineering.},

In developing Knowledge Technology for these areas, methods from knowledge engineering are being explored. Our main work in this area has involved the application and evaluation of existing knowledge for a large intranet system. This, and other case studies, have provided important lessons and insights which have led to ongoing research in ontologies, generic models and process modelling methods.

The library system supports personal websites that are visible to the entire organization. Personal topic profiles for library research services, information services choice and collaborative research requests provide employees with views of each others' activities and interests. In particular, information about research questions being asked across all parts of the organization provides a unique window on the company's goals and activities. Collaboration and interest-matching tools help employees to share knowledge across the oraganization and to form special interest communities.},

abstract = {The communicative act in a learning organization is subject to a number of threats to its validity (Habermas, 1981), in particular the comprehensibility, truth, trustworthiness and appropriateness of a given message. Organizational memories (OMs) can be used to address these threats. Our focus is on email communication, which suffers from the same threats identified by Habermas. The integration of email with on OM can improve the quality of communication by applying meta-knowledge to appropriately link a given message to the OM. In this paper, we expand upon the direction taken by earlier work of Abecker et al. (1997) with respect to the importance of the object-meta relationship and the use of meta-knowledge to manage (or rather to complete) an OM. We suggest that the focus of the meta-knowledge in an email application, should be on the roles, perspectives, and characteristics of the people in an organization rather than on knowledge description. This, we argue, will effectively ensure that knowledge will not be disassociated from the people and the situation (Sierhuis &amp; Clancey, 1997). We present the HyperMail architecture and sample application to illustrate how formal meta-knowledge is used to re-associate informal email communications to an OM.},

Some examples from manufacturing industry are outlined. The paper then discusses some classifications of knowledge, points out some management issues and then discusses what appears to be emerging “best practice” in this field. Implications for organizational configurations are then outlined. Finally, a list of outstanding issues is given. This discussion is based on interviews and findings from a number of collaborative projects in the European automotive industry over the past decade.},

A more effective paradigm may be to use the semantics of the application domain itself to govern access to an expert system's knowledge base. This approach has been explored in a program called OPAL, which allows medical specialists working alone to enter and review cancer treatment plans for use by an expert system called ONCOCIN. Knowledge-acquisition tools based on strong domain models should be useful in application areas whose structure is well understood and for which there is a need for repetitive knowledge entry.},

Aquinas, an expanded version of the Expertise Transfer System (ETS), is a knowledge-acquisition workbench that combines ideas from psychology and knowledge-based systems research to support knowledge-acquisition tasks. These tasks include eliciting distinctions, decomposing problems, combining uncertain information, incremental testing, integration of data types, automatic expansion and refinement of the knowledge base, use of multiple sources of knowledge and providing process guidance. Aquinas interviews experts and helps them analyse, test, and refine the knowledge base. Expertise from multiple experts or other knowledge sources can be represented and used separately or combined. Results from user consultations are derived from information propagated through hierarchies. Aquinas delivers knowledge by creating knowledge bases for several different expert-system shells. Help is given to the expert by a dialog manager that embodies knowledge-acquisition heuristics.Aquinas contains many techniques and tools for knowledge acquisition; the techniques combine to make it a powerful testbed for rapidly prototyping portions of many kinds of complex knowledge-based systems.},

abstract = {An empirical study was performed to train naive subjects in the use of a prototype Boolean logic-based information retrieval system on a database of bibliographic records. The research was based on the mental models theory which proposes that people can be trained to develop a `mental model or a qualitative simulation of a system which will aid in generating methods for interacting with the system, debugging errors, and keeping track of one's place in the system. It follows that conceptual training based on a system model will be superior to procedural training based on the mechanics of the system. We performed a laboratory experiment with two training conditions (model and procedural), and with each condition split by sex. Forty-three subjects participated in the experiment, but only 32 were able to reach the minimum competency level required to complete the experiment. The data analysis incorporated time-stamped monitoring data, personal characteristics variables, affective variables, and interview data in which subjects described how they thought the system worked (an articulation of the model). As predicted, the model-based training had no effect on the ability to perform simple, procedural tasks, but subjects trained with a model performed better on complex tasks that required extrapolation from the basic operations of the system. A stochastic process analysis of search-state transitions reinforced this conclusion. Subjects had difficulty articulating a model of the system, and we found no differences in articulation by condition. The high number of subjects (26%) who were unable to pass the benchmark test indicates that the retrieval tasks were inherently difficult. More interestingly, those who dropped out were significantly more likely to be humanities or social science majors than science or engineering majors, suggesting important individual differences and equity issues. The sex-related differences were slight, although significant, and suggest future research questions.},

Some theorists have adopted an “operational” approach, focusing on the manifest effects of suggesting metaphoric comparisons to learners. Some have resolved the question formally into a “structural” definition of metaphor. However, structural and operation approaches typically ignore the goal-directed learner-initiated learning process through which metaphors become relevant and effective in learning. Taking this process seriously affords an analysis of metaphor that explains why metaphors are intrinsically open-ended and how their open-endedness stimulates the construction of mental models.},

There has thus been some debate in the field about the need for and role of “deep” knowledge in the design of expert systems. It is often argued that this underlying deep knowledge will enable an expert system to solve hard problems. In this paper we consider diagnostic expert systems and argue that given a body of underlying knowledge that is relevant to diagnostic reasoning in a medical domain, it is possible to create a diagnostic problem-solving structure which has all the aspects of the underlying knowledge needed for diagnostic reasoning “compiled” into it. It is argued this compiled structure can solve all the diagnostic problems in its scope efficiently, without any need to access the underlying structures. We illustrate such a diagnostic structure by reference to our medical system MDX. We also analyze the use of these knowledge structures in providing explanations of diagnostic reasoning.},

In contrast to traditional approaches to the study of man machine systems which mainly operate on the physical and physiological level, CSE operates on the level of cognitive functions. Instead of viewing an MMS as decomposable by mechanistic principles, CSE introduces the concept of a cognitive system: an adaptive system which functions using knowledge about itself and the environment in the planning and modification of actions. Operators are generally acknowledged to use a model of the system (machine) with which they work. Similarly, the machine has an image of the operator. The designer of an MMS must recognize this, and strive to obtain a match between the machine's image and the user characteristics on a cognitive level, rather than just on the level of physical functions. This article gives a presentation of what cognitive systems are, and of how CSE can contribute to the design of an MMS, from cognitive task analysis to final evaluation.},

abstract = {It has long been recognized that in order to build a good system in which a person and a machine cooperate to perform a task it is important to take into account some significant characteristics of people. These characteristics are used to build some kind of a “user model”. Traditionally, the model that is built is a model of a canonical (or typical) user. But often individual users vary so much that a model of a canonical user is insufficient. Instead, models of individual users are necessary. This article presents some examples of situations in which individual user models are important. It also presents some techniques that make the construction and use of such models possible. These techniques all reflect a desire to place most of the burden of constructing the models on the system, rather than on the user. This leads to the development of models that are collections of good guesses about the user. Thus some kind of probabilistic reasoning is necessary. And as the models are being used to guide the underlying system, they must also be monitored and updated as suggested by the interactions between the user and the system. The performance of one system that uses some of these techniques is discussed.},

A notional machine is the idealized model of the computer implied by the constructs of the programming language. Visibility is concerned with methods for viewing selected parts and processes of this notional machine in action. We introduce the term “commentary” which is the system's dynamic characterization of the notional machine, expressed in either text or pictures on the user's terminal. We examine the simplicity and visibility of three systems, each designed to provide programming experience to different populations of novices.},

Verbal data cannot therefore be used to test theories of mental behaviour. Verbal data may be produced by a separate report generating process which may give a distorted account. The data can be useful for practical purposes if these distortions are minimal. This paper attempts to assess the conditions in which this is the case. Several methods of obtaining verbal reports are surveyed: system state/action state diagram, questionnaire, interview, static simulation and verbal protocol. Techniques for collecting and analysing the data are described. In each case the small amount of data available on the correlation between reports and observed behaviour are reviewed. The results are not clear. Some verbal data are evidently misleading. Others, however, are sufficiently good to encourage the search for more information about factors affecting their validity.},

The former is easier for unskilled subjects. Possible reasons for this finding are discussed.},

abstract = {In order for comparative studies of programming languages to be meaningful, differences between the languages need to be carefully studied and well understood. Languages that appear to differ only in syntax (for example, visual vs. textual syntax) may in fact differ greatly in usability. Such differences can confound comparative studies unless they are controlled for. In this paper, we examine the usefulness of fine-grained task modeling for studying the usability of programming languages. We focus on program entry, and demonstrate how to create models of program entry tasks for both visual and textual languages. We also demonstrate how to derive performance time estimates from the models using keystroke-level analysis. A by-product of the model building is a collection of functional-level models that can serve as building blocks for modeling higher-level visual programming tasks. We then report on a comparative study of languages with the same semantics but different syntax (visual and textual). Model-based time predictions of program entry tasks were compared to observed times from an empirical study. The time estimates for the visual condition greatly overestimated the observed times. The primary source of the overestimates appeared to be the time estimate for pointing with the mouse. We then look at three different approaches to improving program entry models. We report on a separate study to calibrate the mouse-pointing time estimate, and demonstrate improved correlation between predicted and observed times with the new estimate. We also apply task modeling to program editing activities, in order to model error recovery behavior during program entry. Finally, we discuss language-specific customization of the keystroke-level operator for mental preparation. We conclude that task modeling is a useful technique for studying differences in the usability of programming languages at the keystroke level.},

In particular, the question was whether novices' mental representations focus more on domain-level or program-level knowledge and whether the mental representation of object-oriented program differ from procedural programs. The experiment indicated that novices tend to develop a mental representation of small object-oriented programs strong in function-related knowledge, but weaker in data flow and program-related knowledge. By contrast, novices' mental representations of small procedural programs were stronger in program-related knowledge. The results are discussed in terms of theories of program comprehension and programming pedagogy.},

The results of the observation are also interpreted in terms of the information needs of these software engineers. We found that programmers work at all levels of abstraction (code, algorithm, application domain) about equally. They frequently switch between levels of abstraction. The programmers' main concerns are with what software does and how this is accomplished, not why software was built a certain way. These questions guide the work process. Information is sought and cross-referenced from a variety of sources from application domain concepts to code-related information, outpacing current maintenance environments' capabilities which are mostly stratified by information source, making cross-referencing difficult.},

This evidence is used to justify the use of diagrams and visual programming languages during software design. This paper reports the results of two studies. In the first, expert programmers were directly questioned regarding the nature of their mental representations while they were engaged in a design task. This investigative technique was used with the explicit intention of eliciting introspective reports of mental imagery. In the second, users of a visual programming language responded to a questionnaire in which they were asked about cognitive processes. The resulting transcripts displayed a considerable number of common elements. These suggests that software design shares many characteristics of more concrete design disciplines. The reports from participants in the two studies, together with previous research into imagery use, indicate potential techniques for further investigation of software development support tools and design strategies.},

The difference in PCT is not just in the model of the organism, but in the assumed properties of the world in which the organism behaves. We discuss and experimentally demonstrate the basic models, and the worlds in which they can operate properly. The results show, we believe, that PCT employs the only kind of model that can work in a realistic model of the world.},

However, the technical understanding required to turn this idea into a theory was largely developed only in this century.

An explanation is provided why novices are expected to select the appropriate actions and execute them in the correct order. The analyses point out how E- and I-feedback at the different interaction levels can create perceptions that induce users to build up correct intention hierarchies. It is shown that label following, difference reduction and analogical reasoning are inclined to be among the psychological mechanisms people use to link intentions to sub-intentions. Among the mechanisms for ordering sub-intentions are selective feedback presentation, difference reduction and forward and backward chaining.},

A proposed explanation would be that the self functions as a control system. Testing this hypothesis has entailed development of a methodological approach in which control action occurs predictably rather than having a statistical probability.

When we simulated the pairs that compared to non-simulated gatherings, the outcome was an arc but was still unlike those we have observed in many temporary gatherings. When we introduced disturbances into the gatherings in the form of other simulated actors they more closely represented what we have observed in the non-simulated world of parks, plazas, states fairs and school yards as well as those at political, religious and rallies.

abstract = {In this paper, a compositional model for reflective agents is proposed within which reasoning about observation, assumption making and communication, an agent's own information state and reasoning processes, other agents' information states and reasoning processes, and combinations of these types of reflective reasoning are explicitly modelled. The types of knowledge needed to detect, analyse and resolve conflicts that arise by meta-reasoning within the agent are discussed. The knowledge and interaction between agents required to model the wise men's puzzle is used to illustrate the approach. The model has been validated using think-aloud protocols. An implementation has been made including a speech synthesis facility.},

Although the syntax of simple iconic languages may be intuitively suggested by the icons themselves, an unexperienced user might find it difficult to construct syntactically correct iconic sentences in a complex visual environment.The paper presents a technique or the generation of interactive syntax-directed iconic environments. The user can easily interact with the generated iconic environment thanks to an underlying syntactic mechanism which suggests both the current feasible set of icons and their feasible positions on the screen. We have implemented a prototype tool based on this technique and used it experimentally to generate several practical iconic environments.},

Traffic lights are small red, yellow or green images added around the anchor text of each link indicating its connection speed, red for slow, yellow for somewhat fast and green for fastest. The first two experiments showed that traffic lights do not facilitate perceptual processes involved in web navigation (i.e. link localization and visual search). However, traffic lights also do not distract from the process of finding links in hypertext documents and, thus have no perceptual performance cost. The third experiment showed that traffic lights facilitate web navigation performance by improving link evaluation and decision processes. This improvement is particularly marked when link relevance is low or undifferentiated. It was concluded that supplying users with information about Internet connection speeds improves web navigation performance. Thus, traffic lights provide functional cues for efficiently navigating the web.},

abstract = {Despite the cognitive vocation of a number of studies on the comparison of interfaces in sensitive industrial sectors such as the nuclear sector, and in spite of the presentation of new frameworks for both task analysis and reducing the mental load, one vital question remains: how does psychology enter into these studies? Very often the principle of depth of processing is the basis for interface design-assessment approaches in operating situations like those of nuclear reactors. This then justifies the use of a methodology based on recall. After presenting how this principle, which stems from the memory field, is the basis for the different interface designs recently proposed in the literature and the validation approach associated to these technical propositions, we present a pressurized water reactor operating situation that demonstrates the same willingness to act on reasoning through information displays. For powering up conditions, we show how integration of different representational levels has been achieved, and provide evidence for a Physical vs. a Physical and Functional display. All these features indirectly show that recent proposals on ecological interface design have some validity for real work situations, provided a context is selected. Finally, from this analysis, we define, by considering success as the limits of past experience, the conditions under which a recall technique can be used to demonstrate the efficiency of these new tools.},

abstract = {Claims have been proposed as a means of expressing HCI knowledge that is associated with a specific artifact and usage context. Claims describe design trade-offs and record HCI knowledge related to a specific design, or artifact, as psychological design rationale. Claims are created in the task-artifact cycle of interactive design and evaluation. Usability evaluation establishes a claim for a specific usage context, but this can restrict subsequent reuse of claims-related knowledge. To widen the scope of reuse the knowledge contained within claims and their associated artifacts has to be classified and generalized. To address this problem a schema and method for classifying claims is introduced. The schema elaborates the description of HCI knowledge in claims and enables reuse by describing the assumptions and dependencies upon which a claim rests. Methods for generalising claims and discovering new claims from existing claims and artifacts were investigated. A factoring method for evolving child claims from parent claims and their usage scenarios is described. This employs a walkthrough technique based on Norman's model of action with questions directed at the contributions a claim makes to usability at different stages in interaction. Factoring promotes evolution of child claims that either address different aspects of task support in the same domain as the parent claim, or development of more general child claims for user-interface design. The relationships between claims are represented in maps to illustrate histories of task-artifacts investigation that lead to claims evolution either via the factoring process or by empirical investigation. The schema and method for claims evolution are illustrated by case studies of claims development in tutoring systems and claims for functional requirements for specification reuse support tools. The paper concludes with a discussion of the contribution that reusable claims can make as a repository of HCI knowledge.},

abstract = {User interface modelling (UIM) is basically a method for gathering user requirements that are applicable when designing the user interface to an information system. UIM is to be used as a complement to use case modelling (Jacobson, Christerson, Jonsson &amp; vergaard, 1992) in the system development process. An actor model, a goal model and a work model are specified during sessions where the end-users cooperate with software engineers and user-interface designers. The actor model is a description of characteristics for each category of users. The goal model is a list of high-level goals the users want to achieve. The work model is a specification of work situations, information objects and actions, and properties of attributes and operations, suitable for the design. UIM does not describe a step-by-step procedure on how to create usable interfaces. Interface design is partially a creative process than cannot be completely described with a method. However, the design process can be facilitated if the design decisions are based on a substantial model defining the users' requirements for the user interface. This model is created during UIM sessions.The method has been tested in different development projects at the Swedish National Tax Board. It has been shown to provide useful input to the user-interface design process.},

A number of keyboard and mouse configuration options designed to overcome physical difficulties exist. However, formal empirical evaluation of such facilities is rare. There is, in fact, little data available on the precise nature of physical difficulties with input devices. Hence, it is difficult to gauge the adequacy of existing access provision. This paper presents an empirical study of the keyboard and mouse errors encountered in a sample of 20 computer users with motor disabilities, and six without disabilities. Six important classes of keyboard difficulty are identified, involving significant correction time for participants with disabilities. Difficulties with all aspects of mouse usage were observed, particularly pointing and dragging. Many of the difficulties observed would be amenable to automatic detection. It is hoped that these results will help to inform the development of more accessible software and hardware.},

The statistical analysis reveals that the individuals contributions are not mutually independent; rather, they seem to be affected by social interactions manifested in the two-person case. These results may be explained by theories of social influence.},

The programmer's mental representation reflects comprehension of a program and guides tasks carried out on the program, such as debugging and modifications. The goals of the research were three-fold: (a) to determine if and how the mental representations of procedural and OO experts differ, (2) to investigate the initial mental representation formed while comprehending a moderately large program and (3) to examine the evolution of the mental representations of procedural and OO experts over time as they carried out several modifications of the same program. Fifteen expert procedural programmers and 15 expert object-oriented programmers studied and then performed three program modifications during two sessions which were 7 10 days apart. They answered two question sets designed to elicit the categories of knowledge present in their mental representations at different times. The initial mental representation of the OO participants was dominated by problem domain-based knowledge and contained relatively little detailed program information. The procedural participants' initial representation was more balanced, containing domain-based knowledge and also substantial program detail. After performing the modifications, the procedural participants' representations remained essentially the same, while those of the OO participants became more balanced with respect to the program and domain elements. The results suggest that, regardless of paradigm, expert programmers build a mixed mental representation of a larger program, which includes detailed program knowledge as well as domain-based knowledge.},

abstract = {Commercial speech systems, for use by the public, rely heavily on prompts which aim to constrain user input to a highly limited vocabulary set. Constraints help to increase the recognition accuracy of the automatic speech recognition device and thus improve dialogue efficiency. However, this strategy can also lengthen interactions because longer prompts are needed to effectively constrain user utterances and more steps are usually needed to complete a task. The current paper argues that to achieve optimal dialogue design solutions it is necessary to balance these conflicting effects of constraint. Two modelling studies are presented in which dialogue constraint levels for a home-banking application were systematically manipulated in order to investigate the effects on overall transaction time. The results indicate that, even with the assumption that high constraint leads to high recognition accuracy, it is difficult for highly constrained dialogues which entail the need for extra dialogue steps (e.g. those using menus) to compete with less-constrained dialogues which do not (e.g. those using queries). The implications of these findings to system design are discussed and it is suggested that the modelling method presented here can provide a useful tool early in the design process.},

The first experiment uses the slide-jump puzzle to look at the effects of imposing an implementation cost only on the undo operator of the interface to a task. The second experiment looks at problem solving with the eight-puzzle and imposes a system lockout delay after every operator application. In line with the predictions of the rational analysis model, both experiments demonstrate how these different manipulations of implementation cost result in more planning and shorter solution lengths when the operator implementation cost is high. The final experiment again uses a manipulation of lockout time and replicates the effects within the domain of a non-puzzle-like office administration type task.},

The analysis highlights the multiplicity of definitions and uses of the same set of classification terms which denote time relationships in collaborative systems. We observe that authors, when characterizing collaborative systems, use concepts without giving an exact definition of them, and other authors use terms in an ambiguous way, as if they were synonyms, when in fact they are not. This situation encourages the revision and reformulation of the conflictive terms. Specifically, the real-time, concurrent and synchronous concepts are analysed, and we apply them in different areas of this technology, resulting in the reformulation of the criteria. In many cases the resulting criteria are truly new due to the fact that their meanings, apart from being more precise, are different from those already used by some authors. The refining of criteria contributes to the organization and placement of the classification concepts, and helps in the formation of a useful vocabulary in order to better characterize collaborative systems.},

abstract = {Situated cognition poses a challenge that requires a paradigm shift in the way we build symbolic knowledge-based systems. Current approaches require complex analysis and modelling and the intervention of a knowledge engineer. They rely on building knowledge-level models which often result in static models that suffer from the frame of reference problem. This approach has also resulted in an emphasis on knowledge elicitation rather than user requirements elicitation. The situated nature of knowledge necessitates a review of how we build, maintain and validate knowledge-based systems. We need systems that are flexible, intuitive and that interact directly with the end-user. We need systems that are designed with maintenance in mind, allowing incremental change and on-line validation. This will require a technique that captures knowledge in context and assists the user to distinguish between contexts. We take up this challenge with a knowledge acquisition and representation method known as Ripple-down Rules. Context in Ripple-down Rules is handled by its exception structure and the storing of the case that prompted a rule to be added. A rule is added as a refinement to an incorrect rule by assigning the correct conclusion and picking the salient features in the case that differentiate the current case from the case associated with the wrong conclusion. Thus, knowledge acquisition and maintenance are simple tasks, designed to be performed incrementally while the system is in use. Knowledge acquisition, maintenance and inferencing are offered in modes that can be performed reflexively without a knowledge engineer. We further describe the addition of modelling tools to assist the user to reflect on their knowledge for such purposes as critiquing, explanation, “what-if” analysis and tutoring. Our aim is to provide a system that lets the user choose the mode of interaction and view of the knowledge according to the situation in which they find themselves and their own personal preferences.},

abstract = {A continuing problem in business today is the design of human computer systems that respect how work actually gets done. The overarching context of work consists ofactivities, which people conceive as ways of organizing their daily life and especially their interactions with each other. Activities include reading mail, going to workshops, meeting with colleagues over lunch, answering phone calls, and so on. Brahms is a multiagent simulation tool for modeling the activities of groups in different locations and the physical environment consisting of objects and documents, including especially computer systems. A Brahms model of work practice revealscircumstantial, interactional influenceson how work actually gets done, especially how people involve each other in their work. In particular, a model of practice reveals how people accomplish a collaboration through multiple and alternative means of communication, such as meetings, computer tools, and written documents. Choices of what and how to communicate are dependent uponsocial beliefs and behaviors what people know about each other s activities, intentions, and capabilities and their understanding of the norms of the group. As a result, Brahms models can help human computer system designers to understandhow tasks and information actually flowbetween people and machines, what work is required to synchronize individual contributions, and how tools hinder or help this process. In particular, workflow diagrams generated by Brahms arethe emergent product of local interactions between agents and representational artifacts, not pre-ordained, end-to-end paths built in by a modeler. We developed Brahms as a tool to support the design of work by illuminating how formal flow descriptions relate to the social systems of work; we accomplish this by incorporating multiple views relating people, information, systems, and geography in one tool. Applications of Brahms could also include system requirements analysis, instruction, implementing software agents, and a workbench for relating cognitive and social theories of human behavior.},

These situations are often “wicked” in nature, and may be defined by reinterpreting the meaning of an organization's intent. A real-world case study is used to illustrate the framing process and derive an ontology for framing. A computer tool called FRAMER is described that implements the framing ontology and supports the framing process. A key feature of FRAMER is the ability for people to adapt and redefine knowledge representations as they articulate new theories, and extend existing theories, about an organization.},

abstract = {A perspective on situated learning is presented which proposes that navigating within a space of many descriptive models overcomes limitations inherent in mono-model approaches to learning contextualized knowledge. The situationist view may be interpreted as drawing attention to neglected aspects of knowledge such as non-verbal, tacit, sub-conscious, metacognitive and affective. Although these elements have evaded adequate modelling for the purpose ofsimulatinghuman behaviour, they can be “attended to” from descriptions tosupporthuman behaviour however, the utility of a representation depends on the kind of knowledge so described. Different viewpoints of a situation, such as the learner's and a professional's, can be described with different models, which differ in fundamental dimensions. These facilitate communication of viewpoints between learners and professional members of the community, so that though negotiation a synthesis emerges which retains critical aspects of both view points this is learning. Other interactions between viewpoints develop other affective and metacognitive skills. The many elements of situated action and knowledge are discussed and then a methodology for supporting situated learning with multiple descriptive models is presented. A situated learning environment is present, founded on multiple models, which demonstrates that switching between models is a metalevel process for changing viewpoints and this is the basis of integrating learners into new communities of practice. Learning problem solving, developing identities and refining roles are all introduced and consolidated by an example using multiple models to developaffectiveconciliation skills. The examples given illustrate how part of a professional's knowledge can be used by a learner for one particular approach to learning. However, the representation of the professional, using this multiple models approach, would include informal knowledge from the community of practice as well as formal knowledge. This combination of different knowledge types allows a variety of learning situations to be accommodated.},

abstract = {Evolutionary approaches to cognitive design in the air traffic management (ATM) system can be attributed with a history of delayed developments. This issue is well illustrated in the case of the flight progress strip where attempts to design a computer-based system to replace the paper strip have consistently been met with rejection. An alternative approach to cognitive design of air traffic management is needed and this paper proposes an approach centred on the formulation of cognitive design problems. The paper gives an account of how a cognitive design problem was formulated for a simulated ATM task performed by controller subjects in the laboratory. The problem is formulated in terms of two complimentary models. First, a model of the ATM domain describes the cognitive task environment of managing the simulated air traffic. Second, a model of the ATM worksystem describes the abstracted cognitive behaviours of the controllers and their tools in performing the traffic management task. Taken together, the models provide a statement of worksystem performance, and express the cognitive design problem for the simulated system. The use of the problem formulation in supporting cognitive design, including the design of computer-based flight strips, is discussed.},

This is surprising given the vast literature on the calibration of confidence which can be found within the judgment and decision literature. In this study, 60 participants were asked to complete a novel computer-based task, and to provide measures of self-confidence in terms of their anticipated performance at each stage of the task. Users' confidence judgements showed sensitivity to their rate of improvement on the task, but were poorly calibrated with actual performance at each stage. Furthermore, confidence judgements were insensitive to the complexity of the individual task components, even though these different components led to very different levels of performance. The style of computer interface was also found to affect anticipated performance independently of actual performance. The ability of existing models of confidence judgement to deal with these data is discussed.},

The abstraction display controller (ADC) interactor model is one such abstraction which draws on research into user interface architectures and on earlier approaches to the formal specification of user interfaces. The ADC interactor model is specified formally using the LOTOS specification language. As a concept and as a representation scheme the ADC interactor model applies both to the user interface as a whole and also to its components. This property is preserved when interactors are combined to describe more complex entities or, conversely, when an interactor is decomposed into smaller-scale interactors. The paper includes a discussion of the ADC model and its use for the verification of user-interface software.},

abstract = {Ecological interface design (EID) is a candidate framework for designing interfaces for complex sociotechnical systems. Interfaces based on EID have been shown to lead to better performance than traditional interfaces, but not all participants benefit equally. Thus, it is important to identify ways of raising the performance of all participants using an EID interface. The purpose of this article is to determine whether encouraging participants to engage in self-explanations (i.e. reasoning aloud) can help them “make the most” of EID. An experiment was conducted using DURESS II, an interactive, thermal-hydraulic process control microworld with an interface designed according to the principles of EID. During this one-month study, participants controlled DURESS II under normal and fault conditions on a quasi-daily basis. Two experimental groups occasionally watched a replay of their own performance immediately after completing a trial, while the control group did not. In addition, the self-explanation (SE) group was instructed to explain aloud the reasons for their control actions while watching the replay. The replay group simple watched their trials again with no verbal explanation. The SE participants were divided into “good” and “poor” groups according to several performance criteria. An analysis of the protocols produced during self-explanation revealed that “good” SE participants showed more signs of self-explanation in their protocols than did the “poor” SE participants. There were no substantial differences between the SE, replay and control groups for normal trials. However, the SE participants did have the best overall performance on fault trials, suggesting that self-explanation can help operators make the most of EID.},

In particular, the relationship between scheduling methods as articulated in terms of the structural relations among concepts in the domain model. Application systems developed with the library can be extended by modifying the configurations of the sub-systems and elaborating the concepts in each sub-system. The reusability of the library is investigated in terms of the ratio of code reuse in a real case. Finally, we compare our approach with related studies, and draw implications for designing domain-oriented libraries of problem-solving methods, taking account of the transition of knowledge-modelling perspectives.},

In Speel and Aben (1997), we have reported our positive experiences in reusing problem-solving methods (PSMs). In this paper, we focus on the feasibility of another important technique called structure-preserving design and implementation (SPD).In the literature it is claimed that SPD leads to many benefits including improved maintenance and reuse of program code. In this paper, we discuss our experiences in applying SPD in an extensive case study. We have tested the validity of the scientifically claimed pros and cons during the development of four industrial KBSs. For these off-line diagnosis and assessment applications, we found that the SPD approach is feasible and improves maintainability, encourages reuse on all levels, contributes to improved understandability, documentation and explanation and promotes systematization. In addition, the off-line KBSs do not demonstrate any serious performance problems.},

Reuse should be cost-effective; therefore, the library will include standard problem-solving methods whose semantics are well understood and are described with a language for stating the requirements and capabilities of a component. In addition, when a developer needs toadapta component to a new task, the adaptation costs should be minimal. Thus, we advocate the use of separate mediating components that isolate these adaptations from the original component.

abstract = {Different libraries of problem-solving methods have been described in the past few years. But they have mostly been defined at an informal or operational level and rarely at the formal level. Since their components lack a clear definition and rigorous structuration, it is difficult to ensure that a method selected from a library is correctly reused in the development of an application. This is the reason why we have chosen a formal approach to support problem-solving methods libraries organisation and use. Our approach is based on algebraic specifications. Our first contribution presents how such formal techniques can provide reusable PSMs with a precise and unambiguous semantics and with a mathematically well-defined hierarchical structuration. Second, we show how reusing and adapting such PSMs to develop particular applications can be rigorously formalized. A library fragment of assignment methods is used to illustrate how to structure a PSM library. Sisyphus I example is used to describe how to derive a formal specification of an application by reusing components of this library. The paper focuses on the competence of PSMs regardless of their dynamic aspects.},

abstract = {Chandrasekaran and Steels proposed several years ago that libraries of reusable problem-solving methods, for use in model-driven knowledge acquisition, should be organized as hierarchies of task decomposition methods, rather than as collections of complete methods. Using such a library, a complete problem-solving method can be generated for an application, on the basis of selection criteria. This paper proposes a set of general principles which libraries of task decomposition methods can be evaluated against, concerning method correctness, specialization of selection criteria, and method generality. The objective of the principles is to facilitate the process of using a library of task decomposition methods in application modelling, by reducing the need to make adaptations of complete methods generated with the library. The principles were motivated by difficulties encountered in a case-study of modelling a specific diagnosis application using one of the most comprehensive libraries of task decomposition methods Benjamins' library of diagnosis methods. It is shown how those difficulties could have been avoided, if Benjamins' library had been explicitly evaluated against the proposed principles.},

Its design allows to store and index an extensible set of modeling components of different levels of granularity, as well as generic (partial) models of expertise and even reusable modeling steps. Further, its contents were significantly expanded, in what is probably the largest library of problem solving methods presently. In this article, we explain the rationale of the design of theCommonKADS library, the mechanisms defined to index the elements it stores, and the Library contents. An example of the use of a part of the Library concerned with problem-solving methods for assessment tasks is presented. The Library is not a finished product: not only because still many contents may need further verification and validation, but also because the Library is intended to accumulate and share practical experiences and advice on the process of modeling for actual applications.

abstract = {The knowledge-engineering literature contains a number of approaches for constructing or selecting problem solvers. Some of these approaches are based on indexing and selecting a problem solver from a library, others are based on a knowledge acquisition process, or are based on search-strategies. None of these approaches sees constructing a problem solver as a configuration task that could be solved with an appropriate configuration method. We introduce a representation of the functionality of problem-solving methods that allows us to view the construction of problem solvers as a configuration problem, and specifically as a parametric design problem. From the available methods for parametric design, we use propose-critique-modify for the automated configuration of problem-solving methods. We illustrate this approach by a scenario in a small car domain example.},

This approach describes the refinement process of an initial, abstract formalization of the required competence of a PSM, towards an operational version of the PSM. Three major steps in this process are identified: specification of the required competence theory, refinement of the theory into a form that fits a PSM paradigm and the operationalization of the theory into a form that is close to an executable specification. As an example, the ontological commitments and assumptions underlying some problem-solving methods for classification problems are investigated and their operational forms are presented.},

abstract = {Recent work (Telford &amp; Johnson, 1996; Johnson, 1997), involving the application of formal notations to analyse accident reports has shown that the quality of these accident reports is poor, so much so that their conclusions can be misleading. The proposed solution has been to use formal notations in combination with traditional analysis to produce a report, the conclusions of which can be verified by formal reasoning. However, there are weaknesses with the formal notations used up until now. Firstly, they have not allowed the representation of all aspects of an accident or incident. For example, human factors have either not been represented or not clearly delineated from system factors. In particular, there has not been an attempt to provide a task analysis of the incident. Secondly, the notations used do not easily facilitate the system engineering concepts of modularity, encapsulation or scalability. In consequence, it is difficult to model different aspects of an accident, compose these different aspects to build up the model or make changes to parts of the model without affecting the rest of the model. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how a formal object-oriented specification language can be used to provide the benefits offered by an engineering approach and in particular, by using this approach, how a task analysis model can be constructed. The task analysis incorporates Hollnagel's (1993) classification of erroneous actions, so that scenarios, deriving from human error, can be reasoned about. An air accident investigation report, issued by the UK Civil Aviation Authority, is used as a case study.},

Design techniques often fail to make the transition from research to practice because insufficient attention is paid to understanding and communicating the skills required to use them. This paper reports on work to train software engineering students to use a user-centred language for describing and analysing interface designs called the “Programmable User Model Instruction Language”, or IL. Various types of data, including video, students' IL descriptions and brief usability reports were collected during training, and subsequently analysed. These show that after 6 h of training, students have a good grasp of the syntax of the notation, and start using notational affordances to support their reasoning, but that their reasoning is still limited by a poor grasp of the underlying cognitive theory. A comparison of the analyses of trainees with those of experts provides a means of developing a better understanding of the nature of expertise in this area as comprising an understanding of the syntax and the surface semantics of the notation, the underlying ognitive theory, the method of conducting an analysis and the implications of the analysis for design.},

abstract = {Clancey (1992) proposed the model-construction framework as a way to explain the reasoning of knowledge-based systems (KBSs), based on his realization that all KBSs construct implicit or explicit situation-specificmodels(SSMs). An SSM is a rational argument that explains the solution produced for a specific problem situation pertaining to a target application task (e.g. SSMs constructed for typical diagnosis tasks are causal arguments having the structure of a proof). From a knowledge engineering perspective it makes sense that the notion of an SSM should play a major role in the modeling of tasks. Motivated by this view, we present a structured knowledge modeling methodology calledSSM-directed knowledge modeling(SSM-DKM). In SSM-DKM, an SSM is a central structure that drives the entire modeling endeavor. In light of this fact, we explain how SSM-DKM supports three main stages in the knowledge engineering process conceptualization, formalization and validation and instantiation and illustrate the application of SSM-DKM to a medical diagnosis task. The knowledge model that SSM-DKM produces for a target application task has two appealing traits. First, the model embodies explicit knowledge about the ontology of SSMs that the task entails creating as solutions, thus enabling the construction of a KBS that makes these SSMs explicit. Second, the model captures strategic (or problem-solving) knowledge in declarative terms pertaining to the ontology of SSMs created for the task. Both these beneficial traits have been illustrated in the context of ACE-SSM, a KBS architecture that constructs explicit SSMs (Benaroch, 1998).},

abstract = {One of the objectives of machine learning is to enable intelligent systems to acquire knowledge in a highly automated manner. In systems modelling and control engineering, fuzzy systems have shown to be highly suitable for the modelling of complex and uncertain systems. Recently, the interest in fuzzy systems has shifted from the seminal ideas about modelling the process or the behaviour of operators by knowledge acquisition towards a data-driven approach. Reasons to choose fuzzy systems instead of modelling techniques such as neural networks, radial basis functions, genetic algorithms or splines, are mainly the possibility of integrating logical information processing with the attractive mathematical properties of general function approximators. Furthermore, the rule-based structure of fuzzy systems makes analysis easier. The fuzzy sets in the rules represent linguistic qualitative terms that approximate the human-like way of information quantization. However, many of the data-driven fuzzy modelling algorithms that have been developed, aim at good numerical approximation and pay little attention to the semantical properties of the resulting rule base. In this article, we briefly discuss different approaches to data-intensive fuzzy modelling reported in the literature. Next, we present a data-driven approach to fuzzy modelling that provides the user with both accurate and transparent rule bases. The method has two main steps: data exploration by means of fuzzy clustering and fuzzy set aggregation by means of similarity analysis. First, fuzzy relations are identified in the product space of the system's variables and are described by means of fuzzy production rules. Compatible fuzzy concepts defined for the individual variables are then identified and aggregated to produce generalizing concepts, giving a comprehensible rule base with increased semantic properties. The transparent fuzzy modelling approach is demonstrated on a real world problem concerning the modelling of algae growth in lakes.},

This is the problem when items on a single panel or a pull-down menu are disabled. Generally, the underlying structure of an interface is hidden from the user's view, and it may be quite difficult for the user to figure out the sequence of selections to enable the desired options. Users high in spatial visualization ability (SVA) are often quick to learn the contingencies underlying the menus and are not severely hindered by this problem; however, low SVA users generally experience substantial difficulty in visualizing these contingencies and often get lost. We conducted two experiments to determine whether revealing hidden contingencies through visual cues would facilitate the performance of low SVA users on a computerized path-finding task. In general, it was found that increasing interface apparency benefits all users, but particularly those with low SVA. Specifically, methods of displaying single paths in a menu hierarchy using either lines or color coding were the most effective.},

Results strongly supported the predictions: when the outcome was negative, participants working with asimilarcomputer were less likely to blame the computer and more likely to blame themselves, compared with participants working with adissimilarcomputer.

abstract = {There are many commercial systems capable of transmitting a video image of parties in a conversation over a digital network. Typically, these have been used to provide facial images of the participants. Experimental evidence for the advantages of such a capability has been hard to find. This paper describes two experiments that demonstrate significant advantages for video conferencing over audio-only conferencing, in the context of a negotiation task using electronically shared data. In the video condition there was a large, high-quality image of the head and upper torso of the participant(s) at the other end of the link and high-quality sound. For the audio-alone condition the sound was the same but there was no video image. The criteria by which these two communication conditions were compared were not the conventional measures of task outcome. Rather, measures relating to conversational fluency and interpersonal awareness were applied. In each of the two experiments, participants completed the same task with data presented by a shared editor. In Experiment 1, they worked in pairs and in Experiment 2 they worked at quartets with two people at each end of the link. Fluency was assessed from transcripts in terms of length of utterance, overlapping speech and explicit questions. Only the latter measure discriminated between the two communication conditions in both experiments. The other measures showed significant effects in Experiment 2 but not in Experiment 1. Given this pattern of results it is concluded that video can result in more fluent conversation, particularly where there are more than two discussants. However, in the case of dyadic conversation auditory cues to turn taking, etc., would seem to suffice. In both experiments there was a large and significant effect on interpersonal awareness as assessed by ratings of the illusion of presence, and most clearly, awareness of the attentional focus of the remote partner (s). In Experiment 2, the ratings for the remote partners were similar to those for the co-located discussants, demonstrating the effectiveness of the video link with regard to these subjective scales.},

abstract = {Some researchers have argued that providing operators with externalized, graphic representations can lead to a trade-off whereby deep knowledge is sacrificed for cognitive economy and performance. This article provides an initial empirical investigation of this hypothesis by presenting a longitudinal study of the effect of ecological interface design (EID), a framework for designing interfaces for complex industrial systems, on subjects' deep knowledge. The experiment continuously observed the quasi-daily performance of the subjects' over a period of six months. The research was conducted in the context of DURESS II, a real-time, interactive thermal-hydraulic process control simulation that was designed to be representative of industrial systems. The performance of two interfaces was compared, an EID interface based on physical and functional (P+F) system representations and a more traditional interface based solely on a physical (P) representation. Subjects were required to perform several control tasks, including startup, tuning, shutdown and fault management. Occasionally, a set of knowledge elicitation tests was administered to assess the evolution of subjects' deep knowledge of DURESS II. The results suggest that EID can lead to a functionally organized knowledge base as well as superior performance, but only if subjects actively reflect on the feedback they get from the interface. In contrast, if subjects adopt a surface approach to learning, then EID can lead to a shallow knowledge base and poor performance, although no worse than that observed with a traditional interface.},

abstract = {Structured response objects include buttons, menus and formatted fields that an email sender can insert in a message to elicit predetermined responses from recipients. Two studies explored the usefulness of structured response objects in meeting the needs of everyday email. In Study 1, subjective content classifications suggested that more than half of typical email messages are requests or answers to requests. Further, a significant proportion of requests and answers could be expressed as structured response objects, the most common one being the choice of a single item from a predetermined list. Study 2 experimentally determined social factors that affect preference for structured responses compared with free form text. It found an overall preference for replying with structured responses compared with text. But, in accordance with social richness theories, this preference was reduced for ambiguous messages and for those of a personal nature. Together, these results suggest that structured response objects can be a useful tool to increase the convenience and efficiency of electronic messaging.},

abstract = {TurboTurtle is a dynamicmulti-usermicroworld for the exploration of Newtonian physics. With TurboTurtle, students can alter the attributes of the simulation environment, such as gravity, friction, and presence or absence of walls. Students explore the microworld by manipulating a variety of parameters, and learn concepts by studying the behaviours and interactions that occur. TurboTurtle has evolved into a “group-aware” system where several students, each on their own computer, can simultaneously control the microworld and gesture around the shared display. TurboTurtle's design rationale includes concepts such as equal opportunity controls, simulation timing, concrete vs. abstract controls, recoverability, and how strictly views should be shared between students. Teachers can also add structure to the group's activities by setting the simulation environment to an interesting state, which includes a set of problems and questions. Observations of pairs of young children using TurboTurtle highlight extremes in collaboration styles, from conflict to smooth interaction. Finally, the technical work in making TurboTurtle group-aware is slight, primarily because it was built with a groupware toolkit called GroupKit.},

abstract = {We describe a plan-based agent architecture that models misunderstandings in cooperative NL agent communication; it exploits a notion of coherence in dialogue based on the idea that the explicit and implicit goals which can be identified by interpreting a conversational turn can be related with the previous explicit/implicit goals of the interactants. Misunderstandings are hypothesized when the coherence of the interaction is lost (i.e. an unrelated utterance comes). The processes of analysis (and treatment) of a misunderstanding are modelled as rational behaviours caused by the acquisition of a supplementary goal, when an incoherent turn comes: the agent detecting the incoherence commits to restore the intersubjectivity in the dialogue; so, he restructures his own contextual interpretation, or he induces the partner to restructure his (according to who seems to have made the mistake). This commitment leads him to produce a repair turn, which initiates a sub-dialogue aimed at restoring the common interpretation ground. Since we model speech acts uniformly with respect to the other actions (the domain-level actions), our model is general and covers misunderstandings occurring at the linguistic level as well as at the underlying domain activities of the interactants.},

The first part of the methodology is general and supports the detection of any kind of user system interaction problem. The second part concerns the classification, diagnosis and repair of problems of dialogue interaction. These problems are of two broad kinds: dialogue design errors and user errors. Use of the methodology is demonstrated through analysis of a corpus from the user test of the Danish Dialogue System.},

We further illustrate this with related work in active logics. We argue moreover that there may be a core set of meta-dialog principles that is in some sense complete, and that may correspond to the human ability to engage in “free-ranging” conversation. If we are right, then implementing such a set would be of considerable interest. We give examples of existing computer programs that converse inadequately according to our guidelines.},

abstract = {This paper describes successive reformulations of skeletal-plan refinement as a problem-solving method. We argue that, whereas ideas derived from planning literature helped to determine the overall structure of the planning systems, domain-derived considerations and architectural framework in which the systems were implemented played important roles in these reformulations. We illustrate the argument by describing a new framework that integrates knowledge-based applications with a temporal data-abstraction and data-management system. In this framework, both applications and temporal-data mediators are encapsulated as Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) objects. The skeletal-plan refinement method itself is formulated as a collection of cooperating CORBA objects. We have found that we needed to reformulate the method ontology, mapping relations and control structure of the skeletal-planning problem-solving method in this framework. Our experience suggests that problem-solving methods are not necessarily fixed structures that can be plugged into arbitrary application environments, and that we need to develop a flexible configuration environment and expressive mapping formalisms to accommodate the requirements of application environments. These requirements include the ways data are made available and the ways software components interact with one another.},

Existing problem solving models for planning are almost exclusively derived from an analysis of the functional architectures of classic AI planners such as TWEAK and NONLIN. We argue that this makes their suitability for directly assisting knowledge acquisition questionable. Our approach makes a clear distinction between domain-derived knowledge-level models and those derived from computational architectures. We describe how the combination of these two types of models can achieve clear benefits within the course of KBS development. The paper includes extensive descriptions of the SAR domain, which illustrate the practical knowledge engineering problems that our approach attempts to address.},

We use modern knowledge modeling approaches to analyse planning systems described in the literature. The analysis yields a detailed description of these planning systems in terms of the domain knowledge they use and the problem-solving methods they comprise. We show how the result of the analysis can be considered as a library of system-derived problem-solving methods for planning. This library consists of planning problem-solving methods along with their assumptions, which describe the applicability conditions on the domain knowledge of the methods.

abstract = {Previous research has shown that Rasmussen's abstraction hierarchy, which consists of both physical and functional system models, provides a useful basis for interface design for complex human machine systems. However, very few studies have quantitatively analysed how people allocate their attention across levels of abstraction. This experiment investigated the relationship between attention allocation strategies and performance on a thermal-hydraulic process simulation. Subjects controlled the process during both normal and fault situations for about an hour per weekday for approximately one month. All subjects used a multi-level interface consisting of four separate windows, each representing a level of the abstraction hierarchy. Subjects who made more frequent use of functional levels of information exhibited more accurate system control under normal conditions, and more accurate diagnosis performance under fault trials. Moreover, subjects who made efficient use of functional information exhibited faster fault compensation times. In contrast, subjects who made infrequent or inefficient use of functional information exhibited poorer performance on both normal and fault trials. These results provide some initial, specific evidence of the advantages of an abstraction hierarchy interface over more traditional interfaces that emphasize physical rather than functional information.},

abstract = {A key obstacle hampering the fielding of AI planning applications is the considerable expense of developing, verifying, updating and maintaining the planning knowledge base (KB). Planning systems must be able to compare favorably in terms of software lifecycle costs to other means of automation such as scripts or rule-based expert systems. Consequently, in order to field real systems, planning practitioners must be able to provide (1) tools to allow domain experts to create and debug their own planning knowledge bases; (2) tools for software verification, validation and testing and (3) tools to facilitate updates and maintenance of the planning knowledge base. This paper begins by describing a planning application of automated image processing and our overall approach to knowledge acquisition for this application. This paper then describes two types of tools for planning knowledge-base development: static KB analysis techniques to detect certain classes of syntactic errors in a planning knowledge-base and completion analysis techniques to interactively debug the planning knowledge base. We describe these knowledge development tools and describe empirical results documenting the usefulness of these tools.},

Context-based reasoning is identified both within and among constraint networks.

Thanks to this definition we explain the role of the granularity level of processing and the role of the abstraction level of application in modelling context. Based on this definition two main issues related to context are tackled: how context representation can be built and organized and how context contents can be re-used for other applications. Then we propose several solutions to deal with these issues: using a multi-viewpoint representation and describing context through symbolic information. We illustrate the proposed context model with the process of dynamic scene interpretation. After explaining the reasons why this process is particularly concerned with the use of contextual information, we describe the context representation and its implementation for this specific process. Finally, we give an example illustrating the utilization of the context representation and we describe the software we have developed to ease the acquisition stage of context contents.},

abstract = {The control of the subway line traffic is a domain where operators must deal with huge quantities of pieces of knowledge more or less implicit in the control itself. When an incident occurs on a subway line, the operator must choose the best strategy applicable for moving from the incidental context to the operational one. An incident on the subway line may cause traffic delay or service interruption and may last for a long or short time, depending on the nature of the incident and many other elements. Operators mainly focus on contextual information for incident solving. An operator said, “When an incident occurs, I look first at what the incident context is”. We propose to support subway line traffic operators in incident-solving with an incident-manager system, which is a part of the SART project (French acronym for support system in the traffic control). The incident manager is a decision-support system based on the contextual analysis of events that arise at the time of the incident. It uses a context-based representation of incidents and applies a context-based reasoning. In this paper we discuss a context-based representation of incidents on the basis of the onion metaphor. The SART project now enters the second year of the system design and development and implies two universities and two subway companies in France and Brazil.},

In our research, we study how the incorporation of case-specific, episodic, knowledge enables such systems to become more robust and to adapt to a changing environment by continuously retaining new problem-solving cases as they occur during normal system operation. The research reported in this paper describes an extension that incorporates additional knowledge of the problem-solving context into the architecture. The components of this context model is described, and related to the roles the components play in an abductive diagnostic process.

abstract = {Humans and other animals are exquisitely attuned to their context. Context affects almost all aspects of behavior, and it does so for the most part automatically, without a conscious reasoning effort. This would be a very useful property for an artificial agent to have: upon recognizing its context, the agent's behavior would automatically adjust to fit it. This paper describescontext-mediated behavior(CMB), an approach to context-sensitive behavior we have developed over the past few years for intelligent autonomous agents. In CMB, contexts are represented explicitly ascontextual schemas(c-schemas). An agent recognizes its context by finding the c-schemas that match it, then it merges these to form a coherent representation of the current context. This includes not only a description of the context, but also information about how to behave in it. From that point until the next context change, knowledge for context-sensitive behavior is available with no additional effort. This is used to influence perception, make predictions about the world, handle unanticipated events, determine the context-dependent meaning of concepts, focus attention and select actions. CMB is being implemented in the Orca program, an intelligent controller for autonomous underwater vehicles.},

abstract = {Conventional methods of navigating within a virtual reality environment involve the use of interfaces such as keyboards, hand-held input devices such as joysticks, mice and trackballs, and hand-worn data gloves. While these devices are mostly adequate, they are rather obstrusive and require some amount of training to use. Researchers have begun investigation into interfaces that have the capability to interpret human gestures visually.In this document, we describe an approach used to navigate virtual reality environments by tracking the pose (translation and orientation) of the user's face. This “hands-free” navigation is simple, intuitive and unobstrusive. It requires only commercially available products such as a camera and an image digitizer. The pose of the face is determined by warping a reference face image to minimize intensity difference between the warped reference face image and the current face image. This is more robust because all pixels in the face are used, in contrast to detecting only selected facial features. In addition, the proposed approach does not require a geometric model of the face.},

abstract = {User's mental representations and cognitive strategies can have a profound influence on how they interact with computer interfaces (Janosky, Smith &amp; Hildreth, 1986). However, there is very little research that elucidates such mental representations and strategies in the context of interactive hypermedia. Furthermore, interface design for hypermedia information presentation systems is rarely driven by what is known of users' mental models and strategies. This paper makes three contributions toward addressing these problems. First, it describes a novel cognitive model of comprehension of multimodal presentations for the specific application of explaining how machines work, and proposes guidelines for hypermedia design derived from this model. Since the development of this model draws heavily upon research in both cognitive science and computational modeling, a second contribution is that it contains a detailed review of literature in these fields on comprehension from static multimodal presentations. Third, it illustrates how cognitive and computational modeling are being used to inform the design of hypermedia information presentation systems about machines. This includes a framework for empirical validation of the model and evaluation of hypermedia design so that both theory and design can be refined iteratively.},

abstract = {Electronic monitoring systems are becoming a prominent feature of the modern office. The aims of the present study were three-fold. First, to assess the effects electronic security monitoring systems (ESM) have on the user's physiological state. Second, the researches aimed to examine the effects explicit security challenges have on both user behaviour and physiological state when using an ESM system. Finally, the research aimed to examine the effects one form of electronic performance monitoring system may have on the user's physiological state. To this effect, the present study examined the physiological and performance effects of two simulated electronic monitoring systems (security/performance). The computer task required 32 subjects to enter mock clinical case notes under various conditions. In the first session subjects were only required to enter the case notes while keystroke data were collected. In the “security baseline” condition subjects were informed that a keystroke security monitoring system had been instituted, but no security challenges occurred. In the “security challenge” condition, however, a number of explicit security challenges occurred. In the final “performance monitoring” condition, subjects were informed that their data entry speed was monitored and they were placed on a response-cost schedule for poor performance. Blood pressure and continuous inter-heartbeat latency were recorded for the security and performance conditions. Results indicated that monitoring systems have the potential to evoke altered arousal states in the form of increased heart rate and blood pressure. Contrary to expectations, the hypothesized improvement in task performance within the performance monitoring condition was not observed. The implications of these results for the design and implementation of electronically based behavioural-based security and performance monitoring systems are discussed.},

This paper investigates how people extract information from any one of several common displays by analysing the match between display, decision task and data. We posit two kinds of activity: first, the formulation of an appropriate extraction strategy and second, the execution of that strategy. We then develop a model ofstrategy formulation. We hypothesize that with matched designs a higher proportion of subjects use common strategies characterized by less time to formulate, less time to execute and more accurate decisions. A laboratory experiment using a new technique of graphical protocol analysis supported these hypotheses. Moreover, the experiment demonstrated how changes in display, decision task and data alter the way people select decision strategies. This suggests new opportunities for designing more effective human computer interfaces.},

abstract = {Negotiation has been extensively discussed in game-theoretic, economic and management science literatures for decades. Recent growing interest in autonomous interacting software agents and their potential application in areas such as electronic commerce has give increased importance to automated negotiation. Evidence both from theoretical analysis and from observations of human interactions suggests that if decision makers can somehow take into consideration what other agents are thinking and furthermore learn during their interactions how other agents behave, their payoff might increase. In this paper, we propose a sequential decision-making model of negotiation, called Bazaar. It provides an adaptive, multi-issue negotiation model capable of exhibiting a rich set of negotiation behaviors. Within the proposed negotiation framework, we model learning as a Bayesian belief update process. In this paper, we present both theoretical analysis and initial experimental results showing that learning is beneficial in the sequential negotiation model.},

abstract = {Intelligent interaction in multi-agent domains frequently requires an agent to track other agents' mental states: their current goals, beliefs and intentions. Accuracy in thisagent-trackingtask is critically dependent on the accuracy of the tracker's (tracking agent's) model of the trackee (tracked agent). Unfortunately, in real-world situations, model imperfections arise due to the tracker's resource and information constraints, as well as due to trackees' dynamic behavior modification. While such model imperfections are unavoidable, a tracker must nonetheless attempt to be adaptive in its agent tracking. This article identifies key issues in adaptive agent tracking and presents an approach called DEFT. At its core, DEFT is based on discrimination-based learning. The main idea is to identify the deficiency of a model based on tracking failures, and revise the model by using features that are critical in discriminating successful and failed tracking episodes. Because in real-world situations the set of candidate discriminating features is very large, DEFT relies on knowledge-based focusing to limit the discrimination to those features that it determines were relevant in successful tracking episodes with an autonomous explanation capability as a major source of this knowledge. This article reports on experiments with an implementation of key aspects of DEFT in a complex synthetic air-to-air combat domain.},

In general, it is assumed that the more accurate and comprehensive the available information, the better is the expected performance of the individual and the group. This conclusion can be challenged in a number of scenarios. We investigate the use of limited information by agents in choosing betwen one of several different options, and conclude that if agents are kept ignorant about, or they deliberately ignore, any number of options, the group can converge faster to a stable and optimal configuration. We present a probabilistic analysis that sheds light on the observed phenomenon of quicker system convergence with less global information. This analysis suggests a desirable adaptive behavior on the part of individual agents. Experiments with agents following these adaptive behavior exhibits faster convergence. We also demonstrate how a couple of coalition formation schemes can improve the rate of convergence. A variable coalition formation mechanism is found to be more effective than a static one.},

abstract = {In building intelligent network agents, computer scientists may employ a variety of different design strategies, and their design decisions can have a significant effect on the ultimate nature of network interactions. Some agent designs are “co-operative”, and populations of agents based on them would be able to interact smoothly, effectively utilizing network resources. In contrast, other agent designs can lead to ineffective and wasteful competition for network resources, resulting in massive bottlenecks and unacceptable access delays. We focus here on a particular design question, themultiple-access problem: if an agent seeking a piece of information knows of several sites that have, or might have, that information, how many queries should it issue, and when? We provide a formal analysis that demonstrates the viability of cooperative responses to this question under certain assumptions. We then discuss the limitations of this analysis and present the results of experiments done using a genetic-algorithms approach in which simulated network agents “evolve” co-operative strategies, under less restrictive assumptions than those made in the formal analysis.},

abstract = {Organizational context is now accepted as a central concept in attempts to understand error in human machine systems. However, accounts which emphasize the processes of everyday organizing, such as accountability and work activity, are needed in order to establish organizational requirements for design. In this article, we provide a framework for the consideration of organizational contexts of human error in high-consequence work systems, with a view to integrating empirical insights and supporting practical design work. We draw on computer-supported cooperative work conceptualizations of the process of everyday organizing, particularly the notion of “accountability for work activity” which is pivotal to our organizational account of error. The conceptual framework is characterized here as a set of dimensions which are expressive concerning the relationship between accountability and work activity in different contexts: (1) explicit implicit; (2) global local; (3) stable transient and (4) dependent independent. The framework is demonstrated with respect to everyday work practices in a radiology department and its analytical utility validated with respect to two documented aviation system failures. Applying the framework has enabled us to identify and define, in terms of the dimensions, a number of contexts for vulnerability in high-consequence systems: contexts for collusion, violation, deference, loss of control, buck passing and complacency. These are discussed in terms of requirements for error-tolerant design. In the final section of the article, links between the various contexts for vulnerability and the design process are explored.},

abstract = {Accidents occurring in nuclear power plants cannot be depended upon to train experts of nuclear operators. Generally, this expertise is developed through the simulator training. In this training course, only limited varieties of malfunctions can be presented. Thus, it would be impossible for operators to cope with any other possible anomalies of diverse varieties. Operators have to reorganize knowledge and experiences obtained in the training. Of course, prescribed procedures are far from covering them. This paper presents the structure and contents of a “operator's mental model” and it can deal with flexible operations under any situation. Based on the record of the simulator experiments, in-depth analyses were conducted by interviewing with experienced operators in order to model operators' thinking patterns and also to arrive at the aims behind their actions and utterances. Summarizing the findings obtained, fundamental functions of the mental model in coping with anomalies resulted in the following: (1) suggesting suitable preventive measures by envisioning the ongoing (future) scenario of plant dynamics; (2) identifying causes by investigating symptoms and implying causal remedies to eliminate them or to avoid influences from them and (3) adopting immediate responses simply formulated by “if alarm A then action B”. These functions, as well as the mental model itself, can be made available by getting information on plant status and operator's structured knowledge together. The substances and structures of the mental models could be proposed, including implications of how to create it for a specific event, and finally they were synthesized into a more generalized format.},

abstract = {Analysis of naturally occurring information-seeking dialogues indicates that they usually consist of a number of distinct discourse segments, such as a greeting segment, a request issued by a user, an optional clarification segment, a transfer of information segment and a final closing segment. The clarification interaction is often initiated by the information provider and it may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) there is confusion regarding the user's intentions, (2) there is insufficient information to formulate a plan to satisfy a recognized intention, or (3) there is difficulty in formulating a plan that satisfies a recognized intention. Once the information provider determines the user's intention and formulates a plan to achieve this intention, the information transfer phase is initiated to inform the user about the proposed plan.In this paper, we present a mechanism for generating queries during the clarification stage and answers during the information transfer stage. Given a hierarchical representation of the alternatives possibly intended by a user and the probabilities of these alternatives, our mechanism determines the hierarchy level at which a query must be directed and the query to be posed in order to determine the alternative intended by the user. Once the user's intentions are ascertained, the mechanism determines whether additional information is required and the manner in which queries may be posed to acquire this information. When a user's intentions cannot be satisfied by means of a single plan, our mechanism enters into a negotiation process to alter the user's specifications until a valid plan is formulated. In the final stages of the interaction, the mechanism determines the information to be transferred and generates an answer to effect the transfer. The mechanisms for negotiation and for the generation of queries and answers described in this paper have been implemented in a system calledRADAR, a computerized information providing system that functions as a travel agent.},

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated that motion cues combined with stereoscopic viewing can enhance the perception of three-dimensional objects displayed on a two-dimensional computer screen. Using a variant of the mental rotation paradigm, subjects view pairs of object images presented on a computer terminal and judge whether the objects are the same or different. The effects of four variables on the accuracy and speed of decision performances are assessed: stereo vs. mono viewing, controlled vs. uncontrolled object motion, cube vs. sphere construction and wire frame vs. solid surface characteristic. Viewing the objects as three-dimensional images results in more accurate and faster decision performances. Furthermore, accuracy improves although response time increases when subjects control the object motion. Subjects are equally accurate comparing wire frame and solid images, although they take longer comparing wire frame images. The cube-based or sphere-based object construction has no impact on decision accuracy nor response time.},

abstract = {Validation has emerged as a significant problem in the development of knowledge based systems (KBS). Verification of KBS correctness and completeness has been cited as one of the most difficult aspects of validation. A number of software tools have been developed to perform such verification, but none of these are in widespread use. One of the reasons for this is that little quantitative evidence exists to demonstrate the effectiveness of the tools. This paper presents an experimental study of three KBS verification tools: a consistency checker, a completeness checker and a testing tool (for correctness). The tools are evaluated on their ability to reveal plausible faults seeded into a complex, realistic KBS application. The cost of using the tools is also measured. It is shown that each tool is independently effective at detecting certain kinds of fault and that the capabilities of the tools are complementary a result not revealed by previous studies.},

abstract = {Human intervention has played a critical role in the causes of many major accidents. At Three Mile Island, the operators isolated a reactor from its heat sink. The pilots of the Boeing 737 at Kegworth managed to shut down their one functioning engine. Staff continued to allow trains to deposit passengers in Kings Cross after the fire had started. In retrospect, it seems impossible to predict all of the ways that human intervention might threaten safety. It is, therefore, important that we learn as much as possible from those accidents that do occur. This task is complicated because conventional accident reports contain many hundreds of pages of prose. They present findings drawn from many different disciplines: metallurgy; systems engineering; human factors; meterology. These findings are, typically, separated into a number of distinct chapters. Each section focuses upon a different aspect of the accident. This makes it difficult for designers to recognize the ways in which operator intervention and system failure combine during major failures. The following pages use formal methods to address these concerns. It is argued that mathematical specification techniques can represent human factors and system failures. Unfortunately, formal methods have not previously been used to analyse the factors that motivate operator intervention. This paper, therefore, argues that epistemic extensions of mathematical notations must be recruited in order to support the formal analysis of major accidents.},

DCA treats a set of decision problems having some degree of similarity as a single unit. This paper presents a scheme within which a neural network is used to implement DCA. An influence diagram model is employed to represent the decision problem, since the diagram is a good tool for knowledge representation of complex decision problems under uncertainty. DCA under consideration is viewed as a classification problem where a set of input output data pairs is given. We thus utilize a feed-forward neural network with a supervised learning procedure so as to develop DCA and then to generate an influence diagram in the topological level. This paper also presents the results of the neural net simulation with an example of a class of decision problems.},

abstract = {Group support systems (GSS) represent one of the real success stories of research by the MIS academic community. There is no doubt that GSS academic research has had an impact on practice in the MIS field. This paper discusses the future of GSS research in terms of what is needed, some important research questions, and offers some possible directions. Section 1 describes what a GSS is and explains the underlying fundamental background. Section 2 explains why GSS research is needed. Section 3 describes the multimethodological approach that is needed for well-grounded GSS research programs. Section 4 discusses some of the major issues in applying GSS in organizational settings. Section 5 explores the scope of GSS research and the questions that need to be answered. Section 6 provides keys to successful distributed collaboration from our experience. Section 7 starts to answer the difficult question “what is needed for a distributed workspace?” Section 8 begins to clarify just what virtual reality can offer for distributed collaboration. Section 9 explains the justification for a virtual reality representation of the distributed office. Section 10 explores what we need to get real work done in a virtual workspace including: support for sense making during the process, automating bottlenecks in the process, modeling through simulation and animation, multiple languages, education, crisis response and software inspection. Research in GSS is just beginning and thousands of questions must be answered before we can have an understanding of the field.},

The distributed meeting scheduler is a collection of agents, responsible for scheduling meetings for their respective users. Users have preferences on when they like to meet, e.g. time of day, day of week, status of other invitees, topic of the meeting, etc. The agent must balance such concerns, proposing and accepting meeting times that satisfy as many of these criteria as possible. For example, a user might prefer not to meet at lunchtime unless the president of the company is hosting the meeting. We apply techniques from voting theory to arrive at consensus choices for meeting times while balancing different preferences.},

This paper uses the theory of persuasive arguments for studying group behavior in a computer-mediated, cross-cultural setting. Our findings illustrate that group decisions are a function of the medium of communication and the cultural setting in which the decision is attempted. In addition, the protocol analysis conducted demonstrates that the process of decision making in groups varies in terms of persuasive arguments exchanged as a function of the interaction between the medium of communication and the cultural setting observed. These results have both theoretical and practical implications for GSS research.},

abstract = {Past research has demonstrated that individual and group judgments are subject to systematic biases. Although much effort has been devoted to the debiasing of individual judgments, no corresponding work has been found on the debiasing of group judgments. This study examines the usefulness of a group support system (GSS) in addressing an important judgment bias, namely, the representativeness bias, which refers to the bias incurred in posterior-probability estimations by not properly utilizing all information sources, such as the base rates.The formation of a judgment is seen from the perspective of an information integration process. Two orthogonal dimensions of information integration interpersonalandintrapersonal are involved in group judgments. Interpersonal information integration concerns the aspect of information sharing among group members, and can be supported with the computer-mediated communication channel of GSS. Intrapersonal information integration deals with the information processing capacities and capabilities of individuals, and can be supported using a problem representation tool, as part of GSS.A laboratory experiment with a 2 2 factorial design was conducted. One hundred and twenty subjects, randomly allocated to 40 three-member groups, took part in the experiment. Data pertaining to both processes and outcomes were collected and analysed. Representativeness bias was reduced by the use of the problem representation tool. Increased use of the tool led to greater awareness about the base rate and, consequently, to better judgments in this problem context. On the other hand, computer-mediated communication did not reduce the representativeness bias. Although computer-mediated communication is capable of improving the interpersonal aspect of information integration, the representativeness bias is primarily a result of cognitive limitations, and benefits little from improved communication among group members. It is also possible that benefits of computer-mediated communication can be more readily derived by larger groups than by smaller groups of size three used in this study.},

A group member's success or failure in sharing unique information can have important impacts on meeting outcomes. This research builds on previous work which has examined various factors that impact information-sharing performance. To examine these issues, groups processed a hidden profile task, i.e. a task with an asymmetrical distribution of information. In addition, group size (groups of four and seven) and the level of structure (structured or unstructured agenda) were manipulated. Results show that group size had no effect on information sharing. However, groups using the structured agenda shared more initially-shared information and initially-unshared information. Although no relationship was found between information-sharing performance and decision quality, a curvilinear (U-shaped) relationship between information sharing and satisfaction was observed. These results show that, for hidden-profile tasks, a critical performance level must be reached before performance is positively related to satisfaction. The paper concludes with a discussion of the findings and the implications for future research and use.},

Forty-three students of an introductory Prolog course solved five different Prolog programming problems in each of three different conditions (using isomorphic problem variants to disguise recurring tasks). Each of the three conditions provided subjects with static screen-snapshot-mockups derived from one of three different trace packages (“conventional” Spy; “graphical AND/OR tree-based” TPM*; “informative textual” EPTB). When traces explicitly displayed the information asked for in the problem, subjects solved the problems more quickly. Conversely, when trace output obscured the required information (or necessitated difficult detective work to uncover the information), solution times were longer and answers less accurate. Deciding on a “good” format for display is thus a task-dependent decision, and impacts directly on the user's cognitive ability to solve a problem.},

These are added to the task model to specify what type of information is required during the task. The next step selects appropriate means of information delivery according to the users' needs. Different information access and display paradigms, e.g. hypertext, data retrieval and display media are considered. The method is illustrated with a case study of a shipboard information system.},

abstract = {Structure-preserving design has emerged as an important principle in Knowledge Engineering for developing knowledge-based systems. The principle prescribes the construction of increasingly more detailed models of the functionality of the knowledge-based system, while the information content and structure of the initial model are maintained throughout the process. It is, however, not trivial to come up with such models: their construction is still more an art than a science. Libraries with reusable components provide generic structures ready for selection and adaptation to the specific requirements at hand. We show the construction of a conceptual and formal model of a diagnostic reasoner through the use of two respective libraries, following the structure-preserving design principle. We include a proof that the high-level conceptual specification of the reasoner is ensured by the formal model presented.},

abstract = {This special issue arises out of a symposium entitled “The Missing Link: Hypermedia Usability Research &amp; The Web”, held at The Open University's Knowledge Media Institute in May 1996 (Buckingham Shum, 1996). As the title suggests, we felt there was something missing between the vast amount of hypermedia and related human computer interaction (HCI) research that has been conducted, and the most popular hypermedia system in existence the World Wide Web. Certainly, the web community, by and large, seemed to be ignoring the hypermedia research literature and, as Santayana (1905) notes, “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it”.However, it was possible that our view was inaccurate or even that the web was sufficiently different to its predecessors to make earlier findings irrelevant. The symposium set out to explore such issues.The idea for the symposium was obviously timely, following closely after two similar but independently organized events in the US. A workshop (Instone, 1996b) held during the Hypertext 96 conference was structured around the questions: What hypermedia research has influenced the web__ __ What hypermedia research needs to be implemented in the web__ __ What issues has the web raised which should be researched further__ __ Similarly, the CHI 96 conference included a workshop on “HCI and the web” (Instone &amp; Pemberton, 1996), subsequently reported by Instone (1996a).},

Tools are essential for good design; without them iterative design and user testing are impractical to follow through because of the prohibitive costs of making even small changes reliably. Gentler is one such authoring tool. It uses a database of pages and a page layout language, providing reliable design features including hypertext linkage and navigation. With Gentler as a concrete example, we introduce an important principle for design:dual requirements. Features that hypertext document readers find beneficial are beneficial for document authors, andvice versa.},

Following this analogy, sophisticated application environments on the World Wide Web will require third- and fourth-generation hypermedia features. Implementing third- and fourth-generation hypermedia involves designing both high-level hypermedia features and the high-level authoring environments system developers build for authors to specify them. We present a set of high-level hypermedia features including typed nodes and links, link attributes, structure-based query, transclusions, warm and hot links, private and public links, hypermedia access permissions, computed personalized links, external link databases, link update mechanisms, overviews, trails, guided tours, backtracking and history-based navigation. We ground our discussion in the hypermedia research literature, and illustrate each feature both from existing implementations and a running scenario. We also give some direction for implementing these on the World Wide Web and in other information systems.},

The result is a set of techniques for using structured dialogue between users and designers to increase designers' understanding of specific domains of users' work. To the extent that the design of an artifact is grounded in the specific context of a work domain, systematic, efficient access to workplace expertise is a requirement of the design process. Because it is primarily “content-driven”, the design of World Wide Web sites is particularly suited to the development of design rationale via structured dialogue which represents the ways of thinking and conversing characteristic of a work domain.},

abstract = {The paper considers the usability of the World Wide Web in the light of a decade of research into the usability of hypertext and hypermedia systems. The concepts of virtual hierarchies and virtual networks are introduced as a mechanism for alleviating some of the shortcomings inherent in the current implementations of the web, without violating its basic philosophy. It is suggested that virtual hierarchies and virtual networks will assist users to find task-relevant information more easily and quickly and also help web authors to ensure that their pages are targeted at the users who wish to see them.The paper first analyses the published work on hypermedia usability, identifying the assumptions that underlie this research and relating them to the assumptions underlying the web. Some general conclusions are presented about both hypermedia usability principles and their applicability to the web. These results are coupled with problems identified from other sources to produce a requirements list for improving web usability. A possible solution is then presented which utilizes the capabilities of existing distributed information management software to permit web users to create virtual hierarchies and virtual networks. Some ways in which these virtual structures assist searchers to find useful information, and thus help authors to publicize their information more effectively, are described. The explanation is illustrated by examples taken from the GENIE Service, an implementation of some of the ideas. This uses the World Wide Web as a means of allowing global environmental change researchers throughout the world to find data that may be relevant to their research.},

In this paper, we describe our approach to the development of an Internet-based course designed for distance education. Using this experience, we provide general observations on the opportunities and constraints which the web provides and on the pedagogic issues which arise when using this delivery mechanism.We have found that the process of developing web-based courses is one area which requires careful consideration as technologies and tools for both the authoring and the delivery of courses are evolving so rapidly. We have also found that current tools are severely lacking in a number of important respects particularly with respect to the design of pedagogically sound courseware.},

abstract = {We report on users' revisitation patterns to World Wide Web (web) pages, and use the results to lay an empirical foundation for the design of history mechanisms in web browsers. Through history, a user can return quickly to a previously visited page, possibly reducing the cognitive and physical overhead required to navigate to it from scratch. We analysed 6 weeks of detailed usage data collected from 23 users of a well-known web browser. We found that 58% of an individual's pages are revisits, and that users continually add new web pages into their repertoire of visited pages. People tend to revisit pages just visited, access only a few pages frequently, browse in very small clusters of related pages and generate only short sequences of repeated URL paths. We compared different history mechanisms, and found that the stack-based prediction method prevalent in commercial browsers is inferior to the simpler approach of showing the last few recently visited URLs with duplicates removed. Other predictive approaches fare even better. Based on empirical evidence, eight design guidelines for web browser history mechanisms were then formulated. When used to evaluate the existing hypertext-based history mechanisms, they explain why some aspects of today's browsers seem to work well, and other's poorly. The guidelines also indicate how history mechanisms in the web can be made even more effective.f1f1This article is a major expansion of a conference paper (Tauscher &amp; Greenberg, 1997).

The system monitors user operations on the articles and reflects them in the user profiles. Differently from conventional newspapers on the WWW, our system sends an interaction agent implemented as a Java applet to the client side, and the agent monitors the user operations and creates each user's newspaper pages automatically. The server side manages user profiles and anticipates how interesting an article would be for each user. The interaction agent on the client side manages all the user interactions, including the automatic layout of pages. Our system has page multiple layout algorithms and the user can switch from one view to another anytime, according to the preference or machine environment. On one of the views, the user can even see all the articles sequentially without performing any operations. We evaluated a scheme in which the user scores each article explicitly, and a scheme in which all the personalization is done automatically. The results show that automatic personalization works well when some parameters are set properly.},

In this paper, we describe how our students used such forms to remotely control a symbolic debugger executing algorithms in the on-line version of a book used in their data structure course. After describing in detail how the user interface is built and how the students can interact with it, we focus on the limitations of this approach and how this interface could be enhanced with the use of more recent developments such as applets.},

Social navigation phenomena are quite common although most current tools (like web browsers or email clients) offer very little support for it. We describe why social navigation is useful and how it can be supported better in future systems. We further describe two prototype systems that, although originally not designed explicitly as tools for social navigation, provide features that are typical for social navigation systems. One of these systems, the Juggler system, is a combination of a textual virtual environment and a web client. The other system is a prototype of a web-hotlist organizer, called Vortex. We use both systems to describe fundamental principles of social navigation systems.},

abstract = {Virtual documents are hypermedia documents that are generated on demand in response to reader input. This paper describes a virtual document application that generates natural language explanations about the structure and behavior of electromechanical systems. The application, called DME, structures the interaction with the reader as a question answer dialog. Each page of the hyperdocument is the answer to a question, and each link on each page is a follow-up question that leads to another answer. DME is amodel-basedvirtual document generator; unlike conventional database front-ends that provide views onto data, DME dynamically constructs the document's content (i.e. coherent explanations in English) from underlying mathematical and symbolic models. DME-based virtual documents have been running on the WWW since late 1993. They are used to document engineered systems in support of collaborative design and simulation-based training.In this paper we describe and demonstrate the DME application (with examples that run), and describe how it generates virtual documents on the web. We discuss the impact that model-based virtual documentation can have on the way technical documentation is authored and delivered.},

This paper describes one of these tools, theBSCW Shared Workspace system a centralized cooperative application integrated with an unmodified web server and accessible from standard web browsers. The BSCW system supports cooperation through “shared workspaces”; small repositories in which users can upload documents, hold threaded discussions and obtain information on the previous activities of other users to coordinate their own work. The current version of the system is described in detail, including design choices resulting from use of the web as a cooperation platform and feedback from users following the release of a previous version of BSCW to the public domain.},

abstract = {In any design process, there are different perspectives that need to be accommodated. For the design of interactive systems, two of these are that of the computer system designer and that of the end user. The focus of this paper is on tools or notations to support the integration of these different perspectives in particular, system modelling and theory-based user modelling. There are few established techniques for doing such integration; those that there are generally involve a loose coupling between the description of the system and that of the user, or are skewed towards one or other of these viewpoints. Recently, techniques that deal with the system and user more symmetrically have emerged. We focus, in particular, on techniques that have been developed and investigated within a large European project, Amodeus. These allow the analyst to explore properties of the conjoint system, and to investigate how the properties of the interaction relate to those of the individual agents. However, there is a trade-off, which can be characterized as increased power to critique a design being offset against reduced generality in the design perspectives that can be considered using the technique. We argue that while such techniques require a high initial investment, technological advances make the need for such integrated approaches urgent. We consider what resources each class of technique demands and what kinds of results each yields.},

PSMs have been proposed as a comprehensive and feasible approach to the construction of conceptual models for knowledge-based systems (KBSs). A number of evaluations of this approach have been reported in the literature. Most of these evaluations have involved toy problems or reverse engineering of existing KBSs. In this paper we have applied Benjamins' library to a real-life task.In this paper, we discuss how we have applied the PSMs during conceptual knowledge modelling, and how we had to adapt them to suit our task. We have found that the library of PSMs was extremely helpful in our project. Thanks to this reuse, the complete scope and quality of the “prime diagnostic method” was incorporated in our application, ambiguities in the task and domain were brought to light and the functional specifications of the target system were structured transparently. Since the reuse of library components in our real-life application was not trivial, we emphasize on the need for guidelines that support knowledge engineers to apply libraries of PSMs during the development of real-life KBSs.},

abstract = {In recent years, a body of literature has developed which shows that users' perceptions of software are a key element in its ultimate acceptance and use. We focus on how the interaction style and prior experience with similar software affect users' perceptions of software packages. In our experiment, direct manipulation, menu-driven and command-driven interfaces were investigated. We studied users' perceptions of the software in two hands-on training sessions. In the first session, novice users were given initial training with word-processing software, and in the second session the users were trained on a word processor which was functionally equivalent to the prior one, but had a different interaction style. In the initial training session, we found that the interaction style had a reliable but small effect on learners' perceptions of ease of use. The direct manipulation interface was judged easier to use than the command style. The interaction style, however, did not affect learners' perceptions of the usefulness of the software. In the second training session, subjects who had used a direct manipulation interface in the first session learned either the menu-based or command-based software. The perceptions of these users were compared to those of learners, who had used the menu or command software in the initial training session. We found that both interaction style and the prior experience with a direct manipulation interface affected perceptions of ease of use. Subjects with prior experience of a direct style interface tended to have very negative attitudes toward a less direct interface style. The interaction style did not affect perceptions of usefulness of the package, but the prior experience did. These results suggest that users' attitudes toward software are strongly influenced by their past history of usage, including what interaction styles the user has encountered, and this should be considered in the design of software and training programs.},

The first procedure tests the casualness of a prediction to ensure that the prediction is not based on only a few (casual) observations. The second procedure tests the conditional casualness of an attribute within a prediction rule.The procedures are applied to three data sets, originally published in the context of rough set analysis. We argue that several claims of these analyses need to be modified because of lacking validity, and that other possibly significant results were overlooked.},

abstract = {A laboratory experiment examines the claims that (1) humans are susceptible to flattery from computers and (2) the effects of flattery from computers are the same as the effects of flattery from humans. In a cooperative task with a computer, subjects (N=41) received one of three types of feedback from a computer: “sincere praise”, “flattery” (insincere praise) or “generic feedback”. Compared to generic-feedback subjects, flattery subjects reported more positive affect, better performance, more positive evaluations of the interaction and more positive regard for the computer, even though subjects knew that the flattery from the computer was simply noncontingent feedback. Subjects in the sincere praise condition responded similarly to those in the flattery condition. The study concludes that the effects of flattery from a computer can produce the same general effects as flattery from humans, as described in the psychology literature. These findings may suggest significant implications for the design of interactive technologies.},

While there is little agreement on exactly what constitutes an intelligent agent, many definitions embody a user-interface model that differs from the traditional one where users perform tasks with the help of computer-based “tools”. In contrast, the “delegation” model associated with agents is based on entrusting tasks to an autonomous, sometimes anthropomorphized system, whose performance is monitored and evaluated. This change in user-interface model is a dramatic one since delegation can be a difficult and often-avoided behavior in humans. Agent-interface designs need to overcome well-established drawbacks in delegation. For this purpose, designers should find the management sciences and organizational psychology literatures to be as relevant as that of traditional human factors. This paper describes issues regarding task delegation as they pertain to the design of intelligent-agent user interfaces.},

Little is yet known about how and why people in organizations choose amongnewmedia like electronic mail and voice mail, although the availability and use of new media are increasing dramatically. Media richness theory (MRT) is the most prominent, if contested, theory of media choice. It is concerned with identifying the most appropriate medium in terms of “medium richness” for communication situations characterized by equivocality and uncertainty. From this theory, we derived hypotheses about how and why individuals will choose between electronic mail and voice mail and tested them among users of both media in the corporate headquarters of a large company. The data are analysed using both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The results fail to support MRT, but they do support alternative explanations of people's media choice behavior. While the concept of media richness is too poor to explain the richness of people's media use behavior, our behavioral findings and explanations should prove useful to those building the next generation of integrated multimedia communication tools.},

Two main problems are addressed: dealing with too much data and allowing simulation steering. The agent solves these problems by extracting semantically interesting data for spatial and temporal understanding, enabling a dynamic and flexible behavior for simulation-integrated control, and intelligently creating visualizations that intuitively display the selected data. A significant event language is proposed to capture the semantically interesting data through event expressions which can then be parsed and monitored. Behavior is achieved through programmable, hierarchical finite-state machines with events mapped to the arcs and interactions with the visualization and simulation mapped to the nodes. A knowledge-based data mapping process has been designed which uses visual perceptual knowledge and problem-specific knowledge represented in cognitive maps to create visualizations. This architecture has been applied within a watershed simulation application and a prototype has been developed.},

abstract = {Decision support systems often require knowledge of users' preferences. However, preferences may vary among individual users or be difficult for users to articulate. This paper describes how user preferences can be acquired in the form ofpreference predicatesby a learning apprentice system and proposes two new instance-based algorithms for preference predicate acquisition: 1ARCandCompositional Instance-Based Learning(CIBL). An empirical evaluation using simulated preference behavior indicated that the instance-based approaches are preferable to decision-tree induction and perceptrons as the learning component of a learning apprentice system, if representation of the relevant characteristics of problem-solving states, requires a large number of attributes, if attributes interact in a complex fashion, or if there are very few training instances. Conversely, decision-tree induction or perceptron learning is preferable if there are a small number of attributes and the attributes do not interact in a complex fashion unless there are very few training instances. When tested as the learning component of a learning apprentice system used by astronomers for scheduling astronomical observations, both CIBL and decision-tree induction rapidly achieved useful levels of accuracy in predicting the astronomers' preferences.},

In this paper the KARO approach is introduced which provides various means of retrieving and adapting components of an ontology as part of a domain model construction process. KARO is based on the knowledge-processing component LILOG-KR provided by the LILOG text-understanding system. Above all, the notion of classification is applied for the retrieval of relevant categories. The upper structure of LILOG-KB serves as an exemplary ontology. By integrating KARO into the Model-based and Incremental Knowledge Engineering Environment (MIKE) the reuse of a predefined ontology can be integrated into the development process of expert systems in a systematic way.},

This paper describes an architecture for production of explanations that justify reasoning that is based on the premises that (1) the task of justifying expert decisions is an intelligence-requiring activity and (2) the appropriate model for machine-produced justifications should be explanations written by people. The architecture consists of (1) a processing strategy for an Augmented Phrase Structured Grammar (APSG) for the purpose of structuring text, (2) a special language designed for writing text structuring grammars, and (3) a Justification Grammar (JG) representing the structure of justification texts. A prototype justification production system is presented to demonstrate how the model can be used to synthesize knowledge from a variety of sources and produce coherent, multisentential text similar to that produced by a domain expert.},

The present research refined this technique by exploring inter and intra subject differences in digraph latency distributions. Experiment 1 showed that there is marked heterogeneity in the latency with which individual subjects type different digraphs. Consequently, it was found that typist verification accuracy improved when a digraph-specific index of the distance between test and reference digraph latencies was employed. Experiment 1 also showed the utility of nonlinear modelling as a tool to establish optimum verification parameter settings. Experiment 2 showed that the use of a common low-pass temporal filter cutoff setting for all typists when screening digraphs is unwise. It was found that there is a significant interaction between subjects and filter settings such that verification accuracy may improve if subject-specific filter settings are used.},

If this is true, the iconic language should be adapted to the user's characteristics. This paper presents results of a study that was aimed at designing the iconic language of a medical decision support system to be used in several European countries. The study included four main phases: listing and classification of the messages to be represented, collection of proposals about icons from representatives of potential users, preparation of candidates for evaluation and final evaluation of candidates by a sample of users. Results of this study indicate which icons are universally considered as "good" or "bad", and which ones are "controversial", that is, which are clearly preferred or clearly rejected by different interviewed subgroups. These results are also compared with results of previous studies, to single out factors which seem to condition acceptance of iconic messages. Finally, the paper describes the architecture of the interface which supports adapting icons to the user characteristics.},

abstract = {Models of physical systems range from those of initial individual cognition to mathematical representations on a computer which are accepted as the developed final models. It is conjectured that a formalization of the qualitative cognitive models will help us to understand how they are formed and will eventually help us to produce better computer models. The structure of these models would provide qualitative descriptions and explanations of behaviour which could be assimilated by non-specialists. It is argued that cognitive models should be produced with an awareness of the possible form of the final computer model. To illustrate this, a case study of the development of the cognitive and computer models of a naturally parallel physical process is presented. This early work is part of the broader goal of producing an appropriate computing environment through which various models and techniques are combined for producing explanations. A procedure for developing models from the primitive stage to computer implementation is suggested. Theories in cognitive science and research on mental models are briefly discussed.},

In order to address this problem, we built a special interface designed to improve group effectiveness. The special interface is based on a communication competency model that assumes group effectiveness in a particular task depends upon the performance of certain competencies (or skills) that aid groups in collective problem solving. In order to support this model, we provide special online tools that correspond to and, in turn, support each of the competencies. This paper presents an evaluation of the Computer-Supported Cooperative Training (CSCT) environment and delineates the group behaviors that lead to successful task performance in this environment. Groups using the interface demonstrated more effective skills when compared with groups who performed the same task face-to-face. Furthermore, the CSCT environment showed that the competencies relating to group problem description and generation of alternative solutions were the most predictive of successful group interaction.},

abstract = {This study investigates strategies in failure diagnosis at cutting-machine-tools with a verbal knowledge acquisition technique. Sixty-nine semi-structured interviews were performed with mechanical and electrical maintenance technicians, and a protocol analysis was conducted. Strategies were analysed in dependence of the technician's job experience, his familiarity with the problem and problem complexity. The technicians were categorized into three groups, novices, advanced, and experts, based upon level of experience. Results show that typical strategies of failure diagnosis are "Historical information", "Least effort", "Reconstruction", and "Sensory check". Strategies that lead to a binary reduction of the problem space, such as "Information uncertainty" and "Split half", play only a minor role in real-life failure diagnosis. Job experience and the familiarity with the problem significantly influenced the occurrence of strategies. In addition to "Symptomatic search" and "Topographic search", results show frequent use of case-based strategies, particularly in routine failures. In novel situations, technicians usually used "Topographic search". A software design method, the strategy-based software design (SSD) is proposed, that uses strategies to derive decision support systems, that are adaptive to the different working styles and the changing levels of experience in user groups. The methodology is briefly described and illustrated by the development of an information support system for maintenance and repair.},

abstract = {This article advocates, as alternative for either the "classical" technology- or user-centred approach, to focus on the joint human-computer task performance in system design. Human involvement can be improved by designing system functions which complement human knowledge and capacities. Based on general needs for cognitive support, an aiding function is proposed which in the process of task execution takes the initiative to present context-specific, procedural task knowledge. Design of such aiding comprises two aspects: design of software and design of a human-computer system. Modern model-based software engineering methods provide strong support for the design of software systems, but little support for modelling the human-computer interaction. Current model-based methods are extended to address human-computer interaction issues. The resulting method comprises the design of easy-to-use-and-learn interfaces providing, if needed, aiding. In a case study, the method is applied to design a conventional plain interface and an aiding interface for the statistical program HOMALS. In an experiment, users with minor HOMALS expertise prove to perform their tasks better and to learn more with the aiding interface.},

abstract = {This paper re-assesses the role of real-time video as a technology to support interpersonal communications at distance. We review three distinct hypotheses about the role of video in the coordination of conversational content and process. For each hypothesis, we identify design implications and outstanding research questions derived from current findings. We first evaluate the non-verbal communication hypothesis, namely the prevailing assumption that the role of video is to supplement speech, and embodied in applications such as videoconferencing and videophone. We conclude that previous work has overestimated the importance of video at the expense of audio. This finding has strong implications for the implementation of such systems, and we make recommendations about both synchronization and bandwidth allocation. Furthermore our own recent studies of workplace interactions point to other communicative functions of video. Current systems have neglected another potentially vital role of visual information in supporting the process of achieving opportunistic connection. Rather than providing a supplement to audio information, video is used to assess the communication availability of others. Visual information therefore promotes the types of remote opportunistic communications that are prevalent in face-to-face settings. We discuss early experiments with such connection applications and identify outstanding design and implementation issues. Finally we discuss another novel application of video "video-as-data". Here the video image is used to transmit information about the work objects themselves, rather than information about interactants, creating a dynamic shared workspace, and simulating a shared physical environment. In conclusion we suggest that research move away from an exclusive focus on non-verbal communication, and begin to investigate these other uses of real-time video.},

abstract = {Topoi are gradual inference rules, often used by experts in several types of problems: they can be exploited at various phases of a knowledge-based system life cycle. In this article, after justifying the interest of topoi, we try to answer the following question: how to help the knowledge engineer to elicit gradual knowledge from the expert and to exploit it? In this purpose, we distinguish two viewpoints for studying the notion of topoi, according to the two levels distinguished by Newell: the knowledge level and the symbol level. We formalize topoi through several qualitative physics formalisms. We exploit some knowledge elicitation techniques such as rating grids and some knowledge acquisition methods such as KADS and KOD in order to facilitate the acquisition of topoi. At the symbol level, we propose different ways for representing and implementing topoi. Last, we study the issues of topoi-based validation and we describe a possible topoi-based tool. Throughout the article, we illustrate our ideas by examples of topoi in traffic accident analysis.},

Next, we discuss the knowledge representation, specifically designed to meet the needs of flexible, interactive knowledge management. The highly-developed user interface, which we believe to be critical for this type of system, is explained in some detail. We finally describe how CODE4 is being used in a number of applications.},

abstract = {We report an experiment designed to compare human-human spoken dialogues with human-computer spoken dialogues. Our primary purpose was to collect data on protocols that were used to control the interaction. Three groups of subjects (35 total) were each asked to complete tasks over the phone. The experimental procedure was a new variation on the Wizard of Oz simulation technique that allowed much clearer comparisons to be made between human-human and human-computer interactions.Previous studies have shown that there are significant differences between human-human and human-computer interactions. While some effects can be attributed to the beliefs about computers the subjects bring to the task, others appear to be connected with the ongoing interaction styles of the speakers. Our study focuses on effects created by differences in interaction style. An important feature of the study is the use of two wizards, a technique which resulted in a realistically degraded communication channel.A second important feature of this study is the emphasis on computational models of spoken dialogue processing. One of the aims of Wizard of Oz studies is to identify language restrictions that will make the understanding task easier yet still be acceptable to the users. We observed that subjects could indeed successfully carry out their task with a restricted turn-taking protocol. More importantly, however, the experiment pointed us in the direction of a less restricted protocol and provided the data for a more sophisticated computational model of turn-taking.An important aspect of our study is the light it appears to shed on conflicting results in the literature. We discuss how these conflicts can be explained in terms of differences in interlocution style. We argue that ongoing interlocution style has a significant effect on the dialogue and over-rides a priori models of interlocutor ability.},

abstract = {This research reports on the experimental test of several causes of user errors while composing database queries. The query language under consideration is Structured Query Language (SQL), the industry standard language for querying databases. Unfortunately, users commit many errors when using SQL. To understand user errors, a model of query writing was developed that integrated a GOMS-type analysis of query writing with the characteristics of human cognition. This model revealed multiple cognitive causes of a frequent and troublesome error, join clause omission. This semantic user error returns answers from the database that may be undetectably wrong, affecting users, decision makers, and programmers.The model predicted four possible causes of join clause omission, and empirical testing revealed that all four contributed to the error. Specifically, the frequency of this error increased because (1) the load on working memory caused by writing intervening clauses made the users forget to include the join clause, (2) an explicit clue to write the join clause was absent from the problem statement, (3) users inappropriately reused the procedure appropriate for a single table query, which requires no join clause, when a join clause is indeed necessary, and (4) some users never learned the correct procedure. These results are significant for understanding user errors in general and for developing new interfaces and training schemes for the task of writing database queries.},

abstract = {The paper presents a user interface toolkit to support the construction of cooperative multi-user interfaces. The toolkit is based on the configuration of shared interface objects to construct cooperative interfaces. A principal focus of the toolkit is the provision of accessible facilities to manage interface configuration and tailoring. Most existing facilities to manage multi-user interfaces tend to be application specific and provide only limited tailorability for purpose built cooperative applications.In addition, the current structure of most cooperative applications fails to separate the semantics of applications from the cooperation specific semantics. In this paper we present a multi-user interface toolkit that provides management facilities in a manner which separates appropriate features of cooperative use from application semantics. This is achieved by allowing multi-user interfaces to be derived from a common shared interface constructed from shared interface objects. We would suggest that the separation of semantics in this form represents an initial identification of the re-usable cooperative interface components.},

abstract = {Novice users make many errors when they first try to learn how to work with a computer program like a spreadsheet or wordprocessor. No matter how user-friendly the software or the training manual, errors can and will occur. The current view on errors is that they can be helpful or disruptive, depending on the extent to which they are controlled in the learning process. This study examines one of the ways in which such error control can be brought about, namely by investigating the design and role of error-information in a (tutorial) manual. The error-information was designed to support the detection, diagnosis and correction of errors of novice users, and it was based on a general model of error-handling. In an experiment a manual that contained ample error-information was compared to a manual in which there was hardly any error-information. The outcomes showed that the presence of the error-information in the manual helped subjects perform better during practice as well as after practice. Among others, these subjects completed training faster and showed superior corrective knowledge and skill after practice, in addition to having acquired the same level of constructive skill. The discussion addresses the compensating roles of support for error-handling on screen and on paper.},

abstract = {Widespread interest in the evaluation of human-system interfaces has led to the development of various techniques in usability engineering. Usability evaluations are usually carried out on interface prototypes. However, if the design involves hardware implementation, such as a special keypad or a control panel layout, producing hardware prototypes for evaluation can be expensive and time-consuming. One solution to this problem is to use software tools for design simulation. In this case, a question which must be answered is: will a simulated prototype produce the same conclusions as a hardware prototype? That is, is software simulation a valid approach? The main purpose of this paper is to address this issue through an experiment. A multimedia authoring package was used to simulate several potential telephone handset designs for telephone-computer interfaces. The simulated prototypes were tested and compared with a physical keyboard for validation. The experiment did confirm the validity of simulation in this particular setting. It also demonstrated the advantages of using a software tool to build the prototype and to automate the evaluation process, including user training, test setting, and data collection.},

abstract = {Causal knowledge is often cyclic and fuzzy, thus it is hard to represent in the form of trees. A fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) can represent causal knowledge as a signed directed graph with feedback. It provides an intuitive framework in which to form decision problems as perceived by decision makers and to incorporate the knowledge of experts. This paper proposes a fuzzy time cognitive map (FTCM), which is a FCM introduced to a time relationship on arrows. We first discuss the characteristics and basic assumptions of the FCM, and present a description of causal propagations in a FCM with the causalities of negative-positive-neutral interval, -1, 1]. We develop a method of translating the FTCM, that has a different time lag, into the FTCM that has one or the same unit-time lag, which is a value-preserving translation. With the FTCM, we illustrate analysing the change of causalities among factors according to lapse of time.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new machine learning system called SHAPE. The input data are vectors of properties (represented as attribute-value pairs) which are used to describe individual cases, examples or observations in a given world. Each case belongs to exactly one of a set of classes, and the aim is to produce a collection of decision rules concluding the class according to the properties observed.SHAPE follows three steps. First, we build up an acyclic graph capturing dependencies among the properties involved. Since we endow this net with a semantic interpretation, we are allowed to read the net as a first draft of classification rules. Secondly, we will rewrite these rules to compact their syntactic description using automata minimization techniques, Finally, the rules are generalized in order to obtain the definite intensional description of the thus learned concepts.Let us remark that the last two stages could be applied to a set of rules attached to a collection of examples coming from any other learning system.To close the paper, we also present different experiments made with SHAPE to illustrate the performance of the system in a wide range of applications.},

abstract = {Formalisms for the description of procedural knowledge, such as action grammars and production systems, do not allow for direct handling of the semantic of objects which are involved in the actions. As models focusing on rules, objects only appear through rule triggering conditions, and hence preclude opportunities to make the overall semantic structure of the task world explicit.After a critical review of action grammars and their semantic extensions, the PROCOPE formalism is presented as an alternative way to describe know-how focusing on objects. Goals and procedures to reach goals are treated as properties of objects, just as structural properties; i.e. they are the functional properties of objects. Handled in this way, goals and procedures, because they categorize objects, are used to generate the class inclusion semantic network which is the core of the PROCOPE description.A major advantage of PROCOPE over rule-based systems is its ability to express the part of cognitive complexity which is due, not to the number of procedures, but to the complexity of the overall structure generated by the way the objects involved in the actions are sharing those procedures.Finally, we present the PROCOPE software and we show how it has been put to practical use.},

The paper focuses on the theory underlying measurements and its application to knowledge valuation; it stresses the issue of constructing meaningful measures rather than discussing some of the desirable properties of measures (e.g. reliability or validity). A detailed example of knowledge valuation using the measures is described. The example demonstrates the importance for system understanding and the difficulty of valuating knowledge. It shows the importance of employing several different measures simultaneously for a single valuation. The paper concludes by discussing the scope of and relationships between the measures.},

As a clear example of our claim, this paper describes an experimental trackball device that provides the user with the less common E-feedback in addition to the conventional layered I-feedback in the form of the momentary cursor position on the screen and the kinetic forces from the ball. In particular, the machine expresses its expectation concerning the goal position of the cursor by exerting an extra force to the trackball.Two optical sensors and two servo motors are used in the described trackball device with contextual force feedback. One combination of position sensor and servo motor handles the cursor position and tactile feedback along the x -axis, the other combination controls that along the y-axis. By supplying supportive force feedback as a function of the current display contents and the momentary cursor position, the user's movements are guided towards the cursor target position expected by the machine. The force feedback diminishes the visual processing load of the user and combines increased ease of use with robustness of manipulation.Experiments with a laboratory version of this new device have shown that the force feedback significantly enhances speed and accuracy of pointing and dragging, while the effort needed to master the trackball is minimal compared with that for the conventional trackball without force feedback.},

abstract = {A common subtask in spreadsheet calculation is the transformation of verbal task instructions into spreadsheet formulas. This task can be used to study the relation of imagery to thinking. Research using physics and mathematics problems has indicated that mental transformation from verbal to mathematical representations is not necessarily direct but is intermediated by imagery. Therefore, a human-computer interaction task such as spreadsheet calculation provides a good task environment for analysing mental imagery operations, the role of imagery operations, and the role of intermediate imagery in thinking tasks. Testing the use of imagery in spreadsheet calculations also improves our understanding of representational systems used in this specific task and in user interfaces in general.Four experiments provided different types of evidence for the intermediate imagery hypothesis, which means that subjects do not directly transform verbal instructions into spreadsheet formulas. They first try to code an overall image of the areas referred to by verbal instructions, segment it into suitable fields, and only thereafter do they write down the set of formulas which best extract the information demanded. Typically, the field borders, used in this segmentation are often imagined and are not presented at all in the original verbal task instructions.Intermediate imagery is a relevant notion in discussing the construction of user models because the most important current models, such as GOMS, assume only propositional representations. Also, the use of images should be taken into account in designing spreadsheet packages by providing features which aid analog information processing.},

abstract = {Building useful systems with an ability to understand "real" natural language input has long been an elusive goal for Artificial Intelligence. Well-known problems such as ambiguity, indirectness, and incompleteness of natural language inputs have thwarted efforts to build natural language interfaces to intelligent systems. In this article, we report on our work on a model of understanding natural language design specifications of physical devices such as simple electrical circuits. Our system, called KA, solves the classical problems of ambiguity, incompleteness and indirectness by exploiting the knowledge and problem-solving processes in the situation of designing simple physical devices. In addition, KA acquires its knowledge structures (apart from a basic ontology of devices) from the results of its problem-solving processes. Thus, KA can be bootstrapped to understand design specifications and user feedback about new devices using the knowledge structures it acquired from similar devices designed previously.In this paper, we report on three investigations in the KA project. Our first investigation demonstrates that KA can resolve ambiguities in design specifications as well as infer unarticulated requirements using the ontology, the knowledge structures, and the problem-solving processes provided by its design situation. The second investigation shows that KA's problem-solving capabilities help ascertain the relevance of indirect design specifications, and identify unspecified relations between detailed requirements. The third investigation demonstrates the extensibility of KA's theory of natural language understanding by showing that KA can interpret user feedback as well as design requirements. Our results demonstrate that situating language understanding in problem solving, such as device design in KA, provides effective solutions to unresolved problems in natural language processing.},

abstract = {Current collaborative learning systems focus on maximizing shared information. However, "meaningful learning" is not simply information sharing but also knowledge construction. CLARE is a computer-supported learning environment that facilitates meaningful learning through collaborative knowledge construction. It provides a semi-formal representation language called RESRA and an explicit process model called SECAI. Experimental evaluation through 300 hours of classroom usage indicates that CLARE does support meaningful learning. It also shows that a major bottleneck to computer-mediated knowledge construction is summarization. Lessons learned through the design and evaluation of CLARE provide new insights into both collaborative learning systems and collaborative learning theories.},

abstract = {Two experiments were conducted to compare several methods of numeric and text entry for pen-based computers. For numeric entry, the conditions were hand printing, tapping on a soft keypad, stroking a moving pie menu, and stroking a pie pad. For the pie conditions, strokes are made in the direction that numbers appear on a clock face. For the moving pie menu, strokes were made directly in the application, as with hand printing. For the pie pad, strokes were made on top of one another on a separate pie pad, with the results sent to the application. Based on speed and accuracy, the entry methods from best to worst were soft keypad (30 wpm, 1.2% errors), hand printing (18.5 wpm, 10.4% errors), pie pad (15.1 wpm, 14.6% errors), and moving pie menu (12.4 wpm, 16.4% errors).For text entry, the conditions were hand printing, tapping on a soft keyboard with a QWERTY layout, and tapping on a soft keyboard with an ABC layout (two rows of sequential characters). Tapping on the soft QWERTY keyboard was the quickest (23 wpm) and most accurate (1.1% errors) entry method. Hand printing was slower (16 wpm) and more error prone (8.1% errors). Tapping on the soft ABC keyboard was very accurate (0.6% errors) but was slower (13 wpm) than the other methods.These results represent the first empirical tests of entry speed and accuracy using a stylus to tap on a soft keyboard. Although handwriting (with recognition) is touted as the entry method of choice for pen-based computers, the much simpler technique of tapping on a soft keyboard is faster and more accurate.},

abstract = {In recent years, there have been a lot of efforts in solving scheduling problems by using the techniques of artificial intelligence (AI). However, through development of a variety of AI-based scheduling systems, it has become well known that eliciting effective problem-solving knowledge from human experts is arduous work, and that human schedulers typically lack the knowledge for solving large and complicated scheduling problems in a sophisticated manner. This paper discusses the characteristics of a scheduling problem and describes prior work on acquiring human schedulers' knowledge in scheduling expert systems. Then, a case-based approach, implemented in a system called CABINS, is presented for capturing human experts' preferential criteria about scheduling quality and control knowledge to speed up problem solving. Through iterative schedule repair, CABINS improves the quality of sub-optimal schedules, and during the process CABINS utilizes past repair experiences for (1) repair tactic selection and (2) repair result evaluation. It is empirically demonstrated in this paper that CABINS can revise a schedule along objectives captured in its case base and can improve the efficiency of the revision process while preserving the quality of a resultant schedule.},

abstract = {In earlier work, we have shown that software testers exhibit positive test bias. Positive test bias is the pervasive behavioral phenomenon in which hypothesis testers tend to test a hypothesis with data which confirms the hypothesis. However, in software testing this behavior may be counter-productive, since it may be more effective to test with data which are designed to disconfirm the hypothesis.The first study considered how positive test bias is influenced by the expertise level of the subjects, the completeness of the software specifications and whether or not the programs contained errors. The results demonstrated strong evidence of positive test bias regardless of condition. The effects appear to be partially mitigated by increasingly higher levels of expertise and by increasingly more complete specifications. In some cases, the effect is also increased by the presence of errors. A second study used talk-aloud protocols to explore the kinds of hypotheses testers generate during testing. The results further emphasize that subjects test their programs in a biased way and support the notion that the program specification drives testers' hypotheses. We conclude that positive test bias is a critical concern in software testing and may have a seriously detrimental effect on the quality of testing. The results further emphasize the importance of complete and thorough program specifications in order to enhance effective testing.},

MacSHAPA is designed to bring investigators into closer contact with their data and to help them achieve greater research productivity and quality. MacSHAPA allows investigators to see their data in various ways, to enter it, edit it and encode it, and to carry out statistical analyses and make reports. MacSHAPA's relation to other ESDA software tools is indicated throughout the paper.},

In general, the strengths are such as allow quick gratification of immediate needs, while the weaknesses are such as make subsequent debugging and interpretation difficult, suggesting a situated view of spreadsheet usage in which present needs outweigh future needs. We conclude with an attempt to characterize three extreme positions in the design space of information systems: the incremental addition system, the explanation system and the transcription system.

abstract = {Dealing with uncertainty problems in intelligent systems has attracted a lot of attention in the AI community. Quite a few techniques have been proposed. Among them, the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (DS theory) has been widely appreciated. In DS theory, Dempster's combination rule plays a major role. However, it has been pointed out that the application domains of the rule are rather limited and the application of the theory sometimes gives unexpected results. We have previously explored the problem with Dempster's combination rule and proposed an alternative combination mechanism in generalized incidence calculus. In this paper we give a comprehensive comparison between generalized incidence calculus and the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. We first prove that these two theories have the same ability in representing evidence and combining DS-independent evidence. We then show that the new approach can deal with some dependent situations while Dempster's combination rule cannot. Various examples in the paper show the ways of using generalized incidence calculus in expert systems.},

abstract = {When tasks offer alternative methods for attaining subgoals, several factors may determine which method is selected. People might choose procedures that are, or appear, cognitively less demanding. These demands can operate over several different dimensions (e.g. learnability, solution speed, number of motor actions). A series of studies is reported of method selection for a task that involved locating and comparing information within an electronic document. A variety of computer-based memory aids were also available to readers. Experiment 1 showed that subjects' navigation choices were predicted more successfully by a GOMS analysis than by the number of discrete actions (mouse clicks) required for the alternative procedures. However, the GOMS model failed to predict subjects' choices in experiment 2 where the previously chosen navigation method was modified to increase its procedural length and reduce its perceptual affordances. Subjects still frequently chose this navigation method but they also significantly increased their use of memory aids. Experiment 3 examined whether subjects' navigation choices arose from the memory demands of the alternative methods. The results showed that the method rejected by subjects in experiment 2 gave faster performance and reduced the use of some of the memory aids. It is suggested that number of motor actions in a procedure determines the use of memory aids but not the selection of navigation method. The perceptual characteristics of the alternative methods, which may relate to factors such as subjective risk, need to be incorporated into models predicting the procedures that people will select in complex tasks.},

abstract = {Diagnosis of a malfunctioning physical system is the task of identifying those component parts whose failures are responsible for discrepancies between observed and correct system behavior. The result of diagnosis is to enable system repair by replacement of failed parts.The model-based approach to diagnosis has emerged as a strong alternative to both symptom-based and fault-model-based approaches. Hypothesis generation and hypothesis discrimination (action selection) are two major subtasks of model-based diagnosis. Hypothesis generation has been partially resolved by symbolic reasoning using a subjective notion of parsimony such as non-redundancy. Action selection has only been studied for special cases, e.g. probes with equal cost. Little formal work has been done on repair selection and verification.This paper presents a probabilistic theory for model-based diagnosis. An objective measure is used to rank hypotheses, viz., posterior probabilities, instead of subjective parsimony. Fault hypotheses are generated in decreasing probability order. The theory provides an estimate of the expected diagnosis cost of an action. The result of the minimal cost action is used to adjust hypothesis probabilities and to select further actions.The major contributions of this paper are the incorporation of probabilistic reasoning into model-based diagnosis and the integration of repair as part of diagnosis. The integration of diagnosis and repair makes it possible to troubleshoot failures effectively in complex systems.},

abstract = {A possible way of supporting a human operator with the supervision of complex industrial processes is to provide him or her with a knowledge-based system that can detect faults in the process and infer their cause(s) and consequences. The effects of the introduction of such an aid cannot be predicted. On the one hand, it may improve the performance of the operator since it provides additional information about causes and consequences of a malfunction. On the other hand, it may worsen the operator's performance since he or she is either mentally underloaded (when all that is left for the operator to do is to follow the advice of the knowledge-based system) or mentally overloaded (because there is one more system which the operator must understand and check). In order to improve our understanding of this point, we constructed a monitoring and diagnosis system for a nuclear power plant simulation and carried out a laboratory evaluation of this system. During the evaluation, we compared the performance of a group of operators using the support system with a control group. The latter had to perform the same task in a model of a normally equipped control room. Results show that the aided operators performed better when they had to diagnose malfunctions caused by multiple failures, and when they had to diagnose malfunctions which they did not practise during their training.},

Sixty subjects took part in a simple computer game in order to explore the relationship between internal consistency, compatibility, and mode of learning. Internal consistency was found to be related to the subjects' ability to create an explicit model of the task, and compatibility was related to enhanced performance on the task. There was evidence that properties of a consistent underlying rule structure were made more salient when the mappings were consistent with users' expectations and only under these circumstances were performance benefits observed.},

abstract = {Whenever decisions are made based upon a person's level of computer literacy, it is important that such expertise is accurately assessed. This paper takes a thorough methodological approach to the measurement of computer literacy using both objective and self-appraisal tests. While objective tests have been used on many occasions to measure computer literacy, they suffer from generalizability problems. Self-appraisal tests, on the other hand, are subject to leniency bias by the respondents. Taken together, though, the potential exists for the establishment of a computer literacy assessment instrument with high levels of generalizability and accuracy. For this research, an objective test for computer literacy was developed and an existing self-appraisal test was extended for use in a computer literacy assessment experiment. It was found that the self-appraisal test is a more lenient performance indicator than the objective test. Both male and female subjects exhibited substantial self-leniency in their self-appraisals, but both self-leniency and gender-based differences in self-appraisal decreased as the subjects' level of computer expertise increased. Finally, the low level of convergence between the self-appraisal test and the objective test found in this study cast doubt on the ability of any self-appraisal test to assess accurately computer literacy by itself. A combination of different measures may be more appropriate when it is important to determine computer literacy levels accurately.},

abstract = {When performing a computer task, a user will decompose the task into cognitive goals and subgoals. These goals are accomplished through the use of external operators (e.g. keystrokes, mouse button presses) or internal mental operators (e.g. reading parts of the display, deciding on the goal). Users may utilize different goals and sequence the goals differently to accomplish the same overall task. Determining the goals and the sequencing of the goals could be useful for several reasons, such as providing a means for on-line assistance with the task. Determining these goals in the past, however, has been a time-consuming process. A neural network tool for automatically identifying cognitive text-editing goals from operators is investigated. The first of three memos edited by subjects was used to train the neural network successfully to map the operators (keystrokes) to cognitive goals. In a test of the trained network's ability to generalize to new input the second and third memos edited by the subjects the net could identify the cognitive goals with an overall performance accuracy of 96%. Two methods were used to investigate the validity of the goals which were identified by the tool. The characteristics of the goals were consistent with that which could be expected based upon previous research. This research illustrates that a neural network tool can identify the cognitive goals of a task.},

abstract = {Programming is a cognitive activity that requires the learning of new reasoning skills and the understanding of new technical information. Since novices lack domain-specific knowledge, many instructional techniques attempt to provide them with a framework or mental model that can be used for incorporating new information. A major research question concerns how to encourage the acquisition of good mental models and how these models influence the learning process. One possible technique for providing an effective mental model is to use dynamic cues that make transparent to the user all the changes in the variable values, source codes, output, etc., as the program runs. Two groups of novice programmers were used in the experiment. All subjects learned some programming notions in the C language (MIXC). The MIXC version of the programming language provides a debugging facility (C trace) designed to show through a system window all the program components. Subjects were either allowed to use this facility or not allowed to do so. Performance measures of programming and debugging were taken as well as measures directed to assess subjects' mental models. Results showed differences in the way in which the two groups represented and organized programming concepts, although the performance tasks did not show parallel effects.},

abstract = {Much of the knowledge required to use modern computing systems takes the form of mappings or associations. These associations occur between user goals and the functions that accomplish those goals, between functions and the user actions that activate a desired function, and between a menu item or a button label and the function associated with that item or label. The question we explore in this paper is: when is it worthwhile, if ever, to make a user pay the price of learning a new set of task-action mappings? In other words, how much interference is there when the new set is inconsistent with the original set of task-action mappings of the previously known system? We consider three factors that determine the ease of learning and retention of task-action mappings: mnemonics, regularity within a set of mappings, and consistency of mapping across different system contexts. In two experiments, we found that Irregular-Non-Mnemonic mappings take much longer to master than Regular-Mnemonic mappings and that Irregular-Non-Mnemonic mappings are more rapidly forgotten and subject to interference effects due to inconsistency. Regular-Non-Mnemonic mappings fall between the two groups. They are easier to learn and retain than Irregular-Non-Mnemonic but harder than Regular-Mnemonic mappings. We conclude that transferring from a well-learned set of old task-action mappings is simple when the new set is regular (completely consistent) and mnemonic.},

According to her model, different levels of knowledge, ranging from operational to functional, are extracted during comprehension in a bottom-up fashion. It was hypothesized that poor naming style would affect comprehension of function, but would not affect the other sorts of knowledge. An expertise effect was found, as well as evidence that knowledge of program function is independent of other sorts of knowledge. However, neither novices nor experts exhibited strong evidence of bottom-up comprehension. The results are discussed in terms of emerging theories of program comprehension which include knowledge representation, comprehension strategies, and the effects of ecological factors such as task demands and the role-expressiveness of the language.},

We compare two algorithms which could be used in such environments for turning networks of notes indicating ideas into linear draft documents. The algorithms are designed to produce a linear ordering of the notes which is acceptable to the writer as a first draft of the document. We report on experiments to test their effectiveness. Subjects were asked to create notes networks which were then linearized by the two algorithms. The resulting linearizations, plus a random ordering of nodes and a linearization created by hand, were assessed for textual organization. The experiments indicate that both algorithms produce linearizations which are acceptable as draft texts, that the "best first" algorithm is marginally superior to the "hillclimbing" one, and that providing information to the algorithms about link types had little effect on their effectiveness. The paper concludes by describing an implementation of the best first algorithm as part of the Writer's Assistant writing environment.},

abstract = {This paper explores the relationship between knowledge structure and organization and the development of expertise in a complex problem-solving task. An empirical study of skill acquisition in computer programming is reported, providing support for a model of knowledge organization that stresses the importance of knowledge restructuring processes in the development of expertise. This is contrasted with existing models which have tended to place emphasis upon schemata acquisition and generalization as the fundamental modes of learning associated with skill development. The work reported in this paper suggests that a fine-grained restructuring of individual schemata takes place during the later stages of skill development. It is argued that those mechanisms currently thought to be associated with the development of expertise may not fully account for the strategic changes and the types of error typically found in the transition between intermediate and expert problem solvers. This work has a number of implications. Firstly, it suggests important limitations of existing theories of skill acquisition. This is particularly evident in terms of the ability of such theories to account for subtle changes in the various manifestations of skilled performance that are associated with increasing expertise. Secondly, the work reported in this paper attempts to show how specific forms of training can give rise to this knowledge restructuring process. It is argued that the effects of particular forms of training are of primary importance, but these effects are often given little attention in theoretical accounts of skill acquisition. Finally, the work presented here has practical relevance in a number of applied areas including the design of intelligent tutoring systems and programming environments.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interdisciplinary interest in designing intelligent human-computer systems for problem-solving. Although progress has been made, we are far from building intelligent human-computer systems that fully exploit the natural synergies of the combination of human and intelligent machine. One of the significant paradigms of intelligent decision support is the cognitive systems engineering approach. This approach considers the human and the intelligent machine as components of a joint cognitive system and focuses on the need to maximize the overall performance of the joint system. Factors influencing the performance of the joint cognitive system include the cognitive characteristics of the human, the computer system, and the task. An important relationship between the cognitive characteristics of the human and those of the system is cognitive coupling, which has a number of dimensions.The study described in this paper explores the style dimension of cognitive coupling by presenting a laboratory experiment that examines the interactions among human cognitive style (analytic vs. heuristic), problem type (analysis-inducing vs. heuristic-inducing), and nature of decision aid (analytic vs. heuristic). The study demonstrates that, depending on the characteristics of the human, the computerized aid, and the problem to be solved, the joint human-computer system performance can be better or worse than the performance of the individual human or computer system working alone. Furthermore, the results suggest that the impact of cognitive style on decision-making performance may depend upon the characteristics of the problem, the nature of the decision-aid, and the measures used to evaluate performance. Inadequate recognition of these factors and their interactions may have led to conflicting results in prior decision-making studies using cognitive style.},

This paper reports a study undertaken to establish the concept validation of a design aid that is based on feedback to improve the quality of conceptual and logical relational databases. We describe the design of SERFER (Simulated ER based FEedback system for R elational databases) and test its effectiveness in a laboratory experiment using the "hidden operator" method. The results show that feedback can help users detect and correct certain types of database design errors in modeling ternary relationships. However, no improvement seems possible in the case of unary relationships. The experiment could not determine whether errors can be corrected in modeling binary relationships, since the subjects were reasonably adept and rarely committed serious errors in this case.},

abstract = {A design rationale (DR) is a representation of the reasoning behind the design of an artifact. In recent years, the use of semiformal notations for structuring arguments about design decisions has attracted much interest within the human-computer interaction and software engineering communities, leading to a number of DR notations and support environments. This paper examines two foundational claims made by argumentation-based DR approaches: that expressing DR as argumentation is useful, and that designers can use such notations. The conceptual and empirical basis for these claims is examined, firstly by surveying relevant literature on the use of argumentation in non-design contexts (from which current DR efforts draw much inspiration), and secondly, by surveying DR work. Evidence is classified according to the research contribution it makes, the kind of data on which claims are based (anecdotal or experimental), the extent to which the claims made are substantiated, and whether or not the users of the approach were also the researchers.In the survey, a trend towards tightly integrating DR with other design representations is noted, but it is argued that taken too far, this may result in the loss of the original vision of argumentative design. In examining the evidence for each claim, it is demonstrated firstly, that research into semiformal argumentation outside the design context has failed to substantiate convincingly either of the two claims implicitly attributed to it in current DR research, and secondly, that there are also significant gaps in the DR literature. There are emerging indications, however, that argumentation-based DR can assist certain kinds of design reasoning by turning the representational effort to the designer's advantage, and that such DRs can be useful at a later date. This analysis of argumentation research sets an agenda for future work driven by a concern to support the designer in the whole process of externalizing and structuring DR, from initially ill-formed ideas to more rigorous, coherent argumentation. The paper concludes by clarifying implications for the design of DR training, notations, and tools.},

We observed, as predicted by others, a closer alliance of domain and solution spaces in object-oriented design compared to procedural design. Procedural programmers spent a large proportion of their time analysing the problem domain. In contrast, object-oriented designers defined objects and methods much more quickly and spent more time evaluating their designs through simulation processes. Novices resembled object-oriented experts in some ways and procedural experts in others. Their designs had the general shape of the object-oriented experts' designs, but retained some procedural features. Novices were very inefficient at defining objects, going through an extensive situation analysis first, in a manner similar to the procedural experts. Some suggestions for instruction are made on the basis of novice object-oriented designers' difficulties.},

Explanations of ignorance and individuals' views of machines as proxies for humans are shown to be inadequate; instead, individuals' responses to technology are shown to be inconsistent with their espoused beliefs. In two laboratory studies, computer-literate college students used computers for tutoring and testing. The first study (n = 22) demonstrates that subjects using a computer that praised itself believed that it was more helpful, contributed more to the subject's test score, and was more responsive than did subjects using a computer that criticized itself, although the tutoring and testing sessions were identical. In the second study (n = 44), the praise or criticism came from either the computer that did the tutoring or a different computer. Subjects responded as if they attributed a "self" and self-focused attributions (termed "ethopoeia") to the computers. Specifically, subjects responses followed the rules "other-praise is more valid and friendlier than self-praise", "self-criticism is friendlier than other-criticism", and "criticizers are smarter than praisers" to evaluate the computers, although the subjects claimed to believe that these rules should not be applied to computers.},

abstract = {The design of interfaces which support a user's natural cognitive processes and structures depends on an understanding of communicational codes as well as task structures etc. Research in human-computer interaction has, however, tended to neglect the former in favour of the latter. This paper seeks to redress this imbalance by reporting in detail the results of an empirical enquiry into how people use two communicational codes natural language and drawing to achieve a shared understanding of a problem (the redesign of a kitchen) and its solution. This enquiry clearly indicates the complex interdependency of these forms of communication when used in combination. While a graphical depiction may provide a context for linguistic interpretation, especially in respect of the disambiguation of spatial expressions, graphical expressions (pictures and drawings) themselves require a context-dependent interpretation which, itself, can derive from an accompanying natural language expression. Often, however, neither form of expression can be independently interpreted. Rather the meaning of the situation is dependent on the synergistic combination of both forms of expression and is heavily dependent on the common background knowledge of participants in the interaction. While natural language expressions may be explicitly linked to graphical depictions through pointing actions, such actions are not mandatory for effective communication. The implications of these observations for the design of natural language/graphics interfaces are discussed. Among the questions raised by the paper are: how to characterize the difference between representation or modelling and communication in graphics; how to apply current object-oriented theories of knowledge representation to the highly fluid yet knowledge-rich use of pictures that was observed in our study; and finally what differences might emerge between dialogues of this type in different domains.},

A rule space analysis is performed on the same test items. The resulting diagnoses (describing attribute-mastery patterns) are shown to demonstrate within-test stability. These patterns are then discussed in the light of their potential contribution to the design of machine-delivered remediation.},

The development following a design-evaluation-redesign approach has shown that adaptations are accepted if the user has the opportunity to control their timing and content. This does not necessarily mean that the adaptation is initiated and performed by the user alone (adaptability). On the contrary, the strictly user-controlled adaptation is too demanding for the user. The paper shows how the user's own adaptations can be supported by the system by initial adaptive suggestions showing the rationale of adaptations and the way to perform them.},

These two kinds of knowledge can be expressed in a single formalism. A powerful criterion of consistency for knowledge bases, based on this differentiation, is presented and formally expressed. The reasons why a knowledge base can he inconsistent are studied, and formally expressed. We present the COCO system, which checks knowledge bases. Then, we present the X system, which helps restore the consistency of an inconsistent knowledge base.

abstract = {This paper reports the performance of several neural network models on the problem of multi-font character recognition. The networks are trained on machine generated, upper-case English letters in selected fonts. The task is to recognize the same letters in different fonts. The results presented here were produced by back-propagation networks, radial basis networks and a new hybrid algorithm which is a combination of the two. These results are compared to those of the Hogg-Hubermann model as well as to those of nearest neighbor and maximum likelihood classifiers. The effects of varying the number of nodes in the hidden layer, the initial conditions, and the number of iterations in a back-propagation network were studied. The experimental results indicate that the number of nodes is an important factor in the recognition rate and that over-training is a significant problem. Different initial conditions also had a measurable effect on performance. The radial basis experiments used different numbers of centers and differing techniques for selecting the means and standard deviations. The best results were obtained with one center per training vector in which the standard deviation for each center was set to the same small number. Finally, a new hybrid technique is discussed in which a radial basis network is used to determine a starting point for a back-propagation network. The back-propagation network refines the radial basis means and standard deviations which are replaced in the radial basis network and used for another iteration. All three networks out-performed the Hogg-Hubermann network as well as the maximum likelihood classifiers.},

abstract = {The increasing use of automation to supplant human intervention in controlling complex systems changes the operators' role from active controllers (directly involved with the system) to supervisory controllers (managing the use of different degrees of automatic and manual control). This paper examines the relationship between trust in automatic controllers, self-confidence in manual control abilities, and the use of automatic controllers in operating a simulated semi-automatic pasteurization plant. Trust, combined with self-confidence, predicted the operators' allocation strategy. A Multitrait-multimethod matrix and logit functions showed how trust and self-confidence relate to the use of automation. An ARMAV time series model of the dynamic interaction of trust and self-confidence, combined with individual biases, accounted for 60.9-86.5% of the variance in the use of the three automatic controllers. In general, automation is used when trust exceeds self-confidence, and manual control when the opposite is true. Since trust and self-confidence are two factors that guide operators' interactions with automation, the design of supervisory control systems should include provisions to ensure that operators' trust reflects the capabilities of the automation and operators' self-confidence reflects their abilities to control the system manually.},

abstract = {The QUERY procedure is designed to systematically question an expert, and construct the unique knowledge space consistent with the expert's responses. Such a knowledge space can then serve as the core of a knowledge assessment system. The essentials of the theory of knowledge spaces are given here, together with the theoretical underpinnings of the QUERY procedure. A full scale application of the procedure is then described, which consists in constructing the knowledge spaces of five expert-teachers, pertaining to 50 mathematics items of the standard high school curriculum. The results show that the technique is applicable in a realistic setting. However, the analysis of the data indicates that, despite a good agreement across experts concerning item difficulty and other coarse measures, the constructed knowledge spaces obtained for the different experts are not as consistent as one might expect or hope. Some experts appear to be considerably more skillful than others at generating a usable knowledge space, at least by this technique.},

abstract = {The abstraction hierarchy (AH) is a multileveled representation framework, consisting of physical and functional system models, which has been proposed as a useful framework for developing representations of complex work environments. Despite the fact that the AH is well known and widely cited in the cognitive engineering community, there are surprisingly few examples of its application. Accordingly, the intent of this paper is to provide a concrete example of how the AH can be applied as a knowledge representation framework. A formal instantiation of the AH as the basis for a computer program is presented in the context of a thermal-hydraulic process. This model of the system is complemented by a relatively simple reasoning mechanism which is independent of the information contained in the knowledge representation. This reasoning mechanism uses the AH model, along with qualitative user input about system states, to generate reasoning trajectories for different types of events and problems. Simulation outputs showing how the AH model can provide an effective basis for reasoning under different classes of situations, including challenging faults of various types, are presented. These detailed examples illustrate the various benefits of adopting the AH as a knowledge representation framework, namely: providing sufficient representations to allow reasoning about unanticipated fault and control situations, allowing the use of reasoning mechanisms that are independent of domain information, and having psychological relevance.},

abstract = {This study examines the impact of a user's level of computer knowledge and an adaptive software interface on performance. Performance is examined with a simulation game decision-making task and with the user's expertise on the type of computer interface used to accomplish the task. MIS literature offers various interface characteristics for novice users that are different from those recommended for experienced users. The premise of this research is that the characteristics of the computer user will change based on exposure to the experience with the application at hand. When such change transpires, the characteristics of the interface can be software-adjusted to maximize the productivity of the user. This empirical study investigates the impact of using an adaptive user interface that evolves to correspond to the skill level of the user. Results indicate that the level of computer knowledge, when using an adaptive interface, is not significant on either task performance or interface learning. More importantly, however, the type of interface coupled to a particular user novice, adaptive, or experienced produces significant performance differences.},

abstract = {This paper first presents a general structured framework for user modeling, which includes a set of basic user modeling purposes exploited by a user modeling system when providing a set of services to other components of an application. At a higher level of abstraction such an application may perform a generic user modeling task , which results from an appropriate combination of some basic user modeling purposes. The central aim of the paper is to present, within the proposed framework, a flexible general-purpose shell, called UMT (User Modeling Tool), which supports the development of user modeling applications. UMT features a non-monotonic approach for performing the modeling activity: more specifically, it utilizes a modeling approach called assumption-based user modeling, which exploits a truth maintenance mechanism for maintaining the consistency of the user model. The modeling task is divided into two separate activities, one devoted to user classification and user model management, and the other devoted to consistency maintenance of the model. The modeling knowledge exploited by UMT is represented by means of stereotypes and production rules. UMT is capable of identifying, at any given moment during an interaction, all the possible alternative models which adequately describe the user and are internally consistent. The choice of the most plausible one among them is then performed using an explicit programmable preference criterion. UMT is also characterized by a very well defined and simple interface with the hosting application, and by a specialized development interface which supports the developer during the construction of specific applications. This paper includes an example application in the field of information-providing systems. UMT has been developed in Common LISP.},

abstract = {The research presented in this paper is concerned with the planning component of project management and describes the use of interviewing techniques to develop cognitive models of planning for project management systems. Interviews were conducted with six project managers from six different problem domains. Protocol analysis was used to develop two types of cognitive models: process models that provided detailed descriptions of planning actions; and a higher level model of the planning process based on the Hayes-Roth theoretical model of planning. A visual representation of the planning process, called DMAP, was created to identify the type of planning that occurs at each stage of the planning process in project management. The discussion focuses on the use of cognitive models in the design of knowledge-based systems for project management.},
