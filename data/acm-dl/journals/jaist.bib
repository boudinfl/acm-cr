abstract = {This article explores how linguistics has influenced information retrieval IR and attempts to explain the impact of linguistics through an analysis of internal developments in information science generally, and IR in particular. It notes that information science/IR has been evolving from a case science into a fully fledged, "disciplined"/disciplinary science. The article establishes correspondences between linguistics and information science/IR using the three established IR paradigms-physical, cognitive, and computational-as a frame of reference. The current relationship between information science/IR and linguistics is elucidated through discussion of some recent information science publications dealing with linguistic topics and a novel technique, "keyword collocation analysis," is introduced. Insights from interdisciplinarity research and case theory are also discussed. It is demonstrated that the three stages of interdisciplinarity, namely multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity in the narrow sense, and transdisciplinarity, can be linked to different phases of the information science/IR-linguistics relationship and connected to different ways of using linguistic theory in information science and IR.},

abstract = {In November 2014, the Nature Index NI was introduced see http://www.natureindex.com by the Nature Publishing Group NPG. The NI comprises the primary research articles published in the past 12 months in a selection of reputable journals. Starting from two short comments on the NI Haunschild &amp; Bornmann, , , we undertake an empirical analysis of the NI using comprehensive country data. We investigate whether the huge efforts of computing the NI are justified and whether the size-dependent NI indicators should be complemented by size-independent variants. The analysis uses data from the Max Planck Digital Library in-house database which is based on Web of Science data and from the NPG. In the first step of the analysis, we correlate the NI with other metrics that are simpler to generate than the NI. The resulting large correlation coefficients point out that the NI produces similar results as simpler solutions. In the second step of the analysis, relative and size-independent variants of the NI are generated that should be additionally presented by the NPG. The size-dependent NI indicators favor large countries or institutions and the top-performing small countries or institutions do not come into the picture.},

abstract = {The increasing popularity of academic social networking sites ASNSs requires studies on the usage of ASNSs among scholars and evaluations of the effectiveness of these ASNSs. However, it is unclear whether current ASNSs have fulfilled their design goal, as scholars' actual online interactions on these platforms remain unexplored. To fill the gap, this article presents a study based on data collected from ResearchGate. Adopting a mixed-method design by conducting qualitative content analysis and statistical analysis on 1,128 posts collected from ResearchGate Q&amp;A, we examine how scholars exchange information and resources, and how their practices vary across three distinct disciplines: library and information services, history of art, and astrophysics. Our results show that the effect of a questioner's intention i.e., seeking information or discussion is greater than disciplinary factors in some circumstances. Across the three disciplines, responses to questions provide various resources, including experts' contact details, citations, links to Wikipedia, images, and so on. We further discuss several implications of the understanding of scholarly information exchange and the design of better academic social networking interfaces, which should stimulate scholarly interactions by minimizing confusion, improving the clarity of questions, and promoting scholarly content management.},

abstract = {Research on information technology IT adoption and use, one of the most mature streams of research in the information science and information systems literature, is primarily based on the intentionality framework. Behavioral intention BI to use an IT is considered the sole proximal determinant of IT adoption and use. Recently, researchers have discussed the limitations of BI and argued that behavioral expectation BE would be a better predictor of IT use. However, without a theoretical and empirical understanding of the determinants of BE, we remain limited in our comprehension of what factors promote greater IT use in organizations. Using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as the theoretical framework, we develop a model that posits 2 determinants i.e., social influence and facilitating conditions of BE and 4 moderators i.e., gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use of the relationship between BE and its determinants. We argue that the cognitions underlying the formation of BI and BE differ. We found strong support for the proposed model in a longitudinal field study of 321 users of a new IT. We offer theoretical and practical IT implications of our findings.},

In CIS, collaborative sensemaking is an important but understudied aspect. A thorough understanding of collaborative sensemaking behavior in CIS tasks is essential to develop tools to support collaborative sensemaking activities in CIS. In this article, we investigate the general patterns and differences in collaborative sensemaking behavior in travel planning and topic research tasks using the data from 2 observational user studies. The results show the common stages of the collaborative sensemaking process and the differences in users' collaborative sensemaking strategies and activities between the 2 tasks. This comparative study enhances our understanding of the collaborative sensemaking process in CIS tasks and the differences in user's sensemaking behavior according to tasks, and describes implications for supporting collaborative sensemaking behavior in CIS tasks.},

abstract = {Using Ellis's seminal model of information seeking as an example, this study demonstrates how the elaborations made to the original framework since the late 1980s have contributed to conceptual growth in information-seeking studies. To this end, nine key studies elaborating Ellis's model were scrutinized by conceptual analysis. The findings indicate that the elaborations are based on two main approaches: adding novel, context-specific components in the model and redefining and restructuring the components. The elaborations have contributed to conceptual growth in three major ways. First, integrating formerly separate parts of knowledge; second, generalizing and explaining lower abstraction-level knowledge through higher-level constructs; and third, expanding knowledge by identifying new characteristics of the object of study, that is, information-seeking behavior. Further elaboration of Ellis's model toward a theory would require more focused attempts to test hypotheses in work-related environments in particular.},

abstract = {Online participation is becoming an increasingly common means for individuals to contribute to citizen science projects, yet such projects often rely on only a small fraction of participants to make the majority of contributions. Here, we investigate a means for influencing the performance of citizen scientists toward enhancing overall participation. Building on past social comparison research, we pair citizen scientists with a software-based virtual peer in an environmental monitoring project. Through a series of experiments in which virtual peers outperform, underperform, or perform similarly to human participants, we investigate the influence of their presence on citizen science participation. To offer insight into the psychological determinants to the response to this intervention, we propose a new dynamic model describing the bidirectional interaction between humans and virtual peers. Our results demonstrate that participant contribution can be enhanced through the presence of a virtual peer, creating a feedback loop where participants tend to increase or decrease their contribution in response to their peers' performance. By including virtual peers that systematically outperform the participants, we demonstrate a fourfold increase in their contribution to the citizen science project.},

Censorship of identity occurs in different contexts-for example, the military censors the identity of personnel and the judiciary censors the identity of minors and victims. We address three objectives: a assess the relevance of identity censorship in the presence of user-generated comments, b understand the fashion of censorship circumvention what people say and how, and c determine how comment analysis can aid in identifying decensorship and information leakage through comments. After examining 3,582 comments made on 48 articles containing obfuscated terms, we find that a systematic examination of comments can compromise identity censorship. We identify and categorize information leakage in comments indicative of knowledge of censored information that may result in information decensorship. We show that the majority of censored articles contained at least one comment leading to censorship circumvention.},

abstract = {With the information overload of user-generated content in microblogging, users find it extremely challenging to browse and find valuable information in their first attempt. In this paper we propose a microblogging recommendation algorithm, TSI-MR Topic-Level Social Influence-based Microblogging Recommendation, which can significantly improve users' microblogging experiences. The main innovation of this proposed algorithm is that we consider social influences and their indirect structural relationships, which are largely based on social status theory, from the topic level. The primary advantage of this approach is that it can build an accurate description of latent relationships between two users with weak connections, which can improve the performance of the model; furthermore, it can solve sparsity problems of training data to a certain extent. The realization of the model is mainly based on Factor Graph. We also applied a distributed strategy to further improve the efficiency of the model. Finally, we use data from Tencent Weibo, one of the most popular microblogging services in China, to evaluate our methods. The results show that incorporating social influence can improve microblogging performance considerably, and outperform the baseline methods.},

abstract = {Information and communication technology ICT has increasingly important implications for our everyday lives, with the potential to both solve existing social problems and create new ones. This article focuses on one particular group of ICT professionals, computational modelers, and explores how these ICT professionals perceive their own societal responsibilities. Specifically, the article uses a mixed-method approach to look at the role of professional codes of ethics and explores the relationship between modelers' experiences with, and attitudes toward, codes of ethics and their values. Statistical analysis of survey data reveals a relationship between modelers' values and their attitudes and experiences related to codes of ethics. Thematic analysis of interviews with a subset of survey participants identifies two key themes: that modelers should be faithful to the reality and values of users and that codes of ethics should be built from the bottom up. One important implication of the research is that those who value universalism and benevolence may have a particular duty to act on their values and advocate for, and work to develop, a code of ethics.},

abstract = {The need for new indicators on universities is growing enormously. Governments and decision makers at all levels are faced with the huge opportunities generated by the availability of new knowledge and information and, simultaneously, are pressed by tight budget constraints. University rankings, in particular, are attracting policy and media attention, but at the same time receive harsh methodological criticism. After summarizing the main criticisms of rankings, we describe 2 trends in the user requirements for indicators; namely, granularity and cross-referencing. We then suggest that a change in the paradigm of the design and production of indicators is needed. The traditional approach is one that not only leverages on the existing data but also suggests heavy investment to integrate existing databases and to build up tailored indicators. We show, based on the European universities case, how the intelligent integration of existing data may lead to an open-linked data platform which permits the construction of new indicators. The power of the approach derives from the ability to combine heterogeneous sources of data to generate indicators that address a variety of user requirements without the need to design indicators on a custom basis.},

However, significant barriers impede this work, primarily because the infrastructure services, tools, and collaborative networks to support scholarly information management is still under development. Under the aegis of the Scholars Tracking Archival Resources STAR project we are studying how humanities scholars gather and manage primary source materials with a goal of developing software to support their information management practices. This article reports the findings from our interviews with 26 humanities scholars, in conjunction with a set of initial requirements for a mobile application that will support scholars in capturing documents, recreating the archival context, and uploading these documents to cloud storage for access and sharing from other devices.},

Complex queries such as "papers on information retrieval, which were cited by John's papers that had been presented in SIGIR" can be effectively answered by the system. We evaluate the proposed system by developing another relational database-based bibliographic information retrieval system with the same interface and functions. Experiment results show that the proposed system executes the same queries much faster than the relational database-based system, and on average, our system reduced the execution time by 72% for 3-node query, 89% for 4-node query, and 99% for 5-node query.},

In response, this article assesses samples of ResearchGate articles uploaded at specific dates, comparing their views in the site to their Mendeley readers and Scopus-indexed citations. This analysis shows that ResearchGate is dominated by recent articles, which attract about three times as many views as older articles. ResearchGate has uneven coverage of scholarship, with the arts and humanities, health professions, and decision sciences poorly represented and some fields receiving twice as many views per article as others. View counts for uploaded articles have low to moderate positive correlations with both Scopus citations and Mendeley readers, which is consistent with them tending to reflect a wider audience than Scopus-publishing scholars. Hence, for articles uploaded to the site, view counts may give a genuinely new audience indicator.},

A discussion of the connection of trust and scientific knowledge and of the role of peer review for establishing and communicating this connection provides for the theoretical and topical framing. Special attention is paid to the pervasiveness of digital technologies in formal scholarly communication processes. Three dimensions of trust are traced in the material analyzed: a trust through personal experience and informal knowledge, b trust through organized, internal control, c trust through form. The article concludes by discussing how certain understandings of the conditions for trust in science are challenged by perceptions of possibilities for deceit in digital environments.},

In-depth telephone interviews with 50 VRS librarians included questions on collaboration, referral practices, and attitudes toward Social Question and Answer SQA services using the Critical Incident Technique Flanagan, . The Community of Practice CoP Wenger, ; Davies, framework was found to be a useful conceptualization for understanding VRS professionals' approaches to their work. Findings indicate that participants usually refer questions from outside of their area of expertise to other librarians, but occasionally refer them to nonlibrarian experts. These referrals are made possible because participants believe that other VRS librarians are qualified and willing collaborators. Barriers to collaboration include not knowing appropriate librarians/experts for referral, inability to verify credentials, and perceived unwillingness to collaborate. Facilitators to collaboration include knowledge of appropriate collaborators who are qualified and willingness to refer. Answers from SQA services were perceived as less objective and authoritative, but participants were open to collaborating with nonlibrarian experts with confirmation of professional expertise or extensive knowledge.},

abstract = {Recent works in the information science literature have presented cases of using patent databases and patent classification information to construct network maps of technology fields, which aim to aid in competitive intelligence analysis and innovation decision making. Constructing such a patent network requires a proper measure of the distance between different classes of patents in the patent classification systems. Despite the existence of various distance measures in the literature, it is unclear how to consistently assess and compare them, and which ones to select for constructing patent technology network maps. This ambiguity has limited the development and applications of such technology maps. Herein, we propose to compare alternative distance measures and identify the superior ones by analyzing the differences and similarities in the structural properties of resulting patent network maps. Using United States patent data from 1976 to 2006 and the International Patent Classification IPC system, we compare 12 representative distance measures, which quantify interfield knowledge base proximity, field-crossing diversification likelihood or frequency of innovation agents, and co-occurrences of patent classes in the same patents. Our comparative analyses suggest the patent technology network maps based on normalized coreference and inventor diversification likelihood measures are the best representatives.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe the creation and use of metadata on the early Arpanet as part of normal network function. By using the Arpanet Host-Host Protocol and its sockets as an entry point for studying the generation of metadata, we show that the development and function of key Arpanet infrastructure can be studied by examining the creation and stabilization of metadata. More specifically, we use the Host-Host Protocol's sockets as an example of something that, at the level of the network, functions as both network infrastructure and metadata simultaneously. By presenting the function of sockets in tandem with an overview of the Host-Host Protocol, we argue for the further integrated study of infrastructure and metadata. Finally, we reintroduce the concept of infradata to refer specifically to data that locate data throughout an infrastructure and are required by the infrastructure to function, separating them from established and stabilized standards. We argue for the future application of infradata as a concept for the study of histories and political economies of networks, bridging the largely library and information science LIS study of metadata with the largely science and technology studies STS domain of infrastructure.},

abstract = {Since their beginnings, bibliographic information systems have been displaying results in the form of long, textual lists. With the development of new data models and computer technologies, the need for new approaches to present and interact with bibliographic data has slowly been maturing. To investigate how this could be accomplished, a prototype system, FrbrVis1, was designed to present work families within a bibliographic information system using information visualization. This paper reports on two user studies, a controlled and an observational experiment, that have been carried out to assess the Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records FRBR-based against an existing system as well as to test four different hierarchical visual layouts. The results clearly show that FrbrVis offers better performance and user experience compared to the baseline system. The differences between the four hierarchical visualizations Indented tree, Radial tree, Circlepack, and Sunburst were, on the other hand, not as pronounced, but the Indented tree and Sunburst design proved to be the most successful, both in performance as well as user perception. The paper therefore not only evaluates the application of a visual presentation of bibliographic work families, but also provides valuable results regarding the performance and user acceptance of individual hierarchical visualization techniques.},

In interdisciplinary and cross-sector projects, team members may hold distinct views on the types of impact they want to create. Set in the context of an interdisciplinary, cross-sector project comprised of partners from academia, industry, and the nonprofit sector, our paper unpacks how these diverse project members understand impact. Our analysis shows that interdisciplinary projects offer a unique opportunity to create impact on a number of different levels. Moreover, it demonstrates that a lack of accountable design and collaboration practices can potentially hinder pathways to impact. Finally, we find that the interdisciplinary perspectives that such projects introduce encourage a rich gamut of sustainable outcomes that go beyond commercialization. Our findings support researchers working in these complex contexts to appreciate the opportunities and challenges involved in interdisciplinary cross-sector research contexts while imparting them with strategies for overcoming these challenges.},

How they select targeted publications can influence competitive relationships among journals. In this paper, the author quantifies the publishing choices of a set of scholars to confirm this ecological perspective. The results indicate a strong focus on a small number of journals. A measure of author publishing choices was used to define four ecological characteristics: coverage, coreness, exclusivity, and journal overlap. Several types of journals indexed in the Information Science and Library Science section of the Journal Citation Reports are compared in terms of their ecological characteristics. The data show that some journals cover large numbers of authors, but compete with other journals in subcommunities. Some journals with author profiles similar to those of high-ranking journals lost potential submissions. Others with low coverage, high coreness, and high exclusivity were found to have groups of "fans" who used them for all of their submissions, but still exhibited a strong need to sustain their exclusivity. It is hoped that the method and results presented in this paper will provide useful information for editorial boards interested in managing their submissions according to author profiles.},

We report on a small-scale experiment in which we applied Waisda? to content from film archives. We study the differences in the type of time-based tags between experts and novices for film clips in a crowdsourcing setting. The findings show high similarity in the number and type of tags mostly factual. In the less frequent tags, however, experts used more domain-specific terms. We conclude that competitive games are not suited to elicit real expert-level descriptions. We also confirm that providing guidelines, based on conceptual frameworks that are more suited to moving images in a time-based fashion, could result in increasing the quality of the tags, thus allowing for creating more tag-based innovative services for online audiovisual heritage.},

We believe it is necessary to use different answering strategies based on the type of questions to accommodate the different information needs. In this research, we propose the ASK taxonomy that categorizes questions posted on social networking sites into three types according to the nature of the questioner's inquiry of accuracy, social, or knowledge. To automatically decide which answering strategy to use, we develop a predictive model based on ASK question types using question features from the perspectives of lexical, topical, contextual, and syntactic as well as answer features. By applying the classifier on an annotated data set, we present a comprehensive analysis to compare questions in terms of their word usage, topical interests, temporal and spatial restrictions, syntactic structure, and response characteristics. Our research results show that the three types of questions exhibited different characteristics in the way they are asked. Our automatic classification algorithm achieves an 83% correct labeling result, showing the value of the ASK taxonomy for the design of social question and answering systems.},

To better understand the effects of crowd size we conducted a study on the retention and performance of 4,317 articles in the WikiProject Film community. Results indicate that crowd composition, specifically diversity and experience, is vital to understanding when size leads to better retention and performance. Crowd size was positively related to retention and performance when crowds were high in diversity and experience. Retention was important to determining when crowd size led to better performance. Crowd size was positively related to performance when retention was low. Our results suggest that crowds benefit from their size when they are diverse, experienced, and have low retention rates.},

Consumer health information behavior CHIB, which encompasses people's health-related information needs as well as the ways in which they interact or do not interact with health-related information, plays an important role in people's ability to prevent, cope with, and successfully manage a serious chronic disease across time. In this mixed-method longitudinal study, the CHIB of 34 people with type 2 diabetes is explored with the goal of identifying the factors that motivate, demotivate, or impede their diabetes-related information seeking and use. The findings reveal that while these processes can be motivated by many different factors and can lead to important benefits, there are significant barriers such as "incognizance," defined herein as having an information need that one is not aware of that may demotivate or impede their information seeking and use. The implications of these findings are discussed, focusing on how we might work toward preventing, identifying, and addressing incognizance among this population, ensuring they have the information they need when it can be of the most use to them.},

However, such freedom also carries concerns about content quality. In this work, we propose an automatic framework to assess the quality of collaboratively generated content. Quality is addressed as a multidimensional concept, modeled as a combination of independent assessments, each regarding different quality dimensions. Accordingly, we adopt a machine-learning ML-based multiview approach to assess content quality. We perform a thorough analysis of our framework on two different domains: Questions and Answer Forums and Collaborative Encyclopedias. This allowed us to better understand when and how the proposed multiview approach is able to provide accurate quality assessments. Our main contributions are: a a general ML multiview framework that takes advantage of different views of quality indicators; b the improvement up to 30% in quality assessment over the best state-of-the-art baseline methods; c a thorough feature and view analysis regarding impact, informativeness, and correlation, based on two distinct domains.},

Experimental results on a large data set of 18 mood categories show that combining lyrics and audio significantly outperformed systems using audio-only features. Automatic feature selection techniques were further proved to have reduced feature space. In addition, the examination of learning curves shows that the hybrid systems using lyrics and audio needed fewer training samples and shorter audio clips to achieve the same or better classification accuracies than systems using lyrics or audio singularly. Last but not least, performance comparisons reveal the relative importance of audio and lyric features across mood categories.},

abstract = {Brazilian scholarly output has rapidly increased, accompanied by the expansion of domestic collaborations. In this paper, we identify spatial patterns of collaboration in Brazil and measure the role of geographic proximity in determining the interaction among researchers. Using a database comprising more than one million researchers and seven million publications, we consolidated information on interregional research collaboration in terms of scientific coauthorship networks among 4,615 municipalities during the period between 1992 and 2009, which allowed us to analyze a range of data unprecedented in the literature. The effects of geographic distance on collaboration were measured for different areas by estimating spatial interaction models. The main results provide strong evidence of geographic deconcentration of collaboration in recent years, with increased participation of authors in scientifically less traditional regions, such as south and northeast Brazil. Distance remains a significant factor in determining the intensity of knowledge flow in collaboration networks in Brazil, as an increase of 100km between two researchers reduces the probability of collaboration by an average of 16%, and there is no evidence that the effect of distance has diminished over time, although the magnitude of such effects varies among networks of different areas.},

Changes can be indicated at the level of journals using the margin totals of entropy production along the row or column vectors, but also at the level of links among journals by importing the transition matrices into network analysis and visualization programs and using community-finding algorithms. Seventy-four journals were flagged in terms of discontinuous changes in their citations, but 3,114 journals were involved in "hot" links. Most of these links are embedded in a main component; 78 clusters containing 172 journals were flagged as potential "hot spots" emerging at the network level. An additional finding was that PLoS ONE introduced a new communication dynamic into the database. The limitations of the methodology were elaborated using an example. The results of the study indicate where developments in the citation dynamics can be considered as significantly unexpected. This can be used as heuristic information, but what a "hot spot" in terms of the entropy statistics of aggregated citation relations means substantively can be expected to vary from case to case.},

We develop an integrative synthesis of different overlay mapping techniques and associated perspectives on technological emergence across geographical, social, and cognitive spaces. To do so, we longitudinally analyze with publication and patent data three case studies of emerging technologies in the medical domain. These are RNA interference RNAi, human papillomavirus HPV testing technologies for cervical cancer, and thiopurine methyltransferase TPMT genetic testing. Given the flexibility i.e., adaptability to different sources of data and granularity i.e., applicability across multiple levels of data aggregation of overlay mapping techniques, we argue that these techniques can favor the integration and comparison of results from different contexts and cases, thus potentially functioning as a platform for "distributed" strategic intelligence for analysts and decision makers.},

abstract = {This article proposes, exemplifies, and validates the use of course-subject co-occurrence CSCO data to generate topic maps of an academic discipline. A CSCO event is when 2 course-subjects are taught in the same academic year by the same teacher. A total of 61,856 CSCO events were extracted from the 2010-11 directory of the American Association of Law Schools and used to visualize the structure of law school education in the United States. Different normalization, ordination layout, and clustering algorithms were compared and the best performing algorithm of each type was used to generate the final map. Validation studies demonstrate that CSCO produces topic maps that are consistent with expert opinion and 4 other indicators of the topical similarity of law school course-subjects. This research is the first to use CSCO to produce a visualization of a domain. It is also the first to use an expanded, multi-part gold standard to evaluate the validity of domain maps and the intermediate steps in their creation. It is suggested that the framework used herein may be adopted for other studies that compare different inputs of a domain map in order to empirically derive the best maps as measured against extrinsic sources of topical similarity gold standards.},

abstract = {Keeping up to date with research developments is a central activity of academic researchers, but researchers face difficulties in managing the rapid growth of available scientific information. This study examined how researchers stay up to date, using the information journey model as a framework for analysis and investigating which dimensions influence information behaviors. We designed a 2-round study involving semistructured interviews and prototype testing with 61 researchers with 3 levels of seniority PhD student to professor. Data were analyzed following a semistructured qualitative approach. Five key dimensions that influence information behaviors were identified: level of seniority, information sources, state of the project, level of familiarity, and how well defined the relevant community is. These dimensions are interrelated and their values determine the flow of the information journey. Across all levels of professional expertise, researchers used similar hard formal sources to access content, while soft interpersonal sources were used to filter information. An important "pain point" that future information tools should address is helping researchers filter information at the point of need.},

There are two major limitations of such system-centered evaluation approaches: a The evaluation focuses on subtasks in music information retrieval, but not on entire systems and b users and their interactions with MIR systems are largely excluded. This article describes the first implementation of a holistic user-experience evaluation in MIR, the MIREX Grand Challenge, where complete MIR systems are evaluated, with user experience being the single overarching goal. It is the first time that complete MIR systems have been evaluated with end users in a realistic scenario. We present the design of the evaluation task, the evaluation criteria and a novel evaluation interface, and the data-collection platform.

Current research has primarily focused on examining the social and interactional aspects of CIS in organizational or other settings and developing technical approaches to support CIS activities. As we continue to develop a better understanding of the interactional aspects of CIS, we need also start to examine the cognitive aspects of CIS. In particular, we need to understand CIS from a team cognition perspective. To examine how team cognition develops during CIS, we conducted a study using observations and interviews of student teams engaged in colocated CIS tasks in a laboratory setting. We found that a variety of awareness mechanisms play a key role in the development of team cognition during CIS. Specifically, we identify that search, information, and social methods of awareness are critical to developing team cognition during CIS. We discuss why awareness is important for team cognition, how team cognition comprises both individual and team-level cognitive activities, and the importance of examining both interaction and cognition to truly understand team cognition.},

abstract = {Modern search systems often meet their users' information needs, but when the system fails, searchers struggle to formulate effective queries. Query suggestions may help, but research suggests these often go unused. Although much is known about how searchers scan results pages when assessing relevance, little is known about the processes searchers use when struggling to reformulate queries. Investigating how searchers overcome query difficulties, and how search systems help and hinder that process, requires enquiry into the cognitive procedures searchers use to select words for queries. The purpose of this paper is to investigate one cognitive process involved: semantic priming of words in memory. A framework for conceptualizing the role of semantic priming in search interaction is presented, along with results from two experiments that applied research methods from cognitive psychology, in an investigation of word selection and subsequent search for selected words. The results show that word selection activates related words in memory and that looking for a selected word among related words is effortful. The finding suggests that semantic priming may play a role in the difficulties people experience when reformulating queries. Ideas for continued development of semantic priming methods and their use in future research are also presented.},

Google covers multiple different international patent office databases but does not index patent citations or allow automatic searches. In response, this article introduces a semiautomatic indirect method via Bing to extract and filter patent citations from Google to academic papers with an overall precision of 98%. The method was evaluated with 322,192 science and engineering Scopus articles from every second year for the period 1996-2012. Although manual Google Patent searches give more results, especially for articles with many patent citations, the difference is not large enough to be a major problem. Within Biomedical Engineering, Biotechnology, and Pharmacology &amp;Pharmaceutics, 7% to 10% of Scopus articles had at least one patent citation but other fields had far fewer, so patent citation analysis is only relevant for a minority of publications. Low but positive correlations between Google Patent citations and Scopus citations across all fields suggest that traditional citation counts cannot substitute for patent citations when evaluating research.},

abstract = {This article contributes to the growing body of research that explores the significance of context in health information behavior. Specifically, through the lens of trust judgments, it demonstrates that gender is a determinant of the information evaluation process. A questionnaire-based survey collected data from adults regarding the factors that influence their judgment of the trustworthiness of online health information. Both men and women identified credibility, recommendation, ease of use, and brand as being of importance in their trust judgments. However, women also take into account style, while men eschew this for familiarity. In addition, men appear to be more concerned with the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the information, the ease with which they can access it, and its familiarity, whereas women demonstrate greater interest in cognition, such as the ease with which they can read and understand the information. These gender differences are consistent with the demographic data, which suggest that: women consult more types of sources than men; men are more likely to be searching with respect to a long-standing health complaint; and, women are more likely than men to use tablets in their health information seeking. Recommendations for further research to better inform practice are offered.},

Some participants found 75% of high-value items, others found none, with an average of 27%. No association was found between self-reported search expertise and task performance, with a tendency for many participants to overestimate their search expertise. Successful searchers may have more accurate mental models of both search systems and the information space. Organizations may not have effective exploratory search task performance feedback loops, a lack of learning. This may be caused by management bias towards technology, not capability, a lack of systems thinking. Furthermore, organizations may not "know" they "don't know" their true level of search expertise, a lack of knowing. A metamodel is presented identifying the causal factors for workplace exploratory search task performance. Semistructured qualitative interviews with search staff from the defense, pharmaceutical, and aerospace sectors indicates the potential transferability of the finding that organizations may not know their search expertise levels.},

The 30 scientometricians studied were clustered according to the core impact indices. The members in the clusters so obtained overlap only partly with the members in the cohorts made by professional recognition. The Total Overlap is calculated by dividing the sum of the diagonal elements in the cohorts-clusters matrix with the total number of elements, times 100. The highest overlap 76.6% was obtained with the g-index. Accordingly, the g-index seems to have the greatest discriminative power in the system studied.

Queries' temporal patterns are inherent time series patterns of the search volumes of queries that reflect the evolution of the popularity of a query over time. By analyzing the temporal patterns of queries, search engines can more deeply understand the users' search intents and thus improve performance. Furthermore, we extract three groups of features based on the queries' search volume time series and use a support vector machine SVM to automatically detect the temporal patterns of user queries.

A standard way to represent a topic is using a term list; that is the top-n words with highest conditional probability within the topic. Other topic representations such as textual and image labels also have been proposed. However, there has been no comparison of these alternative representations. In this article, we compare 3 different topic representations in a document retrieval task. Participants were asked to retrieve relevant documents based on predefined queries within a fixed time limit, presenting topics in one of the following modalities: a lists of terms, b textual phrase labels, and c image labels. Results show that textual labels are easier for users to interpret than are term lists and image labels. Moreover, the precision of retrieved documents for textual and image labels is comparable to the precision achieved by representing topics using term lists, demonstrating that labeling methods are an effective alternative topic representation.},

Because proverbs can be described and indexed by multiple characteristics and criteria, we built a multidimensional ontology suitable for proverb classification. To evaluate the effectiveness of the constructed ontology for improving search and retrieval of proverbs, a large-scale user experiment was arranged with 70 users who were asked to search a proverb repository using ontology-based and free-text search interfaces. The comparative analysis of the results shows that the use of this ontology helped to substantially improve the search recall, precision, user satisfaction, and efficiency and to minimize user effort during the search process. A practical contribution of this work is an automated web-based proverb search and retrieval system which incorporates the proposed ontological scheme and an initial corpus of ontology-based annotated proverbs.},

abstract = {Users of research databases, such as CiteSeerX, Google Scholar, and Microsoft Academic, often search for papers using a set of keywords. Unfortunately, many authors avoid listing sufficient keywords for their papers. As such, these applications may need to automatically associate good descriptive keywords with papers. When the full text of the paper is available this problem has been thoroughly studied. In many cases, however, due to copyright limitations, research databases do not have access to the full text. On the other hand, such databases typically maintain metadata, such as the title and abstract and the citation network of each paper. In this paper we study the problem of predicting which keywords are appropriate for a research paper, using different methods based on the citation network and available metadata. Our main goal is in providing search engines with the ability to extract keywords from the available metadata. However, our system can also be used for other applications, such as for recommending keywords for the authors of new papers. We create a data set of research papers, and their citation network, keywords, and other metadata, containing over 470K papers with and more than 2 million keywords. We compare our methods with predicting keywords using the title and abstract, in offline experiments and in a user study, concluding that the citation network provides much better predictions.},

The advantage of using our base maps is that it is not necessary for the user to produce a network based on all data e.g., from 1 year, but can collect the Mendeley data for a single institution or journals, topics and can match them with our already produced information. Generation of such large-scale networks is still a demanding task despite the available computer power and digital data availability.

abstract = {As a follow-up to the highly cited authors list published by Thomson Reuters in June 2014, we analyzed the top 1% most frequently cited papers published between 2002 and 2012 included in the Web of Science WoS subject category "Information Science &amp; Library Science." In all, 798 authors contributed to 305 top 1% publications; these authors were employed at 275 institutions. The authors at Harvard University contributed the largest number of papers, when the addresses are whole-number counted. However, Leiden University leads the ranking if fractional counting is used. Twenty-three of the 798 authors were also listed as most highly cited authors by Thomson Reuters in June 2014 http://highlycited.com/. Twelve of these 23 authors were involved in publishing 4 or more of the 305 papers under study. Analysis of coauthorship relations among the 798 highly cited scientists shows that coauthorships are based on common interests in a specific topic. Three topics were important between 2002 and 2012: a collection and exploitation of information in clinical practices; b use of the Internet in public communication and commerce; and c scientometrics.},

With secondary data from a 2012 survey N=622, the final well-fitting structural equation model revealed that teen online privacy concerns were primarily influenced by parental interpersonal trust and parental concerns about teens' online privacy, whereas teen privacy protection behaviors were primarily predicted by teen cost-benefit appraisal of online interactions. In turn, teen online privacy concerns predicted increased privacy protection behaviors and lower teen information disclosure. Finally, restrictive and instructive parental mediation exerted differential influences on teens' privacy protection behaviors and online information disclosure.},

Each of these interface types has its strengths and weaknesses, but few empirical evaluations have been conducted to compare them in terms of performance and perceptions of usability. In this paper, we investigate these issues using three interface types for searching and browsing location-based information across two task types: open and closed ended. The experimental study involved 180 participants who were issued an Android mobile phone preloaded with a specific interface and asked to perform a set of open- and closed-ended tasks using both searching and browsing approaches. The results suggest that the list interface performed best across all tasks in terms of completion times, whereas the AR interface ranked second and the map interface performed worst. Participants rated the list as best across most usability constructs but the map was rated better than the AR interface, even though the latter performed better. Implications of the work are discussed.},

abstract = {Sustained use of an information source is sometimes important for achieving an individual's long-term goals, such as learning and self-development. It is even more important for users of online health communities because health benefits usually come with sustained use. However, little is known about what retains a user. We interviewed 21 participants who had been using online diabetes communities in a sustained manner. Guided by self-determination theory, which posits that behaviors are sustained when they can satisfy basic human needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness, we identified mechanisms that help satisfy these needs, and thus sustain users in online health communities. Autonomy-supportive mechanisms include being respected and supported as a unique individual, feeling free in making choices, and receiving meaningful rationales about others' decisions. Competence-cultivating mechanisms include seeking information, providing information, and exchanging information with others to construct knowledge. Mechanisms that cultivate relatedness include seeing similarities between oneself and peers, receiving responses from others, providing emotional support, and forming small underground groups for closer interactions. The results suggest that, like emotions, information and small group interactions also play a key role in retaining users. System design and community management strategies are discussed based on these mechanisms.},

To assess this, Mendeley readers and citations were obtained for articles from 2004 to late 2014 in five broad categories agriculture, business, decision science, pharmacy, and the social sciences and 50 subcategories. In these areas, citation counts tended to increase with every extra year since publication, and readership counts tended to increase faster initially but then stabilize after about 5 years. The correlation between citations and readers was also higher for longer time periods, stabilizing after about 5 years. Although there were substantial differences between broad fields and smaller differences between subfields, the results confirm the value of Mendeley reader counts as early scientific impact indicators.},

Data collected from an online survey of 323 social cataloging users provide empirical support for the research model. The findings indicate that both information quality IQ and system quality SQ are significant predictors of satisfaction and SOC, which in turn lead to users' intentions to continue using these sites. In addition, SOC was found to affect continuance intention not only directly, but also indirectly through satisfaction. Theoretically, this study draws attention to a largely unexplored but essential area of research in the social cataloging literature and provides a fundamental basis to understand the determinants of continued social cataloging usage. From a managerial perspective, the findings suggest that social cataloging service providers should constantly focus their efforts on the quality control of their contents and system, and the enhancement of SOC among their users.},

abstract = {Traditionally, many information retrieval models assume that terms occur in documents independently. Although these models have already shown good performance, the word independency assumption seems to be unrealistic from a natural language point of view, which considers that terms are related to each other. Therefore, such an assumption leads to two well-known problems in information retrieval IR, namely, polysemy, or term mismatch, and synonymy. In language models, these issues have been addressed by considering dependencies such as bigrams, phrasal-concepts, or word relationships, but such models are estimated using simple n-grams or concept counting. In this paper, we address polysemy and synonymy mismatch with a concept-based language modeling approach that combines ontological concepts from external resources with frequently found collocations from the document collection. In addition, the concept-based model is enriched with subconcepts and semantic relationships through a semantic smoothing technique so as to perform semantic matching. Experiments carried out on TREC collections show that our model achieves significant improvements over a single word-based model and the Markov Random Field model using a Markov classifier.},

By linking recommendations for 28,254 publications in F1000 with citations in Scopus, we investigated the effect of research level basic, clinical, mixed and article type on the internal consistency of assessments based on citations and FFa scores. The research level has little impact on the differences between the 2 evaluation tools, while article type has a big effect. These 2 measures differ significantly for 2 groups: a nonprimary research or evidence-based research are more highly cited but not highly recommended, while b translational research or transformative research are more highly recommended but have fewer citations. This can be expected, since citation activity is usually practiced by academic authors while the potential for scientific revolutions and the suitability for clinical practice of an article should be investigated from a practitioners' perspective. We conclude with a recommendation that the application of bibliometric approaches in research evaluation should consider the proportion of 3 types of publications: evidence-based research, transformative research, and translational research. The latter 2 types are more suitable for assessment through peer review.},

abstract = {Scholars writing books that are widely used to support teaching in higher education may be undervalued because of a lack of evidence of teaching value. Although sales data may give credible evidence for textbooks, these data may poorly reflect educational uses of other types of books. As an alternative, this article proposes a method to search automatically for mentions of books in online academic course syllabi based on Bing searches for syllabi mentioning a given book, filtering out false matches through an extensive set of rules. The method had an accuracy of over 90% based on manual checks of a sample of 2,600 results from the initial Bing searches. Over one third of about 14,000 monographs checked had one or more academic syllabus mention, with more in the arts and humanities 56% and social sciences 52%. Low but significant correlations between syllabus mentions and citations across most fields, except the social sciences, suggest that books tend to have different levels of impact for teaching and research. In conclusion, the automatic syllabus search method gives a new way to estimate the educational utility of books in a way that sales data and citation counts cannot.},

This research investigated what happens if researchers de facto allow distractions to occur in a test situation. It examined the type and magnitude of occurred distractions, the effects distractions have on completion scores, and whether different distractions affect different test activities differently. In the research design, participants were randomly assigned to either a controlled environment or their natural environment. The results showed that whereas participants in the natural environment needed more time to complete the post task questionnaire than their laboratory counterparts, they spent a similar amount of time on the tasks. Participants were capable of, and indeed willing to, limit the less-urgent distractions in the interests of getting the tasks done. If they were interrupted by a human contact, however, the completion time for tasks increased significantly. Previous studies showed that distractions change information behavior. Yet, the present results provide evidence that these changes do not always occur, and thus there needs to be a better demarcation of the limits within which distraction can be expected to change how people interact with information.},

abstract = {The evaluation of scientific research is crucial for both the academic community and society as a whole. Numerous bibliometric indices have been proposed for the ranking of research performance, mainly on an ad hoc basis. We introduce the novel class of Scientific Research Measures SRMs to rank scientists' research performance and provide a rigorous theoretical foundation for these measures. In contrast to many bibliometric indices, SRMs take into account the whole citation curve of the scientist, offer appealing structural properties, allow a finer ranking of scientists, correspond to specific features of different disciplines, research areas and seniorities, and include several bibliometric indices as special cases. Thus SRMs result in more accurate rankings than ad hoc bibliometric indices. We also introduce the further general class of Dual SRMs that reflect the "value" of journals and permit the ranking of research institutions based on theoretically sound criteria, which has been a central theme in the scientific community over recent decades. An empirical application to the citation curves of 173 finance scholars shows that SRMs can be easily calibrated to actual citation curves and generate different authors' rankings than those produced by seven traditional bibliometric indices.},

A total of 88.1% of the records have received no citation, but some repositories show very low uncitedness rates. Although data citation practices are rare in most fields, they have expanded in disciplines such as crystallography and genomics.

Cloud storage, personal network-attached storage NAS, and external hard drives are more affordable than ever before and one would think that backing up personal digital information is a straightforward process nowadays. Despite this, small group studies and corporate surveys show the opposite. In this paper we present the results from a quantitative and qualitative survey of 319 participants about how they back up their personal computers and restore personal information in case of computer failures. The results show that the majority of users do manual, selective, and noncontinuous backups, rely on a set of planned and unplanned backups as a consequence of other activities, have inadequate knowledge about possible solutions and implications of using known solutions, and so on. The study also reveals that around a fifth of all computers are not backed up, and a quarter of most important files and a third of most important folders at the time of the survey could not be fully restored in the event of computer failure. Based on the results, several implications for practice and research are presented.},

To explore the use of information as a concept within dominant public health behavior models and the manner in which information practices are handled therein, we undertook a scoping study. We scoped the use of "information" within core English-language health behavior textbooks and examined dominant models of health behavior for information practices. Index terms within these texts indicated a lack of common language around information-related concepts. Nine models/theories were discussed in a majority of the texts. These were grouped by model type and examined for information-related concepts/constructs. Information was framed as a "thing" or resource, and information practices were commonly included or implied. However, lack of specificity regarding the definition of information, how it differs from knowledge, and how context affects information practices make the exact role of information within health behavior models unclear. Although health information interventions may be grounded in behavioral theory, a limited understanding of the ways information works within people's lives hinders our ability to effectively use information to improve health. By the same token, information scientists should explore public health's interventionist approach.},

This study analyzes a whether search expertise, prior topic knowledge, topic interest, or flow experience during a search of the World Wide Web WWW influence success in finding relevant information and b whether the effects of these predictors vary during the course of the search process. Two different search tasks are investigated: The evaluating task focuses on the selection of relevant websites from a large number of potentially relevant sites, whereas the finding task focuses on the difficulty of finding information in the case of a lack of potentially relevant websites. Survival analysis is applied to data from a quasi-experiment. This analysis considers not only the question of whether information is found, but also when. Findings show that search expertise and flow explain success in the evaluation task; however, flow is only influential in the first phase of the search process. For the finding task, the predictors have no explanatory strength.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to test whether query expansion by approximate string matching methods is beneficial in retrieval from historical newspaper collections in a language rich with compounds and inflectional forms Finnish. First, approximate string matching methods were used to generate lists of index words most similar to contemporary query terms in a digitized newspaper collection from the 1800s. Top index word variants were categorized to estimate the appropriate query expansion ranges in the retrieval test. Second, the effectiveness of approximate string matching methods, automatically generated inflectional forms, and their combinations were measured in a Cranfield-style test. Finally, a detailed topic-level analysis of test results was conducted. In the index of historical newspaper collection the occurrences of a word typically spread to many linguistic and historical variants along with optical character recognition OCR errors. All query expansion methods improved the baseline results. Extensive expansion of around 30 variants for each query word was required to achieve the highest performance improvement. Query expansion based on approximate string matching was superior to using the inflectional forms of the query words, showing that coverage of the different types of variation is more important than precision in handling one type of variation.},

abstract = {Many computer users today value personalization but perceive it in conflict with their desire for privacy. They therefore tend not to disclose data that would be useful for personalization. We investigate how characteristics of the personalization provider influence users' attitudes towards personalization and their resulting disclosure behavior. We propose an integrative model that links these characteristics via privacy attitudes to actual disclosure behavior. Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model, we discuss in what way the influence of the manipulated provider characteristics is different for users engaging in different levels of elaboration represented by the user characteristics of privacy concerns and self-efficacy. We find particularly that a reputation management is effective when users predominantly use the peripheral route i.e., a low level of elaboration, but much less so when they predominantly use the central route i.e., a high level of elaboration; b client-side personalization has a positive impact when users use either route; and c personalization in the cloud does not work well in either route. Managers and designers can use our results to instill more favorable privacy attitudes and increase disclosure, using different techniques that depend on each user's levels of privacy concerns and privacy self-efficacy.},

abstract = {Compared to the early versions of smart phones, recent mobile devices have bigger screens that can present more web search results. Several previous studies have reported differences in user interaction between conventional desktop computer and mobile device-based web searches, so it is imperative to consider the differences in user behavior for web search engine interface design on mobile devices. However, it is still unknown how the diversification of screen sizes on hand-held devices affects how users search. In this article, we investigate search performance and behavior on three different small screen sizes: early smart phones, recent smart phones, and phablets. We found no significant difference with respect to the efficiency of carrying out tasks, however participants exhibited different search behaviors: less eye movement within top links on the larger screen, fast reading with some hesitation before choosing a link on the medium, and frequent use of scrolling on the small screen. This result suggests that the presentation of web search results for each screen needs to take into account differences in search behavior. We suggest several ideas for presentation design for each screen size.},

This study uses a concrete example in an attempt to evaluate a research institute from the area of social sciences and humanities with the help of data from Google Scholar GS. In order to use GS for a bibliometric study, we developed procedures for the normalization of citation impact, building on the procedures of classical bibliometrics. In order to test the convergent validity of the normalized citation impact scores, we calculated normalized scores for a subset of the publications based on data from the Web of Science WoS and Scopus. Even if scores calculated with the help of GS and the WoS/Scopus are not identical for the different publication types considered here, they are so similar that they result in the same assessment of the institute investigated in this study: For example, the institute's papers whose journals are covered in the WoS are cited at about an average rate compared with the other papers in the journals.},

It has also been recognized that geography is an important criterion of relevance, leading to the research area of geographic information retrieval. As users increasingly retrieve information in mobile situations, relevance is often related to geographic features in the real world as well as their representation in web documents. We present 2 methods for assessing geographic relevance GR of geographic entities in a mobile use context that include the 5 criteria topicality, spatiotemporal proximity, directionality, cluster, and colocation. To determine the effectiveness and validity of these methods, we evaluate them through a user study conducted on the Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing platform. An analysis of relevance ranks for geographic entities in 3 scenarios produced by two GR methods, 2 baseline methods, and human judgments collected in the experiment reveal that one of the GR methods produces similar ranks as human assessors.},

A major hurdle for current state-of-the-art automatic methods for sentiment analysis is the fact that human communication often involves the use of sarcasm or irony, where the author means the opposite of what she/he says. Sarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite. Lack of naturally occurring utterances labeled for sarcasm is one of the key problems for the development of machine-learning methods for sarcasm detection. We report on a method for constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter messages in which determination of the sarcasm of each message has been made by its author. We use this reliable corpus to compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm. We investigate the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors on machine-learning effectiveness for identifying sarcastic utterances and we compare the performance of machine-learning techniques and human judges on this task.},

abstract = {Recent research in information studies suggests that the tradition of seeing the discipline as weak is still alive and kicking. This is a problem because the discourse of the weak discipline creates conceptual confusion in relation to interdisciplinarity. Considering the growth of the iSchools and what is assumed to be a major institutional redrawing of boundaries, there is a pressing need to conceptualize interdisciplinary practices and boundary work. This paper explores the "weak" discipline through a discourse analytical lens and identifies a myth. Perceiving the discipline as weak is part of a myth, fueled by the ideal of a unitary discipline; the ideal discipline has strong boundaries, and as long as the discourse continues to focus on a need for boundaries, the only available discourse is one that articulates the discipline as weak. Thus, the myth is a vicious circle that can be broken if weakness is no longer ascribed to the discipline by tradition. The paper offers an explanation of the workings of the myth so that its particular way of interpreting the world does not mislead us when theorizing interdisciplinarity. This is a conceptual paper, and the examples serve as an empirical backdrop to the conceptual argument.},

The empirical data are taken from two online surveys of European authors. Taking a domain analytic approach, the analysis draws on Becher and Trowler's 2001 and Whitley's 2000 theories to gain a deeper understanding of why OA repositories OAR play a particularly important role in the chosen disciplines. The surveys provided a unique opportunity to compare perceptions, motivations, and behaviors of researchers at the discipline level with the parent metadiscipline. It should be noted that participants were not drawn from a stratified sample of all the different subdisciplines that constitute each discipline, and therefore the generalizability of the findings to the discipline may be limited. The differential role of informal and formal communication in each of the three disciplines has shaped green OA practices. For physicists and economists, preprints are an essential feature of their respective OAR landscapes, whereas for clinical medics final published articles have a central role. In comparing the disciplines with their parent metadisciplines there were some notable similarities/differences, which have methodological implications for studying research cultures.},

In response, this article reports a content analysis of random samples of 800 images tweeted from the UK or USA during a week at the end of 2014. Although most images were photographs, a substantial minority were hybrid or layered image forms: phone screenshots, collages, captioned pictures, and pictures of text messages. About half were primarily of one or more people, including 10% that were selfies, but a wide variety of other things were also pictured. Some of the images were for advertising or to share a joke but in most cases the purpose of the tweet seemed to be to share the minutiae of daily lives, performing the function of chat or gossip, sometimes in innovative ways.},

We use a Web of Science data set consisting of 3.6 million articles published in 2003 to 2008 and classified into 5,119 clusters. The main findings are the following. First, the universality claim, according to which all university-citation distributions, appropriately normalized, follow a single functional form, is not supported by the data. Second, the 500 university citation distributions are all highly skewed and very similar. Broadly speaking, university citation distributions appear to behave as if they differ by a relatively constant scale factor over a large, intermediate part of their support. Third, citation-impact differences between universities account for 3.85% of overall citation inequality. This percentage is greatly reduced when university citation distributions are normalized using their mean normalized citation scores MNCSs as normalization factors. Finally, regarding practical consequences, we only need a single explanatory model for the type of high skewness characterizing all university citation distributions, and the similarity of university citation distributions goes a long way in explaining the similarity of the university rankings obtained with the MNCS and the Top 10% indicator.},

Although there exists an ample amount of research into understanding exploration, most of the major information retrieval IR systems do not provide tailored and adaptive support for such tasks. One reason is the lack of empirical knowledge on how to distinguish exploratory and lookup search behaviors in IR systems. The goal of this article is to investigate how to separate the 2 types of tasks in an IR system using easily measurable behaviors. In this article, we first review characteristics of exploratory search behavior. We then report on a controlled study of 6 search tasks with 3 exploratory-comparison, knowledge acquisition, planning-and 3 lookup tasks-fact-finding, navigational, question answering. The results are encouraging, showing that IR systems can distinguish the 2 search categories in the course of a search session. The most distinctive indicators that characterize exploratory search behaviors are query length, maximum scroll depth, and task completion time. However, 2 tasks are borderline and exhibit mixed characteristics. We assess the applicability of this finding by reporting on several classification experiments. Our results have valuable implications for designing tailored and adaptive IR systems.},

We draw upon the substantial body of work by John Searle to help understand the place of lists and identifiers in the constitution of institutional order. To enable us to ground our discussion of the potentiality and problematic associated with lists we describe a number of significant instances of list-making, situated particularly around the use of identifiers to refer to people, places, and products. The theorization developed allows us to better explain not only the significance imbued within lists and identifiers but the key part they play in form-ing the institutional order. We also hint at the role such symbolic artifacts play within breakdowns in institutional order.},

The identification of such concepts is a challenging prediction task that would help multiple parties-including researchers and the general public-focus their attention within the vast scientific literature. In this paper we present a system that predicts the future impact of a scientific concept, represented as a technical term, based on the information available from recently published research articles. We analyze the usefulness of rich features derived from the full text of the articles through a variety of approaches, including rhetorical sentence analysis, information extraction, and time-series analysis. The results from two large-scale experiments with 3.8 million full-text articles and 48 million metadata records support the conclusion that full-text features are significantly more useful for prediction than metadata-only features and that the most accurate predictions result from combining the metadata and full-text features. Surprisingly, these results hold even when the metadata features are available for a much larger number of documents than are available for the full-text features.},

Although helpful machine-learning methods have been applied successfully to similar situations for English news articles, limited research has been completed to yield suitable solutions for Arabic news. In connection with a Qatar National Research Fund QNRF-funded project to build digital library community and infrastructure in Qatar, we developed software for browsing a collection of about 237,000 Arabic news articles, which should be applicable to other Arabic news collections. We designed a simple taxonomy for Arabic news stories that is suitable for the needs of Qatar and other nations, is compatible with the subject codes of the International Press Telecommunications Council, and was enhanced with the aid of a librarian expert as well as five Arabic-speaking volunteers. We developed tailored stemming i.e., a new Arabic light stemmer called P-Stemmer and automatic classification methods the best being binary Support Vector Machines classifiers to work with the taxonomy. Using evaluation techniques commonly used in the information retrieval community, including 10-fold cross-validation and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we showed that our approach to stemming and classification is superior to state-of-the-art techniques.},

We report on a study of the relationship between information searchers' topic knowledge and their search behaviors, and on an attempt to predict searchers' topic knowledge from their behaviors during the search. Data were collected in a controlled laboratory experiment with 32 undergraduate journalism student participants, each searching on 4 tasks of different types. In general, behavioral variables were not found to have significant differences between users with high and low levels of topic knowledge, except the mean first dwell time on search result pages. Several models were built to predict topic knowledge using behavioral variables calculated at 3 different stages of search episodes: the first-query-round, the middle point of the search, and the end point. It was found that a model using some search behaviors observed in the first query round led to satisfactory prediction results. The results suggest that early-session search behaviors can be used to predict users' topic knowledge levels, allowing personalization of search for users with different levels of topic knowledge, especially in order to assist users with low topic knowledge.},

I then test the method by comparing its precision and recall to that of 14 published systematic reviews. The method successfully retrieved 74% of the studies included in these reviews and 90% of the studies it could reasonably be expected to retrieve. The method also retrieved fewer than half of the total number of publications retrieved by these reviews and can be performed in substantially less time. This suggests that the proposed method offers a promising complement to traditional text-based methods of literature identification and retrieval for systematic reviews.},

abstract = {We prove that Ochiai similarity of the co-occurrence matrix is equal to cosine similarity in the underlying occurrence matrix. Neither the cosine nor the Pearson correlation should be used for the normalization of co-occurrence matrices because the similarity is then normalized twice, and therefore overestimated; the Ochiai coefficient can be used instead. Results are shown using a small matrix 5 cases, 4 variables for didactic reasons, and also Ahlgren etal.'s 2003 co-occurrence matrix of 24 authors in library and information sciences. The overestimation is shown numerically and will be illustrated using multidimensional scaling and cluster dendograms. If the occurrence matrix is not available such as in internet research or author cocitation analysis using Ochiai for the normalization is preferable to using the cosine.},

To understand the influence of online reviews, this study extends prior research on information adoption by incorporating the perspective of herd behavior. We develop and empirically test a research model using data collected from an existing book review site. We report 2 major findings. First, argument quality and source credibility predict information usefulness, which affects the adoption of online reviews. Second, we determine that the adoption of online reviews is also influenced by 2 herd factors, namely, discounting own information and imitating others. We further identify the key determinants of these herd factors, including background homophily and attitude homophily. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {MELIBEA is a directory of institutional open-access policies for research output that uses a composite formula with eight weighted conditions to estimate the "strength" of open access OA mandates registered in ROARMAP. We analyzed total Web of Science-WoS-indexed publication output in years 2011-2013 for 67 institutions in which OA was mandated to estimate the mandates' effectiveness: How well did the MELIBEA score and its individual conditions predict what percentage of the WoS-indexed articles is actually deposited in each institution's OA repository, and when? We found a small but significant positive correlation 0.18 between the MELIBEA "strength" score and deposit percentage. For three of the eight MELIBEA conditions deposit timing, internal use, and opt-outs, one value of each was strongly associated with deposit percentage or latency [a] immediate deposit required; [b] deposit required for performance evaluation; [c] unconditional opt-out allowed for the OA requirement but no opt-out for deposit requirement. When we updated the initial values and weights of the MELIBEA formula to reflect the empirical association we had found, the score's predictive power for mandate effectiveness doubled 0.36. There are not yet enough OA mandates to test further mandate conditions that might contribute to mandate effectiveness, but the present findings already suggest that it would be productive for existing and future mandates to adopt the three identified conditions so as to maximize their effectiveness, and thereby the growth of OA.},

It is also shown that end-user energy costs play a key role in the overall environmental costs of a digital library or information service. It is argued that appropriate user research, transaction log analysis, user modeling, and better design and delivery of services can significantly reduce the user interaction time, and thus the environmental costs, of digital information systems and services, making them more sustainable.},

Peer review is considered the most important factor for determining the quality and trustworthiness of research. Researchers continue to read abstracts, check content for sound arguments and credible data, and rely on journal rankings when deciding whether to trust scholarly resources in reading, citing, or publishing.

We present a map of Finnish science based on unsupervised-learning classification, and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this approach vis-\'{\i}-vis those generated by human reasoning. We conclude that from theoretical and practical perspectives there exist several challenges for human reasoning-based classification frameworks of scientific knowledge, as they typically try to fit new-to-the-world knowledge into historical models of scientific knowledge, and cannot easily be deployed for new large-scale data sets. Automated classification schemes, in contrast, generate classification models only from the available text corpus, thereby identifying credibly novel bodies of knowledge. They also lend themselves to versatile large-scale data analysis, and enable a range of Big Data possibilities. However, we also argue that it is neither possible nor fruitful to declare one or another method a superior approach in terms of realism to classify scientific knowledge, and we believe that the merits of each approach are dependent on the practical objectives of analysis.},

As a consequence, numerous institutions and researchers are dedicated to devising systems to automate the process of checking for plagiarism. This work focuses on the problem of detecting text reuse in scientific papers. The contributions of this paper are twofold: a we survey the existing approaches for plagiarism detection based on content, based on content and structure, and based on citations and references; and b we compare content and citation-based approaches with the goal of evaluating whether they are complementary and if their combination can improve the quality of the detection. We carry out experiments with real data sets of scientific papers and concluded that a combination of the methods can be beneficial.},

abstract = {This study examines whether an institution's research resources affect its centrality and relationships in international collaboration among 606 astronomical institutions worldwide. The findings support our theoretical hypotheses that an institution's research resources are positively related to its central position in the network. Astronomical institutions with superior resources, such as being equipped with international observational facilities and having substantial research manpower, tend to have more foreign partners high degree centrality and play an influential role high betweenness centrality in the international collaboration network. An institution becomes more and more active in international collaborations as its research population expands. In terms of the relationship, which is captured by an actor institution's co-authorship preference for each partner in the network, the effect of research resources is not as significant as expected. We found that astronomical institutions are not necessarily preferentially co-authoring with partners that have better research resources. In addition, this study indicates that geographic closeness or "geographic proximity" largely affects the occurrence of international collaboration. The investigated institutions apparently prefer partners from neighboring countries. This finding gives an indication of the phenomenon of "regional homophily" in the international collaboration network.},

We hypothesized that PSP clustering is mainly affected by countries' geographic location, ethnicity, and level of economic development, as indicated in previous studies. Our results showed that the 100 countries with the highest rates of publications were decomposed into 12 PSP groups and that countries within a group tended to be geographically proximal, ethnically similar, or comparable in terms of economic status. Hubs and bridging nodes in each knowledge production group were identified. The performance of each group was evaluated across 16 knowledge domains based on their specialization, volume of publications, and relative impact. Awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of each group in various knowledge domains may have useful applications for examining scientific policies, adjusting the allocation of resources, and promoting international collaboration for future developments.},

abstract = {The results of bibliometric studies provided by bibliometric research groups, for example, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies CWTS and the Institute for Research Information and Quality Assurance iFQ, are often used in the process of research assessment. Their databases use Web of Science WoS citation data, which they match according to their own matching algorithms-in the case of CWTS for standard usage in their studies and in the case of iFQ on an experimental basis. Because the problem of nonmatched citations in the WoS persists due to inaccuracies in the references or inaccuracies introduced in the data extraction process, it is important to ascertain how well these inaccuracies are rectified in these citation matching algorithms. This article evaluates the algorithms of CWTS and iFQ in comparison to the WoS in a quantitative and a qualitative analysis. The analysis builds upon the method and the manually verified corpus of a previous study. The algorithm of CWTS performs best, closely followed by that of iFQ. The WoS algorithm still performs quite well F1 score: 96.41%, but shows deficits in matching references containing inaccuracies. An additional problem is posed by incorrectly provided cited reference information in source articles by the WoS.},

The overall test analysis confirmed the ILT reliability and discrimination power as appropriate Cronbach's alpha 0.74; Ferguson's delta 0.97. The students' average overall achievement was 66%, and IL increased with the year of study. The students were less successful in advanced database search strategies, which require a combination of knowledge, comprehension, and logic, and in topics related to intellectual property and ethics.

abstract = {Social question &amp; answer forums offer great learning opportunities, but students need to evaluate the credibility of answers to avoid being misled by untrustworthy sources. This critical evaluation may be beyond the capabilities of students from primary and secondary school. We conducted 2 studies to assess how students from primary, secondary, and undergraduate education perceive and use 2 relevant credibility cues in forums: author's identity and evidence used to support his answer. Students didn't use these cues when they evaluated forums with a single answer Experiment 1, but they recommended more often answers from self-reported experts than from users with a pseudonym when multiple sources were discussed in the forum Experiment 2. This pattern of results suggested that multiple viewpoints increase students' attention to source features in forum messages. Experiment 2 also revealed that primary school students preferred personal experience as evidence in the messages, whereas undergraduate students preferred the inclusion of documentary sources. Thus, while children mimic the adult preference for expert sources in web forums, they treat source information in a rather superficial manner. To conclude, we outline possible mechanisms to understand how credibility assessment evolves across educational levels, and discuss potential implications for the educational curriculum in information literacy.},

From submissions and subscriptions to grants and hirings, researchers, policy makers, and funding agencies make important decisions influenced by journal rankings such as the ISI journal impact factor. Typically, the rankings are derived from the citation network between a selection of journals and unavoidably depend on this selection. However, little is known about how robust rankings are to the selection of included journals. We compare the robustness of three journal rankings based on network flows induced on citation networks. They model pathways of researchers navigating the scholarly literature, stepping between journals and remembering their previous steps to different degrees: zero-step memory as impact factor, one-step memory as Eigenfactor, and two-step memory, corresponding to zero-, first-, and second-order Markov models of citation flow between journals. We conclude that higher-order Markov models perform better and are more robust to the selection of journals. Whereas our analysis indicates that higher-order models perform better, the performance gain for higher-order Markov models comes at the cost of requiring more citation data over a longer time period.},

The results demonstrate that the core-scatter distribution of cited authors, institutions, and journals varies for authors in each impact and productivity class. All authors in the science network receive the majority of their credit from high-impact authors; however, this effect decreases as authors' impact levels decrease. Similarly, the proportion of citations that lower-impact authors make to each other increases as authors' impact levels decrease. High-impact authors, who have the highest degree of membership in the science network, publish fewer papers in comparison to highly productive authors. However, authors with the highest impact make both more references per paper and also more citations to papers in the science network. This suggests that high-impact authors produce the most relevant work in the science network. Comparing practices by productivity level, authors receive the majority of their credit from highly productive authors and authors cite highly productive authors more frequently than less productive authors.},

In this study, we examine the moderating effect of role perceptions on the relations between each of the two motivational constructs and knowledge sharing, paying particular attention to the affordances of the enabling information technology. An analysis of survey data from a wiki-based organizational encyclopedia in a large, multinational firm reveals that when contributors' motivation is externally driven, they are more likely to share knowledge if this activity is viewed as in-role behavior. However, when contributors' motivation is internally driven, they are more likely to participate in knowledge sharing when this activity is viewed as extra-role behavior. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Sophisticated documents like legal cases and biomedical articles can contain unusually long sentences. Extractive summarizers can select such sentences-potentially adding hundreds of unnecessary words to the summary-or exclude them and lose important content. Sentence simplification or compression seems on the surface to be a promising solution. However, compression removes words before the selection algorithm can use them, and simplification generates sentences that may be ambiguous in an extractive summary. We therefore compare the performance of an extractive summarizer selecting from the sentences of the original document with that of the summarizer selecting from sentences shortened in three ways: simplification, compression, and disaggregation, which splits one sentence into several according to rules designed to keep all meaning. We find that on legal cases and biomedical articles, these shortening methods generate ungrammatical output. Human evaluators performed an extrinsic evaluation consisting of comprehension questions about the summaries. Evaluators given compressed, simplified, or disaggregated versions of the summaries answered fewer questions correctly than did those given summaries with unaltered sentences. Error analysis suggests 2 causes: Altered sentences sometimes interact with the sentence selection algorithm, and alterations to sentences sometimes obscure information in the summary. We discuss future work to alleviate these problems.},

We analyzed 127,812 articles published between 1988 and 2013 in 173 journals on the ISI Web of Science in the "management" category. Collaboration occurred in approximately 60% of all articles. A power-law relationship was found between citation-based performance and journal size and collaboration patterns. The number of citations expected by collaborative articles increases 21.89 or 3.7 times when the number of collaborative articles published in a journal doubles. The number of citations expected by noncollaborative articles only increases 21.35 or 2.55 times if a journal publishes double the number of noncollaborative articles. The Matthew effect is stronger for collaborative than for noncollaborative articles. Scale-independent indicators increase the confidence in the evaluation of the impact of the articles published in management journals.},

To explore whether autocomplete functions reduce the impact of dyslexia on information searching, 20 participants with dyslexia and 20 controls solved 10 predefined tasks in the search engine Google. Eye-tracking and screen-capture documented the searches. There were no significant differences between the dyslexic students and the controls in time usage, number of queries, query lengths, or the use of the autocomplete function. However, participants with dyslexia made more misspellings and looked less at the screen and the autocomplete suggestions lists while entering the queries. The results indicate that although the autocomplete function supported the participants in the search process, a more extensive use of the autocomplete function would have reduced misspellings. Further, the high tolerance for spelling errors considerably reduced the effect of dyslexia, and may be as important as the autocomplete function.},

This article expands on the data sharing component of a paper presented at the 2013 ASIST conference. A three-phase project is reported. Conducted between 2011 and 2013 within an environmental voluntary group, the Australian Plants Society Victoria APSV, the interviews of the first phase are the major data source. Because the project revealed the importance of data sharing with professional scientists, their views are included in the literature review where four themes are explored: lack of shared disciplinary culture, trust, responsibility and controlled access to data, and describing data to enable reuse. The findings, presented under these themes, revealed that, within APSV, sharing among members is mostly generous and uninhibited. Beyond APSV, when online repositories were involved, barriers came very strongly into play. Trust was weaker and barriers also included issues of data quality, data description, and ownership and control. The conclusion is that further investigation of these barriers, including the attitudes of professional scientists to using data contributed by citizen scientists, would indicate how more extensive and useful data sharing could be achieved.},

Researchers and practitioners have both touted the benefits and warned of the drawbacks associated with data science and big data approaches, but few studies investigate how data science is carried out "on the ground." In this paper, we first review the hype and criticisms surrounding data science and big data approaches. We then present the findings of semistructured interviews with 18 data analysts from various industries and organizational roles. Using qualitative coding techniques, we evaluated these interviews in light of the hype and criticisms surrounding data science in the popular discourse. We found that although the data analysts we interviewed were sensitive to both the allure and the potential pitfalls of data science, their motivations and evaluations of their work were more nuanced. We conclude by reflecting on the relationship between data analysts' work and the discourses around data science and big data, suggesting how future research can better account for the everyday practices of this profession.},

abstract = {Scientific disciplines are distinct not only in what they know but in how they know what they know-that is, in their "epistemic cultures." There is a close relationship between the technologies that a field utilizes and sanctions and the process of inquiry, the character and meaning of corroborative data and evidence, and the kinds of models and theories developed in a field. As the machinery changes, epistemic practices also change. A case in point is how the epistemic practices of historians are reconfigured by the introduction of Geographic Information Systems GIS. We argue that GIS mediates historical understanding and knowledge creation in at least three ways: a by allowing historians to bring new sets of data into analysis, b by introducing novel questions, fresh insights, and new modes of analysis and reasoning, or discovering new answers to older questions; and c by providing new tools for historians to communicate with each other and with their audiences. We illustrate these mediations through the study of the historiography of Budapest Ghettos during World War II. Our study shows how GIS functionalities reveal hitherto unknown aspects of social life in the ghettos, while pushing certain other aspects into the background.},

abstract = {This article describes an experimental study that examines the extent to which a group decision support system GDSS, which allows team members to view other members' preference ratings, can encourage changes in individual preferences. We studied 22, four-person teams performing 2 hidden profile tasks-simple and complex-in a controlled setting. Transparency of the interactions, achieved through the visibility of ratings, influenced changes in participants' preferences as measured before, during and after the team discussion. Visibility of team scores could then offer an effective way to reach consensus, despite individual incumbent preferences. Changes between individuals' initial preferences and team preferences were found to be larger for members working on a complex task compared to a simple task, as were changes between individuals' prediscussion and postdiscussion preferences. Although prior studies established that the initial preferences of individual team members are rather sticky, this study reveals that individuals adjusted their initial preferences to reach a team consensus, as well as modified their preferences after team discussions. Despite the mixed earlier research results on the impact of GDSS on efficient decision making, findings from this study suggest that in complex decision-making contexts, GDSS tools can be effective in enabling consensus building in groups.},

abstract = {Information and communications technologies ICTs have enabled the rise of so-called "Collaborative Consumption" CC: the peer-to-peer-based activity of obtaining, giving, or sharing the access to goods and services, coordinated through community-based online services. CC has been expected to alleviate societal problems such as hyper-consumption, pollution, and poverty by lowering the cost of economic coordination within communities. However, beyond anecdotal evidence, there is a dearth of understanding why people participate in CC. Therefore, in this article we investigate people's motivations to participate in CC. The study employs survey data N=168 gathered from people registered onto a CC site. The results show that participation in CC is motivated by many factors such as its sustainability, enjoyment of the activity as well as economic gains. An interesting detail in the result is that sustainability is not directly associated with participation unless it is at the same time also associated with positive attitudes towards CC. This suggests that sustainability might only be an important factor for those people for whom ecological consumption is important. Furthermore, the results suggest that in CC an attitude-behavior gap might exist; people perceive the activity positively and say good things about it, but this good attitude does not necessary translate into action.},

The optimization results were assessed by both density analysis and edge strength analysis methods. In addition, the results were evaluated by domain experts. From this study, it is recommended that four subcategories be switched from their original four categories into two different categories as a result of the parent-child relationship optimization.It is also recommended that 132 subcategories be moved to 40 subcategories and that eight categories be moved to two categories as a result of the related connection optimization. The findings show that optimization boosted the densities of the optimized categories, and the recommended connections of both the related categories and subcategories were stronger than the existing connections of the related categories and subcategories. This paper provides visual displays of the optimization analysis as well as suggestions to enhance the subject directory of this portal.},

Providing access to these online resources is costly, and it is difficult both to analyze the value of this content to the institution and to discern those journals that comparatively provide more value. In this research, we examine 1,510 journals from a large research university library, representing more than 40% of the university's annual subscription cost for electronic resources at the time of the study. We utilize a web analytics approach for the creation of a linear regression model to predict usage among these journals. We categorize metrics into two classes: global journal focused and local institution dependent. Using 275 journals for our training set, our analysis shows that a combination of global and local metrics creates the strongest model for predicting full-text downloads. Our linear regression model has an accuracy of more than 80% in predicting downloads for the 1,235 journals in our test set. The implications of the findings are that university libraries that use local metrics have better insight into the value of a journal and therefore more efficient cost content management.},

Plotting Nobel numbers over several decades provides a quantitative as well as visual indication of a researcher's proximity to the intuitive "center" of a discipline as defined by recognized scientific achievement. It is shown that the Nobel number distributions for physics of several researchers both within and outside of physics are surprisingly flat over the five-decade span from 1951 to 2000. A model in which Nobel laureates are typically connected by short coauthorship paths both intergenerationally and between subdisciplines reproduces such flat Nobel number distributions.},

This paper provides an early review of administrative costs incurred by universities in making research outputs OA, either via publication in journals "Gold" OA, involving payment of article-processing charges APCs, or via deposit in repositories "Green" OA. Using data from 29 UK institutions, it finds that the administrative time, as well as the cost incurred by universities, to make an article OA using the Gold route is over 2.5 times higher than Green. Costs are then modeled at a national level using recent UK policy initiatives from Research Councils UK and the Higher Education Funding Councils' Research Excellence Framework as case studies. The study also demonstrates that the costs of complying with research funders' OA policies are considerably higher than where an OA publication is left entirely to authors' discretion. Key target areas for future efficiencies in the business processes are identified and potential cost savings calculated. The analysis is designed to inform ongoing policy development at the institutional and national levels.},

Thesauri in this research are automatically developed in a simulation from sets of randomly or exhaustively generated documents. Each thesaurus is generated by the Thesaurus Generator software from a set of several hundred documents, and thousands of different document sets are used as input to the Thesaurus Generator, producing thousands of thesauri. Thus, thousands of thesauri are generated for each data point in accompanying graphs. The characteristics of this large number of thesauri are studied so that the relationships between thesaurus parameters can be determined. Some rules governing these relationships are suggested, addressing factors such as tree height and width, number of tree roots in thesauri, and number of terms available for the vocabulary. How these parameters scale as vocabularies grow is addressed. These results apply to various information systems that contain features with hierarchical relationships, including many thesauri and ontologies.},

A 3-step approach is employed: the first step examines disciplines' citation characteristics through scientific trading dimensions; the second step analyzes citation flows between pairs of disciplines; and the third step uses egocentric citation networks to assess individual disciplines' citation flow diversity through Shannon entropy. The results show that measured by scientific impact, the subjects of Chemical Engineering, Energy, and Environmental Science have the fastest growth. Furthermore, most subjects are carrying out more diversified knowledge trading practices by importing higher volumes of knowledge from a greater number of subjects. The study also finds that the growth rates of disciplinary citations align with the growth rates of global research and development R&amp;D expenditures, thus providing evidence to support the impact of R&amp;D expenditures on knowledge production.},

abstract = {The increasing abundance of digital textual archives provides an opportunity for understanding human social systems. Yet the literature has not adequately considered the disparate social processes by which texts are produced. Drawing on communication theory, we identify three common processes by which documents might be detectably similar in their textual features-authors sharing subject matter, sharing goals, and sharing sources. We hypothesize that these processes produce distinct, detectable relationships between authors in different kinds of textual overlap. We develop a novel n-gram extraction technique to capture such signatures based on n-grams of different lengths. We test the hypothesis on a corpus where the author attributes are observable: the public statements of the members of the U.S. Congress. This article presents the first empirical finding that shows different social relationships are detectable through the structure of overlapping textual features. Our study has important implications for designing text modeling techniques to make sense of social phenomena from aggregate digital traces.},

abstract = {Software is increasingly crucial to scholarship, yet the visibility and usefulness of software in the scientific record are in question. Just as with data, the visibility of software in publications is related to incentives to share software in reusable ways, and so promote efficient science. In this article, we examine software in publications through content analysis of a random sample of 90 biology articles. We develop a coding scheme to identify software "mentions" and classify them according to their characteristics and ability to realize the functions of citations. Overall, we find diverse and problematic practices: Only between 31% and 43% of mentions involve formal citations; informal mentions are very common, even in high impact factor journals and across different kinds of software. Software is frequently inaccessible 15%-29% of packages in any form; between 90% and 98% of specific versions; only between 24%-40% provide source code. Cites to publications are particularly poor at providing version information, whereas informal mentions are particularly poor at providing crediting information. We provide recommendations to improve the practice of software citation, highlighting recent nascent efforts. Software plays an increasingly great role in scientific practice; it deserves a clear and useful place in scholarly communication.},

abstract = {Previous studies have not fully investigated the role of source accessibility versus source quality in the selection of information sources. It remains unclear what their relative importance is. Three different models have been identified: a an exclusively accessibility-driven model, b a cost-benefit model in which both accessibility and quality are significant influences, and c an exclusively quality-driven model. Moreover, the conditions under which accessibility and quality are important are not well understood. The goal of our study is to shed more light on both issues by assessing the role of different dimensions of accessibility and quality and how their importance is affected by time pressure. We conducted a policy-capturing study in which 89 financial specialists participated. Each judged 20 scenarios in which the accessibility and quality of human information sources, as well as time pressure, were manipulated. Results showed that both accessibility and quality affect the likelihood of asking a human information source for information. Moreover, although the weights attached to physical accessibility and the source's perceived technical quality were indeed moderated by time pressure, in both conditions we find support for a cost-benefit model of information seeking, in which both accessibility and quality are significant influences.},

A seed set of 901 articles published between 1973 and 2015 was evaluated and in total 65 studies were considered for further analyses. Data extraction and synthesis was performed through content analysis using the PRISMA method. Three thematic categories were identified in regard to music information needs: a those related to scholarly activities, b musically motivated, as well as c those which are related to socializing and communication. In addition, 3 categories of music information sources were connected to musical creativity: i those that are related to Internet and media technologies, ii those that are related to music libraries, organizations, and music stores, and iii those that are related to the subjects' social settings. The paper provides a systematic review, with the aim of showcasing the effect of modern information retrieval techniques in a creative and intensive area of information-dependent activity such as music making and consumption.},

abstract = {Recognizing negative and speculative information is highly relevant for sentiment analysis. This paper presents a machine-learning approach to automatically detect this kind of information in the review domain. The resulting system works in two steps: in the first pass, negation/speculation cues are identified, and in the second phase the full scope of these cues is determined. The system is trained and evaluated on the Simon Fraser University Review corpus, which is extensively used in opinion mining. The results show how the proposed method outstrips the baseline by as much as roughly 20% in the negation cue detection and around 13% in the scope recognition, both in terms of F1. In speculation, the performance obtained in the cue prediction phase is close to that obtained by a human rater carrying out the same task. In the scope detection, the results are also promising and represent a substantial improvement on the baseline up by roughly 10%. A detailed error analysis is also provided. The extrinsic evaluation shows that the correct identification of cues and scopes is vital for the task of sentiment analysis.},

It finds that, first, 4 groups, instead of a binary "haves versus have-nots," best characterize Chinese urban society informationally; second, the distribution of people among these groups conforms to normal distribution, in striking contrast with the pyramid-shaped socioeconomic structure of Chinese society; third, although the demographic characteristics of these groups suggest a significant correlation between people's informational and socioeconomic statuses, the 2 are far from identical; fourth, although the 4 groups differ in all aspects investigated, they differ most notably in information assets and the range and type of materials they choose as their regular information resources; fifth, although the 4 groups vary significantly, each differs from the others in its own way. This study concludes that society's informational and socioeconomic structures are 2 related but distinctive structures, and that the informational structure is characterized by highly complicated textures of inequality.},

Climate change research has become more interdisciplinary and even transdisciplinary as a typical Mode-2 science that is also dependent on an application context for its further development. We propose to approach interdisciplinarity as a co-construction of the knowledge base in the reference patterns and the programmatic focus in the editorials in the core journal of the climate-change sciences-Climatic\"{\i} undefinedChange-during the period 1977-2013. First, we analyze the knowledge base of the journal and map journal-journal relations on the basis of the references in the articles. Second, we follow the development of the programmatic focus by analyzing the semantics in the editorials. We argue that interdisciplinarity is a result of the co-construction between different agendas: The selection of publications into the knowledge base of the journal, and the adjustment of the programmatic focus to the political context in the editorials. Our results show a widening of the knowledge base from referencing the multidisciplinary journals Nature and Science to citing journals from specialist fields. The programmatic focus follows policy-oriented issues and incorporates public metaphors.},

Network analysis was pursued on the set of journals shared between the 2 databases and the 2 sets of unique journals. Citations among the shared journals are more comprehensively covered in JCR than in Scopus, so the network in JCR is denser and more connected than in Scopus. The ranking of shared journals in terms of indegree i.e., numbers of citing journals or total citations is similar in both databases overall Spearman rank correlation \"{\i} undefined&gt;0.97, but some individual journals rank very differently.

Our longitudinal analysis shows, among other things, that the bandwidth share distributions-and thus bandwidth differences-exhibit considerable path dependence where country proportions of international bandwidth in 2011 can be substantially accounted for by a preferential attachment-based mixture of micro-level processes. Our preferential attachment model, consistent with empirical data, does not predict increasing concentration of bandwidth within top-ranked countries. We argue that recognizing the strong, but nuanced, historical inertia of bandwidth distributions is helpful in better discriminating among competing theoretical perspectives on the global digital divide as well as in clarifying policy discussions related to gaps between bandwidth-rich and bandwidth-poor countries.},

abstract = {This study proposes a new method to construct and trace the trajectory of conceptual development of a research field by combining main path analysis, citation analysis, and text-mining techniques. Main path analysis, a method used commonly to trace the most critical path in a citation network, helps describe the developmental trajectory of a research field. This study extends the main path analysis method and applies text-mining techniques in the new method, which reflects the trajectory of conceptual development in an academic research field more accurately than citation frequency, which represents only the articles examined. Articles can be merged based on similarity of concepts, and by merging concepts the history of a research field can be described more precisely. The new method was applied to the "h-index" and "text mining" fields. The precision, recall, and F-measures of the h-index were 0.738, 0.652, and 0.658 and those of text-mining were 0.501, 0.653, and 0.551, respectively. Last, this study not only establishes the conceptual trajectory map of a research field, but also recommends keywords that are more precise than those used currently by researchers. These precise keywords could enable researchers to gather related works more quickly than before.},

We collected the following information: where the request came from; publishing model applied; fees charged; inclusion or not in the Directory of Open Access Journals DOAJ; and presence or not in Beall's 2014 listing of dubious journals. Our research showed that most of the publishers that sent e-mails inviting manuscripts were i using the open access model, ii using article-processing charges to fund their journal's operations; iii offering very short peer-review times, iv on Beall's list, and v misrepresenting the location of their headquarters. Some years ago, a letter of invitation to submit an article to a particular journal was considered a kind of distinction. Today, e-mails inviting submissions are generally spam, something that misleads young researchers and irritates experienced ones.},

The findings identify several notable phenomena including motivating factors, the timing of collaboration formation, partner selection, communication methods, information-sharing practices, and barriers at each phase of the life cycle. We find that specific motivations were related to specific phases. The formation of collaboration was observed throughout the entire process, not only in the beginning phase of the cycle. For communication and information-sharing practices, scientists continue to favor traditional means of communication for security reasons. Barriers to collaboration throughout the phases included different priorities, competitive tensions, and a hierarchical culture among collaborators, whereas credit sharing was a barrier in the research product phase.},

Negative binomial regression models are used that incorporate, for the first time, the inclusion of specific countries within a team. The results show that, holding other factors constant, larger teams robustly associate with higher impact research, but including additional departments has no effect and adding extra institutions tends to reduce the impact of research. Although international collaboration is apparently not advantageous in general, collaboration with the United States, and perhaps also with some other countries, seems to increase impact. In contrast, collaborations with some other nations seems to decrease impact, although both findings could be due to factors such as differing national proportions of excellent researchers. As a methodological implication, simpler statistical models would find international collaboration to be generally beneficial and so it is important to take into account specific countries when examining collaboration.},

To prevent comprehension and accessibility issues in these cases, data infrastructures can be useful. The establishment of such data infrastructures requires a clear understanding of the business processes and information flows within the archeological domain. This study attempts to provide insights into how information is managed in Flemish archeological processes and how this management process can be enhanced: an exploratory study based on an analysis of the new Flemish Immovable Heritage Decree, informal interviews with Flemish archeological organizations, and the results of an international survey. Three main processes, in which certified archeologists and the Flemish Heritage agency are key actors, were identified. Multiple types of information, the majority of which contain a geographical component, are recorded, acquired, used, and exchanged. Geographical information systems GIS and geodatabases therefore appear to be valuable components of an archeology-specific data infrastructure. This is of interest because GIS are widely adopted in archeology and multiple Flemish archeological organizations are in favor of a government-provided exchange standard or database templates for data recording. Furthermore, free and open source software is preferred to ensure cost efficiency and customizability.},

As another strategy, this study proposes to apply a vocabulary specificity measure Zscore to determine the most significantly overused word-types or short sequences of them. Our experiments show that the simple term frequency measure is not able to discriminate between specific terms associated with a document or a set of texts. Using the tf idf or LDA approach, the selection requires some arbitrary decisions. Based on the term-specific measure Zscore, the term selection has a clear theoretical basis. Moreover, the most significant sentences for each presidency can be determined. As another facet, we can visualize the dynamic evolution of usage of some terms associated with their specificity measures. Finally, this technique can be employed to define the most important lexical leaders introducing terms overused by the k following presidencies.},

abstract = {Social media offers both opportunities and challenges in everyday life information seeking ELIS. Despite their popularity, it is unclear whether the use of social media for ELIS heightens problematic outcomes, such as encountering too much information and finding irrelevant, conflicting, outdated, and noncredible information. In light of this gap, this study tested a whether the level of problematic informational outcomes varies with the use of social networking sites, microblogs, and social question and answer sites; b whether the problem level varies by gender and problem-solving styles; and c whether the aforementioned factors have significant interaction effects. An online questionnaire was used to survey 791 U.S. undergraduates. Irrelevant information was the top issue. Gender difference was statistically significant for conflicting information, which was more problematic for women. The multiway analysis of variance ANOVA indicated notable problem-solving style differences, especially on the Personal Control subscale. This highlights the importance of affective factors. It is noteworthy that although social media use has no significant main effect, there were significant interaction effects between microblog use and the Approach-Avoidance and Problem Solving Confidence subscales. The impact of microblog use on ELIS outcomes therefore warrants further investigation. Five propositions are posited for further testing.},

abstract = {Twitter has emerged as a popular source of sharing and delivering news information. In tweet messages, URLs to web resources and hashtags are often included. This study investigates the potential of the hyperlinks and hashtags as topical clues and indicators to tweet messages. For this study, we crawled and analyzed about 1.5 million tweets for a 3-month period covering any topic or subject. The findings of this study revealed a power law relationship for the ranking and frequency of a the host names of URLs, and b a pair of hashtags and URLs that appeared in the tweet messages. This study also discovered that the most popular URLs used in tweets come from news and media websites, and a majority of the hyperlinked resources are news web pages. One implication of this study is that Twitter users are becoming more active in sharing already published information than producing new information. Finally, our investigation on hashtags for web resource indexing reveals that hashtags have the potential to be used as indexing terms for co-occurring URLs in the same tweet. We also discuss the implications of this study for web resource recommendation.},

Discapnet is a website mainly aimed at visually disabled people, and navigation is a challenging task for its users. In this context, system evaluation and problem detection become crucial aspects for enhancing user experience and may contribute greatly to diminishing the existing technological gap. This study proposes a system based on web-mining techniques that collects in-use information while the user is accessing the web thus, being a noninvasive system. The proposed system models users in the wild and discovers navigation problems appearing in Discapnet and can also be used for problem detection when new users are navigating the site. The system was tested and its efficiency demonstrated in an experiment involving navigation under supervision, in which 82.6% of a set of disabled people were automatically labeled as having problems with the website.},

Further, students from schools with lower parent education show greater increases in frequency of school technology engagement. Globaloria participation also weakens the link between prior school achievement and advanced technology activities. Results offer evidence that school-based digital literacy programs can attenuate digital divide effects known to occur cross-sectionally in the general U.S. population.},

In this paper, we provide a methodological resource for social scientists looking to expand their toolkit using unstructured web-based text, and in particular, with the Wayback Machine, to access historical website data. After providing a literature review of existing research that uses the Wayback Machine, we put forward a step-by-step description of how the analyst can design a research project using archived websites. We draw on the example of a project that analyzes indicators of innovation activities and strategies in 300 U.S. small- and medium-sized enterprises in green goods industries. We present six steps to access historical Wayback website data: a sampling, b organizing and defining the boundaries of the web crawl, c crawling, d website variable operationalization, e integration with other data sources, and f analysis. Although our examples draw on specific types of firms in green goods industries, the method can be generalized to other areas of research. In discussing the limitations and benefits of using the Wayback Machine, we note that both machine and human effort are essential to developing a high-quality data set from archived web information.},

This study evaluated academics' receptiveness to information proposed by a mobile app, the SerenA Notebook: information that is based in their inferred interests but does not relate directly to a prior recognized need. The evaluated app aimed at creating the experience of serendipitous encounters: generating ideas and inspiring thoughts, and potentially triggering follow-up actions, by providing users with suggestions related to their work and leisure interests. We studied how 20 academics interacted with messages sent by the mobile app 3 per day over 10 consecutive days. Collected data sets were analyzed using thematic analysis. We found that contextual factors location, activity, and focus strongly influenced their responses to messages. Academics described some unsolicited information as interesting but irrelevant when they could not make immediate use of it. They highlighted filtering information as their major struggle rather than finding information. Some messages that were positively received acted as reminders of activities participants were meant to be doing but were postponing, or were relevant to ongoing activities at the time the information was received.},

abstract = {Medical research is highly funded and often expensive and so is particularly important to evaluate effectively. Nevertheless, citation counts may accrue too slowly for use in some formal and informal evaluations. It is therefore important to investigate whether alternative metrics could be used as substitutes. This article assesses whether one such altmetric, Mendeley readership counts, correlates strongly with citation counts across all medical fields, whether the relationship is stronger if student readers are excluded, and whether they are distributed similarly to citation counts. Based on a sample of 332,975 articles from 2009 in 45 medical fields in Scopus, citation counts correlated strongly about 0.7; 78% of articles had at least one reader with Mendeley readership counts from the new version 1 applications programming interface [API] in almost all fields, with one minor exception, and the correlations tended to decrease slightly when student readers were excluded. Readership followed either a lognormal or a hooked power law distribution, whereas citations always followed a hooked power law, showing that the two may have underlying differences.},

abstract = {Two dominant theoretical models for privacy-individual privacy preferences and context-dependent definitions of privacy-are often studied separately in information systems research. This paper unites these theories by examining how individual privacy preferences impact context-dependent privacy expectations. The paper theorizes that experience provides a bridge between individuals' general privacy attitudes and nuanced contextual factors. This leads to the hypothesis that, when making judgments about privacy expectations, individuals with less experience in a context rely more on individual preferences such as their generalized privacy beliefs, whereas individuals with more experience in a context are influenced by contextual factors and norms. To test this hypothesis, 1,925 American users of mobile applications made judgments about whether varied real-world scenarios involving data collection and use met their privacy expectations. Analysis of the data suggests that experience using mobile applications did moderate the effect of individual preferences and contextual factors on privacy judgments. Experience changed the equation respondents used to assess whether data collection and use scenarios met their privacy expectations. Discovering the bridge between 2 dominant theoretical models enables future privacy research to consider both personal and contextual variables by taking differences in experience into account.},

This intersection is described by a summary of conceptualizations of research synthesis in a diverse set of research fields and in the context of Swanson's 1986 discussion of undiscovered public knowledge. Through a selective literature review, research topics that intersect with LIS and RSM are outlined. Topics identified include open access, information retrieval, bias and research information ethics, referencing practices, citation patterns, and data science. Subsequently, bibliometrics and topic modeling are used to present a systematic overview of the visibility of RSM in LIS. This analysis indicates that RSM became visible in LIS in the 1980s. Overall, LIS research has drawn substantially from general and internal medicine, the field's own literature, and business; and is drawn on by health and medical sciences, computing, and business. Through this analytical overview, it is confirmed that research synthesis is more visible in the health and medical literature in LIS; but suggests that, LIS, as a meta-science, has the potential to make substantive contributions to a broader variety of fields in the context of topics related to research synthesis methods.},

In this study, we present a review of different author credit-assignment schemas, which are designed mainly based on author position and the total number of coauthors on the publication. We implemented, tested, and classified 15 author credit-assignment schemas into 3 types: linear, curve, and "other" assignment schemas. Further investigation and analysis revealed that most of the methods provide reasonable credit-assignment results, even though the credit-assignment distribution approaches are quite different among different types. The evaluation of each schema based on PubMed articles published in 2013 shows that there exist positive correlations among different schemas and that the similarity of credit-assignment distributions can be derived from the similar design principles that stress the number of coauthors or the author position, or consider both. We provide a summary about the features of each credit-assignment schema to facilitate the selection of the appropriate one, depending on the different conditions required to meet diverse needs.},

These include common misconceptions about Wikipedia, doubts about its quality, uneasiness with the challenge that it poses to the traditional peer-review system, and a lack of career-enhancing motivations related to using Wikipedia. Second, the benefits of teaching with Wikipedia for educators, students, and the wider society, as discussed in the current teaching literature, are explored.

To overcome this limitation, we investigated whether by analyzing a searcher's current processes we could forecast his likelihood of achieving a certain level of success with respect to search performance in the future. We propose a machine-learning-based method to dynamically evaluate and predict search performance several time-steps ahead at each given time point of the search process during an exploratory search task. Our prediction method uses a collection of features extracted from expression of information need and coverage of information. For testing, we used log data collected from 4 user studies that included 216 users 96 individuals and 60 pairs. Our results show 80-90% accuracy in prediction depending on the number of time-steps ahead. In effect, the work reported here provides a framework for evaluating search processes during exploratory search tasks and predicting search performance. Importantly, the proposed approach is based on user processes and is independent of any IR system.},

abstract = {We introduce a new problem, identifying the type of relation that holds between a pair of similar items in a digital library. Being able to provide a reason why items are similar has applications in recommendation, personalization, and search. We investigate the problem within the context of Europeana, a large digital library containing items related to cultural heritage. A range of types of similarity in this collection were identified. A set of 1,500 pairs of items from the collection were annotated using crowdsourcing. A high intertagger agreement average 71.5 Pearson correlation was obtained and demonstrates that the task is well defined. We also present several approaches to automatically identifying the type of similarity. The best system applies linear regression and achieves a mean Pearson correlation of 71.3, close to human performance. The problem formulation and data set described here were used in a public evaluation exercise, the *SEM shared task on Semantic Textual Similarity. The task attracted the participation of 6 teams, who submitted 14 system runs. All annotations, evaluation scripts, and system runs are freely available.},

abstract = {The citation relationships between publications, which are significant for assessing the importance of scholarly components within a network, have been used for various scientific applications. Missing citation metadata in scholarly databases, however, create problems for classical citation-based ranking algorithms and challenge the performance of citation-based retrieval systems. In this research, we utilize a two-step citation analysis method to investigate the importance of publications for which citation information is partially missing. First, we calculate the importance of the author and then use his importance to estimate the publication importance for some selected articles. To evaluate this method, we designed a simulation experiment-"random citation-missing"-to test the two-step citation analysis that we carried out with the Association for Computing Machinery ACM Digital Library DL. In this experiment, we simulated different scenarios in a large-scale scientific digital library, from high-quality citation data, to very poor quality data, The results show that a two-step citation analysis can effectively uncover the importance of publications in different situations. More importantly, we found that the optimized impact from the importance of an author first step is exponentially increased when the quality of citation decreases. The findings from this study can further enhance citation-based publication-ranking algorithms for real-world applications.},

abstract = {The diversity of bibliometric indices today poses the challenge of exploiting the relationships among them. Our research uncovers the best core set of relevant indices for predicting other bibliometric indices. An added difficulty is to select the role of each variable, that is, which bibliometric indices are predictive variables and which are response variables. This results in a novel multioutput regression problem where the role of each variable predictor or response is unknown beforehand. We use Gaussian Bayesian networks to solve the this problem and discover multivariate relationships among bibliometric indices. These networks are learnt by a genetic algorithm that looks for the optimal models that best predict bibliometric data. Results show that the optimal induced Gaussian Bayesian networks corroborate previous relationships between several indices, but also suggest new, previously unreported interactions. An extended analysis of the best model illustrates that a set of 12 bibliometric indices can be accurately predicted using only a smaller predictive core subset composed of citations, g-index, q2-index, and hr-index. This research is performed using bibliometric data on Spanish full professors associated with the computer science area.},

Most solutions to this problem are typically based on increases or spikes in frequency of terms in social media. In our case, we explore whether sudden changes in the positivity or negativity that keywords are typically associated with can be exploited for this purpose. A data set that contains several million Twitter messages over a 1-month time span is presented and experimental results demonstrate that sentiment analysis can be successfully utilized for this purpose. Further experiments study the sensitivity of both frequency- or sentiment-based solutions to a number of parameters. Concretely, we show that the number of tweets that are used for event detection is an important factor, while the number of days used to extract token frequency or sentiment averages is not. Lastly, we present results focusing on detecting local events and conclude that all approaches are dependant on the level of coverage that such events receive in social media.},

However, most of these algorithms suffer from the problem of ranking bias. Ranking bias hurts the usefulness of a ranking algorithm because it returns a ranking list with an undesirable time distribution. This paper is a focused study on how to alleviate ranking bias by leveraging the heterogeneous network structure of the literature collection. We propose a new graph-based ranking algorithm, MutualRank, that integrates mutual reinforcement relationships among networks of papers, researchers, and venues to achieve a more synthetic, accurate, and less-biased ranking than previous methods. MutualRank provides a unified model that involves both intra- and inter-network information for ranking papers, researchers, and venues simultaneously. We use the ACL Anthology Network as the benchmark data set and construct the gold standard from computer linguistics course websites of well-known universities and two well-known textbooks. The experimental results show that MutualRank greatly outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors, including PageRank, HITS, CoRank, Future Rank, and P-Rank, in ranking papers in both improving ranking effectiveness and alleviating ranking bias. Rankings of researchers and venues by MutualRank are also quite reasonable.},

We collected participants' answers to psychometric scales at 2 times: after presentation of 5 screenshots of a news site and directly after 10 minutes of hands-on experience with the site. The model was extended with the prediction of users' satisfaction with news sites as a high-level design goal. A psychometric measure of trust in news providers was developed and added to the model to better predict people's intention to use particular news sites. The model presented in this article represents a theoretically founded, empirically tested basis for evaluating news websites, and it holds theoretical relevance to user-experience research in general.

abstract = {Automatic text classification TC continues to be a relevant research topic and several TC algorithms have been proposed. However, the majority of TC algorithms assume that the underlying data distribution does not change over time. In this work, we are concerned with the challenges imposed by the temporal dynamics observed in textual data sets. We provide evidence of the existence of temporal effects in three textual data sets, reflected by variations observed over time in the class distribution, in the pairwise class similarities, and in the relationships between terms and classes. We then quantify, using a series of full factorial design experiments, the impact of these effects on four well-known TC algorithms. We show that these temporal effects affect each analyzed data set differently and that they restrict the performance of each considered TC algorithm to different extents. The reported quantitative analyses, which are the original contributions of this article, provide valuable new insights to better understand the behavior of TC algorithms when faced with nonstatic temporal data distributions and highlight important requirements for the proposal of more accurate classification models.},

However, the large volumes and variety of expressions on social media have challenged traditional policy analysis and public sentiment assessment. In this article, we describe a framework for social-media-based public policy informatics and a system called "iMood" that addresses the needs for sentiment and network analyses of U.S. immigration and border security. iMood collects related messages on Twitter, extracts user sentiment and emotion, and constructs networks of the Twitter users, helping policy makers to identify opinion leaders, influential users, and community activists. We evaluated the sentiment, emotion, and network characteristics found in 909,035 tweets posted by over 300,000 users during three phases between May and November 2013. Statistical analyses reveal significant differences in emotion and sentiment among the 3 phases. The Twitter networks of the 3 phases also had significantly different relationship counts, network densities, and total influence scores from those of other phases. This research should contribute to developing a new framework and a new system for social-media-based public policy informatics, providing new empirical findings and data sets of sentiment and network analyses of U.S. immigration and border security, and demonstrating a general applicability to different domains.},

This study analyzes data from 23 UK institutions covering the period 2007-2014 modeling the TCP. It shows a clear rise in centrally managed APC payments from 2012 onward, with payments projected to increase further. As well as evidencing the growing availability and acceptance of OA publishing, these trends reflect particular UK policy developments and funding arrangements intended to accelerate the move toward OA publishing "Gold" OA. Although the mean value of APCs has been relatively stable, there was considerable variation in APC prices paid by institutions since 2007. In particular, "hybrid" subscription/OA journals were consistently more expensive than fully OA journals. Most APCs were paid to large "traditional" commercial publishers who also received considerable subscription income. New administrative costs reported by institutions varied considerably. The total cost of publication modeling shows that APCs are now a significant part of the TCP for academic institutions, in 2013 already constituting an average of 10% of the TCP excluding administrative costs.},

Many ad hoc applications, or their variants with smoothing techniques suggested in LDA-based language modeling, can result in unsatisfactory performance as the document representations do not accurately reflect concept space. To improve document retrieval performance, we introduce a new definition of document probability vectors in the context of LDA and present a novel scheme for automatic document indexing based on LDA. Second, we propose an Ensemble Model EnM for document retrieval. EnM combines basic indexing models by assigning different weights and attempts to uncover the optimal weights to maximize the mean average precision. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an algorithm, which is derived based on the boosting method. The results of our computational experiments on benchmark data sets indicate that both the proposed approaches are viable options for document retrieval.},

abstract = {An influx of mechanisms for the collection of large sets of data has prompted widespread consideration of the impact that data analytic methods can have on a number of disciplines. Having an established record of the use of a unique mixture of empirical methods, the work of understanding and designing for user behavior is well situated to take advantage of the advances claimed by "big data" methods. Beyond any straightforward benefit of the use of large sets of data, such an increase in the scale of empirical evidence has far-reaching implications for the work of empirically guided design. We develop the concept of "peak empiricism" to explain the new role that large-scale data comes to play in design, one in which data become more than a simple empirical tool. In providing such an expansive empirical setting for design, big data weakens the subjective conditions necessary for empirical insight, pointing to a more performative approach to the relationship between a designer and his or her work. In this, the work of design is characterized as "thinking with" the data in a partnership that weakens not only any sense of empiricism but also the agentive foundations of a classical view of design work.},

The result of crowdsourcing-based evaluation shows that the user preference for TBS was significantly higher than GS. We also took random samples of the documents to see the performance of summaries in a traditional evaluation using ROUGE, which, in general, TBS was also shown to be better than GS. We further analyzed the influence of the number of tweets pointed to a web document on summarization accuracy, finding a positive moderate correlation between the number of tweets pointed to a web document and the performance of generated TBS as measured by user preference. The results show that incorporating social information into the summary generation process can improve the accuracy of summary.

abstract = {Scholars have often relied on name initials to resolve name ambiguities in large-scale coauthorship network research. This approach bears the risk of incorrectly merging or splitting author identities. The use of initial-based disambiguation has been justified by the assumption that such errors would not affect research findings too much. This paper tests that assumption by analyzing coauthorship networks from five academic fields-biology, computer science, nanoscience, neuroscience, and physics-and an interdisciplinary journal, PNAS. Name instances in data sets of this study were disambiguated based on heuristics gained from previous algorithmic disambiguation solutions. We use disambiguated data as a proxy of ground-truth to test the performance of three types of initial-based disambiguation. Our results show that initial-based disambiguation can misrepresent statistical properties of coauthorship networks: It deflates the number of unique authors, number of components, average shortest paths, clustering coefficient, and assortativity, while it inflates average productivity, density, average coauthor number per author, and largest component size. Also, on average, more than half of top 10 productive or collaborative authors drop off the lists. Asian names were found to account for the majority of misidentification by initial-based disambiguation due to their common surname and given name initials.},

Satisfaction with the data reuse experience, however, has not been widely studied. Drawing from the information systems and information science literature, we developed a model to examine the relationship between data quality and data reusers' satisfaction. Based on a survey of 1,480 journal article authors who cited Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research ICPSR data in published papers from 2008-2012, we found several data quality attributes-completeness, accessibility, ease of operation, and credibility-had significant positive associations with data reusers' satisfaction. There was also a significant positive relationship between documentation quality and data reusers' satisfaction.},

abstract = {Pseudo relevance feedback, as an effective query expansion method, can significantly improve information retrieval performance. However, the method may negatively impact the retrieval performance when some irrelevant terms are used in the expanded query. Therefore, it is necessary to refine the expansion terms. Learning to rank methods have proven effective in information retrieval to solve ranking problems by ranking the most relevant documents at the top of the returned list, but few attempts have been made to employ learning to rank methods for term refinement in pseudo relevance feedback. This article proposes a novel framework to explore the feasibility of using learning to rank to optimize pseudo relevance feedback by means of reranking the candidate expansion terms. We investigate some learning approaches to choose the candidate terms and introduce some state-of-the-art learning to rank methods to refine the expansion terms. In addition, we propose two term labeling strategies and examine the usefulness of various term features to optimize the framework. Experimental results with three TREC collections show that our framework can effectively improve retrieval performance.},

In order to fill this gap, we conducted a large-scale user survey questioning various aspects of people's music information needs and behaviors. In particular, we investigated if general music users' needs and behaviors have significantly changed over time by comparing our current survey results with a similar survey conducted in 2004. In this paper, we present the key findings from the survey data and discuss 4 emergent themes-a the shift in access and use of personal music collections; b the growing need for tools to support collaborative music seeking, listening, and sharing; c the importance of "visual" music experiences; and d the need for ontologies for providing rich contextual information. We conclude by making specific recommendations for improving the design of MIR systems and services.},

We surveyed 100 computer science students and found that 94% of respondents searched for places online; 87% had done so as part of a group. Search for place by multiple active participants was experienced by 78%, with group sizes typically being 2 or 3. Search occurred in a range of settings with both desktop PCs and mobile devices. Difficulties were reported with coordinating tasks, sharing results, and making decisions. The results show that finding a place of interest is a quite different group-based search than other multiparty information-seeking activities. The results suggest that local search systems, their interfaces and the devices that access them can be made more usable for collaborative search if they include support for coordination, sharing of results, and decision making.},

However, academic publishers do not always follow these guidelines and therefore fail to guarantee access by all readers to the visual content of academic articles. People with severe visual impairments cannot access the visual content of images unless a text alternative describing the images is provided. This study investigates the current use of texts commonly related to images in academic articles, such as captions and mentions, in order to assess their suitability as potential text alternatives to the images for readers who are blind or have severe low vision. A sample of 30 academic articles in the fields of biomedicine, computer science, and mathematics was analyzed and quantitative and qualitative data were collected about images and their related texts. We suggest a practical and sustainable solution that can foster the adoption of good accessibility practices by authors and publishers and facilitate their inclusion in regular publishing workflows.},

In particular, we study the relationship between the topicality and impact of these videos. Findings demonstrate that topics vary greatly in terms of their impact: Topics on entertainment and psychology/philosophy receive more views and likes, whereas design/art and astronomy/biology/oceanography attract fewer comments and bookmarks. Moreover, we identify several topical differences between YouKu and YouTube users. Topics on global issues and technology are more popular on YouKu, whereas topics on entertainment and psychology/philosophy are more popular on YouTube. By analyzing the popularity distribution of videos and the audience characteristics of YouKu, we find that women are more interested in topics on education and psychology/philosophy, whereas men favor topics on technology and astronomy/biology/oceanography.},

abstract = {In authorship attribution, various distance-based metrics have been proposed to determine the most probable author of a disputed text. In this paradigm, a distance is computed between each author profile and the query text. These values are then employed only to rank the possible authors. In this article, we analyze their distribution and show that we can model it as a mixture of 2 Beta distributions. Based on this finding, we demonstrate how we can derive a more accurate probability that the closest author is, in fact, the real author. To evaluate this approach, we have chosen 4 authorship attribution methods Burrows' Delta, Kullback-Leibler divergence, Labb\'{e}'s intertextual distance, and the na\"{\i}ve Bayes. As the first test collection, we have downloaded 224 State of the\"{\i} undefinedUnion addresses from 1790 to 2014 delivered by 41 U.S. presidents. The second test collection is formed by the Federalist\"{\i} undefinedPapers. The evaluations indicate that the accuracy rate of some authorship decisions can be improved. The suggested method can signal that the proposed assignment should be interpreted as possible, without strong certainty. Being able to quantify the certainty associated with an authorship decision can be a useful component when important decisions must be taken.},

Such tags can act as navigational cues that enable users to discover meaningful and relevant information in a Web 2.0 environment. This is particularly critical for nonexperts for understanding formal academic or scientific resources, also known as hard content. The goal of this study was to develop a novel one-bit comparison OBC metric and to assess in what circumstances a set of tags describing a hard-content resource is mature and representative. We compared OBC with the conventional Shannon entropy approach to determine performance when distinguishing tags generated by domain experts and nonexperts in the early and later stages under social influence. The results indicated that OBC can accurately distinguish mature tags generated by a strong expert consensus from other tags, and outperform Shannon entropy. The findings support tag-based learning, and provide insights and tools for the design of applications involving tags, such as tag recommendation and tag-based organization.},

In particular, we examine the contributions of authors outside the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada; faculty in departments other than LIS; and practicing librarians. Worldwide, faculty in LIS departments account for 31% of the journal literature; librarians, 23%; computer science faculty, 10%; and management faculty, 10%. The top contributing nations are the United States, the United Kingdom, Spain, China, Canada, and Taiwan. Within the United States and the United Kingdom, the current productivity of LIS departments is correlated with past productivity and with other measures of reputation and performance. More generally, the distribution of contributions is highly skewed. In the United States, five departments account for 27% of the articles contributed by LIS faculty; in the United Kingdom, four departments account for nearly two-thirds of the articles. This skewed distribution reinforces the possibility that high-status departments may gain a permanent advantage in the competition for students, faculty, journal space, and research funding. At the same time, concentrations of research-active faculty in particular departments may generate beneficial spillover effects.},

Analysis of their groundbreaking research articles, all produced within a relatively short period of time, and the network of citing articles shows the cumulative effects of the intense collaboration within a small group of researchers working on the same subject. Using bibliographic data from the Web of Science database and the PATSTAT patents database in combination with expert opinions shows that these discoveries accumulated into a new technology. These first findings suggest that potential breakthrough discoveries can be identified at a relatively early stage by careful analysis of publication and citation patterns.},

We propose a personalized word cloud generation as a means for users' navigation. Various user past activities such as user published tweets, retweets, and seen but not retweeted tweets are leveraged for enhanced personalization of word clouds. The best personalization results are attained with user past retweets. However, users' own past tweets are not as useful as retweets for personalization. Negative preferences derived from seen but not retweeted tweets further enhance personalized word cloud generation. The ranking combination method outperforms the preranking approach and provides a general framework for combined ranking of various user past information for enhanced word cloud generation. To better capture subtle differences of generated word clouds, we propose an evaluation of word clouds with a mean average precision measure.},

abstract = {Online Q&amp;A services are information sources where people identify their information need, formulate the need in natural language, and interact with one another to satisfy their needs. Even though in recent years online Q&amp;A has considerably grown in popularity and impacted information-seeking behaviors, we still lack knowledge about what motivates people to ask a question in online Q&amp;A environments. Yahoo! Answers and WikiAnswers were selected as the test beds in the study, and a sequential mixed method employing an Internet-based survey, a diary method, and interviews was used to investigate user motivations for asking a question in online Q&amp;A services. Cognitive needs were found as the most significant motivation, driving people to ask a question. Yet, it was found that other motivational factors e.g., tension free needs also played an important role in user motivations for asking a question, depending on asker's contexts and situations. Understanding motivations for asking a question could provide a general framework of conceptualizing different contexts and situations of information needs in online Q&amp;A. The findings have several implications not only for developing better question-answering processes in online Q&amp;A environments, but also for gaining insights into the broader understanding of online information-seeking behaviors.},

abstract = {A key impact the Internet is having on university teaching involves the new choices being provided because of open educational content. Wikipedia is a clear example of these new options. It is a gigantic open repository of knowledge, and it can also be considered a platform that facilitates collaboration in knowledge creation and dissemination. Our research objective is to understand what the main factors are that influence the teaching uses of Wikipedia among university faculty. Based on a technology acceptance model, and using data from a survey sent to all faculty members of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, we analyze the relationships within the internal and external constructs of the model. We found that both the perception of colleagues' opinions about Wikipedia and the perceived quality of the information in Wikipedia play a central role. These two constructs have a significant direct impact on the perceived usefulness of Wikipedia. This perceived usefulness affects, mediated by the behavioral intention of using Wikipedia, the effective use behavior of the encyclopedia. The degree to which an individual considers it is important to participate in open collaborative environments and the Web 2.0 profile of the faculty members also play an important role in our model.},

abstract = {The objective of this article is to further the study of journal interdisciplinarity, or, more generally, knowledge integration at the level of individual articles. Interdisciplinarity is operationalized by the diversity of subject fields assigned to cited items in the article's reference list. Subject fields and subfields were obtained from the Leuven-Budapest ECOOM subject-classification scheme, while disciplinary diversity was measured taking variety, balance, and disparity into account. As diversity measure we use a Hill-type true diversity in the sense of Jost and Leinster-Cobbold. The analysis is conducted in 3 steps. In the first part, the properties of this measure are discussed, and, on the basis of these properties it is shown that the measure has the potential to serve as an indicator of interdisciplinarity. In the second part the applicability of this indicator is shown using selected journals from several research fields ranging from mathematics to social sciences. Finally, the often-heard argument, namely, that interdisciplinary research exhibits larger visibility and impact, is studied on the basis of these selected journals. Yet, as only 7 journals, representing a total of 15,757 articles, are studied, albeit chosen to cover a large range of interdisciplinarity, further research is still needed.},

abstract = {Analyzing hyperlink patterns has been a major research topic since the early days of the web. Numerous studies reported uncovering rich information and methodological advances. However, very few studies thus far examined hyperlinks in the rapidly developing sphere of social media. This paper reports a study that helps fill this gap. The study analyzed links originating from tweets to the websites of 3 types of organizations government, education, and business. Data were collected over an 8-month period to observe the fluctuation and reliability of the individual data set. Hyperlink data from the general web not social media sites were also collected and compared with social media data. The study found that the 2 types of hyperlink data correlated significantly and that analyzing the 2 together can help organizations see their relative strength or weakness in the two platforms. The study also found that both types of inlink data correlated with offline measures of organizations' performance. Twitter data from a relatively short period were fairly reliable in estimating performance measures. The timelier nature of social media data as well as the date/time stamps on tweets make this type of data potentially more valuable than that from the general web.},

As these movements incorporate many of the past critiques concerning social fit and situational context leveled against them by Social Informatics research, more subtle and more deeply ingrained modes of ideological practice have risen to support movements of computerization. Among these, the current emphasis on the promises of data and data analytics presents the most obvious ideological challenge. In order to reorient Social Informatics in relation to these new ideological challenges, Louis Althusser's theory of ideology is discussed, with its implications for Social Informatics considered. Among these implications, a changed relationship between Social Informatics's critical stance and its reliance on empirical methods is advanced. Addressed at a fundamental level, the practice of Social Informatics comes to be reoriented in a more distinctly reflective and ethical direction.},

abstract = {Collaborative Computer-Supported Argument Visualization CCSAV has often been proposed as an alternative over more conventional, mainstream platforms for online discussion e.g., online forums and wikis. CCSAV tools require users to contribute to the creation of a joint artifact argument map instead of contributing to a conversation. In this paper we assess empirically the effects of this fundamental design choice and show that the absence of conversational affordances and socially salient information in representation-centric tools is detrimental to the users' collaboration experience. We report empirical findings from a study in which subjects using different collaborative platforms a forum, an argumentation platform, and a socially augmented argumentation tool were asked to discuss and predict the price of a commodity. By comparing users' experience across several metrics we found evidence that the collaborative performance decreases gradually when we remove conversational interaction and other types of socially salient information. We interpret these findings through theories developed in conversational analysis common ground theory and communities of practice and discuss design implications. In particular, we propose balancing the trade-off between knowledge reification and participation in representation-centric tools with the provision of social feedback and functionalities supporting meaning negotiation.},

We videotaped the participants as they drew, erased, verbalized their thoughts, gestured, and moved about a two-dimensional paper presentation of the 3D visualization. The videorecords were analyzed using a grounded theory approach to generate hypotheses related to comprehension difficulties and visualization properties. Our analysis of the results uncovered three properties that made problem solving more difficult for participants. These were: a cuts that were at an angle in relation to at least one plane of reference, b nonplanar properties of the features contained in the 3D visualizations including curved layers and v-shaped layers, and c mixed combinations of layers. In contrast, a cutting planes that were perpendicular or parallel to the 3D visualization diagram's planes of reference, b internal features that were flat/planar, and c homogeneous layers were easier to comprehend. This research has direct implications for the generation and use of 3D information visualizations in that it suggests design features to include and avoid.},

A hypernetwork for social tagging is constructed in which a tagging action is expressed as a hyperedge and the user, resource, and tag are expressed as nodes. Quantitative measures for the constructed hypernetwork are defined, including the hyperdegree and its distribution, the excess average hyperdegree, and the hyperdegree conditional probability distribution. Using the data set from Delicious, an empirical study was conducted. The empirical results show that multiple individual tags and one or very few popular tags are generally employed together in one tagging action, and the usage patterns and regularities of tags with varying popularity are correlated to both user activity and resource interest. The empirical results are further discussed and explained from the perspectives of tag functions and motivations. Finally, suggestions regarding the usage of various popular tags for both tagging users and service providers of social tagging are given.},

abstract = {Although Mendeley bookmarking counts appear to correlate moderately with conventional citation metrics, it is not known whether academic publications are bookmarked in Mendeley in order to be read or not. Without this information, it is not possible to give a confident interpretation of altmetrics derived from Mendeley. In response, a survey of 860 Mendeley users shows that it is reasonable to use Mendeley bookmarking counts as an indication of readership because most 55% users with a Mendeley library had read or intended to read at least half of their bookmarked publications. This was true across all broad areas of scholarship except for the arts and humanities 42%. About 85% of the respondents also declared that they bookmarked articles in Mendeley to cite them in their publications, but some also bookmark articles for use in professional 50%, teaching 25%, and educational activities 13%. Of course, it is likely that most readers do not record articles in Mendeley and so these data do not represent all readers. In conclusion, Mendeley bookmark counts seem to be indicators of readership leading to a combination of scholarly impact and wider professional impact.},

abstract = {Statistics are essential to many areas of research and individual statistical techniques may change the ways in which problems are addressed as well as the types of problems that can be tackled. Hence, specific techniques may tend to generate high-impact findings within science. This article estimates the citation advantage of a technique by calculating the average citation rank of articles using it in the issue of the journal in which they were published. Applied to structural equation modeling SEM and four related techniques in 3 broad fields, the results show citation advantages that vary by technique and broad field. For example, SEM seems to be more influential in all broad fields than the 4 simpler methods, with one exception, and hence seems to be particularly worth adding to statistical curricula. In contrast, Pearson correlation apparently has the highest average impact in medicine but the least in psychology. In conclusion, the results suggest that the importance of a statistical technique may vary by discipline and that even simple techniques can help to generate high-impact research in some contexts.},

A collection of 8,310 tags from a digital portal Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship, NINES was analyzed to find out what attributes of primary historical resources users described with tags. Tags were categorized to identify which tags describe the content of the resource, the resource itself, and subjective aspects e.g., usage or emotion. The study's findings revealed that over half were content-related; tags representing opinion, usage context, or self-reference, however, reflected only a small percentage. The study further found that terms related to genre or physical format of a resource were frequently used in describing primary archival resources. It was also learned that nontextual resources had lower numbers of content-related tags and higher numbers of document-related tags than textual resources and bibliographic materials; moreover, textual resources tended to have more user-context-related tags than other resources. These findings help explain users' tagging behavior and resource interpretation in primary resources in the humanities. Such information provided through tags helps information professionals decide to what extent indexing archival and cultural resources should be done for resource description and discovery, and understand users' terminology.},

We found that mathematics applications developers have focused on creating applications for the practice of a priori knowledge, rather than on creating instructional applications. Results show preliminary evidence that child-tablet communication is generally successful, but this success comes at the cost of richer, multimodal interactions. Tablet computer application developers are being cautious in offering a variety of options for children to interact with the devices, and we suggest that there is scope for a broadening of communicative interaction modes.},

A mixed research method that combines the social network analysis method, clustering analysis method, and inferential analysis methods was used. The clustering analysis results of the link connection network were quite different from those of the semantic connection network. There were significant differences between the link connection network and the semantic network in terms of density and centrality. Inferential analysis results show that there were no strong correlations between the centrality of a node and its topic information characteristics.

Specifically, we propose that IM has the potential to enhance guanxi networks by improving communication quality and building interlocutors' mutual trust in the workplace. The conceptual model is validated with 253 survey responses collected from working professionals in China. The data indicate that communication quality and mutual trust contribute to the development of guanxi networks. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.},

Apparently, "bibliogifts" are available online for free from text-sharing platforms. However, little is known about such platforms. What is the size of the underlying digital libraries? What are the topics covered? Where do these documents originally come from? This article reports on a study of the Library Genesis platform LibGen. The 25 million documents 42 terabytes it hosts and distributes for free are mostly research articles, textbooks, and books in English. The article collection stems from isolated, but massive, article uploads 71% in line with a "biblioleaks" scenario, as well as from daily crowdsourcing 29% by worldwide users of platforms such as Reddit Scholar and Sci-Hub. By relating the DOIs registered at CrossRef and those cached at LibGen, this study reveals that 36% of all DOI articles are available for free at LibGen. This figure is even higher 68% for three major publishers: Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley. More research is needed to understand to what extent researchers and the general public have recourse to such text-sharing platforms and why.},

Based on a diary study of 2 assigned tasks to search on Google and Google Scholar, factor analysis identified the core constructs of content, relevance, scope, and style, as well as informational and system "ease of use" as influencing the judgment that useful information had been found. Differences were found in the participants' evaluation of information across the search tasks on Google and on Google Scholar when identified by the factors related to both content and ease of use. The findings from this study suggest how searchers might critically evaluate information, and the study identifies a relation between the user's involvement in the information interaction and the influences of the perceived system ease of use and information design.},

To revitalize the use of this crowd-sourced information, we propose using social tags to link and cluster artworks based on an experimental study using an online collection at the Gyeonggi Museum of Modern Art GMoMA. We view social tagging as a folksonomy, where artworks are classified by keywords of the crowd's various interpretations and one artwork can belong to several different categories simultaneously. To leverage this strength of social tags, we used a clustering method called "link communities" to detect overlapping communities in a network of artworks constructed by computing similarities between all artwork pairs. We used this framework to identify semantic relationships and clusters of similar artworks. By comparing the clustering results with curators' manual classification results, we demonstrated the potential of social tagging data for automatically clustering artworks in a way that reflects the dynamic perspectives of crowds.},

In the proposed HTEM, topics near the root of the hierarchy are more abstract and also evolve in the longer timescales than those near the leaves. To achieve this goal, the distance-dependent Chinese restaurant process ddCRP is extended to a new nested process that is able to simultaneously model the dependencies among data and the relationship between clusters. The HTEM is proposed based on the new process for time-stamped documents, in which the timestamp is utilized to measure the dependencies among documents. Moreover, an efficient Gibbs sampler is developed for the proposed HTEM. Our experimental results on two popular real-world data sets verify that the proposed HTEM can capture coherent topics and discover their hierarchical evolutions. It also outperforms the baseline model in terms of likelihood on held-out data.},

The study uses the lens of human information interaction to investigate finding aid use. Data were collected through a lab-based study of 32 experienced archives' users who completed two tasks with each of two finding aids. Participants were able to carry out the tasks, but they were somewhat challenged by the structure of the finding aid and employed various techniques to cope. Their patterns of interaction differed by task type and they reported higher rates of satisfaction, ease of use, and clarity for the assessment task than the known-item task. Four common patterns of interaction were identified: top-down, bottom-up, interrogative, and opportunistic. Results show how users interact with findings aids and identify features that support and hinder use. This research examines process and performance in addition to outcomes. Results contribute to the archival science literature and also suggest ways to extend models of human information interaction.},

The main contribution of our approach is to deal with the imprecision and uncertainty of the indexing task using possibility theory. We enhance estimation of the similarity between a document and a given concept using the two measures of possibility and necessity. Possibility estimates the extent to which a document is not similar to the concept. The second measure can provide confirmation that the document is similar to the concept. Our contribution also reduces the limitation of partial matching. Although the latter allows extracting from the document other variants of terms than those in dictionaries, it also generates irrelevant information. Our objective is to filter the index using the knowledge provided by the Unified Medical Language System®. Experiments were carried out on different corpora, showing encouraging results the improvement rate is +26.37% in terms of main average precision when compared with the baseline.},

This research addresses this issue by presenting a tool Text Matrix composed of procedures and algorithms coded in software, with the aim of analyzing cohesion between the text sections in extensive documents. A design science research approach was applied to develop, test, and prove the usefulness of the Text Matrix. A total of 127 academic advisors and advisees were trained to use the Text Matrix and apply it in the development of the extensive text of dissertations. An analysis both of those users' perceptions and of variations in network density among 41 extensive texts that they improved through the analyses performed by the artifact proposed in the present study demonstrated the ease of operation and effectiveness of the Text Matrix to identify parts of extensive texts associated with cohesion failures that could be connected by cohesion devices or even excluded from the extensive text.},

abstract = {The music information retrieval MIR community has long understood the role of evaluation as a critical component for successful information retrieval systems. Over the past several years, it has also become evident that user-centered evaluation based on realistic tasks is essential for creating systems that are commercially marketable. Although user-oriented research has been increasing, the MIR field is still lacking in holistic, user-centered approaches to evaluating music services beyond measuring the performance of search or classification algorithms. In light of this need, we conducted a user study exploring how users evaluate their overall experience with existing popular commercial music services, asking about their interactions with the system as well as situational and personal characteristics. In this paper, we present a qualitative heuristic evaluation of commercial music services based on Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics for user interface design, and also discuss 8 additional criteria that may be used for the holistic evaluation of user experience in MIR systems. Finally, we recommend areas of future user research raised by trends and patterns that surfaced from this user study.},

Using evidence from the United Kingdom, references associated with the UK's National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence NICE guidelines tended to be substantially more cited than comparable articles, unless they had been published in the most recent 3 years. Citation counts also seemed to be stronger indicators than Mendeley readership altmetrics. Hence, although presence in guidelines may be particularly useful to highlight the contributions of recently published articles, for older articles citation counts may already be sufficient to recognize their contributions to health in society.},

abstract = {Pseudo relevance feedback PRF has shown to be effective in ad hoc information retrieval. In traditional PRF methods, top-ranked documents are all assumed to be relevant and therefore treated equally in the feedback process. However, the performance gain brought by each document is different as showed in our preliminary experiments. Thus, it is more reasonable to predict the performance gain brought by each candidate feedback document in the process of PRF. We define the quality level QL and then use this information to adjust the weights of feedback terms in these documents. Unlike previous work, we do not make any explicit relevance assumption and we go beyond just selecting "good" documents for PRF. We propose a quality-based PRF framework, in which two quality-based assumptions are introduced. Particularly, two different strategies, relevance-based QLRelPRF and improvement-based QLImpPRF are presented to estimate the QL of each feedback document. Based on this, we select a set of heterogeneous document-level features and apply a learning approach to evaluate the QL of each feedback document. Extensive experiments on standard TREC Text REtrieval Conference test collections show that our proposed model performs robustly and outperforms strong baselines significantly.},

Personal communication networks as a feature do not exist in all collaborative projects. It is currently unclear if a designer's decision to include a personal communication network in a collaborative project's structure affects outcome quality. In this study, I investigated Wikipedia's personal communication network and analyzed which Wikipedia editors are utilizing it and how they are connected to outcome quality. Evidence suggests that people who utilize these networks are more experienced in editing high quality articles and are more integrated in the community. Additionally, these individuals utilize the personal communication network for coordinating and perhaps mentoring editors who edit lower quality articles. The value of these networks is demonstrated by the characteristics of the users who use them. These findings indicate that designers of online collaborative projects can help improve the quality of outcomes in these projects by deciding to implement a personal communication network in their communities.},

This study also explores creative writing faculty members' opinions about publishing in online literary publications in regard to career impact, including tenure and promotion. As online literary publishing disrupts what continues to be a very print-oriented practice, Rogers' "diffusion of innovations" provides a useful framework for exploring these issues. Because this project considers how innovations diffuse throughout a specific group of artists and scholars, and the information needs that emerge from these transformations, the concept of "communities of practice" also informed data analysis.},

Although this theory is one of the dominant models of sensemaking, it has not been extensively tested with a range of sensemaking tasks. The tasks discussed here focused on making sense of structures rather than processes or narratives. Eleven researchers were asked to construct understanding of how a scientific community in a particular domain is organized e.g., people, relationships, contributions, factors by exploring the concept of "influence" in academia. This topic was chosen because, although researchers frequently handle this type of task, it is unlikely that they have explicitly sought this type of information. We conducted a think-aloud study and semistructured interviews with junior and senior researchers from the human-computer interaction HCI domain, asking them to identify current leaders and rising stars in both HCI and chemistry. Data were coded and analyzed using the Data/Frame Model to both test and extend the model. Three themes emerged from the analysis: novices and experts' sensemaking activity chains, constructing frames through indicators, and characteristics of structure tasks. We propose extensions to the Data/Frame Model to accommodate structure sensemaking.},

This article examines variability in data and metadata practices using "institutions" as the key theoretical concept. Institutions, in the sense used here, are stable patterns of human behavior that structure, legitimize, or delegitimize actions, relationships, and understandings within particular situations. Based on prior conceptualizations of institutions, a theoretical framework is presented that outlines 5 categories of "institutional carriers" for data practices: a norms and symbols, b intermediaries, c routines, d standards, and e material objects. These institutional carriers are central to understanding how scientific data and metadata practices originate, stabilize, evolve, and transfer. This institutional framework is applied to 3 case studies: the Center for Embedded Networked Sensing CENS, the Long Term Ecological Research LTER network, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research UCAR. These cases are used to illustrate how institutional support for data and metadata management are not uniform within a single organization or academic discipline. Instead, broad spectra of institutional configurations for managing data and metadata exist within and across disciplines and organizations.},

This research used a survey method to examine to what extent those institutional and individual factors influence scientists' data-sharing behaviors in a range of scientific disciplines. A national survey with 1,317 scientists in 43 disciplines showed that regulative pressure by journals, normative pressure at a discipline level, and perceived career benefit and scholarly altruism at an individual level had significant positive relationships with data-sharing behaviors, and that perceived effort had a significant negative relationship. Regulative pressure by funding agencies and the availability of data repositories at a discipline level and perceived career risk at an individual level were not found to have any significant relationships with data-sharing behaviors.},

abstract = {Social media are becoming increasingly popular in scientific communication. A range of platforms, such as academic social networking sites SNS, are geared specifically towards the academic community. Proponents of the altmetrics approach have pointed out that new media allow for new avenues of scientific impact assessment. Traditional impact measures based on bibliographic analysis have long been criticized for overlooking the relational dynamics of scientific impact. We therefore propose an application of social network analysis to researchers' interactions on an academic social networking site to generate potential new metrics of scientific impact. Based on a case study conducted among a sample of Swiss management scholars, we analyze how centrality measures derived from the participants' interactions on the academic SNS ResearchGate relate to traditional, offline impact indicators. We find that platform engagement, seniority, and publication impact contribute to members' indegree and eigenvector centrality on the platform, but less so to closeness or betweenness centrality. We conclude that a relational approach based on social network analyses of academic SNS, while subject to platform-specific dynamics, may add richness and differentiation to scientific impact assessment.},

abstract = {Using Web of Science data, portfolio analysis in terms of journal coverage can be projected onto a base map for units of analysis such as countries, cities, universities, and firms. The units of analysis under study can be compared statistically across the 10,000+ journals. The interdisciplinarity of the portfolios is measured using Rao-Stirling diversity or Zhang etal.'s improved measure 2D3. At the country level we find regional differentiation e.g., Latin American or Asian countries, but also a major divide between advanced and less-developed countries. Israel and Israeli cities outperform other nations and cities in terms of diversity. Universities appear to be specifically related to firms when a number of these units are exploratively compared. The instrument is relatively simple and straightforward, and one can generalize the application to any document set retrieved from the Web of Science WoS.

abstract = {Over the past few years, several major scientific fraud cases have shocked the scientific community. The number of retractions each year has also increased tremendously, especially in the biomedical field, and scientific misconduct accounts for more than half of those retractions. It is assumed that co-authors of retracted papers are affected by their colleagues' misconduct, and the aim of this study is to provide empirical evidence of the effect of retractions in biomedical research on co-authors' research careers. Using data from the Web of Science, we measured the productivity, impact, and collaboration of 1,123 co-authors of 293 retracted articles for a period of 5 years before and after the retraction. We found clear evidence that collaborators do suffer consequences of their colleagues' misconduct and that a retraction for fraud has higher consequences than a retraction for error. Our results also suggest that the extent of these consequences is closely linked with the ranking of co-authors on the retracted paper, being felt most strongly by first authors, followed by the last authors, with the impact is less important for middle authors.},

abstract = {Numerous past studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the relevance modelRM for information retrieval IR. This approach enables relevance or pseudo-relevance feedback to be incorporated within the language modeling framework of IR. In the traditional RM, the feedback information is used to improve the estimate of the query language model. In this article, we introduce an extension of RM in the setting of relevance feedback. Our method provides an additional way to incorporate feedback via the improvement of the document language models. Specifically, we make use of the context information of known relevant and nonrelevant documents to obtain weighted counts of query terms for estimating the document language models. The context information is based on the words unigrams or bigrams appearing within a text window centered on query terms. Experiments on several Text REtrieval Conference TREC collections show that our context-dependent relevance model can improve retrieval performance over the baseline RM. Together with previous studies within the BM25 framework, our current study demonstrates that the effectiveness of our method for using context information in IR is quite general and not limited to any specific retrieval model.},

But what is a good weighting scheme? We compare 12 different in-text citation frequency-weighting schemes in the field of library and information science LIS and explore author citation impact patterns based on their performance in these schemes. Our results show that the ranks of authors vary widely with different weighting schemes that favor or are biased against common citation impact patterns-substantiated, applied, or noted. These variations separate LIS authors quite clearly into groups with these impact patterns. With consensus rank limits, the hard upper and lower bounds for reasonable author ranks that they provide suggest that author citation ranks may be subject to something like an uncertainty principle.},

abstract = {The readability levels of books identify suitable reading materials. Unfortunately, the majority of published books are assigned a readability level range, which is not useful to readers who look for books at a particular grade level. Existing readability formulas/analysis tools require at least an excerpt of a book to estimate its readability level, which is a severe constraint, since copyright laws prohibit book contents from being made publicly accessible. To alleviate the constraint, we have developed TRoLL which relies on publicly accessible online book metadata, in addition to using a book's snippet, if it is available, to predict its readability level. Based on a multi-dimensional regression analysis, TRoLL determines the grade level of any book instantly, even without a sample of its text, and considers its topical suitability, which is unique. Furthermore, TRoLL is a significant contribution to the educational community, since its computed book readability levels can enrich K-12 readers' book selections and aid parents, teachers, and librarians in locating reading materials suitable for their K-12 readers, which can be a time-consuming and frustrating task that does not always yield a quality outcome. Conducted empirical studies have verified the prediction accuracy of TRoLL and demonstrated its superiority over well-known readability formulas/analysis tools.},

It is a measure for informational intents, which handles both binary and graded relevance. \"{\i} undefined stems from the observation that searching is currently a that searching is currently taken for granted and it is natural for users to assume that search engines are available and work well. As a consequence, users may assume the utility they have in finding relevant documents, which is the focus of traditional measures, as granted. On the contrary, they may feel uneasy when the system returns nonrelevant documents because they are then forced to do additional work to get the desired information, and this causes avoidable effort. The latter is the focus of \"{\i} undefined, which evaluates the effectiveness of a system from the point of view of the effort required to the users to retrieve the desired information. We provide a formal definition of \"{\i} undefined, a demonstration of its properties, and introduce the notion of effort/gain plots, which complement traditional utility-based measures. By means of an extensive experimental evaluation, \"{\i} undefined is shown to grasp different aspects of system performances, to not require extensive and costly assessments, and to be a robust tool for detecting differences between systems.},

abstract = {Intellectual Structure IS is a bibliometric method that is widely applied in knowledge domain analysis and in science mapping. An intellectual structure consists of clusters of related documents ascribed to individual factors. Documents ascribed to a factor are generally associated with a common research theme. As such, the contents of documents ascribed to a factor are theorized to be similar to each other. This study shows that the link-based relatedness implies content-based similarity. The intellectual structures of two research domains were derived from data sets retrieved from the Microsoft Academic Search database. The collection of documents ascribed to a factor is referred to as a factor-based document cluster, which the content-based document clusters are compared with. All documents in an intellectual structure are re-clustered based on their content similarity, which is derived from the cosine of their vector form encoded in documents' term frequency inverse document frequency TF-IDF weighted terms. The factor-based document clusters are then compared with the content-based clusters for congruity. We used the Rand index and kappa coefficient to check the congruity between the factor-based and content-based document clusters. The kappa coefficient indicates that there is fair to moderate agreement between the clusters derived from these two different bases.},

Bibliometric indicators of important discoveries have been formulated using an empirical approach, based on the mathematical properties of the high-citation tail of the citation distribution. To investigate the theoretical basis of such formulations this study compares the US/European research performance ratios expressed in terms of highly cited papers and Nobel Prize-winning discoveries. The research performance ratio in terms of papers was studied from the citation distributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, and biochemistry and molecular biology. It varied as a function of the citation level. Selecting an appropriate high citation level, the ratios in terms of highly cited papers were compared with the corresponding ratios for Nobel Prize-winning discoveries in Chemistry, Physics, and Physiology or Medicine. Research performance ratios expressed in terms of highly cited papers and Nobel Prize-winning discoveries are reasonably similar, and suggest that the research success of the United States is almost 3 times that of Europe. A similar conclusion was obtained using articles published in Nature and Science.},

Our model instead attempts to reflect how users such as game players, collectors, and scholars understand video games and the relationships among them. We specifically consider use cases of gamers, with future intentions of using this conceptual model as a foundation for developing a union catalog for various libraries and museums. In the process of developing the model, we encountered many challenges, including conceptual overlap with and divergence from FRBR, entity scoping, complex relationships among entities, and the question of how to model additional content for game expansion. Future work will focus on making this model interoperable with existing ontologies as well as further understanding and description of content and relationships.},

This foundational approach is implemented by comparing the impact to the cost, titles, and usage for the subset of journals and by assessing the funding area. Overall, the results highlight the benefit of a web analytics evaluation framework for university libraries and the impact of classifying titles based on the funding area. Furthermore, they show the statistical difference in both use and cost among the various funding areas when ranked by cost, eliminating the outliers of heavily used and highly expensive journals.

Furthermore, we explore the links between citations and types of funding by organization and also with combined measures of funding. In particular, we examine the relationship between funding intensity and funding variety and citation. Our empirical work focuses on six small advanced European economies, applying a zero inflated negative binomial model to a set of more than 240,000 papers authored by researchers from these countries. We find that funding is not related to the first citation but is significantly related to the number of citations and top percentile citation impact. Additionally, we find that citation impact is positively related to funding variety and negatively related with funding intensity. Finally there is an inverse relationship between the relative frequency of funding and citation impact. The results presented in the paper provide insights for the design of research programs and the structure of research funding and for the behavior and strategies of research and sponsoring organizations.},

Based on a set of 2,739 academic monographs from 2008 and a set of 1,305 best-selling books in 15 Amazon.com academic subject categories, the existence of significant but low or moderate correlations between citations and numbers of reviews, combined with other evidence, suggests that online book reviews tend to reflect the wider popularity of a book rather than its academic impact, although there are substantial disciplinary differences. Metrics based on online reviews are therefore recommended for the evaluation of books that aim at a wide audience inside or outside academia when it is important to capture the broader impacts of educational or cultural activities and when they cannot be manipulated in advance of the evaluation.},

Near full recall can be achieved with the proposed method while incurring only negligible precision loss. Second, I report some important observations from the results about the extent of latent self-citations and their characteristics and give an example of the effect of improved self-citation detection on the document level self-citation rate of real data.},

abstract = {Disclosure of personal information on social networks has been extensively researched in recent years from different perspectives, including the influence of demographic, personality, and social parameters on the extent and type of disclosure. However, although some of the most widespread uses of these networks nowadays are for professional, academic, and business purposes, a thorough investigation of professional information disclosure is still needed. This study's primary aim, therefore, is to conduct a systematic and comprehensive investigation into patterns of professional information disclosure and various factors involved on different types of social networks. To this end, a user survey was conducted. We focused specifically on Facebook and LinkedIn, the 2 diverse networks most widely used in Israel. Significant differences were found between these networks. For example, we found that on Facebook professional pride is a factor in professional information disclosure, whereas on LinkedIn, work seniority and income have a significant effect. Thus, our findings shed light on the attitudes and professional behavior of network members, leading to recommendations regarding advertising strategies and network-appropriate self-presentation, as well as approaches that companies might adopt according to the type of manpower required.},

Being a new form of work facilitated by information technology, the rise of crowdsourcing calls for the development of new theoretical insights. Our focus in this article is on extra-role behavior-employees' voluntary activities, which are not part of their prescribed duties. Specifically, we explored how user interface design can help increase extra-role behavior among crowdsourcing workers. In a randomized experiment, we examined the joint effects of the presentation of a performance display to crowdsourcing workers and the personal attributes of these workers on the workers' likelihood to engage in extra-role behavior. The experimental setting included an image analysis task performed on an environmental monitoring website. We compared workers' behavior across the different experimental conditions and found that the interaction between the presence of a performance display and the workers' personality trait of curiosity has a significant impact on the likelihood of engaging in extra-role behavior. In particular, the presence of a performance display was associated with increased likelihood of extra-role behavior among low-curiosity workers, and no change in extra-role behavior was observed among high-curiosity users. Implications for design are discussed.},

Download counts tend to be 2 orders of magnitude higher and less skewedly distributed than citations. A mathematical model based on the sum of two exponentials does not adequately capture monthly download counts. The degree of correlation at the article level within a journal is similar to that at the journal level in the discipline covered by that journal, suggesting that the differences between journals are, to a large extent, discipline specific. Despite the fact that in all studied journals download and citation counts per article positively correlate, little overlap may exist between the set of articles appearing in the top of the citation distribution and that with the most frequently downloaded ones. Usage and citation leaks, bulk downloading, differences between reader and author populations in a subject field, the type of document or its content, differences in obsolescence patterns between downloads and citations, and different functions of reading and citing in the research process all provide possible explanations of differences between download and citation distributions.},

abstract = {Major efforts have been conducted on ontology learning, that is, semiautomatic processes for the construction of domain ontologies from diverse sources of information. In the past few years, a research trend has focused on the construction of educational ontologies, that is, ontologies to be used for educational purposes. The identification of the terminology is crucial to build ontologies. Term extraction techniques allow the identification of the domain-related terms from electronic resources. This paper presents LiTeWi, a novel method that combines current unsupervised term extraction approaches for creating educational ontologies for technology supported learning systems from electronic textbooks. LiTeWi uses Wikipedia as an additional information source. Wikipedia contains more than 30 million articles covering the terminology of nearly every domain in 288 languages, which makes it an appropriate generic corpus for term extraction. Furthermore, given that its content is available in several languages, it promotes both domain and language independence. LiTeWi is aimed at being used by teachers, who usually develop their didactic material from textbooks. To evaluate its performance, LiTeWi was tuned up using a textbook on object oriented programming and then tested with two textbooks of different domains-astronomy and molecular biology.},

A 2\texttimes{}2\texttimes{}2 factorial between-subjects experiment N=128 was conducted to examine distinct contributions of these dimensions to perceptions of a nonprofit website. The results showed significant effects for logic of structure and clarity on perceived navigability, while logic of structure and content domain involvement affected attitudes toward the website.},

The proposed extractive summarization method uses tags viewer- and author-assigned terms as key concepts. Our method employs Flickr tag clusters and WordNet synonyms to expand tags and detect the semantic relations between tags. This method helps select sentences that have a greater number of semantically related key concepts. To investigate the effectiveness and uniqueness of the proposed method, we compare it with an existing technique, latent semantic analysis LSA, using intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations. The results of intrinsic evaluation show that the tag-based method is as or more effective than the LSA method. We also observe that in the extrinsic evaluation, the grand mean accuracy score of the tag-based method is higher than that of the LSA method, with a statistically significant difference. Elaborating on our results, we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings for speech video summarization and retrieval.},

Content analysis was performed on the information available for nine drugs on three authoritative sites RxList, eMC, and PDRhealth as well as three drug review sites WebMD, RateADrug, and PatientsLikeMe. The types of information found on authoritative sites but rarely on drug review sites include pharmacology, special population considerations, contraindications, and drug interactions. Types of information found only on drug review sites include drug efficacy, drug resistance experienced by long-term users, cost of drug in relation to insurance coverage, availability of generic forms, comparison with other similar drugs and with other versions of the drug, difficulty in using the drug, and advice on coping with side effects. Drug efficacy ratings by users were found to be different across the three sites. Side effects were vividly described in context, with user assessment of severity based on discomfort and effect on their lives.},

abstract = {In the context of online question-answering services, an intermediary clarifies the user's needs by eliciting additional information. This research proposes that these elicitations will depend on the type of question. In particular, this research explores the relationship between three constructs: question types, elicitations, and the fee that is paid for the answer. These relationships are explored for a few different question typologies, including a new kind of question type that we call Identity. It is found that the kinds of clarifications that intermediaries elicit depend on the type of question in systematic ways. A practical implication is that interactive question-answering services-whether human or automated-can be steered to focus attention on the kinds of clarification that are evidently most needed for that question type. Further, it is found that certain question types, as well as the number of elicitations, are associated with higher fees. This means that it may be possible to define a pricing structure for question-answering services based on objective and predictable characteristics of the question, which would help to establish a rational market for this type of information service. The newly introduced Identity question type was found to be especially reliable in predicting elicitations and fees.},

Twenty participants archaeologists, architects, art historians, and artists, individuals who rely on images of cultural materials in the performance of their work, took part in the study. The findings of the study reveal that interest in CBIR methods varied among the different professional user communities. Individuals who showed an interest in these systems were primarily those concerned with the formal characteristics i.e., color, shape, composition, and texture of the images being sought. In contrast, those participants who expressed a strong interest in images of known items, images illustrating themes, and/or items from specific locations believe concept-based searches to be the most direct route. These image users did not see a practical application for CBIR systems in their current work routines.},

Simulation results show that the rate of forgetting has a significantly negative effect on stakeholders' perceptions and the incremental increase in the number of affected individuals has a positive effect on the maximum level of stakeholders' perceptions, but negative effect on the duration of stakeholders' perceptions. Additionally, a delay effect, a stagnation effect, and a cumulative effect exist in the evolution of stakeholders' perceptions. There is a spike at the beginning of the profile of stakeholders' perceptions in the Damped Exponential Model. An empirical test supports the validity of this model of stakeholders' disaster perceptions.},

abstract = {Main path analysis is a powerful tool for extracting the backbones of a directed network and has been applied widely in bibliometric studies. In contrast to the no-decay assumption in the traditional approach, this study proposes a novel technique by assuming that the strength of knowledge decays when knowledge contained in one document is passed on to another document down the citation chain. We propose three decay models, arithmetic decay, geometric decay, and harmonic decay, along with their theoretical properties. In general, results of the proposed decay models depend largely on the local structure of a citation network as opposed to the global structure in the traditional approach. Thus, the significance of citation links and the associated documents that are overemphasized by the global structure in the traditional no-decay approach is treated more properly. For example, the traditional approach commonly assigns high value to documents that heavily reference others, such as review articles. Specifically in the geometric and harmonic decay models, only truly significant review articles will be included in the resulting main paths. We demonstrate this new approach and its properties through the DNA literature citation network.},

In this article, we examine whether the female winners of those races acted differently than the male winners in the 2012 election, and whether they differed in their tweeting-style during two months in the summer of 2013. Using a hand-coded content analysis of every tweet from each member in the U.S. House of Representatives in June and July of 2013, we show that women differ from their male colleagues in their frequency and type of tweeting, and note some key differences between the period during the election and the period after.

abstract = {Online communities are becoming an important tool in the communication and participation processes in our society. However, the most widespread applications are difficult to use for people with disabilities, or may involve some risks if no previous training has been undertaken. This work describes a novel social network for cognitively disabled people along with a clustering-based method for modeling activity and socialization processes of its users in a noninvasive way. This closed social network is specifically designed for people with cognitive disabilities, called Guremintza, that provides the network administrators e.g., social workers with two types of reports: summary statistics of the network usage and behavior patterns discovered by a data mining process. Experiments made in an initial stage of the network show that the discovered patterns are meaningful to the social workers and they find them useful in monitoring the progress of the users.},

abstract = {"Genius work," proposed by Avramescu, refers to scientific articles whose citations grow exponentially in an extended period, for example, over 50 years. Such articles were defined as "sleeping beauties" by van Raan, who quantitatively studied the phenomenon of delayed recognition. However, the criteria adopted by van Raan at times are not applicable and may confer recognition prematurely. To revise such deficiencies, this paper proposes two new criteria, which are applicable but not limited to exponential citation curves. We searched for genius work among articles of Nobel Prize laureates during the period of 1901-2012 on the Web of Science, finding 25 articles of genius work out of 21,438 papers including 10 by van Raan's criteria sleeping beauties and 15 nonsleeping-beauties. By our new criteria, two findings were obtained through empirical analysis: a the awakening periods for genius work depend on the increase rate b in the exponential function, and b lower b leads to a longer sleeping period.},

It focuses on information practices in everyday patient care by a team of senior and junior physicians in a university teaching hospital. A practice-oriented, interpretative case study approach, in which elements from activity theory, situated learning theory, and communities of practice framework, was developed to form the theoretical basis for the study. The qualitative data from observations and interviews were analyzed with iterative coding techniques. The findings reveal that physicians' learning through everyday access to medical information is enacted by, embedded in, and sustained as a part of the work activity itself. The findings indicate a stable community of practice with traits of both local and general medical conventions, in which the value of used sources and strategies remains relatively uncontested, strongly based on formally and informally sanctioned and legitimized practices. Although the present study is particular and context specific, the results indicate a more generally plausible conclusion; the complementary nature of different information sources and strategies underscores that access to information happens in a context in which solitary sources alone make little difference.},

abstract = {Political sentiment analysis using social media, especially Twitter, has attracted wide interest in recent years. In such research, opinions about politicians are typically divided into positive, negative, or neutral. In our research, the goal is to mine political opinion from social media at a higher resolution by assessing statements of opinion related to the personality traits of politicians; this is an angle that has not yet been considered in social media research. A second goal is to contribute a novel retrieval-based approach for tracking public perception of personality using Gough and Heilbrun's Adjective Check List ACL of 110 terms describing key traits. This is in contrast to the typical lexical and machine-learning approaches used in sentiment analysis. High-precision search templates developed from the ACL were run on an 18-month span of Twitter posts mentioning Obama and Romney and these retrieved more than half a million tweets. For example, the results indicated that Romney was perceived as more of an achiever and Obama was perceived as somewhat more friendly. The traits were also aggregated into 14 broad personality dimensions. For example, Obama rated far higher than Romney on the Moderation dimension and lower on the Machiavellianism dimension. The temporal variability of such perceptions was explored.},

An approach, BayesAD, is developed for solving this problem: apply a Bayesian segmentation algorithm, followed by a segment clustering algorithm. Results are presented from an empirical comparison between BayesAD and AK, a modified version of an approach published by Akiva and Koppel in 2013. BayesAD exhibited greater accuracy than AK in all experiments. However, BayesAD has a parameter that needs to be set and which had a nontrivial impact on accuracy. Developing an effective method for eliminating this need would be a fruitful direction for future work. When controlling for topic, the accuracy levels of BayesAD and AK were, in all but one case, worse than a baseline approach wherein one author was assumed to write all sentences in the input text document. Hence, room for improved solutions exists.},

A typical discussion thread consists of a sequence of posts posted by multiple users. Each post in a thread serves a different purpose providing different types of information and, thus, may not be equally useful for all applications. Identifying the purpose and nature of each post in a discussion thread is thus an interesting research problem as it can help in improving information extraction and intelligent assistance techniques. We study the problem of classifying a given post as per its purpose in the discussion thread and employ features based on the post's content, structure of the thread, behavior of the participating users, and sentiment analysis of the post's content. We evaluate our approach on two forum data sets belonging to different genres and achieve strong classification performance. We also analyze the relative importance of different features used for the post classification task. Next, as a use case, we describe how the post class information can help in thread retrieval by incorporating this information in a state-of-the-art thread retrieval model.},

Although some software vendors and experimental researchers claim the tools can replace manual subject indexing, hard scientific evidence of their performance in operating information environments is scarce. A major reason for this is that research is usually conducted in laboratory conditions, excluding the complexities of real-life systems and situations. The article reviews and discusses issues with existing evaluation approaches such as problems of aboutness and relevance assessments, implying the need to use more than a single "gold standard" method when evaluating indexing and retrieval, and proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework. The framework is informed by a systematic review of the literature on evaluation approaches: evaluating indexing quality directly through assessment by an evaluator or through comparison with a gold standard, evaluating the quality of computer-assisted indexing directly in the context of an indexing workflow, and evaluating indexing quality indirectly through analyzing retrieval performance.},

Authorship verification is considered an extremely difficult task in computational text classification, because it does not assume that the correct author of an anonymous text is included in the candidate authors available. To determine whether 2 documents have been written by the same author, the verification method discussed uses repeated feature subsampling and a pool of impostor authors. We use this technique to attribute a newly discovered Latin text from antiquity the Compendiosa expositio to Apuleius. This North African writer was one of the most important authors of the Roman Empire in the 2nd century and authored one of the world's first novels. This attribution has profound and wide-reaching cultural value, because it has been over a century since a new text by a major author from antiquity was discovered. This research therefore illustrates the rapidly growing potential of computational methods for studying the global textual heritage.},

Previous research dealing with privacy concerns has studied mostly worries about information misuse, focusing on the protection aspects of privacy. By adopting an interpersonal conception of privacy and communication privacy management theory, this study offers a new way of understanding privacy concerns by examining the social and presentational aspects of privacy. It examines privacy concerns in terms not only of others' misuse but of others' misunderstanding and personal information in terms not only of identity but of self-presentational information. Furthermore, it investigates the ways in which information and social risks inherent in SNS influence privacy concerns. A structural equation modeling analysis of a cross-sectional survey of 396 Facebook users finds that longer usage does not alleviate the impact of information risk on either concern, that a greater proportion of offline friends among one's SNS friends aggravates the impact of social risk on both concerns, and that concerns about information misuse affect the provision only of identity information, whereas concerns about information misunderstanding affect the provision of both identity and self-presentational information.},

abstract = {Descriptive document clustering aims at discovering clusters of semantically interrelated documents together with meaningful labels to summarize the content of each document cluster. In this work, we propose a novel descriptive clustering framework, referred to as CEDL. It relies on the formulation and generation of 2 types of heterogeneous objects, which correspond to documents and candidate phrases, using multilevel similarity information. CEDL is composed of 5 main processing stages. First, it simultaneously maps the documents and candidate phrases into a common co-embedded space that preserves higher-order, neighbor-based proximities between the combined sets of documents and phrases. Then, it discovers an approximate cluster structure of documents in the common space. The third stage extracts promising topic phrases by constructing a discriminant model where documents along with their cluster memberships are used as training instances. Subsequently, the final cluster labels are selected from the topic phrases using a ranking scheme using multiple scores based on the extracted co-embedding information and the discriminant output. The final stage polishes the initial clusters to reduce noise and accommodate the multitopic nature of documents. The effectiveness and competitiveness of CEDL is demonstrated qualitatively and quantitatively with experiments using document databases from different application fields.},

Although many researchers have attempted to explain why and how people use this new medium, previous studies have produced relatively inconclusive results. For instance, in most of these studies, microblogging has been considered a social networking activity; however, quantitative analyses of microblogging usage have shown that people use microblogging as an information-broadcasting platform. In this study, we identified the factors that drive microblogging and which of them lead to user satisfaction. We developed a theoretical framework and then empirically validated the factors and the emergent mechanisms value evaluation processes. We empirically tested our research model using a sample of 230 microbloggers, and the results showed that content and technology gratifications are the two key factors that drive user satisfaction with microblogging. That is, it is the value of information dissemination rather than social networking that makes people feel satisfied with the use of microblogging. We believe that this study will generate interest among researchers in social media. The results also provide platform administrators with insights into how people use microblogging and why they are satisfied with the technology.},

abstract = {This study introduces a new proposal to refine the classification of the SCImago Journal and Country Rank SJR platform by using clustering techniques and an alternative combination of citation measures from an initial 18,891 SJR journal network. Thus, a journal-journal matrix including simultaneously fractionalized values of direct citation, cocitation, and coupling was symmetrized by cosine similarity and later transformed into distances before performing clustering. The results provided a new cluster-based subject structure comprising 290 clusters that emerge by executing Ward's clustering in two phases and using a mixed labeling procedure based on tf-idf scores of the original SJR category tags and significant words extracted from journal titles. In total, 13,716 SJR journals were classified using this new cluster-based scheme. Although more than 5,000 journals were omitted in the classification process, the method produced a consistent classification with a balanced structure of coherent and well-defined clusters, a moderated multiassignment of journals, and a softer concentration of journals over clusters than in the original SJR categories. New subject disciplines such as "nanoscience and nanotechnology" or "social work" were also detected, providing evidence of good performance of our approach in refining the journal classification and updating the subject classification structure.},

This article investigates the influence of time on the number of Mendeley readers of an article through a theoretical discussion and an investigation into the relationship between counts of readers of, and citations to, 4 general library and information science LIS journals. For this discipline, it takes about 7 years for articles to attract as many Scopus citations as Mendeley readers, and after this the Spearman correlation between readers and citers is stable at about 0.6 for all years. This suggests that Mendeley readership counts may be useful impact indicators for both newer and older articles. The lack of dates for individual Mendeley article readers and an unknown bias toward more recent articles mean that readership data should be normalized individually by year, however, before making any comparisons between articles published in different years.},

abstract = {Keyphrases represent the main topics a text is about. In this article, we introduce SemGraph, an unsupervised algorithm for extracting keyphrases from a collection of texts based on a semantic relationship graph. The main novelty of this algorithm is its ability to identify semantic relationships between words whose presence is statistically significant. Our method constructs a co-occurrence graph in which words appearing in the same document are linked, provided their presence in the collection is statistically significant with respect to a null model. Furthermore, the graph obtained is enriched with information from WordNet. We have used the most recent and standardized benchmark to evaluate the system ability to detect the keyphrases that are part of the text. The result is a method that achieves an improvement of 5.3% and 7.28% in F measure over the two labeled sets of keyphrases used in the evaluation of SemEval-2010.},

abstract = {Vast amounts of information are daily exchanged and/or released. The sensitive nature of much of this information creates a serious privacy threat when documents are uncontrollably made available to untrusted third parties. In such cases, appropriate data protection measures should be undertaken by the responsible organization, especially under the umbrella of current legislation on data privacy. To do so, human experts are usually requested to redact or sanitize document contents. To relieve this burdensome task, this paper presents a privacy model for document redaction/sanitization, which offers several advantages over other models available in the literature. Based on the well-established foundations of data semantics and information theory, our model provides a framework to develop and implement automated and inherently semantic redaction/sanitization tools. Moreover, contrary to ad-hoc redaction methods, our proposal provides a priori privacy guarantees which can be intuitively defined according to current legislations on data privacy. Empirical tests performed within the context of several use cases illustrate the applicability of our model and its ability to mimic the reasoning of human sanitizers.},

abstract = {The aim of this study is to understand how teenagers use Internet forums to search for information. The activities of asking for and providing information in a forum were explored, and a set of messages extracted from a French forum targeting adolescents was analyzed. Results show that the messages initiating the threads are often requests for information. Teenagers mainly ask for peers' opinions on personal matters and specific verifiable information. The discussions following these requests take the form of an exchange of advice question/answer or a coconstruction of the final answer between the participants with assessments of participants' responses, requests for explanations, etc.. The results suggest that discussion forums present different advantages for adolescents' information-seeking activities. The first is that this social medium allows finding specialized information on topics specific to this age group. The second is that the collaborative aspect of information seeking in a forum allows these adolescents to overcome difficulties commonly associated with the search process making a precise request, evaluating a result.},

We propose an alternative approach to creating QS scores, which is referred to as the composite I-distance indicator CIDI methodology. The main contribution is the proposal of a composite indicator weights correction based on the CIDI methodology. It leads to the improved stability and reduced uncertainty of the QS ranking system. The CIDI methodology is also applicable to other university rankings by proposing a specific statistical approach to creating a composite indicator.},

However, such techniques work only for objects with previously assigned tags. Here we focus on tag recommendation for objects with no tags, a variation of the well-known textit{cold start} problem. We start by evaluating state-of-the-art co-occurrence based methods in cold start. Our results show that the effectiveness of these methods suffers in this situation. Moreover, we show that employing various automatic filtering strategies to generate an initial tag set that enables the use of co-occurrence patterns produces only marginal improvements. We then propose a new approach that exploits both positive and negative user feedback to iteratively select input tags along with a genetic programming strategy to learn the recommendation function. Our experimental results indicate that extending the methods to include user relevance feedback leads to gains in precision of up to 58% over the best baseline in cold start scenarios and gains of up to 43% over the best baseline in objects that contain some initial tags i.e., no cold start. We also show that our best relevance-feedback-driven strategy performs well even in scenarios that lack user cooperation i.e., users may refuse to provide feedback and user reliability i.e., users may provide the wrong feedback.},

abstract = {Since its foundation in 2006, Twitter has enjoyed a meteoric rise in popularity, currently boasting over 500 million users. Its short text nature means that the service is open to a variety of different usage patterns, which have evolved rapidly in terms of user base and utilization. Prior work has categorized Twitter users, as well as studied the use of lists and re-tweets and how these can be used to infer user profiles and interests. The focus of this article is on studying why and how Twitter users mark tweets as "favorites"-a functionality with currently poorly understood usage, but strong relevance for personalization and information access applications. Firstly, manual analysis and classification are carried out on a randomly chosen set of favorited tweets, which reveal different approaches to using this functionality i.e., bookmarks, thanks, like, conversational, and self-promotion. Secondly, an automatic favorites classification approach is proposed, based on the categories established in the previous step. Our machine learning experiments demonstrate a high degree of success in matching human judgments in classifying favorites according to usage type. In conclusion, we discuss the purposes to which these data could be put, in the context of identifying users' patterns of interests.},

In this article, we scrutinize one of these cases where the continued use of technology cannot be explained by one of the most prominent traditional IS models to date. We analyze our qualitative case study by juxtaposing two theoretical lenses: a traditional IS perspective i.e., the "unified theory of acceptance and use" model versus an evolutionary psychology perspective i.e., the four-drive model. We find that a more comprehensive understanding of continued IS usage is possible when including an evolutionary psychology perspective to the existing models. Specifically, we propose three new concepts, including evolved performance expectancy, evolved effort expectancy, and evolved social influence. We also demonstrate that, in some situations, cognitive and social constructs dominate, whereas in other situations, the evolutionary dependent constructs associated with human nature take over.},

Practice is inherently embodied too, which means embodiment can be utilized as a vantage point to seek conceptual grounding for the rather diverse range of theories and models in information behavior research. The challenge then is to articulate in what ways and on what levels a particular approach contributes to advancing information behavior research. Conceptual clarity would also help information behavior models and theories developed in libraries and information science become more accessible and hopefully also more relevant to researchers in cognate disciplines.},

abstract = {In many scientific fields, the order of coauthors on a paper conveys information about each individual's contribution to a piece of joint work. We argue that in prior network analyses of coauthorship networks, the information on ordering has been insufficiently considered because ties between authors are typically symmetrized. This is basically the same as assuming that each coauthor has contributed equally to a paper. We introduce a solution to this problem by adopting a coauthorship credit allocation model proposed by Kim and Diesner 2014, which in its core conceptualizes coauthoring as a directed, weighted, and self-looped network. We test and validate our application of the adopted framework based on a sample data of 861 authors who have published in the journal Psychometrika. The results suggest that this novel sociometric approach can complement traditional measures based on undirected networks and expand insights into coauthoring patterns such as the hierarchy of collaboration among scholars. As another form of validation, we also show how our approach accurately detects prominent scholars in the Psychometric Society affiliated with the journal.},

To address this issue, the Game Metadata Research Group at the University of Washington Information School, in collaboration with the Seattle Interactive Media Museum, worked to create a standardized metadata schema. This metadata schema was empirically evaluated using multiple approaches-collaborative review, schema testing, semi-structured user interview, and a large-scale survey. Reviewing and testing the schema revealed issues and challenges in sourcing the metadata for particular elements, determining the level of granularity for data description, and describing digitally distributed games. The findings from user studies suggest that users value various subject and visual metadata, information about how games are related to each other, and data regarding game expansions/alterations such as additional content and networked features. The metadata schema was extensively revised based on the evaluation results, and we present the new element definitions from the revised schema in this article. This work will serve as a platform and catalyst for advances in the design and use of video game metadata.},

Current research and commercial efforts have concentrated on sensor-based collection of health data for personal fitness and healthcare feedback purposes. However, to date there has not been a detailed investigation of how such smartphones and sensors can be utilized for public health data collection purposes. Public health data have the characteristic of being capturable while still not infringing upon privacy, as the full detailed data of individuals are not needed but rather only anonymized, aggregate, de-identified, and non-unique data for an individual. For example, rather than details of physical activity including specific route, just total caloric burn over a week or month could be submitted, thereby strongly assisting non-re-identification. In this paper we introduce, prototype, and evaluate a new type of public health information system to provide aggregate population health data capture and public health intervention capabilities via utilizing smartphone and sensor capabilities, while fully maintaining the anonymity and privacy of each individual. We consider in particular the key aspects of privacy, anonymity, and intervention capabilities of these emerging systems and provide a detailed evaluation of anonymity preservation characteristics.},

In this paper, we explore the peculiarities of TREC and CLEF medically oriented tasks and queries through the analysis of the differences and the similarities between queries across tasks, with respect to length, specificity, and clarity features and then study their effect on retrieval performance. We show that, even for expert oriented queries, language specificity level varies significantly across tasks as well as search difficulty. Additional findings highlight that query clarity factors are task dependent and that query terms specificity based on domain-specific terminology resources is not significantly linked to term rareness in the document collection. The lessons learned from our study could serve as starting points for the design of future task-based medical information retrieval frameworks.},

abstract = {Text mining has been widely used in multiple types of user-generated data to infer user opinion, but its application to microblogging is difficult because text messages are short and noisy, providing limited information about user opinion. Given that microblogging users communicate with each other to form a social network, we hypothesize that user opinion is influenced by its neighbors in the network. In this paper, we infer user opinion on a topic by combining two factors: the user's historical opinion about relevant topics and opinion influence from his/her neighbors. We thus build a topic-level opinion influence model TOIM by integrating both topic factor and opinion influence factor into a unified probabilistic model. We evaluate our model in one of the largest microblogging sites in China, Tencent Weibo, and the experiments show that TOIM outperforms baseline methods in opinion inference accuracy. Moreover, incorporating indirect influence further improves inference recall and f1-measure. Finally, we demonstrate some useful applications of TOIM in analyzing users' behaviors in Tencent Weibo.},

A series of data sets are examined and joined in order to analyze the citations of over 195,000 conference papers and 108,000 journal papers. Two means of evaluating the citations of journals and conferences are explored: h5 and average citations per paper; it was found that h5 has certain biases that make it a difficult measure to use despite it being the main measure used by Google Scholar. Results from the analysis show that CS, as a discipline, values conferences as a publication venue more highly than any other academic field of study. The analysis also shows that a small number of elite CS conferences have the highest average paper citation rate of any publication type, although overall, citation rates in conferences are no higher than in journals. It is also shown that the length of a paper is correlated with citation rate.},

Fifty topics in arXiv and WoS were generated using an LDA algorithm and then regression models were used to explain 4 types of topic growth patterns. Based on the slopes of the fitted equation curves, the paper redefines the topic trends and popularity. Results show that arXiv and WoS share similar topics in a given domain, but differ in evolution trends. Topics in WoS lose their popularity much earlier and their durations of popularity are shorter than those in arXiv. This work demonstrates that open access preprints have stronger growth tendency as compared to traditional printed publications.},

We believe comments left on these videos can provide insight into user interests, but to this point have not been used to map out a specific video community. Our study investigates whether and how user commenting behavior impacts the topology of the K-pop video community through analysis of co-commenting behavior on these videos. We apply a traditional author cocitation analysis to this behavior, in a process we refer to as co-comment analysis, to detect the topology of this community. This involves: a an analysis of user co-comments to elicit the inclination of user homophily within the community; b an analysis of user co-comments, weighted frequency of co-comments, to detect user interests in the community; and c an analysis of user co-comments, weighted sentiment scores, to capture user opinions by polarity. The results indicate that users who comment on specific K-pop videos also tend to comment on topically similar YouTube videos. We also find that the number of comments made by users correlates with the degree of positivity of their comments. Conversely, users who comment negatively on K-pop videos are not inclined to form specific user groups, but rather present only their opinions individually.},

Such knowledge provides a basis for designing systems for providing complementary health information. This article discusses how patients' conceptualizations of their health-information-related preferences, motivations, and needs are linked to the perceived role of medical records as an informational artifact. We identified seven subject positions: P1 Hypothetically positive to e-health services generally, P2 Positive to reading medical records due to implications, P3 Positive to all Internet use including medical records online, P4 Distrustful and wants to be in control of health treatment, P5 Worried about health, P6 Wants communication with health care professionals, and P7 Do not understand their medical record. These subject positions can explain the worry and enthusiasm documented in earlier literature. The diversity of subject positions implies that health care information services should be planned with different subject positions in mind rather than a simple demographic group. Special attention needs to be given to finding flexible solutions that address the opportunities and worries of the identified subject positions.},

We also explored the moderating role of customer reputation in the relationship between observational learning and reinforcement learning as well as customer information contribution behavior. Analyses of panel data from 6,121 customers in an online social fashion platform revealed that they are significant factors affecting customer information contribution behavior and that reinforcement learning exhibits a stronger effect than observational learning. The results also showed that customer reputation has a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between observational learning and customer information contribution behavior. This study not only enriched our theoretical understanding of information contribution behavior but also provided guidelines for online social shopping community administrators to better design their community features.},

However, we still do not understand how knowledge-sharing intention KSI is formed across poster and lurker groups. Accordingly, this study seeks to provide a fuller understanding of the formation of behavioral intention in PVCs by decomposing the psychological formation of KSI and focusing on factors deemed likely to influence the KSI of posters and lurkers. This study's online survey of 177 posters and 246 lurkers from 3 PVCs demonstrated that enjoyment in helping others positively influenced posters' attitudes toward knowledge sharing, whereas reciprocity and technology adoption variables perceived ease of use and compatibility positively influenced lurkers' attitudes. Interpersonal trust and peer influence strongly affected the subjective norm of knowledge sharing in both groups, with posters emphasizing interpersonal trust and lurkers emphasizing peer influence. Furthermore, knowledge self-efficacy and resource availability enhanced the perceived behavioral control of knowledge sharing in both groups, with knowledge self-efficacy affecting posters the most and resource availability influencing lurkers the most. The results of this study have important implications for both research and practice.},

Although term weighting is one of the important modules for TC and TC has different peculiarities from those in information retrieval, many term-weighting schemes used in information retrieval, such as term frequency-inverse document frequency tf-idf, have been used in TC in the same manner. The peculiarity of TC that differs most from information retrieval is the existence of class information. This article proposes a new term-weighting scheme that uses class information using positive and negative class distributions. As a result, the proposed scheme, log tf-TRR, consistently performs better than do other schemes using class information as well as traditional schemes such as tf-idf.},

The study describes the dynamics of these inboxes throughout the day and the week as users strive to handle incoming messages, read them, classify them, respond to them in a timely manner, and archive them for future reference, all while carrying out the daily tasks of knowledge workers. It then tests several hypotheses about the influence of specific inbox-management behaviors in mitigating the causes of e-mail overload, and proposes a continuous index that quantifies one of these inbox-management behaviors. This inbox clearing index ICI expands on the widely cited trichotomous classification of users into frequent filers, spring cleaners, and no filers, as suggested by Whittaker and Sidner 1996. We propose that the ICI allows shifting the focus, from classifying users to characterizing a diversity of user behaviors and measuring the relationships between these behaviors and desired outcomes.},

The project confirmed that a large percentage of journals have no data sharing policy and that there are inconsistencies between those that are traceable. This state leaves authors unsure of whether they should share article related data and where and how to deposit those data. In the absence of a consolidated infrastructure to share data easily, a model journal data sharing policy was developed by comparing quantitative information from analyzing existing journal data policies with qualitative data collected from stakeholders. This article summarizes and outlines the process by which the model was developed and presents the model journal data sharing policy.},

abstract = {Spam and wildly varying documents make searching in Twitter challenging. Most Twitter search systems generally treat a Tweet as a plain text when modeling relevance. However, a series of conventions allows users to Tweet in structural ways using a combination of different blocks of texts. These blocks include plain texts, hashtags, links, mentions, etc. Each block encodes a variety of communicative intent and the sequence of these blocks captures changing discourse. Previous work shows that exploiting the structural information can improve the structured documents e.g., web pages retrieval. In this study we utilize the structure of Tweets, induced by these blocks, for Twitter retrieval and Twitter opinion retrieval. For Twitter retrieval, a set of features, derived from the blocks of text and their combinations, is used into a learning-to-rank scenario. We show that structuring Tweets can achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our approach does not rely on social media features, but when we do add this additional information, performance improves significantly. For Twitter opinion retrieval, we explore the question of whether structural information derived from the body of Tweets and opinionatedness ratings of Tweets can improve performance. Experimental results show that retrieval using a novel unsupervised opinionatedness feature based on structuring Tweets achieves comparable performance with a supervised method using manually tagged Tweets. Topic-related specific structured Tweet sets are shown to help with query-dependent opinion retrieval.},

abstract = {It is essential for research funding organizations to ensure both the validity and fairness of the grant approval procedure. The ex-ante peer evaluation EXANTE of N=8,496 grant applications submitted to the Austrian Science Fund from 1999 to 2009 was statistically analyzed. For 1,689 funded research projects an ex-post peer evaluation EXPOST was also available; for the rest of the grant applications a multilevel missing data imputation approach was used to consider verification bias for the first time in peer-review research. Without imputation, the predictive validity of EXANTE was low r=.26 but underestimated due to verification bias, and with imputation it was r=.49. That is, the decision-making procedure is capable of selecting the best research proposals for funding. In the EXANTE there were several potential biases e.g., gender. With respect to the EXPOST there was only one real bias discipline-specific and year-specific differential prediction. The novelty of this contribution is, first, the combining of theoretical concepts of validity and fairness with a missing data imputation approach to correct for verification bias and, second, multilevel modeling to test peer review-based funding decisions for both validity and fairness in terms of potential and real biases.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of information and communication technologies, people are increasingly referring to web information to assist in their travel planning and decision making. Research shows that people conduct collaborative information searches while planning their travel activities online. However, little is known in depth about tourists' online collaborative search. This study examines tourists' collaborative information search behavior in detail, including their search stages, online search strategies, and information flow breakdowns. The data for analysis included pre- and postsearch questionnaires, web search and chat logs, and postsearch interviews. A model of tourist collaborative information retrieval was developed. The model identified collaborative planning, collaborative information searching, sharing of information, and collaborative decision making as four stages of tourists' collaborative search. The results show that tourists collaborated by planning their search strategies, dividing search tasks into subtasks and allocating workload, using search queries and URL links recommended by teammates, and discussing search results together. Related personal knowledge and experiences appeared important in trip planning and collaborative information search. During the collaborative search, tourists also encountered various information flow breakdowns in different search stages. These were classified and their effects on collaborative information search were reported. Implications for system design in support of collaborative information retrieval in travel contexts are also discussed.},

In a previous article, we reported the information-seeking behavior of visually impaired users when performing complex search tasks on the web, and we examined the difficulties encountered when interacting with search interfaces via speech-based screen readers. In this article, we use our previous findings to inform the design of a search interface to support visually impaired users for complex information seeking. We particularly focus on implementing TrailNote, a tool to support visually impaired searchers in managing the search process, and we also redesign the spelling-support mechanism using nonspeech sounds to address previously observed difficulties in interacting with this feature. To enhance the user experience, we have designed interface features to be technically accessible as well as usable with speech-based screen readers. We have evaluated the proposed interface with 12 visually impaired users and studied how they interacted with the interface components. Our findings show that the search interface was effective in supporting participants for complex information seeking and that the proposed interface features were accessible and usable with speech-based screen readers.},

Searches using each term are conducted in JSTOR and in selected additional full-text journal sources from over the years 1987-2011. Two measures of OBI are used, one simply tallying the presence or absence of references to Simon's oeuvre strict OBI linked to the catch phrase and one counting only papers lacking any embedded reference as evidence of obliteration lenient OBI. By either measure, OBI existed but varied across subject area, time period, and catch phrase. Economics had the highest strict OBI 82% and lenient OBI 43% for bounded rationality and the highest strict OBI 64% for satisficing; all 3 subject areas were essentially tied for lenient OBI at about 30%. Sixty-two percent of the articles for bounded rationality-psychology were retrieved only because the catch phrase occurred in a title in the article bibliography. OBI research can benefit from full-text searching; the main tradeoff is more detailed and nuanced evidence concerning OBI existence and trends versus increased noise in the retrieval.},

There are numerous approaches to defining and measuring complexity and organization, all involving the idea of information. Conceptions of complexity, order, organization, and "interesting order" are inextricably intertwined with those of information. Shannon's formalism captures information's unpredictable creative contributions to organized complexity; a full understanding of information's relation to structure and order is still lacking. Conceptual investigations of this topic should enrich the theoretical basis of the information science discipline, and create fruitful links with other disciplines that study the concepts of information and complexity.},

Furthermore, the data were analyzed with an advanced statistical technique-segmented regression analysis-which can identify specific segments with similar growth rates in the history of science. The study is based on two different sets of bibliometric data: a the number of publications held as source items in the Web of Science WoS, Thomson Reuters per publication year and b the number of cited references in the publications of the source items per cited reference year. We looked at the rate at which science has grown since the mid-1600s. In our analysis of cited references we identified three essential growth phases in the development of science, which each led to growth rates tripling in comparison with the previous phase: from less than 1% up to the middle of the 18th century, to 2 to 3% up to the period between the two world wars, and 8 to 9% to 2010.},

abstract = {Online-community management is commonly presented as the facilitation of conversation and contributions, especially converting readers to contributors. However, the goal of many discussion communities is to produce a high-quality knowledge resource, whether to improve external task performance or to increase reputation and site traffic. What do moderation practices look like when the community is focused on the creation of a useable knowledge resource rather than facilitating an inclusive conversation? Under what conditions is this style of moderation likely to be successful? We present a case study from online gaming-Elitist Jerks-in which aggressive moderation is used to transform a conversational medium into a high-quality knowledge resource, using the strategy of open censorship. We present a content analysis of moderator comments regarding censored messages. Our analysis revealed differences in types of contributor mistakes and the severity of moderator actions: infractions that interfered with both conversation and resource quality were punished harshly, whereas a set of infractions that supported conversation but undermined resource quality were more respectfully removed. We describe a set of conditions under which moderators should intervene in the conversion of conversation to knowledge resource rather than the conversion of lurkers to contributors.},

A central idea is to gradually increase the user's knowledge about the contents, structures, and semantics of the data sources in the dataspace. Without this knowledge, the user is not able to make sophisticated queries. The dataspace systems proposed so far are usually application specific. In contrast, our idea in this paper is to develop an application-independent extensible markup language XML dataspace system with versatile facilities. Unlike the other proposed dataspace systems, we show that it is possible to build an interface based on conventional visual tools in terms of which the user can satisfy his or her sophisticated information needs. In our system, the user does not need to master programming techniques nor the XML syntax, which provides a good starting point for its declarative use.},

Next, we compare these "VQR rankings" with those that would derive from the application of more-appropriate bibliometrics. Finally, we extend the comparison to university rankings based on the entire scientific production for the period, as indexed in the Web of Science.},

The concept of CoPs was originally developed as a social learning theory, and CoPs were defined by their informal emergent nature. This informal nature has been recognized to be of value to organizations, resulting in a desire to design CoPs. In this article, the nature of CoPs is addressed by focusing on aspects of formality and informality in relationships and learning; CoPs are described as emergent and designed practices. Furthermore, it is questioned whether a designed CoP may realize the essential characteristics attributed to an emergent CoP. It is argued that it is crucial to recognize the informal nature of CoPs in order to either encourage them as informal phenomena or to use the concept of CoPs as inspiration for designing imitations of them. However, when attempting to design them, the original meaning of a CoP is lost, even though, in some cases, the consequences of such a design may be beneficial to organizations. Nevertheless, when not taking the nature of a CoP into account, a designed construct may have a negative impact on learning and knowing.},

Our work extends conventional bias research by considering multiple biases occurring simultaneously. Our findings show that the referees' static profiles are more dominant in peer review bias when compared to their dynamic behavioral context. Of the static profiles, self-reported confidence improved both conference fitness and impact-based bias reductions, while factual authority could only contribute to conference fitness-based bias reduction. Our results also clearly show that the reliability of referees' judgments varies along their static profiles and is contingent on the temporal interval between 2 consecutive reviews.},

Kuhlthau's 7-stage Information Search Process ISP model forms the conceptual framework for the study. The aim of the study was to define an end game for the ISP model by answering the following question: How do the student participants' feelings, thoughts, and information behavior lead to the construction of new knowledge? Study findings tentatively indicate that knowledge construction results from an iterative process between the student and information, which can be divided into 3 phases. In the first phase, the students formulate questions from their previous knowledge to start knowledge construction; in the second phase, newly found topic information causes students to ask questions; and in the third phase, the students answer the questions asked by this newly found topic information. Based on these results and Kuhlthau's own ISP stage 7 assessment definition of the ISP model end game, we propose a model of knowledge construction inserted as an extra row in the ISP model framework.},

abstract = {A review is presented of the relation between information and entropy, focusing on two main issues: the similarity of the formal definitions of physical entropy, according to statistical mechanics, and of information, according to information theory; and the possible subjectivity of entropy considered as missing information. The paper updates the 1983 analysis of Shaw and Davis. The difference in the interpretations of information given respectively by Shannon and by Wiener, significant for the information sciences, receives particular consideration. Analysis of a range of material, from literary theory to thermodynamics, is used to draw out the issues. Emphasis is placed on recourse to the original sources, and on direct quotation, to attempt to overcome some of the misunderstandings and oversimplifications that have occurred with these topics. Although it is strongly related to entropy, information is neither identical with it, nor its opposite. Information is related to order and pattern, but also to disorder and randomness. The relations between information and the "interesting complexity," which embodies both patterns and randomness, are worthy of attention.},

Some authors consider that public e-mail services are unprofessional and insecure, whereas others say that, in a dynamically changing working environment, public e-mail addresses allow readers to contact authors long after they have changed their workplace. To shed light on this issue, we analyzed how often authors of scientific papers provided e-mail addresses that were either public or institution based. We selected from the Web of Science database 1,000 frequently cited and 1,000 infrequently cited articles all of the latter were noncited articles published in 2000, 2005, and 2010, and from these we analyzed 26,937 e-mail addresses. The results showed that approximately three fourths of these addresses were institutional, but there was an increasing trend toward using public e-mail addresses over the period studied. No significant differences were found between frequently and infrequently cited papers in this respect. Further research is now needed to access the motivations and perceptions of scholars when it comes to their use of either public or institutional e-mail accounts.},

We argue that the notion of "location" as it manifests itself in location-based systems is being produced as an object of exchange. Here we are specifically concerned with what happens to institutional roles, power relationships, and decision-making processes when a particular type of information-that of spatiotemporal location of people-is made into a technologically tradable object through the use of location-based systems. We examine the introduction of GPS Global Positioning Systems technologies by the California criminal justice system and the institution of parole for monitoring the movements of parolees, with consequences both for the everyday lives of these parolees and the work practices of their parole officers. We document the ways in which broad adoption of location-based and mobile technologies has the capacity to radically reconfigure the spatiotemporal arrangement of institutional processes. The presence of digital location traces creates new forms of institutional accountability, facilitates a shift in the understood relation between location and action, and necessitates new models of interpretation and sense making in practice.},

abstract = {The success or failure of social media is highly dependent on the active participation of its users. In order to examine the influential factors that inspire dynamic and eager participation, this study investigates what motivates social media users to share their personal experiences, information, and social support with anonymous others. A variety of information-sharing activities in social media, including creating postings, photos, and videos in 5 different types of social media: Facebook, Twitter, Delicious, YouTube, and Flickr, were observed. Ten factors: enjoyment, self-efficacy, learning, personal gain, altruism, empathy, social engagement, community interest, reciprocity, and reputation, were tested to identify the motivations of social media users based on reviews of major motivation theories and models. Findings from this study indicate that all of the 10 motivations are influential in encouraging users' information sharing to some degree and strongly correlate with one another. At the same time, motivations differ across the 5 types of social media, given that they deliver different information content and serve different purposes. Understanding such differences in motivations could benefit social media developers and those organizations or institutes that would like to use social media to facilitate communication among their community members; appropriate types of social media could be chosen that would fit their own purposes and they could develop strategies that would encourage their members to contribute to their communities through social media.},

abstract = {This article introduces the Multidimensional Research Assessment Matrix of scientific output. Its base notion holds that the choice of metrics to be applied in a research assessment process depends on the unit of assessment, the research dimension to be assessed, and the purposes and policy context of the assessment. An indicator may by highly useful within one assessment process, but less so in another. For instance, publication counts are useful tools to help discriminate between those staff members who are research active, and those who are not, but are of little value if active scientists are to be compared with one another according to their research performance. This paper gives a systematic account of the potential usefulness and limitations of a set of 10 important metrics, including altmetrics, applied at the level of individual articles, individual researchers, research groups, and institutions. It presents a typology of research impact dimensions and indicates which metrics are the most appropriate to measure each dimension. It introduces the concept of a "meta-analysis" of the units under assessment in which metrics are not used as tools to evaluate individual units, but to reach policy inferences regarding the objectives and general setup of an assessment process.},

These models each have 2 distinct aspects: growth, which is the introduction of new articles, and preferential attachment, which describes how established articles accumulate new citations. The attachment rules are the subtle portion of these models that supply the interesting explanatory power. Previous treatments included both aspects. Here we separate preferential attachment from the growth aspect of the model. This separation allows us to examine the results of the preferential attachment rules without confounding these with growth in the number of articles available to receive citations. We introduce the method using Markov chains. We show how to overcome the mathematical and computational complexity to obtain results. A comparison of Simon's and Price's rules are computed in 3 Journal\"{\i} undefinedCitation\"{\i} undefinedReports subject categories using articles published in the 1960s and allowed to accumulate citations to 1980. This comparison cannot be made through analysis of power laws.},

abstract = {The quality of online health information for consumers has been a critical issue that concerns all stakeholders in healthcare. To gain an understanding of how quality is evaluated, this systematic review examined 165 articles in which researchers evaluated the quality of consumer-oriented health information on the web against predefined criteria. It was found that studies typically evaluated quality in relation to the substance and formality of content, as well as to the design of technological platforms. Attention to design, particularly interactivity, privacy, and social and cultural appropriateness is on the rise, which suggests the permeation of a user-centered perspective into the evaluation of health information systems, and a growing recognition of the need to study these systems from a social-technical perspective. Researchers used many preexisting instruments to facilitate evaluation of the formality of content; however, only a few were used in multiple studies, and their validity was questioned. The quality of content i.e., accuracy and completeness was always evaluated using proprietary instruments constructed based on medical guidelines or textbooks. The evaluation results revealed that the quality of health information varied across medical domains and across websites, and that the overall quality remained problematic. Future research is needed to examine the quality of user-generated content and to explore opportunities offered by emerging new media that can facilitate the consumer evaluation of health information.},

These applications enable communication between people, using features such as chatting and blogging. There is, however, little consideration of the collaboration between people during information seeking. Mobile applications should support the seeking, sharing, confirming, and validating of information systematically to help users complete their tasks and fulfill their information needs. To support information seeking, especially collaboratively as a group, there is a need to understand people's social interaction behavior. Using tourism as a domain, we conducted a diary study to look into tourists' social interaction during information seeking. Further, based on the diary study findings and current research, we describe a set of triggers that lead to collaboration for each step in the information-seeking process. Here we present the social collaboration patterns between tourists and the people around them.

Our results confirm that the presence and density of social media altmetric counts are still very low and not very frequent among scientific publications, with 15%-24% of the publications presenting some altmetric activity and concentrated on the most recent publications, although their presence is increasing over time. Publications from the social sciences, humanities, and the medical and life sciences show the highest presence of altmetrics, indicating their potential value and interest for these fields. The analysis of the relationships between altmetrics and citations confirms previous claims of positive correlations but is relatively weak, thus supporting the idea that altmetrics do not reflect the same kind of impact as citations. Also, altmetric counts do not always present a better filtering of highly-cited publications than journal citation scores. Altmetric scores particularly mentions in blogs are able to identify highly-cited publications with higher levels of precision than journal citation scores JCS, but they have a lower level of recall. The value of altmetrics as a complementary tool of citation analysis is highlighted, although more research is suggested to disentangle the potential meaning and value of altmetric indicators for research evaluation.},

From this theory, it follows that journal editors might employ biased reviewers because they shirk less. This creates an incentive for the editor to use monitoring mechanisms e.g., associate editors supervising the peer review process that mitigate the resulting bias in the reviewers' recommendations. The supervision of associate editors could encourage journal editors to employ more extreme reviewers. This theory helps to explain the presence of bias in peer review. To mitigate shirking by a reviewer, the journal editor may assign biased referees to generate information about the manuscript's quality and subject the reviewer's recommendations to supervision by a more aligned associate editor.},

abstract = {Faced with highly competitive and dynamic environments, organizations are increasingly investing in technologies that provide them with new options for structuring work. At the same time, firms are increasingly dependent on employees' willingness and ability to make sense of novel tasks, problems, and rapidly changing situations. Yet, in spite of its importance, the impact of technology-enabled distributed work arrangements on sensemaking behavior is largely unknown. Sensemaking remains something that is perceived by many to be an idiosyncratic behavior that is, at best, loosely related to sociotechnical context and culture. Drawing on previous studies of cognitive dispositions need for cognition, tendency for decisiveness, intolerance for ambiguity, and close-mindedness and research on how technology-enabled distributed work arrangements affect interpersonal interaction, we theorize how workgroup geographic distribution interacts with individual cognitive differences to affect employees' willingness to engage in the core sociocognitive activities of sensemaking. Our results show that the consequences of individual tendencies can vary under different work arrangements, suggesting that managers seeking to facilitate sensemaking activities must make careful choices about the composition of distributed work groups, as well as how collaboration technologies can be used to encourage sensemaking behaviors.},

Definitions of such measures have ranged from using distance-based calculations over WordNet or other taxonomies to statistical distributional metrics over document collections such as Wikipedia or the Web. Existing measures do not explicitly consider the domain associations of terms when calculating relatedness: This article demonstrates that domain matters. We construct a data set of pairs of terms with associated domain information and extract pairs that are scored nearly identical by a sample of existing semantic-relatedness measures. We show that human judgments reliably score those pairs containing terms from the same domain as significantly more related than cross-domain pairs, even though the semantic-relatedness measures assign the pairs similar scores. We provide further evidence for this result using a machine learning setting by demonstrating that domain is an informative feature when learning a metric. We conclude that existing relatedness measures do not account for domain in the same way or to the same extent as do human judges.},

abstract = {Recent high-profile statements, criticisms, and boycotts organized against certain quantitative indicators e.g., the DORA declaration have brought misuses of performance metrics to the center of attention. A key concern captured in these movements is that the metrics appear to carry authority even where established agents of quality control have explicitly outlined limits to their validity and reliability as measurement tools. This raises a number of challenging questions for those readers of this journal who are implicated in questions of indicator "production" and, by extension, "effects." In this opinion piece we wish to critically engage the question of how producers of indicators can come to terms with their role as partly responsible parties in the current age of evaluative bibliometrics. We do so through the illuminating case of the professional scientometrics community.},

What is the reason behind whether a university places higher or lower in the ranking?

According to our analyses, the bibliometric indicator values of a university depend very strongly on weights that result in differing estimates of both the total number of a university's publications and the number of publications with a citation impact in the 90th percentile, or PPtop 10%. In addition, we examine the effect of weights at the level of individual publications. Based on the results, we offer recommendations for improving the Leiden Ranking for example, publication of sample calculations to increase transparency.},

abstract = {Data occupy a key role in our information society. However, although the amount of published data continues to grow and terms such as data deluge and big data today characterize numerous research initiatives, much work is still needed in the direction of publishing data in order to make them effectively discoverable, available, and reusable by others. Several barriers hinder data publishing, from lack of attribution and rewards, vague citation practices, and quality issues to a rather general lack of a data-sharing culture. Lately, data journals have overcome some of these barriers. In this study of more than 100 currently existing data journals, we describe the approaches they promote for data set description, availability, citation, quality, and open access. We close by identifying ways to expand and strengthen the data journals approach as a means to promote data set access and exploitation.},

To date, the project has proceeded in 2 key phases. First, we developed a bottom-up method for web register classification, asking end users of the web to utilize a decision-tree survey to code relevant situational characteristics of web documents, resulting in a bottom-up identification of register and subregister categories. We present details regarding the development and testing of this method through a series of 10 pilot studies. Then, in the second phase of our project we applied this procedure to a corpus of 53,000 web documents. An analysis of the results demonstrates the effectiveness of these methods for web register classification and provides a preliminary description of the types and distribution of registers on the web.},

We conducted 2 studies and collected 1,247 responses from U.S. households for the first study and 2,064 responses from U.S. households for the second study. Those households that had adopted household technologies were surveyed regarding their use behavior. Potential adopters i.e., those who had currently not adopted were surveyed regarding their purchase intentions. This allowed us to identify the most influential factors affecting a household's decision to adopt and use technologies. The results show that the model of adoption of technology in the household provided the richest explanation and explained best why households purchase and use technologies.},

We address these issues by taking a random representative sample of 1,000 informational and 1,000 navigational queries from a major German search engine and comparing Google's and Bing's results based on this sample. Jurors were found through crowdsourcing, and data were collected using specialized software, the Relevance Assessment Tool RAT. We found that although Google outperforms Bing in both query types, the difference in the performance for informational queries was rather low. However, for navigational queries, Google found the correct answer in 95.3% of cases, whereas Bing only found the correct answer 76.6% of the time. We conclude that search engine performance on navigational queries is of great importance, because users in this case can clearly identify queries that have returned correct results. So, performance on this query type may contribute to explaining user satisfaction with search engines.},

This research explores another possibility-whether there is a "clubbing" effect in China's surge in research citations, in which a higher rate of internal citing takes place among influential Chinese researchers. Focusing on the most highly cited research articles in nanotechnology, we find that a larger proportion of Chinese nanotechnology research citations are localized within individual, institutional, and national networks within China. Both descriptive and statistical tests suggest that highly cited Chinese papers are more likely than similar U.S. papers to receive internal and localized citations. Tentative explanations and policy implications are discussed.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis mainly focuses on the study of one's opinions that express positive or negative sentiments. With the explosive growth of web documents, sentiment analysis is becoming a hot topic in both academic research and system design. Fine-grained sentiment analysis is traditionally solved as a 2-step strategy, which results in cascade errors. Although joint models, such as joint sentiment/topic and maximum entropy MaxEnt/latent Dirichlet allocation, are proposed to tackle this problem of sentiment analysis, they focus on the joint learning of both aspects and sentiments. Thus, they are not appropriate to solve the cascade errors for sentiment analysis at the sentence or subsentence level. In this article, we present a novel jointly fine-grained sentiment analysis framework at the subsentence level with Markov logic. First, we divide the task into 2 separate stages subjectivity classification and polarity classification. Then, the 2 separate stages are processed, respectively, with different feature sets, which are implemented by local formulas in Markov logic. Finally, global formulas in Markov logic are adopted to realize the interactions of the 2 separate stages. The joint inference of subjectivity and polarity helps prevent cascade errors. Experiments on a Chinese sentiment data set manifest that our joint model brings significant improvements.},

Furthermore, very little behavioral research has focused on how personal privacy concerns are related to information disclosures made by one's friends. Our survey study of 116 Facebook users shows that engaging with friends through tagging activity and third-party application use is associated with higher levels of personal Facebook usage and a stronger emotional attachment to Facebook. However, users who have high levels of personal privacy concern and perceive a lack of effectiveness in Facebook's privacy policies tend to engage less frequently in tagging and app activities with friends, respectively. Our model and results explore illustrate the complexity of the trade-off between privacy concerns, engaging with friends through tagging and apps, and Facebook usage.},

abstract = {Archives are invaluable resources for those interested in understanding past activities and events. What makes archival collections valuable as evidence is that they are organized in a way that connects the materials to their creators, their associated activities, and recordkeeping systems. In order to create this organization archivists engage in a complex process that involves arranging materials physically and intellectually. This arrangement focuses on documenting the original order of the materials and making them evident to secondary users. The time-consuming nature of this process has resulted in a massive backlog of unprocessed and thus unavailable collections, which represents an impediment to the investigative activities of scholars and researchers. To help alleviate such a situation, this article presents a novel approach to archival arrangement, using tabletop computers and digitized images. The article explains the project design and implementation and discusses the evaluation results. This work provides several major contributions to the field, including: a new system that allows archival collections to be arranged digitally, new methods and metrics for evaluating archival arrangements, a detailed analysis of the steps involved in archival arrangement and how they correlate with the final outcomes of the process, and a method for analyzing arrangements based on the topologies created by processing archivists.},

abstract = {Crowdsourcing has emerged as a way to harvest social wisdom from thousands of volunteers to perform a series of tasks online. However, little research has been devoted to exploring the impact of various factors such as the content of a resource or crowdsourcing interface design on user tagging behavior. Although images' titles and descriptions are frequently available in image digital libraries, it is not clear whether they should be displayed to crowdworkers engaged in tagging. This paper focuses on offering insight to the curators of digital image libraries who face this dilemma by examining i how descriptions influence the user in his/her tagging behavior and ii how this relates to the a nature of the tags, b the emergent folksonomy, and c the findability of the images in the tagging system. We compared two different methods for collecting image tags from Amazon's Mechanical Turk's crowdworkers-with and without image descriptions. Several properties of generated tags were examined from different perspectives: diversity, specificity, reusability, quality, similarity, descriptiveness, and so on. In addition, the study was carried out to examine the impact of image description on supporting users' information seeking with a tag cloud interface. The results showed that the properties of tags are affected by the crowdsourcing approach. Tags from the "with description" condition are more diverse and more specific than tags from the "without description" condition, while the latter has a higher tag reuse rate. A user study also revealed that different tag sets provided different support for search. Tags produced "with description" shortened the path to the target results, whereas tags produced without description increased user success in the search task.},

abstract = {Subject indexing is an intellectually intensive process that has many inherent uncertainties. Existing manual subject indexing systems generally produce binary outcomes for whether or not to assign an indexing term. This does not sufficiently reflect the extent to which the indexing terms are associated with the documents. On the other hand, the idea of probabilistic or weighted indexing was proposed a long time ago and has seen success in capturing uncertainties in the automatic indexing process. One hurdle to overcome in implementing weighted indexing in manual subject indexing systems is the practical burden that could be added to the already intensive indexing process. This study proposes a method to infer automatically the associations between subject terms and documents through text mining. By uncovering the connections between MeSH descriptors and document text, we are able to derive the weights of MeSH descriptors manually assigned to documents. Our initial results suggest that the inference method is feasible and promising. The study has practical implications for improving subject indexing practice and providing better support for information retrieval.},

Every day, Internet users with similar information needs have the potential to collaborate. However, online search is typically performed in solitude. Existing search systems do not promote explicit collaborations, and collaboration opportunities collabportunities are missed. In this article, we describe a method to evaluate the feasibility of transforming these collabportunities into recommendations for explicit collaboration. We developed a technique called pseudocollaboration to evaluate the benefits and costs of collabportunities through simulations. We evaluate the performance of our method using three data sets: a data from single users' search sessions, b data with collaborative search sessions between pairs of searchers, and c logs from a large-scale search engine with search sessions of thousands of searchers. Our results establish when and how collabportunities would significantly help or hinder the search process versus searches conducted individually. The method that we describe has implications for the design and implementation of recommendation systems for explicit collaboration. It also connects system-mediated and user-mediated collaborative search, whereby the system evaluates the likely benefits of collaborating for a search task and helps searchers make more informed decisions on initiating and executing such a collaboration.},

Using data about people who register in Mendeley as readers of articles, this article explores different types of users of Clinical Medicine, Engineering and Technology, Social Science, Physics, and Chemistry articles inside and outside academia. The majority of readers for all disciplines were PhD students, postgraduates, and postdocs but other types of academics were also represented. In addition, many Clinical Medicine articles were read by medical professionals. The highest correlations between citations and Mendeley readership counts were found for types of users who often authored academic articles, except for associate professors in some sub-disciplines. This suggests that Mendeley readership can reflect usage similar to traditional citation impact if the data are restricted to readers who are also authors without the delay of impact measured by citation counts. At the same time, Mendeley statistics can also reveal the hidden impact of some research articles, such as educational value for nonauthor users inside academia or the impact of research articles on practice for readers outside academia.},

abstract = {Millions of micro texts are published every day on Twitter. Identifying the sentiment present in them can be helpful for measuring the frame of mind of the public, their satisfaction with respect to a product, or their support of a social event. In this context, polarity classification is a subfield of sentiment analysis focused on determining whether the content of a text is objective or subjective, and in the latter case, if it conveys a positive or a negative opinion. Most polarity detection techniques tend to take into account individual terms in the text and even some degree of linguistic knowledge, but they do not usually consider syntactic relations between words. This article explores how relating lexical, syntactic, and psychometric information can be helpful to perform polarity classification on Spanish tweets. We provide an evaluation for both shallow and deep linguistic perspectives. Empirical results show an improved performance of syntactic approaches over pure lexical models when using large training sets to create a classifier, but this tendency is reversed when small training collections are used.},

abstract = {The recent interest in Big Data has generated a broad range of new academic, corporate, and policy practices along with an evolving debate among its proponents, detractors, and skeptics. While the practices draw on a common set of tools, techniques, and technologies, most contributions to the debate come either from a particular disciplinary perspective or with a focus on a domain-specific issue. A close examination of these contributions reveals a set of common problematics that arise in various guises and in different places. It also demonstrates the need for a critical synthesis of the conceptual and practical dilemmas surrounding Big Data. The purpose of this article is to provide such a synthesis by drawing on relevant writings in the sciences, humanities, policy, and trade literature. In bringing these diverse literatures together, we aim to shed light on the common underlying issues that concern and affect all of these areas. By contextualizing the phenomenon of Big Data within larger socioeconomic developments, we also seek to provide a broader understanding of its drivers, barriers, and challenges. This approach allows us to identify attributes of Big Data that require more attention-autonomy, opacity, generativity, disparity, and futurity-leading to questions and ideas for moving beyond dilemmas.},

Previous studies have attempted to infer influence from blog features, but they have ignored the possible influence styles that describe the different ways in which influence is exerted. We propose a novel approach to analyzing bloggers' influence styles and using the influence styles as features to improve the performance of influence diffusion detection among linked bloggers. The proposed influence style INFUSE model describes bloggers' influence through their engagement style, persuasion style, and persona. Methods used include similarity analysis to detect the creating-sharing aspect of engagement style, subjectivity analysis to measure persuasion style, and sentiment analysis to identify persona style. We further extend the INFUSE model to detect influence diffusion among linked bloggers based on the bloggers' influence styles. The INFUSE model performed well with an average F1 score of 76% compared with the in-degree and sentiment-value baseline approaches. Previous studies have focused on the existence of influence among linked bloggers in detecting influence diffusion, but our INFUSE model is shown to provide a fine-grained description of the manner in which influence is diffused based on the bloggers' influence styles.},

abstract = {This paper describes a clustering and authorship attribution study over the State of the Union addresses from 1790 to 2014 224 speeches delivered by 41 presidents. To define the style of each presidency, we have applied a principal component analysis PCA based on the part-of-speech POS frequencies. From Roosevelt 1934, each president tends to own a distinctive style whereas previous presidents tend usually to share some stylistic aspects with others. Applying an automatic classification based on the frequencies of all content-bearing word-types we show that chronology tends to play a central role in forming clusters, a factor that is more important than political affiliation. Using the 300 most frequent word-types, we generate another clustering representation based on the style of each president. This second view shares similarities with the first one, but usually with more numerous and smaller clusters. Finally, an authorship attribution approach for each speech can reach a success rate of around 95.7% under some constraints. When an incorrect assignment is detected, the proposed author often belongs to the same party and has lived during roughly the same time period as the presumed author. A deeper analysis of some incorrect assignments reveals interesting reasons justifying difficult attributions.},

In the first, a user-centered sound design method is used, based on one originally applied for visually impaired users. Three panels of end users are employed to collaboratively and iteratively design the required nonspeech sounds. The method ensures that the sounds designed are not based on designers' personal or ad hoc choices and instead exploits the creativity of a user group as an application of participatory sound design. Based on the results of this study, recommendations are made for extending the sound design method to novel interfaces and sighted users. A second study involves a formative evaluation of the information system integrated with the designed auditory feedback. This evaluation confirms that the user-centered sound design method leads to the creation of auditory feedback which conveys meaningful information to users.},

First we present a conceptual framework for analyzing image topicality, explicating the layers, the perspectives, and the topical relevance relationships involved in modeling the topicality of art images. We adapt a generic relevance typology to image analysis by extending it with definitions and relationships specific to the visual art domain and integrating it with schemes of image-text relationships that are important for image subject indexing. We then apply the adapted typology to analyze the topical relevance relationships between 11 art images and 768 image tags assigned by art historians and librarians. The original contribution of our work is the topical structure analysis of image tags that allows the viewer to more easily grasp the content, context, and meaning of an image and quickly tune into aspects of interest; it could also guide both the indexer and the searcher to specify image tags/descriptors in a more systematic and precise manner and thus improve the match between the two parties. An additional contribution is systematically examining and integrating the variety of image-text relationships from a relevance perspective. The paper concludes with implications for relational indexing and social tagging.},

abstract = {This study explores how the stability of users' preferences influences recommendation results and how this stability relates to the effectiveness of developing recommendation strategies. In this work, we propose an anchor-based hybrid filtering approachAHF to naturally measure and capture the user's preference stabilities for movie genres. That is, a pairwise preference of the genre comparison process with the genre-based fuzzy inference filtering was conducted in order to achieve effective interactive recommendations. To conduct this experiment, we recruited 30 users with different levels of preference stability for movie genres. The experimental results show that the proposed AHF\"{\i} undefinedapproach can effectively capture the user's preferences and filter out undesired movie genres. In addition, this approach can give a more precise recommendation than one without the anchoring process, especially for the user who has unstable preferences for movie genres. Our proposed approach achieves statistical significance and outperforms the baseline method for recommending users' favorite movies by more than 63% for the stable user group and 77% for the unstable group. The results suggest that the stability of users' preferences is a factor to be considered when developing effective recommendation strategies.},

Modeling these dynamic contextual effects is an important challenge facing the research community because it has the potential to lead to more responsive search systems. With this motivation, a study of software engineers was conducted to understand the role that contextual factors play in shaping their information-seeking behavior. Research was conducted in the field in a large technology company and comprised six unstructured interviews, a focus group, and 13 in-depth, semistructured interviews. Qualitative analysis revealed a set of contextual factors and related information behaviors. Results are formalized in the contextual model of source selection, the main contributions of which are the identification of two types of conditioning variables requirements and constraints that mediate between the contextual factors and source-selection decisions, and the articulation of dominant source-selection patterns. The study has implications for the design of context-sensitive search systems in this domain and may inform contextual approaches to information seeking in other professional domains.},

abstract = {The motivation for this study was to better understand academics' searching and sensemaking processes when solving exploratory tasks for which they lack pre-existing frames. We focus on "influence" tasks because, although they appear to be unfamiliar, they arise in much academic discourse, at least tacitly. We report the processes of academics at different levels of seniority when completing exploratory search tasks that involved identifying influential members of their academic community and "rising stars," and similarly for an unfamiliar academic community. 11 think-aloud sessions followed by semi-structured interviews were conducted to investigate the roles of specific and general domain expertise in shaping information seeking and knowledge construction. Academics defined and completed the tasks through an iterative and interactive process of seeking and sensemaking, during which they constructed an understanding of their communities and determined qualities of "being influential". The Data/Frame Theory of Sensemaking was used to provide sensitising theoretical constructs. The study shows that both external and internal knowledge resources are essential to define a starting point or frame, make and support decisions, and experience satisfaction. Ill-defined or non-existent initial frames may cause unsubstantial or arbitrary decisions, and feelings of uncertainty and lack of confidence.},

abstract = {Deciding whether a claim is true or false often requires a deeper understanding of the evidence supporting and contradicting the claim. However, when presented with many evidence documents, users do not necessarily read and trust them uniformly. Psychologists and other researchers have shown that users tend to follow and agree with articles and sources that hold viewpoints similar to their own, a phenomenon known as confirmation bias. This suggests that when learning about a controversial topic, human biases and viewpoints about the topic may affect what is considered "trustworthy" or credible. It is an interesting challenge to build systems that can help users overcome this bias and help them decide the truthfulness of claims. In this article, we study various factors that enable humans to acquire additional information about controversial claims in an unbiased fashion. Specifically, we designed a user study to understand how presenting evidence with contrasting viewpoints and source expertise ratings affect how users learn from the evidence documents. We find that users do not seek contrasting viewpoints by themselves, but explicitly presenting contrasting evidence helps them get a well-rounded understanding of the topic. Furthermore, explicit knowledge of the credibility of the sources and the context in which the source provides the evidence document not only affects what users read but also whether they perceive the document to be credible.},

This model is challenged by modern search engines and information retrieval IR researchers, who often consider Boolean retrieval a less efficient approach. The paper examines this claim and argues for the continued value of Boolean systems, and suggests two further considerations: a the important role of human expertise in searching expert searchers and "information literate" users and b the role of library and information science and knowledge organization KO in the design and use of classical databases. An underlying issue is the kind of retrieval system for which one should aim. Warner's 2010 differentiation between the computer science traditions and an older library-oriented tradition seems important; the former aim to transform queries automatically into ranked sets of relevant documents, whereas the latter aims to increase the "selection power" of users. The Boolean retrieval model is valuable in providing users with the power to make informed searches and have full control over what is found and what is not. These issues may have significant implications for the maintenance of information science and KO as research fields as well as for the information profession as a profession in its own right.},

To assess the extent to which these countries have become important players at the top level, we compare the BRICS countries with the top-performing countries worldwide. As the analyses of the annual growth rates show, with the exception of Russia, the BRICS countries have increased their output in terms of most frequently cited papers at a higher rate than the top-cited countries worldwide. By way of additional analysis, we generate coauthorship networks among authors of highly cited papers for 4 time points to view changes in BRICS participation 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010. Here, the results show that all BRICS countries succeeded in becoming part of this network, whereby the Chinese collaboration activities focus on the US.},

abstract = {Citizen science, or crowd science, or volunteer science, has increased in the last 4-5 years, with an accompanying increase in the literature. The main argument in such literature is that citizen science has many advantages, not only for scientists and the science that is produced, but also for the participating citizens. As a result of this line of reasoning, the main issue becomes: How we can facilitate citizen science, and help it expand to more projects, and involve more types of participants? My aim in this opinion paper is to make 2 points: First, that most recent work on citizen science fails to elaborate on the new types of relationships, practices, and interactions that are facilitated by information and communication technologies, when compared to traditional volunteer science. The second point is that there are pronounced disciplinary differences among citizen science projects, something that, again, is generally being missed in much recent work. Missing these points can lead us to imagine that it's only a matter of time and of course funding before all sciences catch up with citizen science. Such a line of thought can result in investing resources money, time, effort in projects and infrastructures that are doomed to fail, because of their topic or field of research. I conclude by offering some thoughts on a research agenda.},

abstract = {In this global information age, accessing, disseminating, and controlling information is an increasingly important aspect of human life. Often, these interests are expressed in the language of human rights-for example, rights to expression, privacy, and intellectual property. As the discipline concerned with "facilitating the effective communication of desired information between human generator and human user" Belkin, 1975, p. 22, library and information science LIS has a central role in facilitating communication about human rights and ensuring the respect for human rights in information services and systems. This paper surveys the literature at the intersection of LIS and human rights. To begin, an overview of human rights conventions and an introduction to human rights theory is provided. Then the intersections between LIS and human rights are considered. Three central areas of informational human rights-communication, privacy, and intellectual property-are discussed in detail. It is argued that communication rights in particular serve as a central linchpin in the system of human rights.},

abstract = {Twitter as a potential alternative source of external links for use in webometric analysis is analyzed because of its capacity to embed hyperlinks in different tweets. Given the limitations on searching Twitter's public application programming interface API, we used the Topsy search engine as a source for compiling tweets. To this end, we took a global sample of 200 universities and compiled all the tweets with hyperlinks to any of these institutions. Further link data was obtained from alternative sources MajesticSEO and OpenSiteExplorer in order to compare the results. Thereafter, various statistical tests were performed to determine the correlation between the indicators and the possibility of predicting external links from the collected tweets. The results indicate a high volume of tweets, although they are skewed by the performance of specific universities and countries. The data provided by Topsy correlated significantly with all link indicators, particularly with OpenSiteExplorer r=0.769. Finally, prediction models do not provide optimum results because of high error rates. We conclude that the use of Twitter via Topsy as a source of hyperlinks to universities produces promising results due to its high correlation with link indicators, though limited by policies and culture regarding use and presence in social networks.},

abstract = {Serendipity is not an easy word to define. Its meaning has been stretched to apply to experiences ranging from the mundane to the exceptional. Serendipity, however, is consistently associated with unexpected and positive personal, scholarly, scientific, organizational, and societal events and discoveries. Diverse serendipitous experiences share a conceptual space; therefore, what lessons can we draw from an exploration of how serendipity unfolds and what may influence it? This article describes an investigation of work-related serendipity. Twelve professionals and academics from a variety of fields were interviewed. The core of the semi-structured interviews focused on participants' own work-related experiences that could be recalled and discussed in depth. This research validated and augmented prior research while consolidating previous models of serendipity into a single model of the process of serendipity, consisting of: Trigger, Connection, Follow-up, and Valuable Outcome, and an Unexpected Thread that runs through 1 or more of the first 4 elements. Together, the elements influence the Perception of Serendipity. Furthermore, this research identified what factors relating to the individual and their environment may facilitate the main elements of serendipity and further influence its perception.},

abstract = {Calls for interdisciplinary collaboration have become increasingly common in the face of large-scale complex problems including climate change, economic inequality, and education, among others; however, outcomes of such collaborations have been mixed, due, among other things, to the so-called "translation problem" in interdisciplinary research. This article presents a potential solution: an empirical approach to quantitatively measure both the degree and nature of differences among disciplinary tongues through the social and epistemic terms used a research area we refer to as discourse epistemetrics, in a case study comparing dissertations in philosophy, psychology, and physics. Using a support-vector model of machine learning to classify disciplines based on relative frequencies of social and epistemic terms, we were able to markedly improve accuracy over a random selection baseline distinguishing between disciplines with as high as 90% accuracy as well as acquire sets of most indicative terms for each discipline by their relative presence or absence. These lists were then considered in light of findings of sociological and epistemological studies of disciplines and found to validate the approach's measure of social and epistemic disciplinary identities and contrasts. Based on the findings of our study, we conclude by considering the beneficiaries of research in this area, including bibliometricians, students, and science policy makers, among others, as well as laying out a research program that expands the number of disciplines, considers shifts in socio-epistemic identities over time and applies these methods to nonacademic epistemological communities e.g., political groups.},

This has led to the perception by some that thesauri are ontologies once they are described by using the syntax of OWL while others have emphasized the need to re-engineer a vocabulary to use it as ontology. This confusion is rooted in different perceptions of what ontologies are and how they differ from other types of vocabularies. In this article, we rigorously examine the structural differences and similarities between thesauri and meaning-defining ontologies described in OWL. Specifically, we conduct a a conceptual comparison of thesauri and ontologies, and b a comparison of a specific thesaurus and a specific ontology in the same subject field. Our results show that thesauri and ontologies need to be treated as 2 orthogonal kinds of models with superficially similar structures. An ontology is not a good thesaurus, nor is a thesaurus a good ontology. A thesaurus requires significant structural and other content changes to become an ontology, and vice versa.},

Using both resources, we have created a unique relational database designed to compare citation counts to books with international library holdings or libcitations for scholarly book publishers. First, we construct a ranking of the top 500 publishers and explore descriptive statistics at the level of publisher type university, commercial, other and country of origin. We then identify the top 50 university presses and commercial houses based on total citations and mean citations per book CPB. In a third analysis, we present a map of directed citation links between journals and book publishers. American and British presses/publishing houses tend to dominate the work of library collection managers and citing scholars; however, a number of specialist publishers from Europe are included. Distinct clusters from the directed citation map indicate a certain degree of regionalism and subject specialization, where some journals produced in languages other than English tend to cite books published by the same parent press. Bibliometric rankings convey only a small part of how the actual structure of the publishing field has evolved; hence, challenges lie ahead for developers of new citation indices for books and bibliometricians interested in measuring book and publisher impacts.},

The results demonstrate that an increase in the number of authors leads to an increase in impact, from the beginning of the last century onward, and that this is not due simply to self-citations. A similar trend is also observed for the number of addresses and number of countries represented in the byline of an article. However, the constant inflation of collaboration since 1900 has resulted in diminishing citation returns: Larger and more diverse in terms of institutional and country affiliation teams are necessary to realize higher impact. The article concludes with a discussion of the potential causes of the impact gain in citations of collaborative papers.},

Author keyword co-occurrence data have been used for building a similarity measure between keywords, plus cluster analysis for revealing the main WR research being addressed by the scientific community. Results have been further analyzed using advanced visualization tools to determine which clusters formed strongly-linked research areas that could set the main cognitive divisions of WR science. This process has been repeated with 2002 and 2012 data, and science maps reflecting the main research areas and clusters have been generated. Results show that WR mainly deals with the recovery of basic, widely used raw materials like water and fertile soil. Energy generation and waste management are other relevant fields that show an interesting evolution, revealing signs of growth in research, together with the emergence of sub-areas reflecting consolidating research specialties.},

In the course of the research, the findings revealed that, not only did participants exchange valuable information and helpful social support, there was often little separation between the two, with each overlaying the other throughout most interactions. Expressions of support permeated many informational messages and at the same time served as information to participants. This article argues that social support and information were inextricably connected within participant interactions and that social support is, itself, a form of information that impacts actions and emotional experiences, contributing to participants being able to make sense of their experiences and to move forward both physically and emotionally. This research builds on work in information science that looks at the ways in which people exchange information in informal environments and extends that research by drawing on conceptualizations of social support to exhibit the connections between social support and information.},

The study also compares the associations between the factors and uploading intentions of two different cultures, the United States and South Korea. Using data from surveys of college students from the two countries n=249 and 173, structural equation modeling analyses revealed that ego involvement not only plays an essential role in explaining uploading intention but also functions as an antecedent of attitude and perceived behavioral control in both countries. However, the subjective norm was not significantly associated with uploading intention in either country, and the descriptive norm was a marginally significant factor in accounting for uploading intention in the United States. Moreover, it was found that, only in the United States, attitude was significantly associated with uploading intention, whereas perceived behavioral control was a significant factor in explaining uploading intention in both countries. These findings suggest that the effects of cultural differences, the impact of subjective norms in particular, may be weakened with the more self-oriented nature of Web 2.0 applications and social media such as Wikipedia.

We, instead, investigate online community defections, their cause, and their impact through an empirical investigation of defections from Wikipedia. Our research uses justice theory to determine the effects of injustice perceptions on contributor defections and draws on fairness heuristic theory to distinguish the relative effects of distributive injustice and procedural injustice. The results show that perceptions of injustice concerning collaboration outcomes "distributive injustice" raise contributor dissatisfaction, which in turn leads to defection. Perceptions of injustice concerning the process "procedural injustice", by comparison, have a direct impact on defections and exert a stronger influence on dissatisfaction than distributive injustice. Justice emerges as a hygiene factor adding to the level of dissatisfaction among dissatisfied contributors but not among satisfied contributors. The findings contribute to our understanding of collaborative knowledge creation by drawing attention to contributors' post hoc passive emotions and behaviors instead of predominantly investigating their initial prosharing behaviors. The work also has practical implications for community governance because it suggests how to sustain communities in the long term.},

At the same time, the literature demonstrates a common understanding that paradigmatic relations are the kinds of semantic relations used in thesauri and other knowledge organization systems including equivalence relations, hierarchical relations, and associative relations. This understanding is problematic and harmful because it directs attention away from the empirical and contextual basis for knowledge-organizing systems. Whether A is a kind of X is certainly not context-free and definitional in empirical sciences or in much everyday information. Semantic relations are theory-dependent and, in biology, for example, a scientific revolution has taken place in which many relations have changed following the new taxonomic paradigm named "cladism." This biological example is not an exception, but the norm. Semantic relations including paradigmatic relations are not a priori but are dependent on subject knowledge, scientific findings, and paradigms.

The study resulted in a user-generated framework for designing affordances on social media sites to counter acts of cyberbullying. Seven emergent design themes are evident in the participants' cyberbullying narratives: design for hesitation, design for consequence, design for empathy, design for personal empowerment, design for fear, design for attention, and design for control and suppression. We conclude with a typological analysis of the values present in the participants' design recommendations, applying Cheng and Fleischman's values framework 2010.},

Our work was undertaken in the context of a new design concept, "Privacy Trends", whose aspiration is to foster technology users' digital literacy regarding ongoing privacy risks and elucidate how such risks fit within existing social, organizational, and political systems, leading to a longer-term privacy concern. Our study reveals 2 challenges for privacy intervention design: the need to develop technology users' intrinsic motivations with the privacy domain and the importance of framing the concept of privacy within users' interests. Setting our study within a design context enables us to identify 4 design opportunities for fostering engagement with the privacy domain through technology design.},

abstract = {Search result diversification is one of the key techniques to cope with the ambiguous and underspecified information needs of web users. In the last few years, strategies that are based on the explicit knowledge of query aspects emerged as highly effective ways of diversifying search results. Our contributions in this article are two-fold. First, we extensively evaluate the performance of a state-of-the-art explicit diversification strategy and pin-point its potential weaknesses. We propose basic yet novel optimizations to remedy these weaknesses and boost the performance of this algorithm. As a second contribution, inspired by the success of the current diversification strategies that exploit the relevance of the candidate documents to individual query aspects, we cast the diversification problem into the problem of ranking aggregation. To this end, we propose to materialize the re-rankings of the candidate documents for each query aspect and then merge these rankings by adapting the score-based and rank-based aggregation methods. Our extensive experimental evaluations show that certain ranking aggregation methods are superior to existing explicit diversification strategies in terms of diversification effectiveness. Furthermore, these ranking aggregation methods have lower computational complexity than the state-of-the-art diversification strategies.},

abstract = {In scientometrics, citer behavior is traditionally investigated using one of two main approaches. According to the normative point of view, the behavior of scientists is regulated by norms that make the detection of citation patterns useful for the interpretation of bibliometric measures. According to the constructivist perspective, citer behavior is influenced by other factors linked to the social and/or psychological sphere that do not allow any statistical inferences that are useful for the purposes of interpretation. An intermediate position supports normative theories in describing citer behavior with respect to high citation frequencies and constructivist theories with respect to low citation counts. In this paper, this idea was tested in a case study of the Italian sociology community. Italian sociology is characterized by an unusual organization into three "political" or "ideological" camps, and belonging to one camp can be considered a potentially strong constructivist reason to cite. An all-author co-citation analysis was performed to map the structure of the Italian sociology community and look for evidence of three camps. We did not expect to find evidence of this configuration in the co-citation map. The map, in fact, included authors who obtained high citation counts that are supposedly produced by a normative-oriented behavior. The results confirmed this hypothesis and showed that the clusters seemed to be divided according to topic and not by camp. Relevant scientific works were cited by the members of the entire community regardless of their membership in any particular camp.},

abstract = {International collaboration tends to result in more highly cited research and, partly as a result of this, many research funding schemes are specifically international in scope. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether this citation advantage is the result of higher quality research or due to other factors, such as a larger audience for the publications. To test whether the apparent advantage of internationally collaborative research may be due to additional interest in articles from the countries of the authors, this article assesses the extent to which the national affiliations of the authors of articles affect the national affiliations of their Mendeley readers. Based on English-language Web of Science articles in 10 fields from science, medicine, social science, and the humanities, the results of statistical models comparing author and reader affiliations suggest that, in most fields, Mendeley users are disproportionately readers of articles authored from within their own country. In addition, there are several cases in which Mendeley users from certain countries tend to ignore articles from specific other countries, although it is not clear whether this reflects national biases or different national specialisms within a field. In conclusion, research funders should not incentivize international collaboration on the basis that it is, in general, higher quality because its higher impact may be primarily due to its larger audience. Moreover, authors should guard against national biases in their reading to select only the best and most relevant publications to inform their research.},

The firm level data were aggregated at the levels of 8 Federal Districts, the regional level of 83 Federal Subjects, and the single level of the Russian Federation. Not surprisingly, the knowledge base of the economy is concentrated in the Moscow region 22.8% and Saint Petersburg 4.0%. Except in Moscow itself, high-tech manufacturing does not add synergy to any other unit at any of the various levels of geographical granularity; instead it disturbs regional coordination. Knowledge-intensive services KIS; including laboratories contribute to the synergy in all Federal Districts except the North-Caucasian Federal District, but only in 30 of the 83 Federal Subjects. The synergy in KIS is concentrated in centers of administration. The knowledge-intensive services which are often state affiliated provide backbone to an emerging knowledge-based economy at the level of Federal Districts, but the economy is otherwise not knowledge based except for the Moscow region.},

By rooting my analysis in the experiences of transnational newcomers to New York, my investigation is directed both at library and information science LIS scholarship in transnational experience and urban informatics as an area of study. The findings section first addresses participants' practices for becoming familiar with their surroundings as embedded in everyday routines using Bergson's 1911 construct of habits as a means of organizing stimulus. I then develop an analysis of wandering, which emerged as an information practice used by participants to become familiar with their neighborhoods. Building on these themes, I suggest implications for human information behavior theory, arguing that LIS scholars should articulate more clearly and across a wider range of disciplines the concepts of mobile and ubiquitous technologies.},

Fully automated cross-language person-name linking experiments with 20 non-English languages yielded a resolution accuracy of between 0.84 Serbian and 0.98 Romanian, which compares favorably with previously reported cross-language entity linking results for Spanish.},

Existing research mainly focuses on the ways in which SNSs are used in libraries and on librarians' or users' attitudes towards these SNSs. This study focused on the flow of information via SNS interactions between librarians and users on library Facebook, Twitter, and Chinese Weibo sites, and developed an SNS user interaction type model based on these information flows. A mixed-method approach was employed combining quantitative data generated from the analysis of 1,753 posts sampled from 40 library SNSs and qualitative data from interviews with 10 librarians. Four types of interactions were identified: information/knowledge sharing, information dissemination, communication, and information gathering. The study found that SNSs were used primarily as channels for disseminating news and announcements about things currently happening in the library. Communication allowed open-ended questions and produced more replies. In Facebook posts, Chinese Facebook users generated less "likes" than English-speaking users. The comparison of data between Facebook-like and Twitter-like SNSs in different library settings suggested that libraries need to coordinate different types of SNSs, and take library settings and sociocultural environments into consideration in order to enhance and encourage user engagement and interaction.},

In this article, we study the example of adverse selection of reviewers when a potential referee whose ability is his private information faces a finite sequence of review processes for several scholarly journals, one after the other. Our editor's problem is to design a system that guarantees that each manuscript is reviewed by a referee if and only if the reviewer's ability matches the review's complexity. As is typically the case in solving problems of adverse selection in agency theory, the journal editor offers a menu of contracts to the potential referee, from which the reviewer chooses the contract that is best for him given his ability. The optimal contract will be the one that provides the right incentives to match the complexity of the review and the ability of the reviewer. The payment of contracts is made through a proportional increment of the reviewer factor, which measures the importance of reviewers to their field.},

The methods and resulting findings are presented and structured according to generalized phases of existing information seeking models, which include the needs, actions, and assessments of users. A review of visual information needs focuses on need and thus query formulation; user actions, as reviewed, centers on search and browse behaviors and the observed trends, concluded by a survey of users' assessments of visual information as part of the interactive process. This separate examination, specific to a visual context, is significant; visual information can influence outcomes in an interactive process and presents variations in the types of needs, tasks, considerations, and decisions of users, as compared to information seeking in other contexts.},

The frequency distribution of disciplines by citing articles provides a signature for a cited journal that permits it to be compared with other journals using similarity comparison techniques. As an initial exploration, citing discipline data for 40 high-impact-factor journals assigned to the "information science and library science" category of the Web of Science were compared across 5 time periods. Similarity relationships were determined using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to compare the outcomes produced by the proposed citing discipline and established cocitation methods. The maps and clustering outcomes reveal that a number of journals in allied areas of the information science and library science category may not be very closely related to each other or may not be appropriately situated in the category studied. The citing discipline similarity data resulted in similar outcomes with the cocitation data but with some notable differences. Because the citing discipline method relies on a citing perspective different from cocitations, it may provide a complementary way to compare journal similarity that is less labor intensive than cocitation analysis.},

Nevertheless, to evaluate more fully the value of blog citations, it is necessary to investigate whether research blogs focus on particular types of articles or give new perspectives on scientific discourse. Therefore, we studied the characteristics of peer-reviewed references in blogs and the typical content of blog posts to gain insight into bloggers' motivations. The sample consisted of 391 blog posts from 2010 to 2012 in Researchblogging.org's health category. The bloggers mostly cited recent research articles or reviews from top multidisciplinary and general medical journals. Using content analysis methods, we created a general classification scheme for blog post content with 10 major topic categories, each with several subcategories. The results suggest that health research bloggers rarely self-cite and that the vast majority of their blog posts 90% include a general discussion of the issue covered in the article, with more than one quarter providing health-related advice based on the articles covered. These factors suggest a genuine attempt to engage with a wider, nonacademic audience. Nevertheless, almost 30% of the posts included some criticism of the issues being discussed.},

abstract = {Offensive Internet chats, particularly the child-exploiting type, tend to follow a documented psychological behavioral pattern. Researchers have identified some important stages in this pattern. The psychological stages broadly include befriending, information exchange, grooming, and approach. Similarities among the posts of a chat play an important role in differentiating as well as in identifying these stages. In this article a novel similarity measure is constructed which gives high Inter-post-similarity among the chat-posts within a particular behavioral stage and low inter-post-similarity across different behavioral stages. A psychological stage corpus-based dictionary is constructed from mining the terms associated with each stage. The dictionary works as a background knowledge-base to support the similarity measure. To find the inter-post similarity a modified sentence similarity measure is used. The proposed measure gives improved recognition of inter-stage and intra-stage similarity among the chat posts compared with other types of similarity measures. The pairwise inter-post similarity is used for clustering chat-posts into the psychological stages. Results of experiments demonstrate that the new clustering method gives better results than some current clustering methods.},

Using a single year e.g., 2012, results can be compared with mappings based on the Journal Citation Reports at the Web of Science N=10,936. The Scopus maps are more detailed at both the local and global levels because of their greater coverage, including, for example, the arts and humanities. The base maps can be interactively overlaid with journal distributions in sets downloaded from Scopus, for example, for the purpose of portfolio analysis. Rao-Stirling diversity can be used as a measure of interdisciplinarity in the sets under study. Maps at the global and the local level, however, can be very different because of the different levels of aggregation involved. Two journals, for example, can both belong to the humanities in the global map, but participate in different specialty structures locally.

Like Academia.edu, it provides a new way for scholars to disseminate their work and hence potentially changes the dynamics of informal scholarly communication. This article assesses whether ResearchGate usage and publication data broadly reflect existing academic hierarchies and whether individual countries are set to benefit or lose out from the site. The results show that rankings based on ResearchGate statistics correlate moderately well with other rankings of academic institutions, suggesting that ResearchGate use broadly reflects the traditional distribution of academic capital. Moreover, while Brazil, India, and some other countries seem to be disproportionately taking advantage of ResearchGate, academics in China, South Korea, and Russia may be missing opportunities to use ResearchGate to maximize the academic impact of their publications.},

As per other ISP model studies, our study measured the evolution of the feelings, thoughts, and actions of the study participants over the 3-month period of their class project. The unique feature of this study is the unlimited access the researchers had to a real-life history class, resulting in 12 separate measuring periods. We report 2 important findings of the study. First, through factor analysis, we determined 5 factors that define the temporality of completing an inquiry-based project for these grade 8 students. The second main finding is the importance of the students' consultations with their classmates, siblings, parents, and teachers in the construction of the knowledge necessary to complete their project.},

We looked at one aspect of the interactions between reviewers and authors, the use of politeness in reviewers' comments. Drawing on Brown and Levinson's 1987 politeness theory, we analyzed how politeness strategies were employed by reviewers to mitigate their criticisms in an open peer-review process of a special track of a human-computer interaction conference. We found evidence of frequent use of politeness strategies and that open peer-review processes hold unique challenges and opportunities for using politeness strategies. Our findings revealed that less experienced researchers tended to express unmitigated criticism more often than did experienced researchers, and that reviewers tended to use more positive politeness strategies e.g., compliments toward less experienced authors. Based on our findings, we discuss implications for research communities and the design of peer-reviewing processes and the information systems that support them.},

This article clarifies whether faceted search improves the interactions between searchers and library catalogs and sheds light on ways that facets are used during a library search. To study searchers' behaviors in natural situations, we collected from the servers a data set with more than 1.5 million useful search logs. Logs were parsed, statistically analyzed, and manually studied using visualization tools to gain a general understanding of how facets are used in the search process. A user experiment with 24 subjects was conducted to further understand contextual information, such as the searchers' motivations and perceptions. The results indicate that most searchers were able to understand the concept of facets naturally and easily. The faceted search was not able to shorten the search time but was able to improve the search accuracy. Facets were used more for open-ended tasks and difficult tasks that require more effort to learn, investigate, and explore. Overall, the results weaved a detailed "story" about the ways that people use facets and the ways that facets help people use library catalogs.},

To fill this gap, we explore the populations of academics who engage in social activities using an ASNS; as an indicator of further engagement, we also determine their various motivations for joining a group in ASNSs. Using groups and their members in Mendeley as the platform for our case study, we obtained 146 participant responses from our online survey about users' common activities, usage habits, and motivations for joining groups. Our results show that a participants did not engage with social-based features as frequently and actively as they engaged with research-based features, and b users who joined more groups seemed to have a stronger motivation to increase their professional visibility and to contribute the research articles that they had read to the group reading list. Our results generate interesting insights into Mendeley's user populations, their activities, and their motivations relative to the social features of Mendeley. We also argue that further design of ASNSs is needed to take greater account of disciplinary differences in scholarly communication and to establish incentive mechanisms for encouraging user participation.},

In this article, we study the generation of query-biased summaries as a sentence ranking approach, and methods to evaluate their effectiveness. Using sentence-level relevance assessments from the TREC Novelty track, we gauge the benefits of query expansion to minimize the vocabulary mismatch problem between informational requests and sentence ranking methods. Our results from an intrinsic evaluation show that query expansion significantly improves the selection of short relevant sentences 5-13 words between 7% and 11%. However, query expansion does not lead to improvements for sentences of medium 14-20 words and long 21-29 words lengths. In a separate crowdsourcing study, we analyze whether a summary composed of sentences ranked using query expansion was preferred over summaries not assisted by query expansion, rather than assessing sentences individually. We found that participants chose summaries aided by query expansion around 60% of the time over summaries using an unexpanded query. We conclude that query expansion techniques can benefit the selection of sentences for the construction of query-biased summaries at the summary level rather than at the sentence ranking level.},

abstract = {In recent years, technological innovation has re-ignited an interest in privacy as designers, policy makers, and users each strive to reconcile the advantages of technology with the new demands they pose for privacy. Driven by a classic approach to defining concepts, scholars have not been able to agree on a unified definition of privacy. This poses a barrier to those who seek to implement privacy through their decisions. A critical component of their work involves anticipating and responding to potential privacy risks. In choosing one definition over another, practitioners might be missing nuanced contextual overlaps that bear on privacy and thus bias their subsequent decisions. For these practical endeavors, it is important to adopt an inclusive and rich definition. Such a definition should also be responsive to how those affected by decisions that might compromise privacy, namely citizens and technology users, conceive of privacy. The present paper applies a prototype perspective on privacy that acknowledges the fuzziness of concepts and goes on to develop such a definition in a series of empirical studies. The relevance of the privacy prototype is then explored as it applies to privacy theorists, practitioners, and methodologists, suggesting new avenues for future research.},

Predicting a user's knowledge level from implicit evidence such as search behaviors could allow an adaptive information retrieval system to better personalize its interaction with users. This study examines whether user domain knowledge can be predicted from search behaviors by applying a regression modeling analysis method. We identify behavioral features that contribute most to a successful prediction model. A user experiment was conducted with 40 participants searching on task topics in the domain of genomics. Participant domain knowledge level was assessed based on the users' familiarity with and expertise in the search topics and their knowledge of MeSH Medical Subject Headings terms in the categories that corresponded to the search topics. Users' search behaviors were captured by logging software, which includes querying behaviors, document selection behaviors, and general task interaction behaviors. Multiple regression analysis was run on the behavioral data using different variable selection methods. Four successful predictive models were identified, each involving a slightly different set of behavioral variables. The models were compared for the best on model fit, significance of the model, and contributions of individual predictors in each model. Each model was validated using the split sampling method. The final model highlights three behavioral variables as domain knowledge level predictors: the number of documents saved, the average query length, and the average ranking position of the documents opened. The results are discussed, study limitations are addressed, and future research directions are suggested.},

Contextual relationships of URL categories are learned by the hidden Markov model. The top-level domains TLDs extracted from URLs themselves and the corresponding categories are caught by the TLD model. Given a URL to be predicted, its TLD and current context are empirically combined in an aggregation model. In addition to the uses of the current context, the predictions of the URL accessed previously in different contexts by various users are also considered by majority rule to improve the aggregation model. Large-scale experiments show that the advanced aggregation approach achieves promising performance while maintaining an acceptably low false positive rate. Different strategies are introduced to integrate the model with the blacklist it generates for filtering objectionable web pages without analyzing their content. In practice, this is complementary to the existing content analysis from users' behavioral perspectives.},

We use rhetorical structure theory RST as the analytic framework to identify systematic differences between deceptive and truthful stories in terms of their coherence and structure. A sample of 36 elicited personal stories, self-ranked as truthful or deceptive, is manually analyzed by assigning RST discourse relations among each story's constituent parts. A vector space model VSM assesses each story's position in multidimensional RST space with respect to its distance from truthful and deceptive centers as measures of the story's level of deception and truthfulness. Ten human judges evaluate independently whether each story is deceptive and assign their confidence levels 360 evaluations total, producing measures of the expected human ability to recognize deception. As a robustness check, a test sample of 18 truthful stories with 180 additional evaluations is used to determine the reliability of our RST-VSM method in determining deception. The contribution is in demonstration of the discourse structure analysis as a significant method for automated deception detection and an effective complement to lexicosemantic analysis. The potential is in developing novel discourse-based tools to alert information users to potential deception in computer-mediated texts.},

This article addresses one aspect of page design, testing whether a horizontal or vertical contents arrangement facilitates faster access to content for people with learning disabilities. Participants were timed as they looked for one-word "dummy" menu entries appearing in various locations along a horizontal or vertical grid. The words corresponded to images shown at random in a word-search type activity. Results were analyzed using mixed effects models. Results showed that mean search times increased as the position shifted from left to right and from top to bottom. Thus, participants undertook the test as if it were a reading exercise, despite the images appearing in the center of the page and the words appearing at random positions.

abstract = {The Internet Movie Database IMDb is one of the most-visited websites in the world and the premier source for information on films. Similar to Wikipedia, much of IMDb's information is user contributed. IMDb also allows users to voice their opinion on the quality of films through voting. We investigate whether there is a connection between user voting data and economic film characteristics. We perform distribution and correlation analysis on a set of films chosen to mitigate effects of bias due to the language and country of origin of films. Production budget, box office gross, and total number of user votes for films are consistent with double-log normal distributions for certain time periods. Both total gross and user votes are consistent with a double-log normal distribution from the late 1980s onward while for budget it extends from 1935 to 1979. In addition, we find a strong correlation between number of user votes and the economic statistics, particularly budget. Remarkably, we find no evidence for a correlation between number of votes and average user rating. Our results suggest that total user votes is an indicator of a film's prominence or notability, which can be quantified by its promotional costs.},

It points out, initially, that such aspirations are similar to the now-discredited inductivist approach to science. On the positive side, Big Data may permit larger sample sizes, cheaper and more extensive testing of theories, and the continuous assessment of theories. On the negative side, data-driven science encourages passive data collection, as opposed to experimentation and testing, and hornswoggling "unsound statistical fiddling". The roles of theory and data in inductive algorithms, statistical modeling, and scientific discoveries are analyzed, and it is argued that theory is needed at every turn. Data-driven science is a chimera.},

Entity type models contain sets of patterns aiming to capture the ways geo-located entities are described in natural language. They are automatically derived from texts about geo-located entities of the same type e.g., churches, lakes. We integrate entity type models into a multi-document summarizer and use them to address the 2 major tasks in extractive multi-document summarization: sentence scoring and summary composition. We experiment with 3 different representation methods for entity type models: signature words, n-gram language models, and dependency patterns. We evaluate the summarizer with integrated entity type models relative to a a summarizer using standard text-related features commonly used in text summarization and b the Wikipedia location descriptions. Our results show that entity type models significantly improve the quality of output summaries over that of summaries generated using standard summarization features and Wikipedia summaries. The representation of entity type models using dependency patterns is superior to the representations using signature words and n-gram language models.},

abstract = {We sought to understand how users interpret meanings of symbols commonly used in information systems, especially how icons are processed by the brain. We investigated Chinese and English speakers' processing of 4 types of visual stimuli: icons, pictures, Chinese characters, and English words. The goal was to examine, via functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI data, the hypothesis that people cognitively process icons as logographic words and to provide neurological evidence related to human-computer interaction HCI, which has been rare in traditional information system studies. According to the neuroimaging data of 19 participants, we conclude that icons are not cognitively processed as logographical words like Chinese characters, although they both stimulate the semantic system in the brain that is needed for language processing. Instead, more similar to images and pictures, icons are not as efficient as words in conveying meanings, and brains people make more effort to process icons than words. We use this study to demonstrate that it is practicable to test information system constructs such as elements of graphical user interfaces GUIs with neuroscience data and that, with such data, we can better understand individual or group differences related to system usage and user-computer interactions.},

Then, the citation counts received by the articles in relatively long citation windows 6 and 11 years after publication were predicted by negative binomial multiple regression NBMR analysis for each field. Various article features about author collaboration, cited references, visibility, authors' achievements measured by past publications and citedness, and publishing journals were considered as the explanatory variables of NBMR. Some generality across the fields was found with regard to the selected predicting factors and the degree of significance of these predictors. The Price index was the strongest predictor of citations, and number of references was the next. The effects of number of authors and authors' achievement measures were rather weak.},

abstract = {Although social network sites SNS users' privacy concerns cannot be completely removed by privacy policies and security safeguards, the user base of SNS is constantly expanding. To explain this phenomenon, we use the lens of the calculus of behavior within a cost-benefit framework suggesting privacy concerns as cost factors and behavior enticements as benefit factors and examine how the enticements operate against privacy concerns in users' cost-benefit calculus regarding disclosing personal information and using SNS continuously. Adopting social influence process theory, we examine three enticements-the motivation of relationship management through SNS, the perceived usefulness of SNS for self-presentation, and the subjective social norms of using SNS. From a survey of 362 Facebook users who have disclosed personal information on Facebook, we find that the motivation of relationship management through SNS and the perceived usefulness of SNS for self-presentation lead users to disclose information but that subjective social norms do not, suggesting that the perceived benefit of behavior enticements should be assimilated into users' own value systems to truly operate as benefit factors. The results regarding the positive and negative effects of suggested benefit and cost factors on information disclosure show that only the combined positive effects of all three behavior enticements exceed the negative effect of privacy concerns, suggesting that privacy concerns can be offset only by multiple benefit factors.},

The research took an interpretive approach in which activity theory is used as an analytical framework. The research provides further evidence that the context of the activity and individual differences influence the choice of decision mode and associated information behavior. We also established that information is often not used to resolve uncertainty in decision making and indeed information is often sought and used after the decision is made to justify the decision. Finally, we point to the significance of both expertise and confidence in understanding information behavior. The contribution of the research to existing theoretical frameworks is discussed and a modified version of Wilson's problem-solving model is proposed.},

Similar discussions happen on the interpretation of social scientific research data, for which information triangulation has been proposed as a useful method. In this article, we explore a design theory-consisting of a kernel theory, meta-requirements, and meta-designs-for software and services that triangulate Internet information. The kernel theory identifies 5 triangulation methods based on Churchman's inquiring systems theory and related meta-requirements. These meta-requirements are used to search for existing software and services that contain design features for Internet information triangulation tools. We discuss a prototyping study of the use of an information triangulator among 72 college students and how their use contributes to their opinion formation. From these findings, we conclude that triangulation tools can contribute to opinion formation by information consumers, especially when the tool is not a mere fact checker but includes the search and delivery of alternative views. Finally, we discuss other empirical propositions and design propositions for an agenda for triangulator developers and researchers. In particular, we propose investment in theory triangulation, that is, tools to automatically detect ethically and theoretically alternative information and views.},

To analyze indexing consistency, this study employed the vector space model-based indexing consistency measures. An analysis of tagging effectiveness with tagging exhaustivity and tag specificity was conducted to ameliorate the drawbacks of consistency analysis based on only the quantitative measures of vocabulary matching. To further investigate the semantic values of tags at various levels of specificity, a latent semantic analysis LSA was conducted. To test statistical significance for the relation between tag specificity and semantic quality, correlation analysis was conducted. This research demonstrates the potential of tags for web document indexing with a complete assessment of tagging quality and provides a basis for further study of the strengths and limitations of tagging.},

Second, research collaboration is positively related to research impact, operationally defined as the number of citations. Lastly, the positive relationship between research collaboration and research impact is stronger in the post-web stage than that in the pre-web stage. Articles published in the field of information systems in both time periods were collected to test the hypotheses. The empirical results strongly support H1 and H2, showing that co-authorship increases in the post-web stage, and positively correlates with citations received by information systems articles. The positive effects of interdisciplinary collaborations and collaborations among multiple authors are enhanced in the post-web stage, but such enhancement is not found for international collaboration.

Bose 1858-1937, an Indian scientist, during their long period of association 1898-1911. Here, the writings of J.C. Bose are studied from this perspective. It may be noted that the relation between Bose and Nivedita was personal in nature. Three important style markers-function words, punctuation marks, and usage of words are used to trace the changes in Bose's writing style, if any. The results show that during the association between Bose and Nivedita, Bose's style of writing changed considerably in comparison to the earlier period when they did not know each other. It shows Nivedita helped Bose in preparing his journal articles and books. The results reveal a distinct change in Bose's writing style after his meeting with Nivedita. This is reflected in his changing pattern of usage of these three stylistic features. Bose slowly moved back towards his original style of writing after Nivedita's death, but his later works still carried Nivedita's influence.},

In the similarity-oriented approach, an assessed article's raw citation count is compared with a reference value that is derived from a reference set, which is constructed in such a way that articles in this set are estimated to address a subject matter similar to that of the assessed article. This estimation is based on second-order similarity and utilizes a combination of 2 feature sets: bibliographic references and technical terminology. The contribution of an article in a given reference set to the reference value is dependent on its degree of similarity to the assessed article. It is shown that reference values calculated by the similarity-oriented approach are considerably better at predicting the assessed articles' citation count compared to the reference values given by the journal-set approach, thus significantly reducing the variability in the observed citation distribution that stems from the variability in the articles' addressed subject matter.},

Five categories are identified: use of loose analogies and metaphors between concepts in quantum physics and library/information science; use of quantum concepts and formalisms in information retrieval; use of quantum concepts and formalisms in studying meaning and concepts; quantum social science, in areas adjacent to information science; and the qualitative application of quantum concepts in the information disciplines. Quantum issues have led to demonstrable progress in information retrieval and semantic modelling, with less clear-cut progress elsewhere. Whether there may be a future "quantum turn" in the information sciences is debated, the implications of such a turn are considered, and a research agenda outlined.},

Attention is paid to the grounds by which the participants bolster the informational support. The findings draw on the analysis of 200 threads of a Finnish online discussion group and a Yahoo! Answers Q&amp;A question and answer forum. Three main types of informational support were identified: providing factual information, providing advice, and providing personal opinion. The grounds used in the answers varied across the types of informational support. While providing factual information, the most popular ground was description of the attributes of an entity. In the context of providing advice, reference to external sources of information was employed most frequently. Finally, although providing personal opinions, the participants most often bolstered their views by articulating positive or negative evaluations of an entity. Overall, regarding the grounds, there were more similarities than differences between the discussion group and the Q&amp;A site.},

This study identifies types of social support in the QuitStop forum and brings insights to exchange patterns of social support and user behaviors with content analysis and social network analysis. Motivated by user information behavior, this study defines two patterns to describe social support exchange: initiated support exchange and invited support exchange. It is found that users with a longer quitting time tend to actively give initiated support, and recent quitters with a shorter abstinent time are likely to seek and receive invited support. This study also finds that support givers of informational support quit longer ago than support givers of nurturant support, and support receivers of informational support quit more recently than support receivers of nurturant support. Usually, informational support is offered by users at late quit stages to users at early quit stages. Nurturant support is also exchanged among users within the same quit stage. These findings help us understand how health consumers are supporting each other and reveal new capabilities of online intervention programs that can be designed to offer social support in a timely and effective manner.},

abstract = {In recent years, searching the web on mobile devices has become enormously popular. Because mobile devices have relatively small screens and show fewer search results, search behavior with mobile devices may be different from that with desktops or laptops. Therefore, examining these differences may suggest better, more efficient designs for mobile search engines. In this experiment, we use eye tracking to explore user behavior and performance. We analyze web searches with 2 task types on 2 differently sized screens: one for a desktop and the other for a mobile device. In addition, we examine the relationships between search performance and several search behaviors to allow further investigation of the differences engendered by the screens. We found that users have more difficulty extracting information from search results pages on the smaller screens, although they exhibit less eye movement as a result of an infrequent use of the scroll function. However, in terms of search performance, our findings suggest that there is no significant difference between the 2 screens in time spent on search results pages and the accuracy of finding answers. This suggests several possible ideas for the presentation design of search results pages on small devices.},

While previous research has analyzed trending topics over the long term, we look at the earliest tweets that produce a trend, with the aim of categorizing trends early on. This allows us to provide a filtered subset of trends to end users. We experiment with a set of straightforward language-independent features based on the social spread of trends and categorize them using the typology. Our method provides an efficient way to accurately categorize trending topics without need of external data, enabling news organizations to discover breaking news in real-time, or to quickly identify viral memes that might inform marketing decisions, among others. The analysis of social features also reveals patterns associated with each type of trend, such as tweets about ongoing events being shorter as many were likely sent from mobile devices, or memes having more retweets originating from a few trend-setters.},

abstract = {In a knowledge-intensive environment, a task in an organization is typically performed by a group of people who have task-related knowledge and expertise. Each group may require task-related knowledge of different topic domains and documents to accomplish its tasks. Document recommendation methods are very useful to resolve the information overload problem and proactively support knowledge workers in the performance of tasks by recommending appropriate documents to meet their information needs. A worker's document referencing behavior can be modeled as a knowledge flow KF to represent the evolution of his information needs over time. However, the information needs of workers and groups may change over time, so that modeling the knowledge referencing behavior of a group of workers is difficult. Additionally, most traditional recommendation methods which provide personalized recommendations do not consider workers' KFs, or the information needs of the majority of workers in a group to recommend task knowledge. In this work, I integrate the KF mining method and propose group-based recommendation methods, including group-based collaborative filtering GCF and group content-based filtering GCBF, to actively provide task-related documents for groups. Experimental results show that the proposed methods have better performance than the personalized recommendation methods in recommending the needed documents for groups. Thus, the recommended documents can fulfill the groups' task needs and facilitate knowledge sharing among groups.},

The vocabulary consists of 3 categories-Research Data Practices, Data, and Curation-with 187 terms validated through empirical studies of scientific data practices in the Earth and life sciences. The present article covers the DPCVocab development process and examines applications for mapping relationships across the 3 categories, identifying factors for projecting curation costs and important differences in curation requirements across disciplines. As a tool for curators, the vocabulary provides a framework for charting curation options and guiding systematic administration of curation services. It can serve as a shared terminology or lingua franca to support interactions and collaboration among curators, data producers, system developers, and other stakeholders in data infrastructure and services. The DPCVocab as a whole supports both the technical and the human aspects of professional curation work essential to the modern research system.},

abstract = {Name ambiguity in the context of bibliographic citation affects the quality of services in digital libraries. Previous methods are not widely applied in practice because of their high computational complexity and their strong dependency on excessive attributes, such as institutional affiliation, research area, address, etc., which are difficult to obtain in practice. To solve this problem, we propose a novel coarse-to-fine framework for name disambiguation which sequentially employs 3 common and easily accessible attributes i.e., coauthor name, article title, and publication venue. Our proposed framework is based on multiple clustering and consists of 3 steps: a clustering articles by coauthorship and obtaining rough clusters, that is fragments; b clustering fragments obtained in step 1 by title information and getting bigger fragments; c and clustering fragments obtained in step 2 by the latent relations among venues. Experimental results on a Digital Bibliography and Library Project DBLP data set show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods by 2.4% to 22.7% on the average pairwise F1 score and is 10 to 100 times faster in terms of execution time.},

This study proposes a reflective pause on the HIS adoption literature to broaden our understanding of factors contributing to the user adoption of electronic medical record EMR. This paper provides a comprehensive taxonomy of the factors influencing the user adoption of EMR and classifies these factors into meaningful categories. We searched the selected keywords on several academic databases and found an initial set of 9,684 studies. We excluded papers on the basis of their title, abstract, and full text 89 remaining papers. The effectiveness of adoption theories has been explored based on the empirical results identified in the EMR research. Furthermore, according to the conceptualization of the factors in the literature, a list of 78 factors affecting EMR adoption was identified. These factors were classified to eight categories: individual factors, psychological factors, behavioural factors, environmental factors, organizational factors, financial factors, legal factors, and technical factors. The results have implications for researchers and practitioners, including policymakers, marketers, information technology IT professionals, health information management HIM practitioners, health practice managers, and EMR system developers.},

abstract = {Micro-blogging services such as Twitter represent constantly evolving, user-generated sources of information. Previous studies show that users search such content regularly but are often dissatisfied with current search facilities. We argue that an enhanced understanding of the motivations for search would aid the design of improved search systems, better reflecting what people need. Building on previous research, we present qualitative analyses of two sources of data regarding how and why people search Twitter. The first, a diary study p=68, provides descriptions of Twitter information needs n=117 and important meta-data from active study participants. The second data set was established by collecting first-person descriptions of search behavior n=388 tweeted by twitter users themselves p=381 and complements the first data set by providing similar descriptions from a more plentiful source. The results of our analyses reveal numerous characteristics of Twitter search that differentiate it from more commonly studied search domains, such as web search. The findings also shed light on some of the difficulties users encounter. By highlighting examples that go beyond those previously published, this article adds to the understanding of how and why people search such content. Based on these new insights, we conclude with a discussion of possible design implications for search systems that index micro-blogging content.},

However, treating all citations with equal weight ignores the wide variety of functions that citations perform. We want to automatically identify the subset of references in a bibliography that have a central academic influence on the citing paper. For this purpose, we examine the effectiveness of a variety of features for determining the academic influence of a citation. By asking authors to identify the key references in their own work, we created a data set in which citations were labeled according to their academic influence. Using automatic feature selection with supervised machine learning, we found a model for predicting academic influence that achieves good performance on this data set using only four features. The best features, among those we evaluated, were those based on the number of times a reference is mentioned in the body of a citing paper. The performance of these features inspired us to design an influence-primed h-index the hip-index. Unlike the conventional h-index, it weights citations by how many times a reference is mentioned. According to our experiments, the hip-index is a better indicator of researcher performance than the conventional h-index.},

abstract = {Information use intrigues information behavior researchers, though many have struggled with how to conceptualize and study this phenomenon. Some work suggests that information may have social uses, hinting that information use is more complicated than previous frameworks suggest. Therefore, we use a micro-sociological, symbolic interactionist approach to examine the use of one type of information-biomedical information-in the everyday life interactions of chronic illness patients and their families. Based on a grounded theory analysis of 60 semi-structured interviews 30 individual patient interviews and 30 family group interviews and observations within the family group interviews, we identify 4 categories of information use: a knowing my body; b mapping the social terrain; c asserting autonomy; and d puffing myself up. Extending previous research, the findings demonstrate use of biomedical information in interactions that construct a valued self for the patient: a person who holds authority, and who is unique and cared for. In so doing, we contribute novel insights regarding the use of information to manage social emotions such as shame, and to construct embodied knowledge that is mobilized in action to address disease-related challenges. We thus offer an expanded conceptualization of information use that provides new directions for research and practice.},

Drawing on our experience in an intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital in Israel, the bi-dimensional view of this model includes the medical- and the interprofessional perspective. Retrospective assessment of 3 case studies of complex patients is used for assessing the usefulness of INDECO in decision making. The study reported here draws support from relevant literature, including the information science, information systems, and the medical domains.

This proposal is evaluated using different data sets and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, thereby proving the plausibility of the approach. In addition, because the applicability of our approach depends on the possibility of identifying equivalent named entities among the news, we propose a heuristic system to identify equivalent named entities in the same and different languages, thereby obtaining good performance.},

abstract = {The construct of value is highly relevant to information. For research on the value of information, Saracevic and Kantor 1997 proposed a framework from a value perspective in philosophy. In this report, we substantiate the framework with an updated review of the literature and demonstrate its applicability to understanding the value of user feedback as one type of information. Our field study, in the setting of a health information provider whose information products serve thousands of Canadian healthcare professionals, provides an example of how this value-of-information framework can be operationalized for an organization. In addition to the theoretical and methodological contributions, this research adds to the literature by documenting the way that textual feedback data were used to optimize the content of an information resource. This contrasts with published studies that only dealt with the use of quantitative feedback by information providers not involved in content production.},

abstract = {According to Leventhal's Common Sense Model of illness regulation, people approach and deal with their illnesses differently depending on their cognitive representations of them. Thus, understanding people's illness representations can be invaluable when assisting them to develop lifestyle modifications that improve their health. What role does information use play in this equation? This is the crucial question addressed by this two-part study. Part 1 hypothesizes a model of how information use at different timepoints may affect illness representations, and then tests this model. The study found that a number of information use type and time pairings e.g., information used to consult healthcare practitioners at symptom onset were significantly associated with present-day level of personal control. The results suggest that it is not merely type or timing of information use alone that is helpful in illness coping, but the coupling of the two; this has several implications for the design of patient education programs. Part 2 examines how information use and illness representations differ based on the way an individual participates in online health forums and social media sites. The following four different participation styles were investigated: nonuser, only reading "lurker", posting occasionally but largely reading "infrequent poster", and reading and posting "poster". Differences in both information use and illness perceptions were found, and the implications of these are discussed.},

Its accomplishments in this regard have made it a point of inquiry for researchers from different fields of knowledge. A decade of research has thrown light on many aspects of the Wikipedia community, its processes, and its content. However, due to the variety of fields inquiring about Wikipedia and the limited synthesis of the extensive research, there is little consensus on many aspects of Wikipedia's content as an encyclopedic collection of human knowledge. This study addresses the issue by systematically reviewing 110 peer-reviewed publications on Wikipedia content, summarizing the current findings, and highlighting the major research trends. Two major streams of research are identified: the quality of Wikipedia content including comprehensiveness, currency, readability, and reliability and the size of Wikipedia. Moreover, we present the key research trends in terms of the domains of inquiry, research design, data source, and data gathering methods. This review synthesizes scholarly understanding of Wikipedia content and paves the way for future studies.},

To track temporal changes, we divided data for the period 1986-2010 into five 5-year time periods. The clusters of disciplines for the Slovene science system revealed 5 clusters of scientific disciplines that, in large measure, correspond with the official national classification of sciences. However, there were also some significant differences pointing to the need for a dynamic classification system of sciences to better characterize them. Implications stemming from these results, especially with regard to classifying scientific disciplines, understanding the collaborative structure of science, and research and development policies, are discussed.},

Searching GB for citations produces approximate matches, however, and so its raw results need time-consuming human filtering. In response, this article introduces a method to automatically remove false and irrelevant matches from GB citation searches in addition to introducing refinements to a previous GB manual citation extraction method. The method was evaluated by manual checking of sampled GB results and comparing citations to about 14,500 monographs in the Thomson Reuters Book Citation Index BKCI against automatically extracted citations from GB across 24 subject areas. GB citations were 103% to 137% as numerous as BKCI citations in the humanities, except for tourism 72% and linguistics 91%, 46% to 85% in social sciences, but only 8% to 53% in the sciences. In all cases, however, GB had substantially more citing books than did BKCI, with BKCI's results coming predominantly from journal articles. Moderate correlations between the GB and BKCI citation counts in social sciences and humanities, with most BKCI results coming from journal articles rather than books, suggests that they could measure the different aspects of impact, however.},

abstract = {In economics, the principal-agent problem is the difficulty in motivating one party the agent, to act in the best interests of another the principal rather than in his own interests. We consider the example of a journal editor the principal wondering whether his or her reviewer the agent is recommending rejection of a manuscript because it does not have enough quality to be published or because the reviewer dislikes effort and he/she must work to acquire in-depth knowledge of the content of the manuscript. The reviewer's effort provides him or her with superior information about a manuscript's quality. If this information is not correctly communicated, the reviewer has more information when compared with the journal editor. This inherently leads to an encouragement of moral hazard, where the editor will not know whether the reviewer has done his or her job in accordance to the editor's interest. Prescriptions need to be given as to how the journal editor should control the reviewers to curb self-interest. Besides the associate editors monitoring the peer-review process, incentives can be employed to limit moral hazard on the part of the reviewer. Drawing on agency theory, we examine the incentives motivating the reviewers to expend effort to generate information about the quality of submissions. This model predicts that for reviewers early in their careers, promotion-based incentives may mean there is no need for within-job incentives, but also that within-job rewards for a referee's performance should depend on individual differences in ability and promotion opportunities.},

We conducted a study that investigated this issue by comparing Google Trends and Baidu Index. Data from these two services are based on queries entered by users into Google and Baidu, two of the largest search engines in the world. We first compared the features and functions of the two services based on documents and extensive testing. We then carried out an empirical study that collected query volume data from the two sources. We found that data from both sources could be used to predict the quality of Chinese universities and companies. Despite the differences between the two services in terms of technology, such as differing methods of language processing, the search volume data from the two were highly correlated and combining the two data sources did not improve the predictive power of the data. However, there was a major difference between the two in terms of data availability. Baidu Index was able to provide more search volume data than Google Trends did. Our analysis showed that the disadvantage of Google Trends in this regard was due to Google's smaller user base in China. The implication of this finding goes beyond China. Google's user bases in many countries are smaller than that in China, so the search volume data related to those countries could result in the same issue as that related to China.},

However, because it is jointly written by many contributors, it is subject to constant manipulation by contributors attempting to add biographies of non-notable people. Over time, Wikipedia has developed inclusion criteria for notable people e.g., receiving a significant award based on which newly contributed biographies are evaluated. In this paper we present and analyze a set of simple indicators that can be used to predict which article will eventually be accepted. These indicators do not refer to the content itself, but to meta-content features such as the number of categories that the biography is associated with and to author-based features such as if it is a first-time author. By training a classifier on these features, we successfully reached a high predictive performance area under the receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve [AUC] of 0.97 even though we overlooked the actual biography text.},

We evaluated different methods for acquiring user profiles based on declared and actual interest in various news topics and items. In an experiment, 36 students rated their interest in six news topics and in specific news items and read on 6 days standard, nonpersonalized editions and personalized basic or adaptive news editions. We measured subjective satisfaction with the editions and expressed preferences, along with objective measures, to infer actual interest in items. Users' declared interest in news topics did not strongly predict their actual interest in specific news items. Satisfaction with all news editions was high, but participants preferred the personalized editions. User interest was weakly correlated with reading duration, article length, and reading order. Different measures predicted interest in different news topics. Explicit measures predicted interest in relatively clearly defined topics such as sports, but were less appropriate for broader topics such as science and technology. Our results indicate that explicit and implicit methods should be combined to generate user profiles. We suggest that a personalized newspaper should contain both general information and personalized items, selected based on specific combinations of measures for each of the different news topics. Based on the findings, we present a general model to decide on the personalization of news content to generate personalized editions for readers.},

abstract = {Previous studies of international scientific collaboration have rarely gone beyond revealing the structural relationships between countries. Considering how scientific collaboration is actually initiated, this study focuses on the organization and sector levels of international coauthorship networks, going beyond a country-level description. Based on a network analysis of coauthorship networks between members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD, this study attempts to gain a better understanding of international scientific collaboration by exploring the structure of the coauthorship network in terms of university-industry-government UIG relationships, the mode of knowledge production, and the underlying dynamic of collaboration in terms of geographic, linguistic, and economic factors. The results suggest that the United States showed overwhelming dominance in all bilateral UIG combinations with the exception of the government-government GG network. Scientific collaboration within the industry sector was concentrated in a few players, whereas that between the university and industry sectors was relatively less concentrated. Despite the growing participation from other sectors, universities were still the main locus of knowledge production, with the exception of 5 countries. The university sector in English-speaking wealthy countries and the government sector of non-English-speaking, less-wealthy countries played a key role in international collaborations between OECD countries. The findings did not provide evidence supporting the institutional proximity argument.},

Students' demographic information, knowledge about their research topic, labeling of knowledge, estimate of interest and knowledge, and learning outcomes were collected and analyzed with content analysis and statistical techniques. The findings indicate that ELL students, as a whole group, showed significant increases in their topical knowledge and estimate of interest and knowledge as they progressed in the research project, which are consistent with what other ISP-based studies found. When three different English proficiency-level groups were compared, only the intermediate group showed significant increases in topical knowledge and estimate of knowledge throughout the process. Also, different research tasks impacted the amount and substance of knowledge students built and their estimated knowledge during the research project. The findings led to suggestions for instructional strategies such as learning goals reflecting various kinds of learning, differentiated instructions in mixed-ability classrooms, structured interventions, personalized research topics, and teacher-school librarian collaborations.},

For this task, the nearest-neighbor-based scheme works in two phases: first, it finds the most similar neighbors of a new image from the set of labeled images; then, it propagates the keywords associated with the neighbors to the new image. In this article, we propose a novel approach for image annotation, which simultaneously improves both phases of the nearest-neighbor-based scheme. In the phase of neighbor search, different from existing work discovering the nearest neighbors with the predicted distance, we introduce a ranking-oriented neighbor search mechanism RNSM, where the ordering of labeled images is optimized directly without going through the intermediate step of distance prediction. In the phase of keyword propagation, different from existing work using simple heuristic rules to select the propagated keywords, we present a learning-based keyword propagation strategy LKPS, where a scoring function is learned to evaluate the relevance of keywords based on their multiple relations with the nearest neighbors. Extensive experiments on the Corel 5K data set and the MIR Flickr data set demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

For this study, the term social technologies refers to the fast-evolving suite of tools such as traditional applications like e-mail, phone, and instant messenger; emerging social networking platforms often known as social media such as blogs and wikis; public social networking sites i.e., Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn; and enterprise social networking technologies that are specifically hosted within one organization's computing environment i.e., Socialtext. Building from structuration theory, the analysis presented focuses on the knowledge practices of consultants related to their uses of social technologies and the ways in which organizational norms and policies influence these practices. A primary contribution of this research is a detailed contextualization of social technology uses by knowledge workers. As many organizations are allowing social media-enabled knowledge sharing to develop organically, most corporate policy toward these platforms remains defensive, not strategic, limiting opportunities. Implications for uses and expectations of social technologies arising from this research will help organizations craft relevant policies and rules to best support technology-enabled informal knowledge practices.},

This study looks at users' dwelling behavior on documents and several contextual factors: the stage of users' work tasks, task type, and users' knowledge of task topics, to explore whether or not taking account contextual factors could help infer document usefulness from dwell time. A controlled laboratory experiment was conducted with 24 participants, each coming 3 times to work on 3 subtasks in a general work task. The results show that task stage could help interpret certain types of dwell time as reliable indicators of document usefulness in certain task types, as was topic knowledge, and the latter played a more significant role when both were available. This study contributes to a better understanding of how dwell time can be used as implicit evidence of document usefulness, as well as how contextual factors can help interpret dwell time as an indicator of usefulness. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications for using behaviors and contextual factors in the development of personalization systems.},

However, access to this information can sometimes be restricted or blocked in various ways. This research adopts Jaeger and Burnett's 2005 conceptualization of information access as "the presence of a robust system through which information is made available to citizens and others" p. 465 with physical, intellectual, and social components. This provides the conceptual framework through which incidents of restricted access to science policy RASP were analyzed in a comparative case study. The research found that citizens' physical, intellectual, and social access to scientific research was restricted in these cases. Furthermore, the theoretical framework of democratic accountability held normative and symbolic power for the respondents; although democratic accountability did not accurately predict respondents' actions, it was used as a significant justification for their actions. This research suggests that the conceptual framework of information access with physical, intellectual, and social components and the theoretical framework of democratic accountability although primarily normative may be useful approaches to subsequent investigations of censorship and restricted access in other situations and research areas.},

Social impact of papers can be defined as the net effect of citations on a network. A publication exerts direct and indirect influence on others e.g., by citing articles and is itself influenced directly and indirectly e.g., by cited articles. This network leads to an influence structure of citing and cited publications. Drawing on cooperative game theory, our research problem is to translate into mathematical equations the rules that govern the social impact of a paper in a citation network. In this article, we show that when citation relationships between academic papers function within a citation structure, the result is social impact instead of the individual citation impact of each paper. Mathematical equations explain the interaction between papers in such a citation structure. The equations show that the social impact of a paper is affected by the individual citation impact of citing publications, immediacy of citing articles, and number of both citing and cited papers. Examples are provided for several academic papers.},

In this article, we propose a novel approach to identify complementary QAsCQAs of a target QA. We define two types of complementarity: partial complementarity and extended complementarity. First, we utilize a classification-based approach to predict complementary relationships between QAs based on three measures: question similarity, answer novelty, and answer correlation. Then we construct a CQA network based on the derived complementary relationships. In addition, we introduce a CQA network analysis technique that searches the QA network to find direct and indirect CQAs of the target QA. The results of experiments conducted on the data collected from Yahoo! Answers Taiwan show that the proposed approach can more effectively identify CQAs than can the conventional similarity-based method. Case and user study results also validate the helpfulness and the effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {Pseudorelevance feedback PRF was proposed to solve the limitation of relevance feedback RF, which is based on the user-in-the-loop process. In PRF, the top-k retrieved images are regarded as PRF. Although the PRF set contains noise, PRF has proven effective for automatically improving the overall retrieval result. To implement PRF, the Rocchio algorithm has been considered as a reasonable and well-established baseline. However, the performance of Rocchio-based PRF is subject to various representation choices or factors. In this article, we examine these factors that affect the performance of Rocchio-based PRF, including image-feature representation, the number of top-ranked images, the weighting parameters of Rocchio, and similarity measure. We offer practical insights on how to optimize the performance of Rocchio-based PRF by choosing appropriate representation choices. Our extensive experiments on NUS-WIDE-LITE and Caltech 101+Corel 5000 data sets show that the optimal feature representation is color moment+wavelet texture in terms of retrieval efficiency and effectiveness. Other representation choices are that using top-20 ranked images as pseudopositive and pseudonegative feedback sets with the equal weight i.e., 0.5 by the correlation and cosine distance functions can produce the optimal retrieval result.},

Lexical translation evidence is assembled from Wikipedia and from a large machine-readable dictionary, statistical translation evidence is drawn from parallel corpora, and evidence from co-occurrence in the document language provides a basis for limiting the adverse effect of translation ambiguity. Coverage statistics for NII Testbeds and Community for Information Access Research NTCIR queries confirm that these resources have complementary strengths. Experiments with translation evidence from a small parallel corpus indicate that even rather rough estimates of translation probabilities can yield further improvements over a strong technique for translation weighting based on using Jensen-Shannon divergence as a term-association measure. Finally, a novel approach to posttranslation query expansion using a random walk over the Wikipedia concept link graph is shown to yield further improvements over alternative techniques for posttranslation query expansion. Evaluation results on the NTCIR-5 English-Korean test collection show statistically significant improvements over strong baselines.},

Traditional approaches for discovering publication outlets mainly focus on manually matching research relevance in terms of keywords as well as comparing journal qualities, but other research-relevant information such as social connections, publication rewards, and productivity of authors are largely ignored. To assist in identifying effective publication outlets and to support effective journal recommendations for manuscripts, a three-dimensional profile-boosted research analytics framework RAF that holistically considers relevance, connectivity, and productivity is proposed. To demonstrate the usability of the proposed framework, a prototype system was implemented using the ScholarMate research social network platform. Evaluation results show that the proposed RAF-based approach outperforms traditional recommendation techniques that can be applied to journal recommendations in terms of quality and performance. This research is the first attempt to provide an integrated framework for effective recommendation in the context of scientific item recommendation.},

The goal of this paper is to increase understanding of XML document management and provide a framework to enable the analysis and description of the management of XML documents throughout their life. We followed the design science approach. We introduce a document life cycle model consisting of five phases. For each of the phases we describe the typical activities related to the management of XML documents. Furthermore, we also identify the typical actors, systems, and types of content items associated with the activities of the phases. We demonstrate the use of the model in two case studies: one concerning the State Budget Proposal of the Finnish government and the other concerning a faculty council meeting agenda at a university.},

abstract = {Visually assisted product image search has gained increasing popularity because of its capability to greatly improve end users' e-commerce shopping experiences. Different from general-purpose content-based image retrieval CBIR applications, the specific goal of product image search is to retrieve and rank relevant products from a large-scale product database to visually assist a user's online shopping experience. In this paper, we explore the problem of product image search through salient edge characterization and analysis, for which we propose a novel image search method coupled with an interactive user region-of-interest indication function. Given a product image, the proposed approach first extracts an edge map, based on which contour curves are further extracted. We then segment the extracted contours into fragments according to the detected contour corners. After that, a set of salient edge elements is extracted from each product image. Based on salient edge elements matching and similarity evaluation, the method derives a new pairwise image similarity estimate. Using the new image similarity, we can then retrieve product images. To evaluate the performance of our algorithm, we conducted 120 sessions of querying experiments on a data set comprised of around 13k product images collected from multiple, real-world e-commerce websites. We compared the performance of the proposed method with that of a bag-of-words method Philbin, Chum, Isard, Sivic, &amp; Zisserman, 2008 and a Pyramid Histogram of Orientated Gradients PHOG method Bosch, Zisserman, &amp; Munoz, 2007. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance of example-based product image retrieval.},

However, because global citation databases seem to offer weak coverage of books outside the West, it is not clear whether the influence of non-Western books can be assessed with citations. To investigate this, citations were extracted from Google Books and Google Scholar to 1,357 arts, humanities and social sciences AHSS books published by 5 university presses during 1961-2012 in 1 non-Western nation, Malaysia. A significant minority of the books 23% in Google Books and 37% in Google Scholar, 45% in total had been cited, with a higher proportion cited if they were older or in English. The combination of Google Books and Google Scholar is therefore recommended, with some provisos, for non-Western countries seeking to differentiate between books with some impact and books with no impact, to identify the highly-cited works or to develop an indicator of academic publisher prestige.},

This overlay map technique may support competitive intelligence and policy decision making.

This patent data set, extracted from the PATSTAT database, includes 760,000 patent records in 466 IPC-based categories. We compare the global patent maps derived from this categorization to related efforts of other global patent maps. The paper overlays the nanotechnology-related patenting activities of two companies and two different nanotechnology subfields on the global patent map. The exercise shows the potential of patent overlay maps to visualize technological areas and potentially support decision making. Furthermore, this study shows that IPC categories that are similar to one another based on citing-to-cited patterns and thus close in the global patent map are not necessarily in the same hierarchical IPC branch, thereby revealing new relationships between technologies that are classified as pertaining to different and sometimes distant subject areas in the IPC scheme.},

However, existing bibliometric indices are computed based on the number of citations received by each article, but they do not consider the frequency with which individual citations are mentioned in an article. We use "citation mention" to denote a unique occurrence of a cited reference mentioned in the citing article, and thus some citations may have more than one mention in an article. According to our analysis of the ACL Anthology Network corpus in the natural language processing field, more than 40% of cited references have been mentioned twice or in corresponding citing articles. We argue that citation mention is a preferable for representing the citation relationships between articles, that is, a reference article mentioned m times in the citing article will be considered to have received m citations, rather than one citation. Based on this assumption, we revise the h-index and propose a new bibliometric index, the WL-index, to evaluation an individual's scientific impact. According to our empirical analysis, the proposed WL-index more accurately discriminates between program committee chairs of reputable conferences and ordinary authors.},

This issue should be addressed in a way that it also preserves the utility of the profile with regard to search services. State-of-the-art approaches tackle these issues by generating and submitting fake queries that are related to the interests of the user. This technique allows the WSE to only know general and useful data while the detailed and potentially private data are obfuscated. To build fake queries, these proposals rely on past queries to obtain user interests. However, we argue that this is not always the best strategy and, in this article, we study the use of social networks to gather more accurate user profiles that enable better personalized service while offering a similar, or even better, level of practical privacy. These hypotheses are empirically supported by evaluations using real profiles gathered from Twitter and a set of AOL search queries.},

Experiments with a number of standard TREC collections WordNet-based that this method outperforms existing WordNet-based methods. It also compares favorably with established QE methods such as KLD and RM3. Leveraging earlier work in which a combination of QE methods was found to outperform each individual method as well as other well-known QE methods, we next propose a combination-based QE method that takes into account three different aspects of a candidate expansion term's usefulness: a its distribution in the pseudo-relevant documents and in the target corpus, b its statistical association with query terms, and c its semantic relation with the query, as determined by the overlap between the WordNet definitions of the term and query terms. This combination of diverse sources of information appears to work well on a number of test collections, viz., TREC123, TREC5, TREC678, TREC robust new, and TREC910 collections, and yields significant improvements over competing methods on most of these collections.},

abstract = {This study explores the effect from considering citation relevancy in the main path analysis. Traditional citation-based analyses treat all citations equally even though there can be various reasons and different levels of relevancy for one document to reference another. Taking the relevancy level into consideration is intuitively advantageous because it adopts more accurate information and will thus make the results of a citation-based analysis more trustworthy. This is nevertheless a challenging task. We are aware of no citation-based analysis that has taken the relevancy level into consideration. The difficulty lies in the fact that the existing patent or patent citation database provides no readily available relevancy level information. We overcome this issue by obtaining citation relevancy information from a legal database that has relevancy level ranked by legal experts. This paper selects trademark dilution, a legal concept that has been the subject of many lawsuit cases, as the target for exploration. We apply main path analysis, taking citation relevancy into consideration, and verify the results against a set of test cases that are mentioned in an authoritative trademark book. The findings show that relevancy information helps main path analysis uncover legal cases of higher importance. Nevertheless, in terms of the number of significant cases retrieved, relevancy information does not seem to make a noticeable difference.},

They also discovered that these three journals play the role of a knowledge hub in the domain. Finally, when compared with Journal Citation ReportsThomson Reuters, Philadelphia, PA, their results closely match expert opinions.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the worldwide growth of open-access OA repositories, 2005 to 2012, using data collected by the OpenDOAR project. Initial repository development was focused on North America, Western Europe, and Australasia, particularly the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia, followed by Japan. Since 2010, there has been repository growth in East Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe, especially in Taiwan, Brazil, and Poland. During the period, some countries, including France, Italy, and Spain, have maintained steady growth, whereas other countries, notably China and Russia, have experienced limited growth. Globally, repositories are predominantly institutional, multidisciplinary and English-language based. They typically use open-source OAI-compliant software but have immature licensing arrangements. Although the size of repositories is difficult to assess accurately, available data indicate that a small number of large repositories and a large number of small repositories make up the repository landscape. These trends are analyzed using innovation diffusion theory, which is shown to provide a useful explanatory framework for repository adoption at global, national, organizational, and individual levels. Major factors affecting both the initial development of repositories and their take-up include IT infrastructure, cultural factors, policy initiatives, awareness-raising activity, and usage mandates. Mandates are likely to be crucial in determining future repository development.},

Drawing on a random sample survey in Austin, TX, it borrows the concepts of cultural omnivores and univores to investigate how health information repertoire are related to social capital and digital inequalities. Results demonstrate that both the size and the composition of health information repertoires vary by social and digital connectivity. People with greater social capital have a larger repertoire and are less likely to be univores dependent on the Internet or interpersonal contacts. People with Internet access have a larger repertoire and are less likely to be univores dependent on television. More skilled Internet users are less likely to be univores dependent on interpersonal contacts, whereas frequent Internet users are more likely to be omnivores with a four-channel repertoire including the Internet, interpersonal contacts, television, and newspaper. The positive relationship between social capital and repertoire size is stronger among less-skilled Internet users. There are significant variations in health information repertoires in terms of media access and sociodemographic characteristics. Scholarly and practical implications are discussed.},

The genre structure and relationships among genre structure constituents shed new light on organizing information by purpose or function. This study examines the relationships among a set of functional units previously constructed in a taxonomy, each of which is a chunk of information embedded in a document and is distinct in terms of its communicative function. Through a card-sort study, relationships among functional units were identified with regard to their occurrence and function. The findings suggest that a group of functional units can be identified, collocated, and navigated by particular relationships. Understanding how functional units are related to each other is significant in linking information pieces in documents to support finding, aggregating, and navigating information in a distributed information environment.},

abstract = {A theory of "megacitation" is introduced and used in an experiment to demonstrate how a qualitative scholarly book review can be converted into a weighted bibliometric indicator. We employ a manual human-coding approach to classify book reviews in the field of history based on reviewers' assessments of a book author's scholarly credibility SC and writing style WS. In total, 100 book reviews were selected from the American Historical Review and coded for their positive/negative valence on these two dimensions. Most were coded as positive 68% for SC and 47% for WS, and there was also a small positive correlation between SC and WSr=0.2. We then constructed a classifier, combining both manual design and machine learning, to categorize sentiment-based sentences in history book reviews. The machine classifier produced a matched accuracy matched to the human coding of approximately 75% for SC and 64% for WS. WS was found to be more difficult to classify by machine than SC because of the reviewers' use of more subtle language. With further training data, a machine-learning approach could be useful for automatically classifying a large number of history book reviews at once. Weighted megacitations can be especially valuable if they are used in conjunction with regular book/journal citations, and "libcitations" i.e., library holding counts for a comprehensive assessment of a book/monograph's scholarly impact.},

On one side, the user-centered paradigm asks researchers to focus on the individual; on the other, emerging context-centered approaches move the position of context into the foreground of information studies. Although there have been attempts to create "in between" approaches to achieve a compromise between these two positions, they have merely generated more positions between the two poles in a continuum between approaches focusing on the individual and those focusing on context. Such positioning not only creates an endless debate about the research focus of information studies but also limits such studies to a set of factors, a priori defined by the researcher. This article argues that IB research could benefit from actor-network theory, which could give the actors a space to perform their own positioning.},

Due to this trend, researchers in various disciplines have become interested in studying relationships between real-world phenomena and their virtual representations. One such area of emerging research seeks to study relationships between real-world and virtual activism of social movement organization SMOs. In particular, SMOs holding extreme social perspectives are often studied due to their tendency to have robust virtual presences to circumvent real-world social barriers preventing information dissemination. However, many previous studies have been limited in scope because they utilize manual data-collection and analysis methods. They also often have failed to consider the real-world aspects of groups that partake in virtual activism. We utilize automated data-collection and analysis methods to identify significant relationships between aspects of SMO virtual communities and their respective real-world locations and ideological perspectives. Our results also demonstrate that the interconnectedness of SMO virtual communities is affected specifically by aspects of the real world. These observations provide insight into the behaviors of SMOs within virtual environments, suggesting that the virtual communities of SMOs are strongly affected by aspects of the real world.},

Designing digital information environments to support serendipity can not only provide users with new knowledge, but also propel them in directions they might not otherwise have traveled in-surprising and delighting them along the way. As serendipity involves unexpected circumstances it cannot be directly controlled, but it can be potentially influenced. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous work has focused on providing a rich empirical understanding of how it might be influenced. We interviewed 14 creative professionals to identify their self-reported strategies aimed at increasing the likelihood of serendipity. These strategies form a framework for examining ways existing digital environments support serendipity and for considering how future environments can create opportunities for it. This is a new way of thinking about how to design for serendipity; by supporting the strategies found to increase its likelihood rather than attempting to support serendipity as a discrete phenomenon, digital environments not only have the potential to help users experience serendipity but also encourage them to adopt the strategies necessary to experience it more often.},

abstract = {People frequently answer consequential questions, such as those with a medical focus, using Internet search engines. Their primary goal is to revise or establish beliefs in one or more outcomes. Search engines are not designed to furnish answers, and instead provide results that may contain answers. Information retrieval research has targeted aspects of information access such as query formulation, relevance, and search success. However, there are important unanswered questions on how beliefs-and potential biases in those beliefs-affect search behaviors and how beliefs are shaped by searching. To understand belief dynamics, we focus on yes-no medical questions e.g., "Is congestive heart failure a heart attack?", with consensus answers from physicians. We show that a presearch beliefs are affected only slightly by searching and changes are likely to skew positive yes; b presearch beliefs affect search behavior; c search engines can shift some beliefs by manipulating result rank and availability, but strongly-held beliefs are difficult to move using uncongenial information and can be counterproductive, and d search engines exhibit near-random answer accuracy. Our findings suggest that search engines should provide correct answers to searchers' questions and develop methods to persuade searchers to shift strongly held but factually incorrect beliefs.},

abstract = {As a complement to Nelson and Winter's 1977 article titled "In Search of a Useful Theory of Innovation," a sociological perspective on innovation networks can be elaborated using Luhmann's social systems theory, on the one hand, and Latour's "sociology of translations," on the other. Because of a common focus on communication, these perspectives can be combined as a set of methodologies. Latour's sociology of translations specifies a mechanism for generating variation in relations "associations", whereas Luhmann's systems perspective enables the specification of functionally different selection environments such as markets, professional organizations, and political control. Selection environments can be considered as mechanisms of social coordination that can self-organize-beyond the control of human agency-into regimes in terms of interacting codes of communication. Unlike relatively globalized regimes, technological trajectories are organized locally in "landscapes." A resulting "duality of structure" Giddens, 1979 between the historical organization of trajectories and evolutionary self-organization at the regime level can be expected to drive innovation cycles. Reflexive translations add a third layer of perspectives to a the relational analysis of observable links that shape trajectories and b the positional analysis of networks in terms of latent dimensions. These three operations can be studied in a single framework, but using different methodologies. Latour's first-order associations can then be analytically distinguished from second-order translations in terms of requiring other communicative competencies. The resulting operations remain infrareflexively nested, and can therefore be used for innovative reconstructions of previously constructed boundaries.},

abstract = {Guided by literature on "fatigue" from within the domains of clinical and occupational studies, the present article seeks to define the phenomenon termed social network fatigue in the context of one of the popular uses of social networks, namely, to stay socially connected. This is achieved through an identification of the antecedents and effects of experiences that contribute to negative emotions or to a reduction in interest in using social networks with the help of a mixed-methods study. Five generic antecedents and varying effects of these antecedents on individual user activities have been identified. Fatigue experiences could result from social dynamics or social interactions of the members of the community, content made available on social networks, unwanted changes to the platform that hosts the network, self-detected immersive tendencies of the users themselves, or a natural maturing of the life cycle of the community to which the user belongs. The intensity of the fatigue experience varies along a continuum ranging from a mild or transient experience to a more severe experience, which may eventually result in the user's decision to quit the environment that causes stress. Thus, users were found to take short rest breaks from the environment, moderate their activities downward, or suspend their social network activities altogether as a result of fatigue experiences.},

Even though teaching is a mainstream, information-rich profession, teachers are understudied as information users. More specifically, not much is known about teacher personal information management PIM. Teacher PIM is critically important, as teachers navigate a complex information space complicated by the duality of digital and physical information streams and changing demands on instruction. Our research study increases understanding of teacher PIM and informs the development of tools to support educators. Some important unknowns exist about teachers as information users: What are teachers' PIM practices? What are the perceived consequences of these practices for teaching and learning? How can PIM practices be facilitated to benefit teaching and learning? This study employed a qualitative research design, with interviews from 24 primary and secondary teachers. We observed various systems for information organization, and teachers report their systems to be effective. Important sources for teachers' information in order of importance are personal collections, close colleagues, and the Internet. Key findings reveal that inheriting and sharing information play an important part in information acquisition for teachers and that information technology supporting education creates unintentional demands on information management. The findings on the nature of teacher information, teacher information finding, keeping, and organizational practices have important implications for teachers themselves, school principals, digital library developers, school librarians, curriculum developers, educational technology developers, and educational policy makers.},

It has the potential to help with the application of citation analysis to research fields such as the social sciences that are not covered well by citation databases and to support weighted citation and cocitation counting for improved citation analysis results. We found that in-text author citation analysis can work as well as traditional citation analysis using citation databases for both author ranking and mapping if author name disambiguation is performed properly. Using in-text citation data without any author name disambiguation, ranking authors by citations is useless, whereas cocitation analysis works well for identifying major specialties and their interrelationships with cautions required for the interpretation of small research areas and some authors' memberships in specialties.},

Although the transfer of knowledge is largely unobservable, citations from one discipline to another have been proven to be an effective proxy to study disciplinary knowledge flow. This study constructs a knowledge-flow network in which a node represents a Journal Citation Reports subject category and a link denotes the citations from one subject category to another. Using the concept of shortest path, several quantitative measurements are proposed and applied to a knowledge-flow network. Based on an examination of subject categories in Journal Citation Reports, this study indicates that social science domains tend to be more self-contained, so it is more difficult for knowledge from other domains to flow into them; at the same time, knowledge from science domains, such as biomedicine-, chemistry-, and physics-related domains, can access and be accessed by other domains more easily. This study also shows that social science domains are more disunified than science domains, because three fifths of the knowledge paths from one social science domain to another require at least one science domain to serve as an intermediate. This work contributes to discussions on disciplinarity and interdisciplinarity by providing empirical analysis.},

Images are increasingly ubiquitous in daily communication due to advances in visually enabled information and communication technologies ICT, such as information visualization applications, image retrieval systems, and virtual collaborative work tools. Although images are often used in social contexts, information science research concerned with the visual representation of information typically focuses on the image artifact and system building. To learn more about image making as a form of social interaction and as a form of information practice, a qualitative study examined face-to-face conversations involving the creation of ad hoc visualizations i.e., "napkin drawings". Interactional sociolinguistic concepts of conversational involvement and coordination guided multimodal analysis of video-recorded interactions that included spontaneous drawing. Findings show patterns in communicative activities associated with the visual representation of information. Furthermore, the activity of mark making contributes to the maintenance of conversational involvement in ways that are not always evident in the drawn artifact. This research has implications for the design and evaluation of visually enabled virtual collaboration environments, visual information extraction and retrieval systems, and data visualization tools.},

abstract = {The web encourages the constant creation and distribution of large amounts of information; it is also a valuable resource for understanding human behavior and communication. To take full advantage of the web as a research resource that extends beyond the consideration of snapshots of the present, however, it is necessary to begin to take web archiving much more seriously as an important element of any research program involving web resources. The ephemeral character of the web requires that researchers take proactive steps in the present to enable future analysis. Efforts to archive the web or portions thereof have been developed around the world, but these efforts have not yet provided reliable and scalable solutions. This article summarizes the current state of web archiving in relation to researchers and research needs. Interviews with researchers, archivists, and technologists identify the differences in purpose, scope, and scale of current web archiving practice, and the professional tensions that arise given these differences. Findings outline the challenges that still face researchers who wish to engage seriously with web content as an object of research, and archivists who must strike a balance reflecting a range of user needs.},

abstract = {In this study, we discover Russian "centers of excellence" and explore patterns of their collaboration with each other and with foreign partners. Highly cited papers serve as a proxy for "excellence" and coauthored papers as a measure of collaborative efforts. We find that currently research institutes of the Russian Academy of Sciences as well as others remain the key players despite recent government initiatives to stimulate university science. The contribution of the commercial sector to high-impact research is negligible. More than 90% of Russian highly cited papers involve international collaboration, and Russian institutions often do not play a dominant role. Partnership with U.S., German, U.K., and French scientists increases markedly the probability of a Russian paper becoming highly cited. Patterns of national "intranational" collaboration in world-class research differ significantly across different types of organizations; the strongest ties are between three nuclear/particle physics centers. Finally, we draw a coauthorship map to visualize collaboration between Russian centers of excellence.},

Specifically, this study used 229 text categorization data sets/tasks, and evaluated 28 classification methods both well-established and proprietary/commercial and 19 feature selection methods according to 4 classification performance metrics.

abstract = {People who are collaborating can share files in two main ways: performing Group Information Management GIM using a common repository or performing Personal Information Management PIM by distributing files as e-mail attachments and storing them in personal repositories. There is a trend toward using common repositories with many organizations encouraging workers to use GIM to avoid duplication of files and management. So far, PIM and GIM have been studied by different research communities, so their effectiveness for file retrieval has not yet been systematically compared. We compared PIM and GIM in a large-scale elicited personal information retrieval study. We asked 275 users to retrieve 860 of their own shared files, testing the effect of sharing method on success and efficiency of retrieval. Participants preferred PIM over GIM. More important, PIM retrieval was more successful: Participants using GIM failed to find 22% of their files compared with 13% failures using PIM. This may be because active organization aids retrieval: When using personally created folders, the failure percentage was 65% lower than when using default folders e.g., My Documents, and more than 5 times lower than when using folders created by others for GIM. Theoretical reasons for this are discussed.},

In this article, we investigate adaptive data fusion methods that can change their behavior when the search environment changes. Three adaptive data fusion methods are proposed and investigated. To test these proposed methods properly, we generate a benchmark from a historic Text REtrieval Conference data set. Experiments with the benchmark show that 2 of the proposed methods are good and may potentially be used in practice.},

In this article, we compare the performance of hierarchical Dirichlet process HDP, a promising generative probabilistic model, with that of the 2 traditional topic detecting and tracking methods-cocitation analysis and co-word analysis. We visualize and explore the relationships between topics identified by the 3 methods in hierarchical edge bundling graphs and time flow graphs. Our result shows that HDP is more sensitive and reliable than the other 2 methods in both detecting and tracking emerging topics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the important topics and topic evolution trends in the literature of terrorism research with the HDP method.},

Data on each journal were collected directly from their websites between March and October 2012. Brazil has a fully open access distribution model 97% in which few journals require payment by authors thanks to cultural, financial, operational, and technological support provided by public agencies. In Spain, open access journals account for 55% of the total and have also received support from public agencies, although to a lesser extent. These results show that there are systems support of open access in scientific journals other than the "author pays" model advocated by the Finch report for the United Kingdom.},

abstract = {For the last decade or so, sentiment analysis, which aims to automatically identify opinions, polarities, or emotions from user-generated content e.g., blogs, tweets, has attracted interest from both academic and industrial communities. Most sentiment analysis strategies fall into 2 categories: lexicon-based and corpus-based approaches. While the latter often requires sentiment-labeled data to build a machine learning model, both approaches need sentiment-labeled data for evaluation. Unfortunately, most data domains lack sufficient quantities of labeled data, especially at the subdocument level. Semisupervised learning SSL, a machine learning technique that requires only a few labeled examples and can automatically label unlabeled data, is a promising strategy to deal with the issue of insufficient labeled data. Although previous studies have shown promising results of applying various SSL algorithms to solve a sentiment-analysis problem, co-training, an SSL algorithm, has not attracted much attention for sentiment analysis largely due to its restricted assumptions. Therefore, this study focuses on revisiting co-training in depth and discusses several co-training strategies for sentiment analysis following a loose assumption. Results suggest that co-training can be more effective than can other currently adopted SSL methods for sentiment analysis.},

abstract = {This article seeks to make visible information-sharing activities that take place within a geographically dispersed network of design researchers. For this purpose, a theoretical approach is applied that comprises the analytical notion of material objects and a document theory. Empirical material was primarily ethnographically produced over a period of 6 months, including 2 seminars within the network. Trajectories of sharing that reach across time and space have been identified by studying how people interact with multidimensional objects, such as documents. These were found to coordinate and shape the social practice under study. The theoretical framework has made it possible to highlight aspects of information sharing that have tended to be blackboxed in previous research. It has been suggested in previous research that the concept of information sharing can be reduced to that of mere sharing. Such a stance potentially entails reduction of conceptual ambiguity but may also decrease analytical sharpness. Based on the present study, it appears beneficial to adopt the concept of document into the discourse of information-sharing research. By adding the concept of document to our analytical toolbox, which hitherto has been dominated by the slightly diffuse concept of information, material features can be emphasized without reducing the social and cognitive dimensions of information sharing. The article offers insight into the information-sharing activities of design researchers. Through its focus on materiality, it presents a novel theoretical approach and methodological strategy for studying information practices.},

However, much less is known about such internationalization in the social sciences. In this study, we analyze international and domestic coauthorship relations of all citable items in the DVD version of the Social Sciences Citation Index 2011 SSCI. Network statistics indicate 4 groups of nations: a an Asian-Pacific one to which all Anglo-Saxon nations including the United Kingdom and Ireland are attributed, b a continental European one including also the Latin-American countries, c the Scandinavian nations, and d a community of African nations. Within the EU-28, 11 of the EU-15 states have dominant positions. In many respects, the network parameters are not so different from the Science Citation Index. In addition to these descriptive statistics, we address the question of the relative weights of the international versus domestic networks. An information-theoretical test is proposed at the level of organizational addresses within each nation; the results are mixed, but the international dimension is more important than the national one in the aggregated sets as in the Science Citation Index. In some countries e.g., France, however, the national distribution is leading more than the international one. Decomposition of the United States in terms of states shows a similarly mixed result; more U.S. states are domestically oriented in the SSCI and more internationally in the SCI. The international networks have grown during the last decades in addition to the national ones but not by replacing them.},

abstract = {Online content providers, such as news portals and social media platforms, constantly seek new ways to attract large shares of online attention by keeping their users engaged. A common challenge is to identify which aspects of online interaction influence user engagement the most. In this article, through an analysis of a news article collection obtained from Yahoo News US, we demonstrate that news articles exhibit considerable variation in terms of the sentimentality and polarity of their content, depending on factors such as news provider and genre. Moreover, through a laboratory study, we observe the effect of sentimentality and polarity of news and comments on a set of subjective and objective measures of engagement. In particular, we show that attention, affect, and gaze differ across news of varying interestingness. As part of our study, we also explore methods that exploit the sentiments expressed in user comments to reorder the lists of comments displayed in news pages. Our results indicate that user engagement can be anticipated predicted if we account for the sentimentality and polarity of the content as well as other factors that drive attention and inspire human curiosity.},

abstract = {Recently, an increasing number of information retrieval studies have triggered a resurgence of interest in redefining the algorithmic estimation of relevance, which implies a shift from topical to multidimensional relevance assessment. A key underlying aspect that emerged when addressing this concept is the aggregation of the relevance assessments related to each of the considered dimensions. The most commonly adopted forms of aggregation are based on classical weighted means and linear combination schemes to address this issue. Although some initiatives were recently proposed, none was concerned with considering the inherent dependencies and interactions existing among the relevance criteria, as is the case in many real-life applications. In this article, we present a new fuzzy-based operator, called iAggregator, for multidimensional relevance aggregation. Its main originality, beyond its ability to model interactions between different relevance criteria, lies in its generalization of many classical aggregation functions. To validate our proposal, we apply our operator within a tweet search task. Experiments using a standard benchmark, namely, Text REtrieval Conference Microblog, emphasize the relevance of our contribution when compared with traditional aggregation schemes. In addition, it outperforms state-of-the-art aggregation operators such as the Scoring and the And prioritized operators as well as some representative learning-to-rank algorithms.},

The paper describes the attributes and functionality for a TR, based on a review of published literature, existing TRs, and a survey of experts. A domain model based on user tasks is constructed and a set of core metadata elements for use in TRs is proposed. Ideally, the TR should allow searching as well as browsing for a KOS, matching a user's search while also providing information about existing terminology services, accessible to both humans and machines. The issues surrounding metadata for KOS are also discussed, together with the rationale for different aspects and the importance of a core set of KOS metadata for future machine-based access; a possible core set of metadata elements is proposed. This is dealt with in terms of practical experience and in relation to the Dublin Core Application Profile.},

We contacted these authors to ask about their research processes, with regard to digital archival collections, and their perceptions of the usefulness of digital archival collections to historical research. This study presents a realistic portrayal of the "uses" and "impacts" of digital primary sources from the perspectives of historians who use digital collections for their research projects. The findings from this study indicate that digital archival collections are important source materials for historical studies for various reasons. However, the amount of authority digital materials possess as historical resources was disputed. Many historians preferred documents in their original form, but historians' preferences began to change as they increasingly consulted digital formats. As the web has developed into an important research platform, historians have adopted different research patterns, one of which is using random web searches to find digital primary sources. Historians' understandings of the "use" of digital archival collections revealed a spectrum of activities including finding, understanding, interpreting, and citing digital information. Historians in this study worked concurrently on multiple studies or on a larger project for a book, and each of their searches for digital collections had the potential to provide them with useful results for several research studies.},

abstract = {This article reports the results of a study that examined relationships between primary emotions, secondary emotions, and mood in the online information search context. During the experiment, participants were asked to search Google to obtain information on the two given search tasks. Participants' primary emotions were inferred from analysis of their facial expressions, data on secondary emotions were obtained through participant interviews, and mood was measured using the Positive Affect Negative Affect Scale PANAS; Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988 prior, during, and after the search. The search process was represented by the collection of search actions, search performance, and search outcome quality variables. The findings suggest existence of direct relationships between primary emotions and search actions, which in turn imply the possibility of inferring emotions from search actions and vice versa. The link between secondary emotions and searchers' evaluative judgments, and lack of evidence of any relationships between secondary emotions and other search process variables, point to the strengths and weaknesses of self-reported emotion measures in understanding searchers' affective experiences. Our study did not find strong relationships between mood and search process and outcomes, indicating that while mood can have a limited effect on search activities, it is a relatively stable and long-lasting state that cannot be easily altered by the search experience and, in turn, cannot significantly affect the search. The article proposes a model of relationships between emotions, mood, and several facets of the search process. Directions for future work are also discussed.},

Our results describe the range and variation in access and use control policies and tools employed, identifying both commonalities and distinctions across repositories. Using concepts from commons theory as a guiding theoretical framework, our analysis describes the following five dimensions of repository rules, or data commons boundaries: locus of decision making depositor vs. repository, degree of variation in terms of use within the repository, the mission of the repository in relation to its scholarly field, what use means in relation to specific sorts of data, and types of exclusion.},

This study explores the scattering patterns of patent impact based on citations in 3 distinct technological areas, the liquid crystal, semiconductor, and drug technological areas, to identify the core patents in each area. The research follows the approach from Bradford's law, which equally divides total citations into 3 zones. While the result suggests that the scattering of patent citations corresponded with features of Bradford's law, the proportion of patents in the 3 zones did not match the proportion as proposed by the law. As a result, the study shows that the distributions of citations in all 3 areas were more concentrated than what Bradford's law proposed. The Groos 1967 droop was also presented by the scattering of patent citations, and the growth rate of cumulative citation decreased in the third zone.},

We introduce from the ground up a formal theory of 8 plus 3 structural patterns for XML elements, and verify their identifiability in a number of different XML vocabularies. The results allowed the creation of visualization and content extraction tools that are completely independent of the schema and without any previous knowledge of the semantics and organization of the XML vocabulary of the documents.},

This study aims to examine the information journey experienced by marketing professionals, including task-driven information seeking, information judgments, information use, and information sharing, from a more contextualized and holistic viewpoint. The information journey presents a more comprehensive picture of user-information interaction than is usually offered in the literature. Using a diary method and post-diary in-depth interviews, data consisting of 1,198 diary entries relating to 101 real work tasks were collected over a period of 5 work days. The data were used to ascertain characteristics of the stages of marketing professionals' information journeys as well as the relationships between them. Five stages of the information journey, including determining the need for work task-generated information, seeking such information, judging and evaluating the information found, making sense of and using the obtained information, and sharing the obtained or assembled information, were identified. The information journey also encompassed types of gaps and gap-bridge techniques that occurred during information seeking and use. Based on the empirical findings, an information journey model was developed. The implications for information systems design solutions that enable different stages of the information journey to be linked together are also discussed.},

Recently, methods that exploit named entities have been shown to be more effective for query expansion than traditional pseudorelevance feedback methods. In this article, we introduce a supervised learning approach that exploits named entities for query expansion using Wikipedia as a repository of high-quality feedback documents. In contrast with existing entity-oriented pseudorelevance feedback approaches, we tackle query expansion as a learning-to-rank problem. As a result, not only do we select effective expansion terms but we also weigh these terms according to their predicted effectiveness. To this end, we exploit the rich structure of Wikipedia articles to devise discriminative term features, including each candidate term's proximity to the original query terms, as well as its frequency across multiple article fields and in category and infobox descriptors. Experiments on three Text REtrieval Conference web test collections attest the effectiveness of our approach, with gains of up to 23.32% in terms of mean average precision, 19.49% in terms of precision at 10, and 7.86% in terms of normalized discounted cumulative gain compared with a state-of-the-art approach for entity-oriented query expansion.},

We use a strength value to assess the importance of each citation and propose to use the regression method with a few useful features for automatically estimating the strength value of each citation. Evaluation results on a manually labeled data set in the computer science field show that the estimated values can achieve good correlation with human-labeled values. We further apply the estimated citation strength values for evaluating paper influence and author influence, and the preliminary evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness of the citation strength values.},

If so, sources central to international news may also be central to international recall patterns; in particular, they may reflect an American-centric focus, given the previously proposed central U.S. position in the news marketplace. We asked people of four different nationalities China, Israel, Switzerland, and the United States to list all the countries they could name. We also constructed a network representation of the world for each nation based on the co-occurrence pattern of countries in the news. To compare news and memories, we developed a computational model that predicts the recall order of countries based on the news networks. Consistent with previous reports, the U.S. news was central to the news networks overall. However, although national recall patterns reflected their corresponding national news sources, the Chinese news was substantially better than other national news sources at predicting both individual and aggregate memories across nations. Our results suggest that news and memories are related but may also reflect biases in the way information is transferred to long-term memory, potentially biased against the transient coverage of more "free" presses. We discuss possible explanations for this "Chinese news effect" in relation to prominent cognitive and communications theories.},

This research analyzes funding acknowledgment presence in scientific publications and introduces a novel approach for discovering text patterns by discipline in the acknowledgment section of papers. First, the presence of acknowledgments in 38,257 English-language papers published by Spanish researchers in 2010 is studied by subject area on the basis of the funding acknowledgment information available in the Web of Science database. Funding acknowledgments are present in two thirds of Spanish articles, with significant differences by subject area, number of authors, impact factor of journals, and, in one specific area, basic/applied nature of research. Second, the existence of specific acknowledgment patterns in English-language papers of Spanish researchers in 4 selected subject categories cardiac and cardiovascular systems, economics, evolutionary biology, and statistics and probability is explored through a combination of text mining and multivariate analyses. "Peer interactive communication" predominates in the more theoretical or social-oriented fields statistics and probability, economics, whereas the recognition of technical assistance is more common in experimental research evolutionary biology, and the mention of potential conflicts of interest emerges forcefully in the clinical field cardiac and cardiovascular systems. The systematic inclusion of structured data about acknowledgments in journal articles and bibliographic databases would have a positive impact on the study of collaboration practices in science.},

A recently proposed language-independent approach to plagiarism detection, Citation-based Plagiarism Detection CbPD, allows the detection of semantic similarity even in the absence of text overlap by analyzing the citation placement in a document's full text to determine similarity. This article evaluates the performance of CbPD in detecting plagiarism with various degrees of disguise in a collection of 185,000 biomedical articles. We benchmark CbPD against two character-based detection approaches using a ground truth approximated in a user study. Our evaluation shows that the citation-based approach achieves superior ranking performance for heavily disguised plagiarism forms. Additionally, we demonstrate CbPD to be computationally more efficient than character-based approaches. Finally, upon combining the citation-based with the traditional character-based document similarity visualization methods in a hybrid detection prototype, we observe a reduction in the required user effort for document verification.},

abstract = {Prior studies have shown that articulating and sharing rationales in traditional small-group activities contribute to the maintenance of common ground, members' knowledge awareness, and contribution awareness. It is likely that the importance of articulating and sharing rationales will be increasingly acknowledged in online crowdsourcing because in such a context, large-scale participation is expected with participants often not knowing each other and being flexible about their participation status e.g., participants may join after the activity has started and leave before it completes, and thus more grounding efforts/support are expected. To better understand the role of shared rationales in online crowdsourcing, three experiments were conducted investigating whether and how rationale awareness affects the ideation crowdsourcing task and idea-evaluation crowdsourcing task based on the findings about the rationale awareness effects in small-group idea-generation activities. The results suggest that one's awareness of previous workers' rationales in the current task can slightly improve the average quality of generated ideas in an iterative approach. In addition, one's evaluation of an idea could be positively or negatively affected by the idea's rationale depending on the quality of the rationales. The results also suggest that showing previous workers' rationales in the ideation task may not be an effective approach for improving the best quality of generated ideas.},

Using a data set of 3,972 tags from CiteULike and 6,708 descriptors from Library and Information Science Abstracts LISA from 1,489 scholarly articles of 13 library and information science journals, social network analysis and frequent-pattern tree methods were used to capture and build up the mental models of article indexing of taggers and experts when using keywords, and to generalize their structures and patterns. When measured with respect to the terms used, a power-law distribution, a comparison of terms used as tags and descriptors, social network analysis including centrality, overall structure, and role equivalent and frequent-pattern tree analysis, little similarity was found between the mental models of taggers and experts. Twenty-five patterns of path-based rules and 12 identical rules of frequent-pattern trees were shared by taggers and experts. Title- and topic-related keyword categories were the most popular keyword categories used in path-based rules of frequent-pattern trees, and also the most popular members of 25 patterns and the starting point of the 12 identical rules.},

This study examines the preference for e-books and print books in the contexts of reading purpose, reading situation, and contextual variables such as age, gender, education level, race/ethnicity, income, community type, and Internet use. In addition, this study aims to identify factors that contribute to e-book adoption. Participants were a nationally representative sample of 2,986 people in the United States from the Reading Habits Survey, conducted by the Pew Research Center's Internet &amp; American Life Project http://pewinternet.org/Shared-Content/Data-Sets/2011/December-2011--Reading-Habits.aspx. While the results of this study support the notion that e-books have firmly established a place in people's lives, due to their convenience of access, e-books are not yet positioned to replace print books. Both print books and e-books have unique attributes and serve irreplaceable functions to meet people's reading needs, which may vary by individual demographic, contextual, and situational factors. At this point, the leading significant predictors of e-book adoption are the number of books read, the individual's income, the occurrence and frequency of reading for research topics of interest, and the individual's Internet use, followed by other variables such as race/ethnicity, reading for work/school, age, and education.},

In a primarily linguistic environment such as cyberspace, words are an expressed form of intent and actions. We investigate the functions of words and actions in identifying behavioral anomalies of social actors to safeguard the virtual organization. Social actors are likened to "sensors" as they observe changes in a focal individual's behavior during computer-mediated communications. Based on social psychology theories and pragmatic views of words and actions in online communications, we theorize a dyadic attribution model that helps make sense of anomalous behavior in creative online experiments. This model is then tested in an experiment. Findings show that observation of the behavioral differences between words and actions, based on either external or internal causality, can offer increased ability to detect the compromised trustworthiness of observed individuals-possibly leading to early detection of insider threat potential. The dyadic attribution model developed in this sociotechnical study can function to detect behavioral anomalies in cyberspace, and protect the operations of a virtual organization.},

Unfortunately, less-than-satisfying effectiveness in state-of-the-art information-retrieval techniques is well known, even for some of the best search engines such as Google. In this study, the authors resolve this retrieval ineffectiveness problem by developing a new framework for predicting query performance, which is the first step toward better retrieval effectiveness. Specifically, they examine the relationship between query performance and query context. A query context consists of the query itself, the document collection, and the interaction between the two. The authors first analyze the characteristics of query context and develop various features for predicting query performance. Then, they propose a context-sensitive model for predicting query performance based on the characteristics of the query and the document collection. Finally, they validate this model with respect to five real-world collections of documents and demonstrate its utility in routing queries to the correct repository with high accuracy.},

The overall correlation between Mendeley readership counts and citations for the social sciences was higher than for the humanities. Low and medium correlations between Mendeley bookmarks and citation counts in all the investigated disciplines suggest that these measures reflect different aspects of research impact. Mendeley data were also used to discover patterns of information flow between scientific fields. Comparing information flows based on Mendeley bookmarking data and cross-disciplinary citation analysis for the disciplines revealed substantial similarities and some differences. Thus, the evidence from this study suggests that Mendeley readership data could be used to help capture knowledge transfer across scientific disciplines, especially for people that read but do not author articles, as well as giving impact evidence at an earlier stage than is possible with citation counts.},

To assess how common such practices are and whether they vary by discipline, gender, and country, the authors conducted a large-scale e-mail survey of astronomy and astrophysics, public health, environmental engineering, and philosophy across 15 European countries and analyzed hyperlinks from web CVs of academics. About 60% of the 2,154 survey responses reported having a web CV or something similar, and there were differences between disciplines, genders, and countries. A follow-up outlink analysis of 2,700 web CVs found that a third had at least one outlink to an OA target, typically a public eprint archive or an individual self-archived file. This proportion was considerably higher in astronomy 48% and philosophy 37% than in environmental engineering 29% and public health 21%. There were also differences in linking to publishers' websites, resources, and discussions. Perhaps most important, however, the amount of linking to OA publications seems to be much lower than allowed by publishers and journals, suggesting that many opportunities for disseminating full-text research online are being missed, especially in disciplines without established repositories. Moreover, few academics seem to be exploiting their CVs to link to discussions, resources, or article abstracts, which seems to be another missed opportunity for publicizing research.},

Yet the introduction of such systems has caused much concern about patients' information privacy. This study provides new insights into how privacy concerns play a role in patients' decisions to permit digitization of their personal health information. We conducted an online experiment and collected data from 164 patients who are involved in the nonmandatory EHR adoption in the Netherlands. We found that the negative effect of information privacy concerns on patients' willingness to opt in is influenced by the degree of EHR system interoperability and patients' ability to control disclosure of their information. The results show that, for a networked EHR system, the negative effect of privacy concerns on opt-in behavior was reinforced more than for the stand-alone system. The results also suggest that giving patients greater ability to control their information can alleviate their privacy concerns when they make opt-in decisions. We discuss the implications of these findings.},

abstract = {A user's query is considered to be an imprecise description of their information need. Automatic query expansion is the process of reformulating the original query with the goal of improving retrieval effectiveness. Many successful query expansion techniques model syntagmatic associations that infer two terms co-occur more often than by chance in natural language. However, structural linguistics relies on both syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations to deduce the meaning of a word. Given the success of dependency-based approaches to query expansion and the reliance on word meanings in the query formulation process, we argue that modeling both syntagmatic and paradigmatic information in the query expansion process improves retrieval effectiveness. This article develops and evaluates a new query expansion technique that is based on a formal, corpus-based model of word meaning that models syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations. We demonstrate that when sufficient statistical information exists, as in the case of longer queries, including paradigmatic information alone provides significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness across a wide variety of data sets. More generally, when our new query expansion approach is applied to large-scale web retrieval it demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness over a strong baseline system, based on a commercial search engine.},

In a major research project, we have undertaken this examination. This paper presents an extract from this project, using a global network assessment of these characteristics. We apply our methods to analyze the collaboration networks of a subset of researchers in India through their coauthored papers in peer-reviewed journals and conference proceedings in management science, including related areas of information technology and economics. We find the Indian networks to be currently suffering from a high degree of fragmentation, which severely restricts researchers' long-rage connectivities in the networks.

Among others, the number of retweets RTs and user types are the two important items of analysis for understanding the transmission of information on Twitter. To analyze this point, we applied text classification and feature extraction experiments using random forests machine learning with conventional stylistic and Twitter-specific features. We first collected tweets from 40 accounts with a high number of followers and created tweet texts from 28,756 tweets. We then conducted 15 types of classification experiments using a variety of combinations of features such as function words, speech terms, Twitter's descriptive grammar, and information roles. We deliberately observed the effects of features for classification performance. The results indicated that class classification per user indicated the best performance. Furthermore, we observed that certain features had a greater impact on classification. In the case of the experiments that assessed the level of RT quantity, information roles had an impact. In the case of user experiments, important features, such as the honorific postpositional particle and auxiliary verbs, such as "desu" and "masu," had an impact. This research clarifies the features that are useful for categorizing tweets according to the number of RTs and user types.},

One hundred thirty-seven iSquares were produced and then analyzed using compositional interpretation combined with a theoretical framework of graphic representations. The findings indicate how students visualize information, what was drawn, and associations between the iSquares and prior renderings of information based on words. In the iSquares, information appears most often as pictures of people, artifacts, landscapes, and patterns. There are also many link diagrams, grouping diagrams, symbols, and written text, each with distinct qualities. Methodological reflections address the relationship between visual and textual data, and the sample for the study is critiqued. A discussion presents new directions for theory and research on information, namely, the iSquares as a thinking tool, visual stories of information, and the contradictions of information. Ideas are also provided on the use of arts-informed, visual methods and the draw-and-write technique in the classroom.},

We analyzed whether the flyby of the asteroid elicited more tweets about the asteroid close to the asteroid's trajectory compared to the neutral search term NASA. A spatio-temporal analysis of tweets about NASA revealed a natural movement of the geographical mean from east to west, mirroring the Sun's path through the sky. For the geolocation of users tweeting about the asteroid, this east-west movement changed direction, mirroring the asteroid's trajectory from south-east to north-west as soon as the asteroid was potentially visible from Earth. This effect appears to represent emotionally contagious flocking behavior among Twitter users influenced by the position of the asteroid itself.},

abstract = {How to provide users a positive experience during interaction with information i.e., the "Information eXperience" IX is still an open question. As a starting point, this work investigates how the emotion of interest can be influenced by modifying the complexity of the information presented to users. The appraisal theory of interest suggests a "sweet spot" where interest will be at its peak: information that is novel and complex yet still comprehensible. This "sweet spot" is approximated using two studies. Study One develops a computational model of textual complexity founded on psycholinguistic theory on processing difficulty. The model was trained and tested on 12,420 articles, achieving a classification performance of 90.87% on two classes of complexity. Study Two puts the model to its ultimate test: Its application to change the user's IX. Using 18 news articles the influence of complexity on interest and its appraisals is unveiled. A structural equation model shows a positive influence of complexity on interest, yet a negative influence of comprehensibility, confirming a seemingly paradoxical relationship between complexity and interest. By showing when complexity becomes interesting, this paper shows how information systems can use the model of textual complexity to construct an interesting IX.},

In a naturalistic setting and across a range of curriculum areas, it investigated the behavior of secondary school students undertaking information search tasks. Research questions focused on students' criteria for assessing the relevance and reliability of information. Thirty-seven students between 14 and 17 years of age from a southeastern Australian school participated. The study collected data from journals; interviews, including video-stimulated recall interviews; think-aloud reports; video screen captures; and questionnaires. Data analysis culminated in grounded theory. Initial judgments of an item's relevance were based on comprehensibility, completeness of source, whether the item needed to be purchased, whether video sources were suitable, and whether factual or opinionative material met students' needs. Participants preferred information that provided topic overviews, information that linked to prior knowledge, and sources that treated topics in acceptable depth and were structured to facilitate accessibility. Students derived clues about reliability from URLs and considered the reputation of sources. The ability of an item to corroborate prior knowledge, its graphic design, its style of writing, and the perceived authority of its creators influenced participants' decisions about reliability.},

Social support is crucial to the well-being and quality of life of people with unpredictable and incurable diseases such as ALS.

This qualitative analysis of 1,000 posts from the PLM ALS online discussion examines the social support within the PLM ALS online community and explores ways community members share and build knowledge. The analysis responds to 3 research questions: RQ1: How and why is knowledge shared among the distributed participants in the PLM-ALS threaded discussion forum?; RQ2: How do the participants in the PLM-ALS threaded discussion forum work together to discover knowledge about treatments and to keep knowledge discovered over time?; and RQ3: How do participants in the PLM-ALS forum co-create and treat authoritative knowledge from multiple sources including the medical literature, healthcare professionals, lived experiences of patients and "other" sources of information such as lay literature and alternative health providers? The findings have implications for supporting knowledge sharing and discovery in addition to social support for patients.},

Is their relevance judgment affected by contextual factors, such as location and time? How do message content and contextual factors affect users' privacy concerns? With a focus on mobile ads, we propose a research model based on theories of relevance judgment and mobile marketing research. We suggest topicality, reliability, and economic value as key content factors and location and time as key contextual factors. We found mobile relevance judgment is affected mainly by content factors, whereas privacy concerns are affected by both content and contextual factors. Moreover, topicality and economic value have a synergetic effect that makes a message more relevant. Higher topicality and location precision exacerbate privacy concerns, whereas message reliability alleviates privacy concerns caused by location precision. These findings reveal an interesting intricacy in user relevance judgment and privacy concerns and provide nuanced guidance for the design and delivery of mobile commercial information.},

Some of the key problems that hamper their search experience is their limited vocabulary, their difficulty in using the right keywords, and the inappropriateness of their general-purpose query suggestions. In this work, we propose a method that uses tags from social media to suggest queries related to children's topics. Concretely, we propose a simple yet effective approach to bias a random walk defined on a bipartite graph of web resources and tags through keywords that are more commonly used to describe resources for children. We evaluate our method using a large query log sample of queries submitted by children. We show that our method outperforms by a large margin the query suggestions of modern search engines and state-of-the art query suggestions based on random walks. We improve further the quality of the ranking by combining the score of the random walk with topical and language modeling features to emphasize even more the child-related aspects of the query suggestions.},

We compare 3 distributional similarity measures Lin's, Weeds's, and balAPinc, and a document retrieval function, BM25, adapted as a word similarity measure. We then introduce a method for identifying multiword aspects by using a combination of syntactic rules and a co-occurrence association measure. Finally, we describe a method for ranking multiword aspects by the likelihood of belonging to the target aspect category.

In both cases, the authors report a how the research articles are distributed by topic and b what approaches, research strategies, and methods were applied in the articles. In 2005, the largest research areas in LIS by this measure were information storage and retrieval, scientific communication, library and information-service activities, and information seeking. The same research areas constituted the quantitative core of LIS in the previous years since 1965. Information retrieval has been the most popular area of research over the years. The proportion of research on library and information-service activities decreased after 1985, but the popularity of information seeking and of scientific communication grew during the period studied. The viewpoint of research has shifted from library and information organizations to end users and development of systems for the latter. The proportion of empirical research strategies was high and rose over time, with the survey method being the single most important method. However, attention to evaluation and experiments increased considerably after 1985. Conceptual research strategies and system analysis, description, and design were quite popular, but declining. The most significant changes from 1965 to 2005 are the decreasing interest in library and information-service activities and the growth of research into information seeking and scientific communication.},

However, only a limited number of studies have showed the relationship between cognitive styles and web search behavior. Most importantly, it is not clear which components of web search behavior are influenced by cognitive styles. This article examines the relationships between users' cognitive styles and their web searching and develops a model that portrays the relationship. The study uses qualitative and quantitative analyses based on data gathered from 50 participants. A questionnaire was utilized to collect participants' demographic information, and Riding's 1991 Cognitive Styles Analysis CSA test to assess their cognitive styles. Results show that users' cognitive styles influenced their information-searching strategies, query reformulation behavior, web navigational styles, and information-processing approaches. The user model developed in this study depicts the fundamental relationships between users' web search behavior and their cognitive styles. Modeling web search behavior with a greater understanding of users' cognitive styles can help information science researchers and information systems designers to bridge the semantic gap between the user and the systems. Implications of the research for theory and practice, and future work, are discussed.},

These systems allow users to associate geolocation information with their images, which is essential for many interesting applications. However, only a small fraction of social images have geolocation information. Thus, an automated tool for suggesting geolocation is essential to help users geotag their images. In this article, we use a large data set consisting of 221 million Flickr images uploaded by 2.2 million users. For the first time, we analyze user uploading patterns, user geotagging behaviors, and the relationship between the taken-time gap and the geographical distance between two images from the same user. Based on the findings, we represent a user profile by historical tags for the user and build a multinomial model on the user profile for geotagging. We further propose a unified framework to suggest geolocations for images, which combines the information from both image tags and the user profile. Experimental results show that for images uploaded by users who have never done geotagging, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 10.6 to 34.2%, depending on the granularity of the prediction. For images from users who have done geotagging, a simple method is able to achieve very high accuracy.},

abstract = {Metadata quality presents a challenge faced by many digital repositories. There is a variety of proposed quality assurance frameworks applied in repositories that are deployed in various contexts. Although studies report that there is an improvement of the quality of the metadata in many of the applications, the transfer of a successful approach from one application context to another has not been studied to a satisfactory extent. This article presents the empirical results of the application of a metadata quality assurance process that has been developed and successfully applied in an educational context learning repositories to 2 different application contexts to compare results with the previous application and assess its generalizability. More specifically, it reports results from the adaptation and application of this process in a library context institutional repositories and in a cultural context digital cultural repositories. Initial empirical findings indicate that content providers seem to be gaining a better understanding of metadata when the proposed process is put in place and that the quality of the produced metadata records increases.},

Combining data from the entirety of arXiv and the Web of Science WoS, this article investigates a the proportion of papers across all disciplines that are on arXiv and the proportion of arXiv papers that are in the WoS, b the elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication, and c the aging characteristics and scientific impact of arXiv e-prints and their published version. It shows that the proportion of WoS papers found on arXiv varies across the specialties of physics and mathematics, and that only a few specialties make extensive use of the repository. Elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication has shortened but remains longer in mathematics than in physics. In physics, mathematics, as well as in astronomy and astrophysics, arXiv versions are cited more promptly and decay faster than WoS papers. The arXiv versions of papers-both published and unpublished-have lower citation rates than published papers, although there is almost no difference in the impact of the arXiv versions of published and unpublished papers.},

Author profiles can be useful for evaluation purposes once the advantages and the shortcomings of these services are described and taken into consideration. In total, 771 personal profiles appearing in both the MAS and the GSC databases were analyzed. Results show that the GSC profiles include more documents and citations than those in MAS but with a strong bias toward the information and computing sciences, whereas the MAS profiles are disciplinarily better balanced. MAS shows technical problems such as a higher number of duplicated profiles and a lower updating rate than GSC. It is concluded that both services could be used for evaluation proposes only if they are applied along with other citation indices as a way to supplement that information.},

abstract = {Source-based writing assignments conducted by groups of students are a common learning task used in information literacy instruction. The fundamental assumption in group assignments is that students' collaboration substantially enhances their learning. The present study focused on the group work strategies adopted by upper secondary school students in source-based writing assignments. Seventeen groups authored Wikipedia or Wikipedia-style articles and were interviewed during and after the assignment. Group work strategies were analyzed in 6 activities: planning, searching, assessing sources, reading, writing, and editing. The students used 2 cooperative strategies: delegation and division of work, and 2 collaborative strategies: pair and group collaboration. Division of work into independently conducted parts was the most popular group work strategy. Also group collaboration, where students worked together to complete an activity, was commonly applied. Division of work was justified by efficiency in completing the project and by ease of control in the fair division of contributions. The motivation behind collaboration was related to quality issues and shared responsibility. We suggest that the present designs of learning tasks lead students to avoid collaboration, increasing the risk of low learning outcomes in information literacy instruction.},

abstract = {While term independence is a widely held assumption in most of the established information retrieval approaches, it is clearly not true and various works in the past have investigated a relaxation of the assumption. One approach is to use n-grams in document representation instead of unigrams. However, the majority of early works on n-grams obtained only modest performance improvement. On the other hand, the use of information based on supporting terms or "contexts" of queries has been found to be promising. In particular, recent studies showed that using new context-dependent term weights improved the performance of relevance feedback RF retrieval compared with using traditional bag-of-words BM25 term weights. Calculation of the new term weights requires an estimation of the local probability of relevance of each query term occurrence. In previous studies, the estimation of this probability was based on unigrams that occur in the neighborhood of a query term. We explore an integration of the n-gram and context approaches by computing context-dependent term weights based on a mixture of unigrams and bigrams. Extensive experiments are performed using the title queries of the Text Retrieval Conference TREC-6, TREC-7, TREC-8, and TREC-2005 collections, for RF with relevance judgment of either the top 10 or top 20 documents of an initial retrieval. We identify some crucial elements needed in the use of bigrams in our methods, such as proper inverse document frequency IDF weighting of the bigrams and noise reduction by pruning bigrams with large document frequency values. We show that enhancing context-dependent term weights with bigrams is effective in further improving retrieval performance.},

By allowing low-barrier participation through a social media system, scholars both as authors and users can participate in the metadata editing and enhancing process and benefit from more accurate and effective information retrieval. Our experimental web system ScholarWiki uses machine learning techniques, which automatically produce increasingly refined metadata by learning from the structural metadata contributed by scholars. The cumulated structural metadata add intelligence and automatically enhance and update recursively the quality of metadata, wiki pages, and the machine-learning model.},

We use the same Thomson Reuters data set of about 4.4 million articles used in Crespo etal. 2013a to analyze 22 broad fields. The main results are the following: First, when the classification system goes from 22 fields to 219 subfields the effect on citation inequality of differences in citation practices increases from ~14% at the field level to 18% at the subfield level. Second, we estimate a set of exchange rates ERs over a wide [660, 978] citation quantile interval to express the citation counts of articles into the equivalent counts in the all-sciences case. In the fractional case, for example, we find that in 187 of 219 subfields the ERs are reliable in the sense that the coefficient of variation is smaller than or equal to 0.10. Third, in the fractional case the normalization of the raw data using the ERs or subfield mean citations as normalization factors reduces the importance of the differences in citation practices from 18% to 3.8% 3.4% of overall citation inequality. Fourth, the results in the fractional case are essentially replicated when we adopt a multiplicative approach.},

Communities may evolve over time, because of changes in users' interests, activities, and new users joining the network. To better understand user interactions in CQA communities, it is necessary to analyze the community structures and track community evolution over time. Existing work in CQA focuses on question searching or content quality detection, and the important problems of community extraction and evolutionary pattern detection have not been studied. In this article, we propose a probabilistic community model PCM to extract overlapping community structures and capture their evolution patterns in CQA. The empirical results show that our algorithm appears to improve the community extraction quality. We show empirically, using the iPhone data set, that interesting community evolution patterns can be discovered, with each evolution pattern reflecting the variation of users' interests over time. Our analysis suggests that individual users could benefit to gain comprehensive information from tracking the transition of products. We also show that the communities provide a decision-making basis for business.},

We describe the knowledge loss that occurs when information is aggregated across diverse ontologies into databases or archives relying on a single schema and use a series of illustrative examples demonstrate the significance of this information loss for policy design and implementation. While there are important gains from information aggregation across ontologies, the potential trade-offs involved in creating large-scale databases are significant. The differences between locally constituted ways of knowing and the organizing ontology used for larger scale databases affects the extent to which these collections, or "knowledge banks," provide accurate guidance for policy and action. The article draws on insights from information science and social science to discuss two classes of socio-technical approaches for overcoming information loss at the interface between ontologies: first, technology-enabled efforts to soften ontological interfaces by making data open, unconstructed, and available and/or creating ontologies collaboratively and, second, organizational changes that reduce the need for information to cross interfaces, such as reconstructing knowledge platforms to be more interactive, thereby decentralizing decision-making. The framing of the challenges involved in building large-scale knowledge banks as a matter of ontology mismatch creates an opportunity for an interdisciplinary and analytically integrated research agenda to implement and test these potential approaches.},

During the first step, real-world heuristics on coauthors are able to produce highly pure although fragmented clusters. The most representative of these clusters are then selected to serve as training data for the third supervised author assignment step. The third step exploits a state-of-the-art transductive disambiguation method capable of detecting unseen authors not included in any training example and incorporating reliable predictions to the training data. Experiments conducted with standard public collections, using the minimum set of attributes present in a citation, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms all representative unsupervised author grouping disambiguation methods and is very competitive with fully supervised author assignment methods. Thus, different from other bootstrapping methods that explore privileged, hard to obtain information such as self-citations and personal information, our proposed method produces topnotch performance with no manual training data or parameterization and in the presence of scarce information.},

abstract = {Science linkage is a widely used patent bibliometric indicator to measure patent linkage to scientific research based on the frequency of citations to scientific papers within the patent. Science linkage is also regarded as noisy because the subject of patent citation behavior varies from inventors/applicants to examiners. In order to identify and ultimately reduce this noise, we analyzed the different citing motivations of examiners and inventors/applicants. We built 4 hypotheses based upon our study of patent law, the unique economic nature of a patent, and a patent citation's market effect. To test our hypotheses, we conducted an expert survey based on our science linkage calculation in the domain of catalyst from U.S. patent data 2006-2009 over 3 types of citations: self-citation by inventor/applicant, non-self-citation by inventor/applicant, and citation by examiner. According to our results, evaluated by domain experts, we conclude that the non-self-citation by inventor/applicant is quite noisy and cannot indicate science linkage and that self-citation by inventor/applicant, although limited, is more appropriate for understanding science linkage.},

Articles reviewed in these blogs therefore receive "blog citations." We hypothesized that articles receiving blog citations close to their publication time receive more journal citations later than the articles in the same journal published in the same year that did not receive such blog citations. Statistically significant evidence for articles published in 2009 and 2010 support this hypothesis for seven of 12 journals 58% in 2009 and 13 of 19 journals 68% in 2010.

abstract = {This study explores the effect of interaction in research on knowledge creation KC and its dependence on the conceptualization of a human being. A framework for understanding KC with hermeneutic phenomenology is developed, based on an analysis of recent KC research and key texts on hermeneutic phenomenology. The results obtained indicate that recent KC research still emphasizes the concept of knowledge as an asset inside the human mind, although the interest is in knowing and interpersonal relationships in working communities. Exploration of the use of the effect of interaction in research on KC shows that successful interaction is connected to the ideas of openness, critical thinking, and awareness of past experiences. These elements reflect the general ideas of the hermeneutic tradition without taking into account the historical roots of hermeneutics or questioning the concept of a human being behind them. It is concluded that the hermeneutic circle and phenomenological conceptualization of a human being provide a better defined and more coherent structure for understanding the event of KC as a future-oriented, conscious act of interaction. The framework developed offers three fundamental areas for exploration: structure of the interactive event, construction of the human experience in interaction, and modes of being in interaction.},

abstract = {Most measures of networks are based on the nodes, although links are also elementary units in networks and represent interesting social or physical connections. In this work we suggest an option for exploring networks, called the h-strength, with explicit focus on links and their strengths. The h-strength and its extensions can naturally simplify a complex network to a small and concise subnetwork h-subnet but retains the most important links with its core structure. Its applications in 2 typical information networks, the paper cocitation network of a topic the h-index and 5 scientific collaboration networks in the field of "water resources," suggest that h-strength and its extensions could be a useful choice for abstracting, simplifying, and visualizing a complex network. Moreover, we observe that the 2 informetric models, the Gl\"{a}nzel-Schubert model and the Hirsch model, roughly hold in the context of the h-strength for the collaboration networks.},

We find that web technologies continue to drive developments, especially at the research front, although perhaps more indirectly than before. A broadening of perspectives is visible in IS 2006-2010, where network science becomes influential and where full-text analysis methods complement traditional computer science influences. Research in the areas of the h-index and mapping of science appears to have been highlights of IS 2006-2011. This study tests and confirms a forecast made previously by comparing knowledge-base and research-front findings for IS 2001-2005, which expected both the information retrieval IR systems and webometrics specialties to shrink in 2006 to 2010. A corresponding comparison of the knowledge base and research front of IS 2006-2010 suggests a continuing decline of the IR systems specialty in the near future, but also a considerable regrowth of the webometrics area after a period of decline from 2001 to 2005 and 2006 to 2010, with the latter due perhaps in part to its contribution to an emerging web science.},

To demonstrate the performance of the proposed analytical framework, we conducted an experimental study on 2 major human immunodeficiency virus HIV/acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS forums in Taiwan. The experimental results show that the classification accuracy increased significantly up to 83.83% when using features selected by the information gain technique. The results also show the importance of adopting domain-specific features in analyzing unusual messages on web forums. This study has practical implications for the prevention and support of HIV/AIDS healthcare. For example, public health agencies can re-allocate resources and deliver services to people who need help via social media sites. In addition, individuals can also join a social media site to get better suggestions and support from each other.},

abstract = {A systematic understanding of factors and criteria that affect consumers' selection of sources for health information is necessary for the design of effective health information services and information systems. However, current studies have overly focused on source attributes as indicators for 2 criteria, source quality and accessibility, and overlooked the role of other factors and criteria that help determine source selection. To fill this gap, guided by decision-making theories and the cognitive perspective to information search, we interviewed 30 participants about their reasons for using a wide range of sources for health information. Additionally, we asked each of them to report a critical incident in which sources were selected to fulfill a specific information need. Based on the analysis of the transcripts, 5 categories of factors were identified as influential to source selection: source-related factors, user-related factors, user-source relationships, characteristics of the problematic situation, and social influences. In addition, about a dozen criteria that mediate the influence of the factors on source-selection decisions were identified, including accessibility, quality, usability, interactivity, relevance, usefulness, familiarity, affection, anonymity, and appropriateness. These results significantly expanded the current understanding of the nature of costs and benefits involved in source-selection decisions, and strongly indicated that a personalized approach is needed for information services and information systems to provide effective access to health information sources for consumers.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, the volume of information available digitally over the Internet has grown enormously. Technical developments in the area of search, such as Google's Page Rank algorithm, have proved so good at serving relevant results that Internet search has become integrated into daily human activity. One can endlessly explore topics of interest simply by querying and reading through the resulting links. Yet, although search engines are well known for providing relevant results based on users' queries, users do not always receive the results they are looking for. Google's Director of Research describes clickstream evidence of frustrated users repeatedly reformulating queries and searching through page after page of results. Given the general quality of search engine results, one must consider the possibility that the frustrated user's query is not effective; that is, it does not describe the essence of the user's interest. Indeed, extensive research into human search behavior has found that humans are not very effective at formulating good search queries that describe what they are interested in. Ideally, the user should simply point to a portion of text that sparked the user's interest, and a system should automatically formulate a search query that captures the essence of the text. In this paper, we describe an implemented system that provides this capability. We first describe how our work differs from existing work in automatic query formulation, and propose a new method for improved quantification of the relevance of candidate search terms drawn from input text using phrase-level analysis. We then propose an implementable method designed to provide relevant queries based on a user's text input. We demonstrate the quality of our results and performance of our system through experimental studies. Our results demonstrate that our system produces relevant search terms with roughly two-thirds precision and recall compared to search terms selected by experts, and that typical users find significantly more relevant results 31% more relevant more quickly 64% faster using our system than self-formulated search queries. Further, we show that our implementation can scale to request loads of up to 10 requests per second within current online responsiveness expectations &lt;2-second response times at the highest loads tested.},

The evaluation approach included scenario-based navigation exercises and postexercise interviews. Navigation exercise errors and underlying reasons were analyzed in relation to specific components of the taxonomy and applied construction steps. Guidelines for the construction of the hierarchical structure and categories of an organizational taxonomy using existing general classification schemes and domain thesauri were derived from the evaluation results.},

Conversely, we did observe a sharp decline in single-author publishing. We further demonstrate that coauthored SSH articles in journals indexed in the Web of Science WoS generally have a higher and growing number of coauthors than do either those in non-WoS journals or book chapters. This illustrates the need to include non-WoS data and book chapters when studying coauthorship in the SSH.},

abstract = {Web search engines are important gateways for users to access health information. This study explored whether a search interface based on the Bing API and enabled by Scatter/Gather, a well-known document-clustering technique, can improve health information searches. Forty participants without medical backgrounds were randomly assigned to two interfaces: a baseline interface that resembles typical web search engines and a Scatter/Gather interface. Both groups performed two lookup and two exploratory health-related tasks. It was found that the baseline group was more likely to rephrase queries and less likely to access general-purpose sites than the Scatter/Gather group when completing exploratory tasks. Otherwise, the two groups did not differ in behavior and task performance, with participants in the Scatter/Gather group largely overlooking the features key words, clusters, and the recluster function designed to facilitate the exploration of semantic relationships between information objects, a potentially useful means for users in the rather unfamiliar domain of health. The results suggest a strong effect of users' mental models of search on their use of search interfaces and a high cognitive cost associated with using the Scatter/Gather features. It follows that novel features of a search interface should not only be compatible with users' mental models but also provide sufficient affordance to inform users of how they can be used. Compared with the interface, tasks showed more significant impacts on search behavior. In future studies, more effort should be devoted to identify salient features of health-related information needs.},

The article describes the structural, descriptive, and referential SDR elements of the metadata model and explains the underlying assumptions and justifications for each major component in the model. ScholarWiki, an experimental system developed as a proof of concept, was built over the wiki platform to allow user interaction with the metadata and the editing, deleting, and adding of metadata. By allowing and encouraging scholars both as authors and as users to participate in the knowledge and metadata editing and enhancing process, the larger community will benefit from more accurate and effective information retrieval. The ScholarWiki system utilizes machine-learning techniques that can automatically produce self-enhanced metadata by learning from the structural metadata that scholars contribute, which will add intelligence to enhance and update automatically the publication of metadata Wiki pages.},

Our findings suggest that most participants in these discussions were concerned with the notability and credibility of the topics presented for deletion, and that most presented rationales rooted in established site policies. We found that factors like article topic and unanimity or lack thereof were among the factors that tended to affect the outcome of the debate. Our results also suggested that the blackout of the site in response to the proposed Stop Online Piracy Act SOPA law affected the decisions of deletion debates that occurred close to the event.

The analysis is based on 1.4 million documents covered by both PubMed and Web of Science and published between 2010 and 2012. The number of tweets containing links to these documents was analyzed and compared to citations to evaluate the degree to which certain journals, disciplines, and specialties were represented on Twitter and how far tweets correlate with citation impact. With less than 10% of PubMed articles mentioned on Twitter, its uptake is low in general but differs between journals and specialties. Correlations between tweets and citations are low, implying that impact metrics based on tweets are different from those based on citations. A framework using the coverage of articles and the correlation between Twitter mentions and citations is proposed to facilitate the evaluation of novel social-media-based metrics.},

The matrix V=X,Y,ZT constructs a measure of academic performance, in which the 9 numbers can all be provided with meanings in different dimensions. The "academic trace" trV of this matrix follows naturally, and contributes a unique indicator for total academic achievements by summarizing and weighting the accumulation of publications and citations. This measure can also be used to combine the advantages of the h-index and the integrated impact indicator I3 into a single number with a meaningful interpretation of the values.

abstract = {Log analysis shows that PubMed users frequently use author names in queries for retrieving scientific literature. However, author name ambiguity may lead to irrelevant retrieval results. To improve the PubMed user experience with author name queries, we designed an author name disambiguation system consisting of similarity estimation and agglomerative clustering. A machine-learning method was employed to score the features for disambiguating a pair of papers with ambiguous names. These features enable the computation of pairwise similarity scores to estimate the probability of a pair of papers belonging to the same author, which drives an agglomerative clustering algorithm regulated by 2 factors: name compatibility and probability level. With transitivity violation correction, high precision author clustering is achieved by focusing on minimizing false-positive pairing. Disambiguation performance is evaluated with manual verification of random samples of pairs from clustering results. When compared with a state-of-the-art system, our evaluation shows that among all the pairs the lumping error rate drops from 10.1% to 2.2% for our system, while the splitting error rises from 1.8% to 7.7%. This results in an overall error rate of 9.9%, compared with 11.9% for the state-of-the-art method. Other evaluations based on gold standard data also show the increase in accuracy of our clustering. We attribute the performance improvement to the machine-learning method driven by a large-scale training set and the clustering algorithm regulated by a name compatibility scheme preferring precision. With integration of the author name disambiguation system into the PubMed search engine, the overall click-through-rate of PubMed users on author name query results improved from 34.9% to 36.9%.},

abstract = {The use of robo-readers to analyze news texts is an emerging technology trend in computational finance. Recent research has developed sophisticated financial polarity lexicons for investigating how financial sentiments relate to future company performance. However, based on experience from fields that commonly analyze sentiment, it is well known that the overall semantic orientation of a sentence may differ from that of individual words. This article investigates how semantic orientations can be better detected in financial and economic news by accommodating the overall phrase-structure information and domain-specific use of language. Our three main contributions are the following: a a human-annotated finance phrase bank that can be used for training and evaluating alternative models; b a technique to enhance financial lexicons with attributes that help to identify expected direction of events that affect sentiment; and c a linearized phrase-structure model for detecting contextual semantic orientations in economic texts. The relevance of the newly added lexicon features and the benefit of using the proposed learning algorithm are demonstrated in a comparative study against general sentiment models as well as the popular word frequency models used in recent financial studies. The proposed framework is parsimonious and avoids the explosion in feature space caused by the use of conventional n-gram features.},

Only a comparison with the performance of all other institutions makes it possible to say exactly where an institution stands. In order to interpret the results of the SCImago Institutions Ranking based on Scopus data and the Leiden Ranking based on Web of Science data, in this study we offer thresholds with which it is possible to assess whether an institution belongs to the top 1%, top 5%, top 10%, top 25%, or top 50% of institutions in the world. The thresholds are based on the excellence rate or PPtop 10%. Both indicators measure the proportion of an institution's publications which belong to the 10% most frequently cited publications and are the most important indicators for measuring institutional impact. For example, while an institution must achieve a value of 24.63% in the Leiden Ranking 2013 to be considered one of the top 1% of institutions worldwide, the SCImago Institutions Ranking requires 30.2%.},

With millions of users, these are a significant addition to the scholarly communication and academic information-seeking eco-structure. There is thus a need to understand the role that they play and the changes, if any, that they can make to the dynamics of academic careers. This article investigates attributes of philosophy scholars on Academia.edu, introducing a median-based, time-normalizing method to adjust for time delays in joining the site. In comparison to students, faculty tend to attract more profile views but female philosophers did not attract more profile views than did males, suggesting that academic capital drives philosophy uses of the site more than does friendship and networking. Secondary analyses of law, history, and computer science confirmed the faculty advantage in terms of higher profile views except for females in law and females in computer science. There was also a female advantage for both faculty and students in law and computer science as well as for history students. Hence, Academia.edu overall seems to reflect a hybrid of scholarly norms the faculty advantage and a female advantage that is suggestive of general social networking norms. Finally, traditional bibliometric measures did not correlate with any Academia.edu metrics for philosophers, perhaps because more senior academics use the site less extensively or because of the range informal scholarly activities that cannot be measured by bibliometric methods.},

We find that technological progress has contributed between two to six times more than additional technological infrastructure. While infrastructure seems to reach a certain level of saturation at roughly 20 storage devices per capita and 2 to 3 telecommunication subscriptions per capita, informational capacities are still expanding greatly. Besides progress in better hardware, software for information compression turns out to be an important and often neglected driver of the global growth of technologically-mediated information and communication capacities.},

The study found that tags provide much descriptive information about an image but that users also value and trust controlled vocabulary terms. The study found no correlation between tag length and assignment order, and tag length and its perceived usefulness. The findings of this study can contribute to the design of controlled vocabularies, indexing processes, and retrieval systems for images. In particular, the findings of the study can advance the understanding of image tagging practices, tag facet/category distributions, relative usefulness and importance of these categories to the user, and potential mechanisms for identifying useful terms.},

We created a comprehensive data set based on over 1,100 sources that allows measuring information capacity directly, in bits per second, bits, and instructions per second. The newly proposed indicators provide insights into inequalities in access to, usage of, and impact of digitized information flows. It shows that the digital divide has gone into a second stage, which is based on a relative universalization of technological devices and a continuously evolving divide in terms of communication capacity.},

We also examined the effect of some Google Trends features, namely, limiting the search to a specific country or topic category on the search volume data.

We found that pairs and multiple authors used significantly more tables and graphs than single authors.

abstract = {Group-based trajectory modeling GBTM is applied to the citation curves of articles in six journals and to all citable items in a single field of science virology, 24 journals to distinguish among the developmental trajectories in subpopulations. Can citation patterns of highly-cited papers be distinguished in an early phase as "fast-breaking" papers? Can "late bloomers" or "sleeping beauties" be identified? Most interesting, we find differences between "sticky knowledge claims" that continue to be cited more than 10 years after publication and "transient knowledge claims" that show a decay pattern after reaching a peak within a few years. Only papers following the trajectory of a "sticky knowledge claim" can be expected to have a sustained impact. These findings raise questions about indicators of "excellence" that use aggregated citation rates after 2 or 3 years e.g., impact factors. Because aggregated citation curves can also be composites of the two patterns, fifth-order polynomials with four bending points are needed to capture citation curves precisely. For the journals under study, the most frequently cited groups were furthermore much smaller than 10%. Although GBTM has proved a useful method for investigating differences among citation trajectories, the methodology does not allow us to define a percentage of highly cited papers inductively across different fields and journals. Using multinomial logistic regression, we conclude that predictor variables such as journal names, number of authors, etc., do not affect the stickiness of knowledge claims in terms of citations but only the levels of aggregated citations which are field-specific.},

abstract = {Previous research indicates that during the past 20 years, the highest-quality work has been published in an increasingly diverse and larger group of journals. In this article, we examine whether this diversification has also affected the handful of elite journals that are traditionally considered to be the best. We examine citation patterns during the past 40 years of seven long-standing traditionally elite journals and six journals that have been increasing in importance during the past 20 years. To be among the top 5% or 1% cited papers, papers now need about twice as many citations as they did 40 years ago. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s, elite journals have been publishing a decreasing proportion of these top-cited papers. This also applies to the two journals that are typically considered as the top venues and often used as bibliometric indicators of "excellence": Science and Nature. On the other hand, several new and established journals are publishing an increasing proportion of the most-cited papers. These changes bring new challenges and opportunities for all parties. Journals can enact policies to increase or maintain their relative position in the journal hierarchy. Researchers now have the option to publish in more diverse venues knowing that their work can still reach the same audiences. Finally, evaluators and administrators need to know that although there will always be a certain prestige associated with publishing in "elite" journals, journal hierarchies are in constant flux.},

The map is then used to define discipline-like structures consisting of natural groupings of articles and clusters of articles. This combination of detail and high-level structure can be used to address planning-related problems such as identification of emerging topics and the identification of which areas of science and technology are innovative and which are simply persisting. In addition to presenting the model and map, several process improvements that result in greater accuracy structures are detailed, including a bibliographic coupling approach for assigning current papers to cocitation clusters and a sequential hybrid approach to producing visual maps from models.},

In this article, we show the results of an experiment undertaken to analyze Google Scholar's capacity to detect citation-counting manipulation. For this, we uploaded 6 documents to an institutional web domain that were authored by a fictitious researcher and referenced all the publications of the members of the EC3 research group at the University of Granada. The detection by Google Scholar of these papers caused an outburst in the number of citations included in the Google Scholar Citations profiles of the authors.

abstract = {F1000 is a postpublication peer review service for biological and medical research. F1000 recommends important publications in the biomedical literature, and from this perspective F1000 could be an interesting tool for research evaluation. By linking the complete database of F1000 recommendations to the Web of Science bibliographic database, we are able to make a comprehensive comparison between F1000 recommendations and citations. We find that about 2% of the publications in the biomedical literature receive at least one F1000 recommendation. Recommended publications on average receive 1.30 recommendations, and more than 90% of the recommendations are given within half a year after a publication has appeared. There turns out to be a clear correlation between F1000 recommendations and citations. However, the correlation is relatively weak, at least weaker than the correlation between journal impact and citations. More research is needed to identify the main reasons for differences between recommendations and citations in assessing the impact of publications.},

abstract = {Complex cognitive activities, such as analytical reasoning, problem solving, and sense making, are often performed through the mediation of interactive computational tools. Examples include visual analytics, decision support, and educational tools. Through interaction with visual representations of information at the visual interface of these tools, a joint, coordinated cognitive system is formed. This partnership results in a number of relational properties-those depending on both humans and tools-that researchers and designers must be aware of if such tools are to effectively support the performance of complex cognitive activities. This article presents 10 properties of interactive visual representations that are essential and relational and whose values can be adjusted through interaction. By adjusting the values of these properties, better coordination between humans and tools can be effected, leading to higher quality performance of complex cognitive activities. This article examines how the values of these properties affect cognitive processing and visual reasoning and demonstrates the necessity of making their values adjustable-all of which is situated within a broader theoretical framework concerned with human-information interaction in complex cognitive activities. This framework can facilitate systematic research, design, and evaluation in numerous fields including information visualization, health informatics, visual analytics, and educational technology.},

abstract = {Health research shows that knowing about health risks may not translate into behavior change. However, such research typically operationalizes health information acquisition with knowledge tests. Information scientists who investigate socially embedded information behaviors could help improve understanding of potential associations between information behavior-as opposed to knowledge-and health behavior formation, thus providing new opportunities to investigate the effects of health information. We examine the associations between information behavior and HIV testing intentions among young men who have sex with men YMSM, a group with high rates of unrecognized HIV infection. We used the theory of planned behavior TPB to predict intentions to seek HIV testing in an online sample of 163 YMSM. Multiple regression and recursive path analysis were used to test two models: a the basic TPB model and b an adapted model that added the direct effects of three information behaviors information exposure, use of information to make HIV-testing decisions, prior experience obtaining an HIV test plus self-rated HIV knowledge. As hypothesized, our adapted model improved predictions, explaining more than twice as much variance as the original TPB model. The results suggest that information behaviors may be more important predictors of health behavior intentions than previously acknowledged.},

abstract = {Several researchers have studied serendipitous knowledge discovery in information-seeking behavior. Electronic data in the form of semantic predications have a potential role in literature-based discovery, which can be guided by serendipitous knowledge discovery research findings. We sought to model information-seeking behavior within the context of serendipitous knowledge discovery by leveraging existing research. These efforts were done with an eye for a potential literature-based discovery application that utilizes semantic predications. We performed a literature search, reviewed the results, and applied the findings in developing a model for serendipitous knowledge discovery as an information-seeking behavior. The literature review indicated four important themes in serendipitous knowledge discovery: iteration, change or clarification, a seeker's prior knowledge, and the role of information organization and presentation. The Interaction Flow in Serendipitous Knowledge Discovery IF-SKD model includes these themes, and accommodates iterative, evolving search interests. Output can be presented in a manner to enhance short-term memory conceptualization and connections with prior knowledge. Although the IF-SKD model is currently a theoretical structure, its utility is demonstrated through replicating a literature-based discovery event, using a documented search method within the model's steps. The IF-SKD model can potentially serve as the foundation for future literature-based discovery applications.},

Here we hypothesize that impact-factor boosting unethical behavior documented previously in several underperforming journals should not be considered as exceptional, but that it affects even the top-tier journals. We performed a citation analysis of documents recently published in 11 prominent general science and biomedical journals. In these journals, only 12 to 79% of what they publish was considered original research, whereas editorial materials alone constituted 11 to 44% of the total document types published. Citations to commissioned opinion articles comprised 3 to 15% of the total citations to the journals within 3 postpublication years, with even a higher share occurring during the first postpublication year. An additional 4 to 15% of the citations were received by the journals from commissioned opinion articles published in other journals. Combined, the parallel world of uncitable documents was responsible for up to 30% of the total citations to the top-tier journals, with the highest values found for medical science journals New England Journal of Medicine, JAMA, and the Lancet and lower values found for the Science, Nature, and Cell series journals. Self-citations to some of the top-tier journals reach values higher than the total citation counts accumulated by papers in most of the Web of Science-indexed journals. Most of the self-citations were generated by commissioned opinion articles. The parallel world of supposedly uncitable documents flourishes and severely distorts the commonly used scientometric indicators.},

One of the major resources for environmental scanning is online news documents, which are readily accessible on news websites or infomediaries. However, the proliferation of the World Wide Web, which increases information sources and improves information circulation, has vastly expanded the amount of information to be scanned. Thus, it is essential to develop an effective event episode discovery mechanism to organize news documents pertaining to an event of interest. In this study, we propose two new metrics, Term Frequency \texttimes{} Inverse Document FrequencyTempoTF\texttimes{}IDFTempo and TF\texttimes{}Enhanced-IDFTempo, and develop a temporal-based event episode discovery TEED technique that uses the proposed metrics for feature selection and document representation. Using a traditional TF\texttimes{}IDF-based hierarchical agglomerative clustering technique as a performance benchmark, our empirical evaluation reveals that the proposed TEED technique outperforms its benchmark, as measured by cluster recall and cluster precision. In addition, the use of TF\texttimes{}Enhanced-IDFTempo significantly improves the effectiveness of event episode discovery when compared with the use of TF\texttimes{}IDFTempo.},

The frontline of defense against such threats is the "privacy settings" controls provided by OSNs such as Facebook. However, the efficacy of these settings is often undermined by their poor design. The current design fatigues users with information overload and fails to provide them with a more integrative and global understanding of their information-sharing practices. In this article, we develop a more efficacious design for the display of OSNs' privacy settings by following recommendations for appropriate use of visualization techniques. The new "wheel" interface simplifies the presentation of privacy settings to reduce information overload. It also incorporates an additional layer of information, indicating the safety of users' settings. A within-subject experiment with 67 students suggests that this interface is more versatile than the current tabular interfaces typically used on OSNs. More important, it allows users to easily comprehend complex information and provides them with a more integrative, higher level understanding of their privacy settings. This research focuses on an important niche at the intersection of information representation, interface design, and OSN privacy.},

Data indicate that the smartphone adoption rates are beyond the early majority and are now approaching the late majority. The findings of analysis of variance tests revealed that all variables of TAM, VAM, and SI varied across the adopter groups: The current adopter's mean values of the variables were the highest, followed by those of potential and nonadoption groups. Multinomial logistic regression MLR analyses revealed that perceived value and affiliation mainly determine the different perceptions of adoption groups. Smartphone adoption, however, was relatively unaffected by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Perceived popularity, perceived price, and ethnicity played a role in distinctive determinants between current adopters and nonadopters. The results imply that adopters perceive smartphones as not only a worthwhile device in which to invest money but also a symbolic device to signal their affiliation and timely technology adoption. Another intriguing finding is the differences of interest in contents between current adopters and nonadopters. Social interactions via social networking services, acquisition for lifestyle, information seeking, and entertainment via gaming were the main applications of interest.},

Traditional methods of community detection usually assume that the network's structural information is fully known, which is not the case in many practical networks. Moreover, most previous community detection algorithms do not differentiate multiple relationships between objects or persons in the real world. In this article, we propose a new approach that utilizes social interaction data e.g., users' posts on Facebook to address the community detection problem in Facebook and to find the multiple social groups of a Facebook user. Some advantages to our approach are a it does not depend on structural information, b it differentiates the various relationships that exist among friends, and c it can discover a target user's multiple communities. In the experiment, we detect the community distribution of Facebook users using the proposed method. The experiment shows that our method can achieve the result of having the average scores of Total-Community-Purity and Total-Cluster-Purity both at approximately 0.8.},

The second tests the impact of tags when the full text is available the full-text environment. The third compares the retrieval effectiveness of tags and author keywords in the abstract environment. In addition, both single-word queries and phrase queries are tested to understand the impact of different query types. Our findings suggest that including tags and author keywords in indexes can enhance recall but may improve or worsen average precision depending on retrieval environments and query types. Indexing tags and author keywords for searching using phrase queries in the abstract environment showed improved average precision, whereas indexing tags for searching using single-word queries in the full-text environment led to a significant drop in average precision. The comparison between tags and author keywords in the abstract environment indicates that they have comparable impact on average precision, but author keywords are more advantageous in enhancing recall. The findings from this study provide useful implications for designing retrieval systems that incorporate tags and author keywords.},

A correlation was found between gender and moral judgment. Although both boys and girls made relatively little "humane judgment" in the Internet environment, girls tended to make "humane judgment" more frequently than boys. In the Internet environment, boys tended to make "absence of judgment" evaluations more than girls. Girls tended, relatively more, toward "normative judgment" that reflects adherence to peer-group conventions with minimal reflexivity.},

Results show the overall trends between the periods 2000 to 2003 and 2004 to 2007 were dissimilar, while trends between the periods 2004 to 2007 and 2008 to 2011 were similar.

abstract = {This paper examines how scientists working in government agencies in the U.S. are reacting to the "ethos of sharing" government-generated data. For scientists to leverage the value of existing government data sets, critical data sets must be identified and made as widely available as possible. However, government data sets can only be leveraged when policy makers first assess the value of data, in much the same way they decide the value of grants for research outside government. We argue that legislators should also remove structural barriers to interoperability by funding technical infrastructure according to issue clusters rather than administrative programs. As developers attempt to make government data more accessible through portals, they should consider a range of other nontechnical constraints attached to the data. We find that agencies react to the large number of constraints by mostly posting their data on their own websites only rather than in data portals that can facilitate sharing. Despite the nontechnical constraints, we find that scientists working in government agencies exercise some autonomy in data decisions, such as data documentation, which determine whether or not the data can be widely shared. Fortunately, scientists indicate a willingness to share the data they collect or maintain. However, we argue further that a complete measure of access should also consider the normative decisions to collect or not particular data.},

abstract = {Until now, most of the methods published for polarity classification in Twitter have used a supervised approach. The differences between them are only the features selected and the method used for weighting them. In this article, we present an unsupervised method for polarity classification in Twitter. The method is based on the expansion of the concepts expressed in the tweets through the application of PageRank to WordNet. In addition, we integrate SentiWordNet to compute the final value of polarity. The synsets values are weighted with the PageRank scores obtained in the previous random walk process over WordNet. The results obtained show that disambiguation and expansion are good strategies for improving overall performance.},

abstract = {Text mining and machine learning methodologies have been applied toward knowledge discovery in several domains, such as biomedicine and business. Interestingly, in the business domain, the text mining and machine learning community has minimally explored company annual reports with their mandatory disclosures. In this study, we explore the question "How can annual reports be used to predict change in company performance from one year to the next?" from a text mining perspective. Our article contributes a systematic study of the potential of company mandatory disclosures using a computational viewpoint in the following aspects: a We characterize our research problem along distinct dimensions to gain a reasonably comprehensive understanding of the capacity of supervised learning methods in predicting change in company performance using annual reports, and b our findings from unbiased systematic experiments provide further evidence about the economic incentives faced by analysts in their stock recommendations and speculations on analysts having access to more information in producing earnings forecast.},

abstract = {The notions that information seeking is not always a solitary activity and that people working in collaboration for information intensive tasks should be studied and supported have become more prevalent in recent years. Several new research questions, methodologies, and systems have emerged around these notions that may prove to be useful beyond the field of collaborative information seeking CIS, with relevance to the broader area of information seeking and behavior. This article provides an overview of such key research work from a variety of domains, including library and information science, computer-supported cooperative work, human-computer interaction, and information retrieval. It starts with explanations of collaboration and how CIS fits in different contexts, emphasizing the interactive, intentional, and mutually beneficial nature of CIS activities. Relations to similar and related fields such as collaborative information retrieval, collaborative information behavior, and collaborative filtering are also clarified. Next, the article presents a synthesis of various frameworks and models that exist in the field today, along with a new synthesis of 12 different dimensions of group activities. A discussion on issues and approaches relating to evaluating various parameters in CIS follows. Finally, a list of known issues and challenges is presented to provide an overview of research opportunities in this field.},

We describe the iterative cycles and process to develop a robot to assist with locating resources in libraries. Stakeholders, including child patrons and librarians, were consulted about their needs, preferences, and performance in locating library resources with robotic assistance. Their needs were analyzed and incorporated into the design of the library robot to provide comprehensive support. The results of the study suggest that the library robot was effective as a mobile and humanoid service agent for providing motivation and knowledgeable guidance to help child patrons in the initially complicated sequence of locating resources.},

Six indicators, total publications, independent publications, collaborative publications, first-author publications, corresponding-author publications, and single-author publications were applied to evaluate publication of institutions and countries. Among the highly cited reviews, 33% were single-author, 61% were single-institution, and 83% were single-country reviews. The United States ranked top for all 6 indicators. The G7 United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, France, Japan, and Italy countries were the site of almost all the highly cited reviews. The top 12 most productive institutions were all located in the United States with Harvard University Cambridge, MA the leader. The top 3 most productive journals were Chemical Reviews, Nature, and the Annual Review of Biochemistry.

abstract = {The study of interhuman communication requires a more complex framework than Claude E. Shannon's 1948 mathematical theory of communication because "information" is defined in the latter case as meaningless uncertainty. Assuming that meaning cannot be communicated, we extend Shannon's theory by defining mutual redundancy as a positional counterpart of the relational communication of information. Mutual redundancy indicates the surplus of meanings that can be provided to the exchanges in reflexive communications. The information is redundant because it is based on "pure sets" i.e., without subtraction of mutual information in the overlaps. We show that in the three-dimensional case e.g., of a triple helix of university-industry-government relations, mutual redundancy is equal to mutual information Rxyz=Txyz; but when the dimensionality is even, the sign is different. We generalize to the measurement in N dimensions and proceed to the interpretation. Using Niklas Luhmann's 1984-1995 social systems theory and/or Anthony Giddens's 1979, 1984 structuration theory, mutual redundancy can be provided with an interpretation in the sociological case: Different meaning-processing structures code and decode with other algorithms. A surplus of "absent" options can then be generated that add to the redundancy. Luhmann's "functional subsystems" of expectations or Giddens's "rule-resource sets" are positioned mutually, but coupled operationally in events or "instantiated" in actions. Shannon-type information is generated by the mediation, but the "structures" are re-positioned toward one another as sets of potentially counterfactual expectations. The structural differences among the coding and decoding algorithms provide a source of additional options in reflexive and anticipatory communications.},

In response to Dodd-Frank, a series of rules relating to swaps record keeping have been issued, and one such rule calls for the creation of a financial products classification system. The manner in which financial products are classified will have a profound effect on data integration and analysis in the financial industry. This article considers various approaches that can be taken when classifying financial products and recommends the use of facet analysis. The article argues that this type of analysis is flexible enough to accommodate multiple viewpoints and rigorous enough to facilitate inferences that are based on the hierarchical structure. Various use cases are examined that pertain to the organization of financial products. The use cases confirm the practical utility of taxonomies that are designed according to faceted principles.},

A portfolio analysis may aim to identify the gap between the current position of an organization and a goal that it intends to achieve or identify competencies of multiple institutions. We introduce a new visual analytic method for analyzing, comparing, and contrasting characteristics of publication portfolios. The new method introduces a novel design of dual-map thematic overlays on global maps of science. Each publication portfolio can be added as one layer of dual-map overlays over 2 related, but distinct, global maps of science: one for citing journals and the other for cited journals. We demonstrate how the new design facilitates a portfolio analysis in terms of patterns emerging from the distributions of citation threads and the dynamics of trajectories as a function of space and time. We first demonstrate the analysis of portfolios defined on a single source article. Then we contrast publication portfolios of multiple comparable units of interest; namely, colleges in universities and corporate research organizations. We also include examples of overlays of scientific fields. We expect that our method will provide new insights to portfolio analysis.},

abstract = {Readership popularity has been an important proxy for success for many emerging online interactive media sites. Given the exponential growth of new web applications and services, and the intense competition among them, attaining and retaining popularity are difficult. One possible approach to this problem is to enhance the competitiveness of a web presence by using appropriate web design mechanisms. Research in this area has mainly focused on technological issues and usability studies. Few studies have paid attention to the socially constructed meaning cognition that is embedded in the context of media. Drawing on the heuristic model from the social cognition perspective, the author posits that source credibility and content freshness are two important media-embedded heuristics potentially influential to the readership popularity of online interactive media sites. The content analysis results of 100 leading weblogs strongly supported this hypotheses. Key quantitative findings were also consistent with the qualitative evidence provided by 28 expert practitioners. This study expands our understanding of the related constructs from a social cognition perspective and calls for design attention to influential media-embedded traits when developing online interactive media and related websites.},

abstract = {Democracy is represented on web interface design Li, 2010. Wittfogel's 1957 Eastern autocracy states that 2 environmental dimensions, rainfall and sea border, influence the origin of democracy. This study examined Wittfogel's Eastern autocracy theory through statistical analysis of average annual precipitation, land boundaries, latitudes, and annual temperature of 196 countries and territories with their freedom levels defined by Freedom House, to find out the correlations between these geospatial factors and democracy. In addition, this study extended its investigation to web interface design by examining democracy represented on college/university websites in correlations with these geospatial factors. A total of 130 college/university websites selected from 65 countries were coded and examined systematically in linear and multiple regression analyses. This study concluded that democracy correlates positively with annual precipitation and latitude, but negatively with land boundaries and annual temperature. Furthermore, this study indicated that these 4 geospatial variables associate with democracy represented on web interface design, although the associations are not statistically significant. This study also suggested that it is more accurate to predict democracy if the 4 geospatial factors are considered together as dependent variables. By examining Wittfogel's theory of hydraulic civilization on web interface design, this study not only extended its sociological perspective to the information science arena, but also provided a better understanding of the functionality of the Internet in information dissemination and its cultural and sociological aspects.},

For peer-reviewed journal articles, there are two main routes to OA: publishing in OA journals gold OA or archiving of article copies or manuscripts at other web locations green OA. This study focuses on summarizing and extending current knowledge about green OA. A synthesis of previous studies indicates that green OA coverage of all published journal articles is approximately 12%, with substantial disciplinary variation. Typically, green OA copies become available after considerable time delays, partly caused by publisher-imposed embargo periods, and partly by author tendencies to archive manuscripts only periodically. Although green OA copies should ideally be archived in proper repositories, a large share is stored on home pages and similar locations, with no assurance of long-term preservation. Often such locations contain exact copies of published articles, which may infringe on the publisher's exclusive rights. The technical foundation for green OA uploading is becoming increasingly solid largely due to the rapid increase in the number of institutional repositories. The number of articles within the scope of OA mandates, which strongly influence the self-archival rate of articles, is nevertheless still low.},

We also explore newly available routines "CorText" to analyze this development in terms of "tubes" using an alluvial map and compare the results with an animation using "Visone". The historical specificity of this development can be compared with the development of "artificial intelligence" into an integrated specialty during this same period.

These training sets are costly and laborious to produce, requiring human annotators to assess the relevance or order of the documents in relation to a query. Active learning algorithms are able to reduce the labeling effort by selectively sampling an unlabeled set and choosing data instances that maximize a learning function's effectiveness. In this article, we propose a novel two-stage active learning method for L2R that combines and exploits interesting properties of its constituent parts, thus being effective and practical. In the first stage, an association rule active sampling algorithm is used to select a very small but effective initial training set. In the second stage, a query-by-committee strategy trained with the first-stage set is used to iteratively select more examples until a preset labeling budget is met or a target effectiveness is achieved. We test our method with various LETOR benchmarking data sets and compare it with several baselines to show that it achieves good results using only a small portion of the original training sets.},

abstract = {Searches for specific factual health information constitute a significant part of consumer health information requests, but little is known about how users search for such information. This study attempts to fill this gap by observing users' behavior while using MedlinePlus to search for specific health information. Nineteen students participated in the study, and each performed 12 specific tasks. During the search process, they submitted short queries or complete questions, and they examined less than 1 result per search. Participants rarely reformulated queries; when they did, they tended to make a query more specific or more general, or iterate in different ways. Participants also browsed, primarily relying on the alphabetical list and the anatomical classification, to navigate to specific health topics. Participants overall had a positive experience with MedlinePlus, and the experience was significantly correlated with task difficulty and participants' spatial abilities. The results suggest that, to better support specific item search in the health domain, systems could provide a more "natural" interface to encourage users to ask questions; effective conceptual hierarchies could be implemented to help users reformulate queries; and the search results page should be reconceptualized as a place for accessing answers rather than documents. Moreover, multiple schemas should be provided to help users navigate to a health topic. The results also suggest that users' experience with information systems in general and health-related systems in particular should be evaluated in relation to contextual factors, such as task features and individual differences.},

All research questions are answered affirmatively: The absolute as well as the relative numbers of reviews in these three subfields are indeed increasing. In addition, reviews in these fields are cited more frequently than are normal articles: about 70% more often than are "normal" articles in Infectious Diseases and Oncology and about 50% more often in Tropical Medicine.

Through a qualitative content analysis of 200 posts across Internet groups, we identify topics and information needs expressed by people who feel they have no other sources of support available to them. We uncover various health, well-being, social, and identity issues that are not only crucial to the lives of the people posting but which they are unwilling to risk revealing elsewhere-offering evidence that these online environments provide an outlet for the expression of critical and hidden information needs. To enable this analysis, we first describe our method for reliably identifying situations of information poverty in messages posted to these groups and outline our coding approach. Our work contributes to the study of both information seeking within the context of information poverty and the use of Internet groups as sources of information and support, bridging the two by exploring the manifestation of information poverty in this particular online setting.},

abstract = {Search engine users typically engage in multiquery sessions in their quest to fulfill their information needs. Despite a plethora of research findings suggesting that a significant group of users look for information within a specific geographical scope, existing reformulation studies lack a focused analysis of how users reformulate geographic queries. This study comprehensively investigates the ways in which users reformulate such needs in an attempt to fill this gap in the literature. Reformulated sessions were sampled from a query log of a major search engine to extract 2,400 entries that were manually inspected to filter geo sessions. This filter identified 471 search sessions that included geographical intent, and these sessions were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. The results revealed that one in five of the users who reformulated their queries were looking for geographically related information. They reformulated their queries by changing the content of the query rather than the structure. Users were not following a unified sequence of modifications and instead performed a single reformulation action. However, in some cases it was possible to anticipate their next move. A number of tasks in geo modifications were identified, including standard, multi-needs, multi-places, and hybrid approaches. The research concludes that it is important to specialize query reformulation studies to focus on particular query types rather than generically analyzing them, as it is apparent that geographic queries have their special reformulation characteristics.},

abstract = {E-patients seeking information online often seek specific advice related to coping with their health conditions among social networking sites. They may be looking for social connectivity with compassionate strangers who may have experienced similar situations to share opinions and experiences rather than for authoritative medical information. Previous studies document distinct technological features and different levels of social support interaction patterns. It is expected that the design of the social media functions will have an impact on the user behavior of social support exchange. In this part of a multipart study, we investigate the social support types, in particular information support types, across multiple computer-mediated communication formats forum, journal, and notes within an alcoholism community using descriptive content analysis on 3 months of data from a MedHelp online peer support community. We present the results of identified informational support types including advice, referral, fact, personal experiences, and opinions, either offered or requested. Fact type was exchanged most often among the messages; however, there were some different patterns between notes and journal posts. Notes were used for maintaining relationships rather than as a main source for seeking information. Notes were similar to comments made to journal posts, which may indicate the friendship between journal readers and the author. These findings suggest that users may have initially joined the MedHelp Alcoholism Community for information-seeking purposes but continue participation even after they have completed with information gathering because of the relationships they formed with community members through social media features.},

abstract = {News portals are a popular destination for web users. News providers are therefore interested in attaining higher visitor rates and promoting greater engagement with their content. One aspect of engagement deals with keeping users on site longer by allowing them to have enhanced click-through experiences. News portals have invested in ways to embed links within news stories but so far these links have been curated by news editors. Given the manual effort involved, the use of such links is limited to a small scale. In this article, we evaluate a system-based approach that detects newsworthy events in a news article and locates other articles related to these events. Our system does not rely on resources like Wikipedia to identify events, and it was designed to be domain independent. A rigorous evaluation, using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, was performed to assess the system-embedded links against the manually-curated ones. Our findings reveal that our system's performance is comparable with that of professional editors, and that users find the automatically generated highlights interesting and the associated articles worthy of reading. Our evaluation also provides quantitative and qualitative insights into the curation of links, from the perspective of users and professional editors.},

abstract = {Multi-session search tasks are complex and span more than one web session. Such tasks are challenging because searchers must keep track of their search progress and the information they encounter across sessions. Multi-session tasks can be cognitively taxing for visually impaired users because the lack of persistence of screen readers causes the load on working memory to be high. In this article, we first discuss the habitual behavior of visually impaired participants for multi-session tasks when using popular search interfaces. We then present the evaluation of a search interface developed to support complex information seeking for visually impaired users. The user evaluation was structured in two sessions to simulate a multi-session task. Thus, we discuss the strategies observed among participants to resume the search, to review previously encountered information, and to satisfy their evolved information need. We also compare the information-seeking behavior across the two sessions and examine how the proposed interface supports participants for multi-session tasks. Findings from this evaluation contribute to our understanding of the information-seeking behavior of visually impaired users and have implications for the design of tools to support searchers to manage and make sense of information during multi-session search tasks.},

abstract = {This study examines early warning from the users' perspective as a special category of information seeking. Specifically, we look at the 2009 Victorian bushfires in Australia as an instructive case of early warning information seeking. The bushfires, the worst in Australia's recorded history, were unique in its ferocity and damage caused, but also in the amount of data and research that was generated. We analyzed the affected residents' information needs, seeking and use in terms of their cognitive, affective, and situational dimensions. We found that residents wanted information that would act as a "trigger for action," provide timely warning, and indicate clearly fire severity. Nearly two thirds of residents surveyed did not receive an official warning. Almost half first found out that the bushfire was in their area through personal observation of smoke, embers, or flames. We suggest that a form of normalcy bias may have been at work during information seeking, causing people to interpret their situations as "normal" even when disaster warnings have been issued. Although the authorities had adopted a "Stay or Go" policy to help residents use warning information to decide between staying to defend their property or leaving early, the policy's effectiveness was undermined by information challenges.},

abstract = {The success of an enterprise information retrieval system is determined by interactions among three key entities: the search engine employed; the service provider who delivers, modifies, and maintains the engine; and the users of the service within the organization. Evaluations of an enterprise search have predominately focused on the effectiveness and efficiency of the engine, with very little analysis of user involvement in the process, and none on the role of service providers. We propose and evaluate a model of costs and benefits to a service provider when investing in enhancements to the ranking of documents returned by their search engine. We demonstrate the model through a case study to analyze the potential impact of using domain experts to provide enhanced mediated search results. By demonstrating how to quantify the cost and benefit of an improved information retrieval system to the service provider, our case study shows that using the relevance assessments of domain experts to rerank original search results can significantly improve the accuracy of ranked lists. Moreover, the service provider gains substantial return on investment and a higher search success rate by investing in the relevance assessments of domain experts. Our cost and benefit analysis results are contrasted with standard modes of effectiveness analysis, including quantitative using measures such as precision and qualitative through user preference surveys approaches. Modeling costs and benefits explicitly can provide useful insights that the other approaches do not convey.},

To better understand the nature of these tags, we analyzed tags assigned to a collection of 100 images of art provided by the steve.museum project using subject matter categorization. Our results show that the majority of tags describe the people and objects in the image and are generic in nature. This contradicts prior subject matter analyses of queries, tags, and index terms of other image collections, suggesting that the nature of social tags largely depends on the type of collection and on user needs. This insight may help cultural heritage institutions improve their management and use of tags.},

Drawing from 95 structured interviews, 6 in-depth interviews, a focus group, and a series of participatory observations of computer training classes at Casa Latina, we find that information and communication technologies ICT help immigrant day laborers remain connected with their families and their employers and facilitate their navigation of, and integration into, the society in which they have precarious social and economic standing. ICT help immigrant day laborers maintain links with their past and their roots, offer tools to navigate their present needs, and help them build future plans and aspirations. Hispanic day laborers experience ICT mostly through mobile phones used to communicate with employers and families; they use computers and the Internet to communicate with family and friends. In addition, the experience of the immigrant day laborers is strongly influenced by their English-language proficiency-which helps them navigate daily life in the United States and communicate with employers-and their use of transportation to move around the city for work and daily life. The results of this study offer new insight into the ways in which day laborers in Seattle use ICT to help them meet personal and employment needs and realize their long-term goals.},

The 100 journals in this sample included research and practitioner venues across a range of subdomains and specializations. The authors gathered data for 3 points in time, at 10-year intervals during a 20-year period, from 1989-2009. They examined the following in detail: journal profiles for publishing characteristics, submission specifications for manuscript parameters, and full-text published manuscripts for compliance with specifications. All were analyzed as point-in-time comparisons as well as trajectories of change over time. Journal profiles demonstrated patterns of increased centralization and digitization, inclusiveness of readership, increased frequency of issues, and increased length of articles. Key findings for manuscript parameter trends included increased specificity of detail, range of manuscript types and research designs accepted, and average manuscript length. In addition, journals have more explicitly specified elements previously left implicit, such as professional and ethical standards. Criteria for submission procedures and manuscript quality are consistent with university faculty performance standards for productivity and technological advancement. Findings carry implications for publishing, journal management, faculty work, and performance evaluation.},

abstract = {The “sharing economy” has recently emerged as a major global phenomenon in practice and is consequently an important research topic. What, precisely, is meant by this term, “sharing economy”? The literature to date offers many, often incomplete and conflicting definitions. This makes it difficult for researchers to lead a coherent discourse, to compare findings and to select appropriate cases. Alternative terms (e.g., “collaborative consumption,” “gig economy,” and “access economy”) are a further complication. To resolve this issue, our article develops a consolidated (based on all prior work) and systemic (relating to the phenomenon in its entire scope) definition of the sharing economy. The definition is based on the detailed analysis of definitions and explanations in 152 sources identified in a systematic literature review. We identify 36 original understandings of the term “sharing economy.” Using semantic integration strategies, we consolidate 84 semantic facets in these definitions into 18 characteristics of the sharing economy. Resolving conflicts in the meaning and scope of these characteristics, we arrive at a consolidated, systemic definition. We evaluate the definition's appropriateness and applicability by applying it to cases claimed by the media to be examples of the sharing economy. This article's definition is useful for future research and discourse on the sharing economy.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to develop an empirical measure for everyday information mastering (EIM). EIM describes the ways that individuals, based on their beliefs, attitudes, and expectations, orient themselves to information as a resource of everyday action. The key features of EIM were identified by conceptual analysis focusing on three EIM frameworks. Four modes of EIM—Proactive, Social, Reactive, and Passive—and their 12 constituents were identified. A survey of 39 items was developed in two pilot studies to operationalize the identified modes as measurable EIM constituents. The respondents in the main study were upper secondary school students (n = 412). Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was applied to validate subscales for each EIM constituent. Seven subscales emerged: Inquiring and Scanning in the Proactive mode, Social media‐centered, and Experiential in the Social mode, and Information poor, Overwhelmed, and Blunting in the Passive mode. Two constituents, Serendipitous and Intuitive, were not supported in the EFA. The findings highlight that the core constituents of an individual's everyday information mastering can be operationalized as psychometric scales. The instrument contributes to the systematic empirical study of EIM constituents and their relationships. The study further sheds light on key modes of EIM.},

We study the effect of search assistance, operationalized as an interactive faceted query suggestion, for both whole‐session effectiveness and engagement through interactive faceted query suggestion. A user experiment is reported, where users performed exploratory search tasks, comparing interactive faceted query suggestion and a control condition with only conventional typed‐query interaction. Data comprised of interaction and search logs show that the availability of interactive faceted query suggestion substantially improves whole‐session effectiveness by increasing recall without sacrificing precision. The increased engagement with interactive faceted query suggestion is targeted to direct situated navigation around the initial query scope, but is not found to improve individual queries on average. The results imply that research in exploratory search should focus on measuring and designing tools that engage users with directed situated navigation support for improving whole‐session performance.},

abstract = {Although collective trolling is an integral part of online communities, it has received little scholarly attention. Research on collective trolling, which involves an organized group trolling effort, is in its infancy perhaps because early works on online trolling depicted it as the deviant behavior of individuals who acted in isolation and under hidden identity. Thus, it is still unclear what collective trolling is and how it evolves. To address this gap, we collected 12,840 posts and comments pertinent to a brief, controversial, and very visible collective trolling event. The event, which surrounded Chinese rapper PG One on the Chinese microblogging platform Sina Weibo, received 40 million reads in 1 day and a lot of media attention. Based on a thematic content analysis of 480 posts, we describe the collective trolling lifecycle through five distinct stages defined by posting frequency and content of posts. We also explain the transformation of participants' roles, tactics, motives, behavioral tone, and the variations in their thematic content, stakeholder group affiliation, and roles over time. The major contributions of the study are the characterization of collective trolling, and the addition of a lifecycle model to the understanding of trolling as sociotechnical, context‐dependent, and multidimensional phenomenon.},

abstract = {The movement for open access publishing (OA) is often said to have its roots in the scientific disciplines, having been popularized by scientific publishers and formalized through a range of top‐down policy interventions. But there is an often‐neglected prehistory of OA that can be found in the early DIY publishers of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Managed entirely by working academics, these journals published research in the humanities and social sciences and stand out for their unique set of motivations and practices. This article explores this separate lineage in the history of the OA movement through a critical‐theoretical analysis of the motivations and practices of the early scholar‐led publishers. Alongside showing the involvement of the humanities and social sciences in the formation of OA, the analysis reveals the importance that these journals placed on experimental practices, critique of commercial publishing, and the desire to reach new audiences. Understood in today's context, this research is significant for adding complexity to the history of OA, which policymakers, advocates, and publishing scholars should keep in mind as OA goes mainstream.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, megajournals have expanded in popularity and established a legitimate niche in academic publishing. Leveraging advantages of digital publishing, megajournals are characterized by large publication volume, broad interdisciplinary scope, and peer‐review filters that select primarily for scientific soundness as opposed to novelty or originality. These publishing innovations are complementary and competitive vis‐\`{a}‐vis traditional journals. We analyze how megajournals (PLOS One, Scientific Reports) are represented in different fields relative to prominent generalist journals (Nature, PNAS, Science) and “quasi‐megajournals” (Nature Communications, PeerJ). Our results show that both megajournals and prominent traditional journals have distinctive niches, despite the similar interdisciplinary scopes of such journals. These niches—defined by publishing volume and disciplinary diversity—are dynamic and varied over the relatively brief histories of the analyzed megajournals. Although the life sciences are the predominant contributor to megajournals, there is variation in the disciplinary composition of different megajournals. The growth trajectories and disciplinary composition of generalist journals—including megajournals—reflect changing knowledge dissemination and reward structures in science.},

Despite such a crucial role of forenames, their effect on the performance of heuristic (string matching) and algorithmic disambiguation is not well understood. This study assesses the contributions of forenames in author name disambiguation using multiple labeled data sets under varying ratios and lengths of full forenames, reflecting real‐world scenarios in which an author is represented by forename variants (synonym) and some authors share the same forenames (homonym). The results show that increasing the ratios of full forenames substantially improves both heuristic and machine‐learning‐based disambiguation. Performance gains by algorithmic disambiguation are pronounced when many forenames are initialized or homonyms are prevalent. As the ratios of full forenames increase, however, they become marginal compared to those by string matching. Using a small portion of forename strings does not reduce much the performances of both heuristic and algorithmic disambiguation methods compared to using full‐length strings. These findings provide practical suggestions, such as restoring initialized forenames into a full‐string format via record linkage for improved disambiguation performances.},

abstract = {The star‐rating mechanism of customer reviews is used universally by the online population to compare and select merchants, movies, products, and services. The consensus opinion from aggregation of star ratings is used as a proxy for item quality. Online reviews are noisy and effective aggregation of star ratings to accurately reflect the “true quality” of products and services is challenging. The mean‐rating aggregation model is widely used and other aggregation models are also proposed. These existing aggregation models rely on a large number of reviews to tolerate noise. However, many products rarely have reviews. We propose probabilistic aggregation models for review ratings based on the Dirichlet distribution to combat data sparsity in reviews. We further propose to exploit the “helpfulness” social information and time to filter noisy reviews and effectively aggregate ratings to compute the consensus opinion. Our experiments on an Amazon data set show that our probabilistic aggregation models based on “helpfulness” achieve better performance than the statistical and heuristic baseline approaches.},

The analysis showed the importance of three national culture dimensions of PDI (the way people of a nation interact with authorities), IDV (the degree of centrality of person or groups in a country), and IVR (the agreeableness of joy and happiness in a country) for explaining the cross‐cultural differences of ISU. The findings were explained through HNCD, and four cultural patterns of ISU were identified. However, further research is required to better understand the complex relationships of cultural factors, ISU, and other societal variables.},

In this article, we present the results of a study designed to determine the feasibility of a cross‐lingual readability assessment strategy. For doing so, we first analyzed the most common features used for readability assessment and determined their influence on the readability prediction process of 6 different languages: English, Spanish, Basque, Italian, French, and Catalan. In addition, we developed a cross‐lingual readability assessment strategy that serves as a means to empirically explore the potential advantages of employing a single strategy (and set of features) for readability assessment in different languages, including interlanguage prediction agreement and prediction accuracy improvement for low‐resource languages.},

These decisions are greatly influenced by contextual characteristics of the request. However, the contextual influence may not be uniform among users with different levels of privacy concerns. In this study, we hypothesize that users with higher privacy concerns may consider contextual factors differently from those with lower privacy concerns. By conducting a scenario‐based survey study and structural equation modeling, we verify the interaction effects between privacy concerns and contextual factors. We additionally find that users' perceived risk towards the requester mediates the effect of context and privacy concerns. These results extend our understanding about the cognitive process behind privacy decision making in SNSs. The interaction effects suggest strategies for SNS providers to predict user's friend request acceptance and to customize context‐aware privacy decision support based on users' different privacy attitudes.},

In fact, if we make creative use of Simpson's index of concentration (originally devised as a measure of ecological diversity) to measure the degree of standardization of definition in this case, we arrive at a value of 0.05, on a scale of zero to one. It is suggested, however, that the situation is not as problematic as it might seem: that low cross‐domain levels of standardization of definition should not be cause for concern.},

Information as an experience good is inherently challenging to evaluate a priori; therefore, comparing value before and after different types of experience is likely to inform theory about users' preferences regarding information. Prior research mostly refers to consuming information and rarely considers the experience of producing information as a factor affecting information value. The current research compares the effect of experiencing online information through production and consumption processes on value perception. In a set of 6 experiments with 178 participants, willingness‐to‐pay by consumers and willingness‐to‐accept payment by producers are measured before and after consumption and production of information, independently and as repeated measures. In the experiments, we define and implement a framework for an information production process. The results show that the value of information is dynamic. Value perception increased after experiencing information, especially when people engaged in producing information compared to consuming it. This study offers a window toward the practical design of new digital information products.},

An investigation of education on cultural heritage informatics and digital humanities at iSchools () using a gap analysis framework demonstrates the core information science skills required for cultural heritage education. The research demonstrates that: (i) a thematic analysis of cultural heritage policy documents can be used to explore the key themes for cultural informatics education and research that can lead to sustainable development; and (ii) cultural heritage information education should cover a series of skills that can be categorized in five key areas, viz., information, technology, leadership, application, and people and user skills.},

abstract = {To better account for information behavior in everyday life, the field must more fully explore information phenomena in the lifeworld, that is, information experience. This article shows that one way to do this is through the concept of understanding. Visual art is identified as an illuminating domain for an initial foray into such research. This article presents findings from a phenomenology‐of‐practice study of the information behavior of visual artists. Seven local artists documented their experiences creating self‐portraits, and semistructured follow‐up interviews were conducted. The findings show how these participants built understanding with information in their work of creating individual self‐portraits. These understandings fall into two categories: of the self and of the artistic process. Many forms of information, traditional and novel, contribute to these understandings; examples of the latter include memories, the lived environment, profound experiences, and online browsing. These findings extend the literature on artists' information behavior, connect everyday information behavior to information experience, and illustrate a method for studying understanding empirically in information science. The article closes by discussing the meaning of these findings for the future of information science, suggesting that the kinds of information employed by artists might be recognized and appreciated more widely throughout society.},

abstract = {Named entity recognition (NER) in the past has focused on extracting mentions in a local region, within a sentence or short paragraph. When dealing with user‐generated text, the diverse and informal writing style makes traditional approaches much less effective. On the other hand, in many types of text on social media such as user comments, tweets, or question–answer posts, the contextual connections between documents do exist. Examples include posts in a thread discussing the same topic, tweets that share a hashtag about the same entity. Our idea in this work is utilizing the related contexts across documents to perform mention recognition in a collective manner. Intuitively, within a mention coreference graph, the labels of mentions are expected to propagate from more confidence cases to less confidence ones. To this end, we propose a novel semisupervised inference algorithm named parameterized label propagation. In our model, the propagation weights between mentions are learned by an attention‐like mechanism, given their local contexts and the initial labels as input. We study the performance of our approach in the Yahoo! News data set, where comments and articles within a thread share similar context. The results show that our model significantly outperforms all other noncollective NER baselines.},

abstract = {Research activities related to social informatics (SI) are expanding, even as community fragmentation, topical dispersion, and methodological diversity continue to increase. Specifically, the different understandings of SI in regional communities have strong impacts, and each has a different history, methodological grounding, and often a different thematic focus. The aim of this article is to connect three selected perspectives on SI—intellectual (regional schools of thought), methodological, and thematic—and introduce a comparative framework for understanding SI that includes all known approaches. Thus, the article draws from a thematic and methodological grounding of research across schools of thought, along with definitions that rely on the extension and intension of the notion of SI. The article is built on a paralogy of views and pluralism typical of postmodern science. Because SI is forced to continually reform its research focus, due to the rapid development of information and communication technology, social changes and ideologies that surround computerization and informatization, the presented perspective maintains a high degree of flexibility, without the need to constantly redefine the boundaries, as is typical in modern science. This approach may support further developments in promoting and understanding SI worldwide.},

abstract = {Millions of messages are produced on microblog platforms every day, leading to the pressing need for automatic identification of key points from the massive texts. To absorb salient content from the vast bulk of microblog posts, this article focuses on the task of microblog keyphrase extraction. In previous work, most efforts treat messages as independent documents and might suffer from the data sparsity problem exhibited in short and informal microblog posts. On the contrary, we propose to enrich contexts via exploiting conversations initialized by target posts and formed by their replies, which are generally centered around relevant topics to the target posts and therefore helpful for keyphrase identification. Concretely, we present a neural keyphrase extraction framework, which has 2 modules: a conversation context encoder and a keyphrase tagger. The conversation context encoder captures indicative representation from their conversation contexts and feeds the representation into the keyphrase tagger, and the keyphrase tagger extracts salient words from target posts. The 2 modules were trained jointly to optimize the conversation context encoding and keyphrase extraction processes. In the conversation context encoder, we leverage hierarchical structures to capture the word‐level indicative representation and message‐level indicative representation hierarchically. In both of the modules, we apply character‐level representations, which enables the model to explore morphological features and deal with the out‐of‐vocabulary problem caused by the informal language style of microblog messages. Extensive comparison results on real‐life data sets indicate that our model outperforms state‐of‐the‐art models from previous studies.},

abstract = {Main path analysis is a famous network‐based method for understanding the evolution of a scientific domain. Most existing methods have two steps, weighting citation arcs based on search path counting and exploring main paths in a greedy fashion, with the assumption that citation networks are acyclic. The only available proposal that avoids manual cycle removal is to preprint transform a cyclic network to an acyclic counterpart. Through a detailed discussion about the issues concerning this approach, especially deriving the “de‐preprinted” main paths for the original network, this article proposes an alternative solution with two‐fold contributions. Based on the argument that a publication cannot influence itself through a citation cycle, the SimSPC algorithm is proposed to weight citation arcs by counting simple search paths. A set of algorithms are further proposed for main path exploration and extraction directly from cyclic networks based on a novel data structure main path tree. The experiments on two cyclic citation networks demonstrate the usefulness of the alternative solution. In the meanwhile, experiments show that publications in strongly connected components may sit on the turning points of main path networks, which signifies the necessity of a systematic way of dealing with citation cycles.},

abstract = {More and more social Q&amp;A platforms are launching a new business model to monetize online knowledge. This monetizing process introduces a more complicated cost and benefit tradeoff to users, especially for askers' concerns. Much of the previous research was conducted in the context of free‐based Q&amp;A platform, which hardly explains the triggers that motivate askers' pay intention. Based on the theories of social exchange and social capital, this study aims to identify and examine the antecedents of askers' pay intention from the perspective of benefit and cost. We empirically test our predictions based on survey data collected from 322 actual askers in a well‐known trilateral payment‐based social Q&amp;A platform in China. The results by partial least squares (PLS) analysis indicate that besides noneconomic benefits including self‐enhancement, social support, and entertainment, financial factors such as cost and benefit have significant influences on the perceived value of using trilateral payment‐based Q&amp;A platforms. More important, we further identify that the effect of financial benefit is moderated by perceived reciprocity belief, and the effect of perceived value is moderated by perceived trust in answerers. Our findings contribute to the previous literature by proposing a theoretical model that explains askers' behavioral intention, and the practical implications for payment‐based Q&amp;A service providers and participants.},

Data regarding 4 aspects of their music‐related psychological traits—“music involvement,” “musical identity,” “preference diversity,” and “preference openness”—were also collected through a background questionnaire. A classification of music access modes was proposed based on the circumstances that lead to a music listening experience. A mixed regression analysis revealed several significant interaction effects between psychological traits and the mode of music access on music enjoyment. Foremost among these was a positive interaction effect between preference openness and the playing of a known track triggered by musical cues, and that between preference diversity and exposure to new music played by others. Individuals with a strong musical identity tended to enjoy music played of their own volition without any apparent triggers. Furthermore, a multimodal logistic regression analysis also revealed the relationships between these psychological traits and the likelihood of different music access modes. Preference diversity significantly increased the likelihood of music listening triggered by need arousal. The results support the proposition that users' music‐related psychological traits should be considered in personalized recommendation strategies.},

It is also crucial for promoting online community health by motivating participation. However, how gratitude occurs and can be encouraged in online communities is not yet well understood. This exploratory study investigated how online community users experience gratitude, focusing on how gratitude expression and acknowledgment occurs, can break down or can be reinforced. Semistructured Critical Incident interviews were conducted with 8 users of various online communities, including discussion and support groups, social Q&amp;A sites, and review sites, eliciting 17 memorable examples of giving and receiving thanks online. The findings gave rise to a process model of gratitude in online communities—the “gratitude cycle,” which provides a detailed, holistic understanding of the experience of gratitude online that can inform the design of online community platforms that aim to motivate users to perpetuate the cycle. An enriched understanding of gratitude in online communities can help ensure future platforms better support the expression and acknowledgment of thanks, encouraging participation.},

abstract = {Information seeking and access are essential for users in all walks of life, from addressing personal needs such as finding flights to locating information needed to complete work tasks. Over the past decade or so, the general needs of people with impairments have increasingly been recognized as something to be addressed, an issue embedded both in international treaties and in state legislation. The same tendency can be found in research, where a growing number of user studies including people with impairments have been conducted. The purpose of these studies is typically to uncover potential barriers for access to information, especially in the context of inaccessible search user interfaces. This literature review provides an overview of research on the information seeking and searching of users with impairments. The aim is to provide an overview to both researchers and practitioners who work with any of the user groups identified. Some diagnoses are relatively well represented in the literature (for instance, visual impairment), but there is very little work in other areas (for instance, autism) and in some cases no work at all (for instance, aphasia). Gaps are identified in the research, and suggestions are made regarding areas where further research is needed.},

We validated the DCM using quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative analyses of 1,185 communication sessions and related purchase records reflect that shoppers' cognitive, rather than affective, expressions tend to indicate their purchase intentions, and retailers should emphasize cognitive expressions to the extent possible while being strategic in their choice of expressions. Furthermore, the affective expressions (in positive and negative forms) articulated by retailers have a considerable influence on purchase conversion. However, the same is not true for shoppers. Post‐hoc interviews were conducted with shoppers to gain additional insights.},

This mixed‐methods study investigates information value cocreation from the social informatics perspective to surface sociotechnical implications for IT design and use, since cocreation is inherently social and technology‐mediated. Specifically, the cocreation of software as an information‐intensive product is examined. Data on the cocreation of Xiaomi's MIUI firmware were collected from two sources: 49 interviews of staff and user participants and web crawling of the cocreation platform. They were analyzed with interpretive analysis, topic modeling, and social network analysis for triangulation. Findings indicate three sociotechnical information practices co‐constituted by information, IT, people, and their activities. Each practice is instrumental in rapidly and continuously converting external information into cocreated information value. The adsorption information practice attracts new and diverse external information; the absorption practice integrates external and internal information rapidly by involving users; the desorption practice allows rapid adoption of the cocreated product so that information value can be realized and demonstrated for further cocreation. Critically analyzing these practices reveals unanticipated or paradoxical issues affecting the design and use of common cocreation technology such as discussion forums.},

We compare the impact of a single design change on 49 disease‐specific health support forums hosted on the WebMD platform, a popular online health information service. A statistical analysis showcases changes in posting patterns before and after the design intervention; a subsequent interpretive examination of forum content reveals how the design change affected members' perceived affordances of the platform. Our findings suggest that, despite differences between communities, the design change triggered a common set of cascading effects: it made it difficult for core users to create and maintain relationships, that led them to ultimately leave the site, and, in turn, reduced the activity drawing newcomers to the platform. Using these findings, we argue that the design of sustainable and robust online communities must account for systemic, sociotechnical dynamics.},

Many of the new keywords appearing in the LIS field are ephemeral. Actually, more than half are never used again. In general, the terms most commonly used in the LIS area come from other areas. The average survival time of these keywords is approximately 3 years, being slightly higher in the case of words that were published in journals classified in the second quartile of the area. We believe that measuring the appearance and disappearance of terms will allow understanding some relevant aspects of the evolution of a discipline, providing in this way a new bibliometric approach.},

Investor opinions extracted from online investment communities capture “crowd wisdom” and have begun to play an important role in financial markets. Existing research confirms the importance of crowd wisdom in stock predictions, but fails to investigate factors influencing crowd performance (that is, crowd prediction accuracy). In order to help improve crowd performance, our research strives to investigate the impact of crowd characteristics on crowd performance. We conduct an empirical study using a large data set collected from a popular online investment community, StockTwits. Our findings show that experience diversity, participant independence, and network decentralization are all positively related to crowd performance. Furthermore, crowd size moderates the influence of crowd characteristics on crowd performance. From a theoretical perspective, our work enriches extant literature by empirically testing the relationship between crowd characteristics and crowd performance. From a practical perspective, our findings help investors better evaluate social sensors embedded in user‐generated stock predictions, based upon which they can make better investment decisions.},

Digital preservation research has focused on identifying technical, economic, and organizational sources of risk and has relied on an assumption that individuals will behave in rational and predictable ways in response to the same information. This article asserts that viewing digital preservation as a process that takes place in complex social contexts is just as important as thinking about digital preservation in terms of technological or economic issues. This is particularly important for understanding how individuals involved in digital preservation construct their understanding of risk because social factors influence how people construct their understanding of, and behave in response to, risk information. The author proposes an eight‐factor model for the social construction of risk, which includes: communication, complexity, expertise, organizations, political culture, trust, uncertainty, and vulnerability. The article demonstrates how these factors influence individuals as they construct their understanding of risk in the context of digital preservation and how this in turn affects digital preservation decisions.},

We study this question empirically, as opposed to normatively. Based on the literature that discusses whose viewpoints should be reflected, we construct a research model that includes those same three viewpoints as factors that might be influencing term assignment in actual practice. In the unique study design that we employ, the records of term assignments made by identified indexers in academic libraries are cross‐referenced with the results of a survey that those same indexers completed on political views. Our results indicate that in our setting, variance in term assignment was best explained by indexers' personal political views. © 2019 ASIS&amp;T},

abstract = {Scientific collaboration is essential and almost imperative in modern science. However, collaboration may be difficult to achieve because of 2 major barriers: geographic distance and social divides. It is predicted that the advancement of information communication technologies (ICTs) will bring a puzzled conclusion for collaboration in the scientific community: the “Global Village” trend with significantly increased physical distance among collaborated scientists and the “Virtual Balkans” trend with significantly increased social stratification among collaborated scientists. The results of this study reveal that the scientific community evolves towards the Global Village generally on both the geographic and social dimension, but with variations in term of collaboration patterns. The influence of such collaboration patterns on research performance (that is, productivity and impact), however, is asymmetric to each side of collaborators. When researchers from top‐tier and general‐tier institutions collaborate, researchers from top‐tier institutions face a decrease in research productivity and impact, whereas researchers from general‐tier institutions increase in research productivity and impact. Furthermore, the development of ICTs plays an important role in shaping the evolving trends and moderating effects of collaboration patterns. Our findings provide a comprehensive understanding of scientific collaboration in the geographic, social, and technological aspect.},

We start by critically examining Westin's conceptualization of information privacy and argue for a contextual approach that holds promise for overcoming some of Westin's weaknesses. We then highlight three contextual considerations for studying privacy—digital networks, marginalized populations, and the global context—and close by discussing how these considerations advance privacy theorization and technology design.},

Multidimensional scaling analysis, temporal analysis, and inferential statistical analysis approaches were used in the study. A resulting 2‐layer Zika virus schema, and term connections and relationships are presented. The results indicate that consumers’ concerns changed over the 4 defined periods. Consumers paid more attention to the basic information about the Zika virus, and the prevention and protection from the Zika virus at the beginning of the outbreak of the Zika virus. During the later periods, consumers became more interested in the role that the government and health organizations played in the public health emergency.},

abstract = {Pseudo‐relevance feedback is a well‐studied query expansion technique in which it is assumed that the top‐ranked documents in an initial set of retrieval results are relevant and expansion terms are then extracted from those documents. When selecting expansion terms, most traditional models do not simultaneously consider term frequency and the co‐occurrence relationships between candidate terms and query terms. Intuitively, however, a term that has a higher co‐occurrence with a query term is more likely to be related to the query topic. In this article, we propose a kernel co‐occurrence‐based framework to enhance retrieval performance by integrating term co‐occurrence information into the Rocchio model and a relevance language model (RM3). Specifically, a kernel co‐occurrence‐based Rocchio method (KRoc) and a kernel co‐occurrence‐based RM3 method (KRM3) are proposed. In our framework, co‐occurrence information is incorporated into both the factor of the term discrimination power and the factor of the within‐document term weight to boost retrieval performance. The results of a series of experiments show that our proposed methods significantly outperform the corresponding strong baselines over all data sets in terms of the mean average precision and over most data sets in terms of P@10. A direct comparison of standard Text Retrieval Conference data sets indicates that our proposed methods are at least comparable to state‐of‐the‐art approaches.},

The framework consists of additional information about users that can be explicitly obtained by asking users for their preferences, or implicitly inferred from users' search behaviors. Users' characteristics and contextual factors such as tasks, time, location, etc., can be helpful for personalization.

abstract = {This article investigates how to improve the effectiveness of voice search systems. Earlier research found that participants employed voice search much less frequently than keyboard search. The main reasons that participants disliked voice search are system mistakes and the inability to modify queries. In keyboard search, query reformulation is facilitated by partial query modification, which is not supported by most of the current voice search systems. Consequently, users need to speak the complete query in voice search even with only minor changes. This article focuses on examining partial query modification during voice search through a Wizard of Oz user experiment. It examines if users would prefer partial query modification and how they perform it in voice search. Thirty‐two participants participated in the experiment. Results indicated that when given the opportunity, the users performed more partial query modifications than complete queries. Common partial query modification strategies and patterns emerged from the experiment. The results can be used to improve the voice search system design and benefit the research community in general. System implications and future work were discussed.},

We introduce the notions of “visibility” and “discoverability.” We find, based on historical data, that the majority of the actions of arXiv users would be potentially “visible” under targeted attack. However, “discoverability,” which incorporates the difficulty of actually seeing a “visible” effect, is very much lower for nearly all users. We consider the effect of changes to the settings of the recommender algorithm on the visibility and discoverability of user actions and propose mitigation strategies that reduce both measures of risk.},

This study integrates attitude and identity theory within a cross‐sectional survey design. The sample consists of about 1,600 researchers in Norway, and the data were collected via e‐mail invitation using a digital surveying tool and analyzed using structural equation modeling techniques. We determined that perceived impact‐quality increases the intention to publish non‐OA, while decreasing the intention to publish OA. Content quality is only associated with non‐OA journals. Perceived visibility increases the intention to publish OA, while the opposite effect is found for non‐OA. Career‐self salience has the strongest effect on impact‐quality, while content quality is most important when work‐self is salient. This research contributes to a deeper understanding about how perceived quality influences intention to publish in OA and non‐OA journals, and how self‐identity salience affects different facets of perceived quality in valence and strength. Findings have implications for policy development, implementation, and assessment and may contribute to improving OA adoption.},

The proposed companion metric reflects the impact of the journal in which an article appears; the rationale for incorporating this information is to reflect higher costs of production and higher review standards, and to mitigate the heavily truncated citation counts that often arise in promotion, renewal, and tenure deliberations. Additionally, focusing jointly on citations and journal impact diversifies the assessment process, and can thereby help avoid misjudging scholars with modest citation counts in high‐level journals. A combination of both metrics is also proposed, which nests each as a special case. The approach is demonstrated using a generic journal ranking metric, but can be adapted to most any stated or revealed preference measure of journal impact.},

abstract = {In a digital library, book search is one of the most important information services. However, with the rapid development of network technologies such as cloud computing, the server‐side of a digital library is becoming more and more untrusted; thus, how to prevent the disclosure of users' book query privacy is causing people's increasingly extensive concern. In this article, we propose to construct a group of plausible fake queries for each user book query to cover up the sensitive subjects behind users' queries. First, we propose a basic framework for the privacy protection in book search, which requires no change to the book search algorithm running on the server‐side, and no compromise to the accuracy of book search. Second, we present a privacy protection model for book search to formulate the constraints that ideal fake queries should satisfy, that is, (i) the feature similarity, which measures the confusion effect of fake queries on users' queries, and (ii) the privacy exposure, which measures the cover‐up effect of fake queries on users' sensitive subjects. Third, we discuss the algorithm implementation for the privacy model. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated by theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation.},

Although the most frequent reason to cite an article is to highlight the connection between the 2 publications, researchers sometimes mention an earlier work to cast a negative light. While computing citation‐based scores, for instance, the h‐index, information about the reason why an article was mentioned is neglected. Therefore, it can be questioned whether these indices describe scientific achievements accurately. In this article we shed insight into the problem of “negative” citations, analyzing data from Stack Exchange and, to draw more universal conclusions, we derive an approximation of citations scores. Here we show that the quantified influence of introducing negative citations is of lesser importance and that they could be used as an indicator of where the attention of the scientific community is allocated.},

One of the fundamental problems in this field is to find a connection between the entity in a query and the potential intents of the users, the latter of which would further reveal important information for facilitating the users' future actions. In this article, we present a novel research method for mining the actionable intents for search users, by generating a ranked list of the potentially most informative actions based on a massive pool of action samples. We compare different search strategies and their combinations for retrieving the action pool and develop three criteria for measuring the informativeness of the selected action samples, that is, the significance of an action sample within the pool, the representativeness of an action sample for the other candidate samples, and the diverseness of an action sample with respect to the selected actions. Our experiment, based on the Action Mining (AM) query entity data set from the Actionable Knowledge Graph (AKG) task at NTCIR‐13, suggests that the proposed approach is effective in generating an informative and early‐satisfying ranking of potential actions for search users.},

A content analysis was conducted examining the full texts of 82 data papers, drawn from the curated list of data papers connected to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. Data events recorded for each paper were organized into a set of 17 categories. Many of these categories are described together in the same sentence, which indicates the messiness of data events in the laboratory space. The findings challenge the degrees to which data papers are a distinct genre compared to research articles and they describe data‐centric research processes in a through way.

abstract = {Throughout an information search, a user needs to make sense of the information found to create an understanding. This requires cognitive effort that can be demanding. Building on prior sensemaking models and expanding them with ideas from learning and cognitive psychology, we examined the use of cognitive mechanisms during individual sensemaking. We conducted a qualitative user study of 15 students who searched for and made sense of information for business analysis and news writing tasks. Through the analysis of think‐aloud protocols, recordings of screen movements, intermediate work products of sensemaking, including notes and concept maps, and final reports, we observed the use of 17 data‐driven and structure‐driven mechanisms for processing new information, examining individual concepts and relationships, and detecting anomalies. These cognitive mechanisms, as the basic operators that move sensemaking forward, provide in‐depth understanding of how people process information to produce sense. Meaningful learning and sensemaking are closely related, so our findings apply to learning as well. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the sensemaking process—how people think—and this better understanding can inform the teaching of thinking skills and the design of improved sensemaking assistants and mind tools.},

abstract = {This study investigates the influence of individual and information characteristics on university students' information channel selection (that is, search engines, social question &amp; answer sites, online health websites, and social networking sites) of online health information (OHI) for three different types of search tasks (factual, exploratory, and personal experience). Quantitative data were collected via an online questionnaire distributed to students on various postgraduate programs at a large UK university. In total, 291 responses were processed for descriptive statistics, Principal Component Analysis, and Poisson regression. Search engines are the most frequently used among the four channels of information discussed in this study. Credibility, ease of use, style, usefulness, and recommendation are the key factors influencing users' judgments of information characteristics (explaining over 62% of the variance). Poisson regression indicated that individuals' channel experience, age, student status, health status, and triangulation (comparing sources) as well as style, credibility, usefulness, and recommendation are substantive predictors for channel selection of OHI.},

abstract = {Organizations have recognized that engaging with customers on social media is now a critical element of their public relations strategy, but many struggle to find the optimal way to use these new tools. This study examined the success factors of online posts from organizations in evoking a high level of response from group members. Specifically, appeals to community belongingness were discovered to be effective at motivating user engagement on social media. The impact of community‐focused language on garnering likes, comments, and shares was assessed using a methodology that combined text analytics, supervised machine learning, and multilevel regression. In 51,760 postings from 100 academic libraries, it was found that general community appeals increase likes by 60%, comments by 130%, and shares by 39%, whereas specific intracommunity, locally meaningful references increase likes by 16% and shares by 12%. These findings have both theoretical implications, as they constitute a large‐scale, empirical confirmation of the belongingness hypothesis from social psychology, and practical implications, as they suggest best practices for maintaining an organizational online presence.},

abstract = {Information encountering (IE) often occurs during active information seeking and involves passively finding unsought, unexpected information that is subjectively considered interesting, useful, or potentially useful. While the idealized IE process involves engaging with information after noticing it (for example, by examining it, conducting follow‐up seeking to determine usefulness, then using or sharing it), the process can be disrupted—resulting in missed opportunities for knowledge and insight creation. This study provides a detailed understanding of when and why the process can be disrupted. Think‐aloud observations and Critical Incident Interviews were conducted with 15 web users, focusing on examining when they encountered information but did not engage with it. Factors that discouraged engagement and simultaneously encouraged participants to return to active, goal‐directed information seeking by disrupting the IE process were identified. These factors individually and collectively demonstrate that IE can instigate a highly uncertain cost–benefit trade‐off, sometimes resulting in encounterers being cautious by returning to “less risky” active seeking. Design suggestions are made for reducing the uncertainty of deciding whether to engage with encountered information and making it easier to return to the active seeking task if disruption occurs.},

Although the quantity of digitized historical documents available is increasing, historians' ways of working with the digital documents have not been widely studied, particularly in authentic work settings. To better support the historians' reasoning processes, we investigate history researchers' work tasks as the context of information interaction and examine their cognitive access points into information. The analysis is based on a longitudinal observational research and interviews in a task‐based research setting. Based on these findings in the historians' cognitive space, we build bridges into the document space. By studying the information interactions in real task contexts, we facilitate the provision of task‐specific handles into documents that can be used in designing digital research tools for historians.},

abstract = {Author name disambiguation (AND) is a challenging problem due to several issues such as missing key identifiers, same name corresponding to multiple authors, along with inconsistent representation. Several techniques have been proposed but maintaining consistent accuracy levels over all data sets is still a major challenge. We identify two major issues associated with the AND problem. First, the namesake problem in which two or more authors with the same name publishes in a similar domain. Second, the diverse topic problem in which one author publishes in diverse topical domains with a different set of coauthors. In this work, we initially propose a method named ATGEP for AND that addresses the namesake issue. We evaluate the performance of ATGEP using various ambiguous name references collected from the Arnetminer Citation (AC) and Web of Science (WoS) data set. We empirically show that the two aforementioned problems are crucial to address the AND problem that are difficult to handle using state‐of‐the‐art techniques. To handle the diverse topic issue, we extend ATGEP to a new variant named ATGEP‐web that considers external web information of the authors. Experiments show that with enough information available from external web sources ATGEP‐web can significantly improve the results further compared with ATGEP.},

Such file management has been the focus of many studies across various fields, but has not been explicitly acknowledged nor made the focus of dedicated review. In this article we present the first dedicated review of this topic and its research, synthesizing more than 230 publications from various research domains to establish what is known and what remains to be investigated, particularly by examining the common motivations, methods, and findings evinced by the previously furcate body of work. We find three typical research motivations in the literature reviewed: understanding how and why users store, organize, retrieve, and share files and folders, understanding factors that determine their behavior, and attempting to improve the user experience through novel interfaces and information services. Relevant conceptual frameworks and approaches to designing and testing systems are described, and open research challenges and the significance for other research areas are discussed. We conclude that file management is a ubiquitous, challenging, and relatively unsupported activity that invites and has received attention from several disciplines and has broad importance for topics across information science.},

abstract = {Web ad effect evaluation is a challenging problem in web marketing research. Although the analysis of web ad effectiveness has achieved excellent results, there are still some deficiencies. First, there is a lack of an in‐depth study of the relevance between advertisements and web content. Second, there is not a thorough analysis of the impacts of users and advertising features on user browsing behaviors. And last, the evaluation index of the web advertisement effect is not adequate. Given the above problems, we conducted our work by studying the observer's behavioral pattern based on multimodal features. First, we analyze the correlation between ads and links with different searching results and further assess the influence of relevance on the observer's attention to web ads using eye‐movement features. Then we investigate the user's behavioral sequence and propose the directional frequent‐browsing pattern algorithm for mining the user's most commonly used browsing patterns. Finally, we offer the novel use of “memory” as a new measure of advertising effectiveness and further build an advertising memory model with integrated multimodal features for predicting the efficacy of web ads. A large number of experiments have proved the superiority of our method.},

One of these repositories, Wikipedia, is facing an important problem: assessing the quality of Wikipedia. Existing approaches exploit techniques such as statistical models or machine leaning algorithms to assess Wikipedia article quality. However, existing models do not provide satisfactory results. Furthermore, these models fail to adopt a comprehensive feature framework. In this article, we conduct an extensive survey of previous studies and summarize a comprehensive feature framework, including text statistics, writing style, readability, article structure, network, and editing history. Selected state‐of‐the‐art deep‐learning models, including the convolutional neural network (CNN), deep neural network (DNN), long short‐term memory (LSTMs) network, CNN‐LSTMs, bidirectional LSTMs, and stacked LSTMs, are applied to assess the quality of Wikipedia. A detailed comparison of deep‐learning models is conducted with regard to different aspects: classification performance and training performance. We include an importance analysis of different features and feature sets to determine which features or feature sets are most effective in distinguishing Wikipedia article quality. This extensive experiment validates the effectiveness of the proposed model.},

Their central role in strategic decision making raises the need to evaluate their fitness for this purpose and develop guidelines for their design and evaluation. A comprehensive review of assessment frameworks, however, found little evidence that existing assessment frameworks have been evaluated systematically, and no methods for their evaluation. This article proposes a new methodology for evaluating the design and use of assessment frameworks. It builds on prior research on maturity models and combines analytic and empirical evaluation methods to explain how the design of assessment frameworks influences their application in practice, and how the design process can effectively take this into account. We present the evaluation methodology and its application to two frameworks. The evaluation results lead to guidelines for the design process of assessment frameworks in digital curation. The methodology provides insights to the designers of the evaluated frameworks that they can consider in future revisions; methodical guidance for researchers in the field; and practical insights and words of caution to organizations keen on diagnosing their abilities.},

abstract = {Statistical significance tests can provide evidence that the observed difference in performance between 2 methods is not due to chance. In information retrieval (IR), some studies have examined the validity and suitability of such tests for comparing search systems. We argue here that current methods for assessing the reliability of statistical tests suffer from some methodological weaknesses, and we propose a novel way to study significance tests for retrieval evaluation. Using Score Distributions, we model the output of multiple search systems, produce simulated search results from such models, and compare them using various significance tests. A key strength of this approach is that we assess statistical tests under perfect knowledge about the truth or falseness of the null hypothesis. This new method for studying the power of significance tests in IR evaluation is formal and innovative. Following this type of analysis, we found that both the sign test and Wilcoxon signed test have more power than the permutation test and the t‐test. The sign test and Wilcoxon signed test also have good behavior in terms of type I errors. The bootstrap test shows few type I errors, but it has less power than the other methods tested.},

LIS researchers are uniquely positioned to help bring together LIS's deep understanding of “information” and embodiment perspectives that may or may not have been developed in other disciplines. LIS researchers need to be more explicit about what their original contribution is, though, and what may have been appropriated from other disciplines.},

Previous work focused on developing machine‐learning classifiers restricted to specific disasters, such as storms or wildfires. We investigate for the first time methods to detect such messages where the type of the crisis is not known in advance, that is, the data are highly heterogeneous. Data heterogeneity causes significant difficulties for learning algorithms to generalize and accurately label incoming data. Our main contributions are as follows. First, we evaluate the extent of this problem in the context of disaster management, finding that the performance of traditional learners drops by up to 40% when trained and tested on heterogeneous data vis‐\'{a}‐vis homogeneous data. Then, in order to overcome data heterogeneity, we propose a new ensemble learning method, and found this to perform on a par with the Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost ensemble learners. The methods are studied on a benchmark data set comprising 26 disaster events and four classification problems: detection of relevant messages, informative messages, eyewitness reports, and topical classification of messages. Finally, in a case study, we evaluate the proposed methods on a real‐world data set to assess its practical value.},

So far, automated tools have been developed either to account for the social networks among participants in the debates, or to analyze the content of these debates. Less attention has been paid to mapping co‐occurrences of actors (participants) and topics (content) in online debates that can be considered as socio‐semantic networks. We propose a new, automated approach that uses the whole matrix of co‐addressed topics and actors for understanding and visualizing online debates. We show the advantages of the new approach with the analysis of two data sets: first, a large set of English‐language Twitter messages at the Rio + 20 meeting, in June 2012 (72,077 tweets), and second, a smaller data set of Dutch‐language Twitter messages on bird flu related to poultry farming in 2015–2017 (2,139 tweets). We discuss the theoretical, methodological, and substantive implications of our approach, also for the analysis of other social media data.},

abstract = {A study of enthusiast car restorers is used to illustrate how an information practice approach can provide information science researchers with a richer, more nuanced understanding of the complex interrelationship between people, technology, and information. An ethnographic approach incorporating both semistructured interviews and in the garage ethnographic observation was employed. Analysis was undertaken using an inductive, thematic approach. The findings demonstrate that participants' information environments are rich and complex. Participants' accounts emphasized the corporeal and embodied nature of the restoration process, and this may account for why they privileged the social networks they had developed, often over many decades, over online resources and communities. The findings indicate that participants are engaged in much more than applied problem solving. What is also evident is that engagement in the social world of car restoration, and the networks of social knowledge sharing it affords, is significant for the emotional support it provides for older men who often lose these networks later in life. In a sense, the participants are not only rebuilding their cars but also their own sense of self.},

abstract = {The materiality of information environments, and its role in information behavior, has received little attention. We present an ethnographic study involving 156 hours of observation and 28 patient interviews in outpatient hemodialysis facilities. Using an extended “Semiotic Framework for Information Systems Research,” the findings show that objects, spaces, and bodies were integral to 6 sociomaterial layers of facility information environments: the physical, empiric, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic, and social world. Objects of importance in the information environments included dialysis machines, instruments, records, paper documents, televisions, furniture, thermostats, lighting, and personal possessions. Spatial features, including compartmentalization, displays, distance, proximity, and spatially‐grounded routines, also constituted information environments. The information environments were also shaped by patient immobility, bodily discomforts, and orientation to bodily states. Each sociomaterial layer introduced enablers and constraints to information access, flow, and acceptance; these combined to construct patients primarily as passive recipients of information rather than active seekers and producers of information. A sociomaterial perspective and related focus on objects, spaces, and bodies offers a lens for professional information practice. We contribute information environment design guidance to facilitate such practice and stress that the value of certain sources and types of information can be materially encoded in an environment.},

The increasingly popular activity tracking technology (ATT) has given rise to a new type of personal information about one's daily physical activities, which has not been scrutinized under theoretical frameworks in PIM. This article presents an in‐depth qualitative interview study supplemented by participant‐driven photo elicitation with 20 long‐term activity tracker users about how they manage personal information generated by ATT. Key findings include the identification of two distinctive user groups (i.e., consistent casual users and powers users) among long‐term activity tracker users and an in‐depth portrayal of these groups' PIM behaviors with ATT. These behaviors include concurrent and subsequent PIM practices, 6 types of PIM activities, and the use of a spectrum of PIM tools. This research provides timely theoretical updates to PIM under the background of self‐tracking technologies, outlines empirical implications to improve ATT in support of PIM, and offers recommendations for incorporating participant‐driven photo elicitation as a supplementary method for qualitative interviews in information behavior research.},

abstract = {Libraries increasingly offer much of their collection online, rendering it invisible or unavailable to readers who, for reasons of information experience, prefer to browse the shelves. Although the evidence that shelf browsing is an important part of information behavior is increasing, information browsing as a behavior is somewhat of a black box (in contrast to web browsing, which is relatively well understood). It seems likely from early work that browsing is not, in fact, a monolithic behavior, but rather a set of behaviors and goals. The typologies presented in these works, however, are of a too high level to offer much insight into what support is needed for successful online browsing. In contrast, a recent spate of speculative browsing technologies meet some browsing needs, but offer little theoretical understanding of how systems support browsing. The major contribution of this article is a new typology of library browsing behavior based on recent observations of browsing behavior in libraries. The secondary contribution is an understanding of the interface features that would support these types of information browsers in an online environment.},

I employ affordances as a process concept to understand the recursive relationship between individuals and technologies and envision information practices as an outcome of this relationship. Guided by this conceptual framework, I conducted 30 semistructured interviews with LGBTQ+ individuals between the ages of 18 and 38. Data analysis identified 3 key affordances that enable and constrain participants' information practices: visibility, anonymity, and association. The findings indicate that participants are highly skilled in appropriating technological features to engage in desired information practices, such as seeking and creating. However, they also must contend with significant sociocultural barriers encoded into these features, which reinforce hetero‐ and cisnormative identity discourses. Library practitioners and systems designers can use these findings to offer services and systems inclusive of LGBTQ+ populations.},

Twenty students engaged in making projects of their choice with low‐ and high‐technologies for 15 weeks. Data collection included visual process mapping activities, surveys, and Dervin's Sense‐Making Methodology‐informed interviews. Findings included inspirations, actions, emotions, challenges, helps, and learning that occurred during the making processes. Information played an integral role as students engaged in creative production and learning. Students identified information as helps, challenges, how they learn, and learning outcomes. The study proposes a new, evolving process model of making that illustrates production‐centered information behavior and learning. The model's spiral form emphasizes the non‐linear and cyclical nature of the making process. Squiggly lines represent how the making process is gap‐filled and uncertain. The study contributes to the scholarly and professional fields of information science, library and information studies, maker, and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Math) learning.},

This article builds on discussions of the pleasurable and profound in information science conceptually and empirically. First, it argues for the necessity of phenomenology in these discussions, which heretofore has been mostly absent. Next, it presents results from a qualitative, empirical study on information in personally meaningful activities. The empirical study uses interpretative phenomenological analysis to examine information experience in three domains of personal meaning: Bible reading, ultramarathon running, and art‐making. The following themes emerge and are discussed: identity, central practice, curiosity, and presence. Opportunities for technological development and further research are outlined.},

Text mining and semantic network analysis methods were used to explore the usage patterns at semantic type levels of the identified medical concepts in tags, in blogs, and between tags and blogs. More various associations among semantic types were identified both in tags and in blogs. These associations were more diverse and complicated than the relationships in the Unified Medical Language System Semantic Network. Among the groups of concepts in tags and blogs, groups showed relatively stronger and more diverse relationships with other groups of concepts. In addition, many direct and close relations were found between tags and blogs.},

abstract = {Implicit detection of relevance has been approached by many during the last decade. From the use of individual measures to the use of multiple features from different sources (multimodality), studies have shown the feasibility to automatically detect whether a document is relevant. Despite promising results, it is not clear yet to what extent multimodality constitutes an effective approach compared to unimodality. In this article, we hypothesize that it is possible to build unimodal models capable of outperforming multimodal models in the detection of perceived relevance. To test this hypothesis, we conducted three experiments to compare unimodal and multimodal classification models built using a combination of 24 features. Our classification experiments showed that a univariate unimodal model based on the left‐click feature supports our hypothesis. On the other hand, our prediction experiment suggests that multimodality slightly improves early classification compared to the best unimodal models. Based on our results, we argue that the feasibility for practical applications of state‐of‐the‐art multimodal approaches may be strongly constrained by technology, cultural, ethical, and legal aspects, in which case unimodality may offer a better alternative today for supporting relevance detection in interactive information retrieval systems.},

To test the hypotheses, we collected and text‐mined online posts from product platforms such as review aggregator sites, discussion forums, and consumer rating websites, and non‐product platforms such as microblogs. The results showed that product platforms have more polarized opinions, and exhibit more convergence in opinion across time, compared with non‐product platforms. Our findings advise researchers and practitioners to pay attention to the characteristics of online platforms, and how users' perceptions of the purpose of the online platform may affect their online posting behavior.},

The major challenges for question retrieval in cQA are related to solving the lexical gap problem and estimating the relevance between questions. In this study, we first solve the lexical gap problem using a translation‐based language model (TRLM). Thereafter, we determine features and methods that are competent for estimating the relevance between two questions. For this purpose, we explore ways to use the results of a dependency parser and question classification for category information. Head‐dependent pairs are first extracted as bigram features, called dependency bigrams, from the analysis results of the dependency parser. The probability of each category is estimated using the softmax approach based on the scores of the classification results. Subsequently, we propose two retrieval models—the dependency‐based model (DM) and category‐based model (CM)—and they are applied to the previous model, TRLM. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly improve the performance of question retrieval in cQA services.},

Consequently, questions such as how users' intentions, task goals, and substances of the users' tasks affect search behavior, as well as what triggers information needs, remain largely unanswered. We report an experiment in which naturalistic information search behavior was captured by analyzing 24/7 continuous recordings of information on participants' computer screens. Written task diaries describing the participants' tasks were collected and used as real‐life task contexts for further categorization. All search tasks were extracted and classified under various task categories according to users' intentions, task goals, and substances of the tasks. We investigated the effect of different task categories on three behavioral factors: search efforts, content‐triggers, and application context. Our results suggest four findings: (i) Search activity is integrally associated with the users' creative processes. The content users have seen prior to searching more often triggers search, and is used as a query, within creative tasks. (ii) Searching within intellectual and creative tasks is more time‐intensive, while search activity occurring as a part of daily routine tasks is associated with more frequent searching within a search task. (iii) Searching is more often induced from utility applications in tasks demanding a degree of intellectual effort. (iv) Users' leisure information‐seeking activity is occurring inherently within social media services or comes from social communication platforms. The implications of our findings for information access and management systems are discussed.},

Using a content analysis approach to determine data breach severity attributes (measured by the total number of breached records, type of data accessed, the source of the data breach, and how the data were used), in conjunction with readability measures (reading complexity, numerical intensity, length of letter, word size, and unique words), 512 data breach incidents from 281 U.S. firms across the 2012–2015 period were examined. The results indicate that data breach severity has a positive impact on reading complexity, length of letter, word size, and unique words, and a negative impact on numerical terms. Interpreting the results collectively through the lens of impression management, it can be inferred that business managers may be attempting to obfuscate bad news associated with high data breach severity incidents by manipulating syntactical features of the data breach notification letters in a way that makes the message difficult for individuals to comprehend. The study contributes to the information studies and impression management behavior literatures by analyzing linguistic cues in notifications following a data breach incident.},

abstract = {Human spatial concepts, such as the concept of place, are not immediately translatable to the geometric foundations of spatial databases and information systems developed over the past 50 years. These systems typically rest on the concepts of objects and fields, both bound to coordinates, as two general paradigms of geographic representation. The match between notions of place occurring in everyday where questions and the data available to answer such questions is unclear and hinders progress in place‐based information systems. This is particularly true in novel application areas such as the Digital Humanities or speech‐based human–computer interaction, but also for location‐based services. Although this shortcoming has been observed before, we approach the challenges of relating places to information system representations with a fresh view, based on a set of core concepts of spatial information. These concepts have been proposed in information science with the intent of serving human–machine spatial question asking and answering. Clarifying the relationship of the notion of place to these concepts is a significant step toward geographically intelligent systems. The main result of the article is a demonstration that the notion of place fits existing concepts of spatial information, when these are adequately exploited and combined.},

abstract = {The impact of university rankings has driven scholars to increase productivity, and expanding collaboration has dramatically changed the publishing patterns in the academic publication system. The aim of this study was to develop a scholar classification scheme from publication patterns in academic science. Classification schemes are ways of describing groups that display different clusters of behaviors, approaches, or perspectives, and useful in the development of typologies. In this research, sample data are selected from three representative universities, considered a leading university, a middle‐tier university, and a noncomprehensive university. A final set of 11,427 effective scholars and their 284,128 journal publication records were used to develop the classification scheme via cluster analysis. The results identify six types of scholars, labeled as: singleton (8%), small‐team low performer (16%), small‐team high performer (17%), big‐team strategist (22%), free‐style follower (21%), and life‐time warrior (17%). These six scholar types demonstrate different approaches to publishing that can be used to understand both individual and research team performance across different institutional settings. Additionally, possible future work was identified that uses the scholar classification scheme to define the behavior for agents in an agent‐based model to simulate the strategic‐behavior‐driven academic publication system.},

abstract = {It is a frequently seen scenario that when people are not familiar with their search topics, they use a simple keyword search, which leads to a large amount of search results in multiple pages. This makes it difficult for users to pick relevant documents, especially given that they are not knowledgeable of the topics. To explore how systems can better help users find relevant documents from search results, the current research analyzed document selection behaviors of users with different levels of domain knowledge (DK). Data were collected in a laboratory study with 35 participants each searching on four tasks in the genomics domain. The results show that users with high and low DK levels selected different sets of documents to view; those high in DK read more documents and gave higher relevance ratings for the viewed documents than those low in DK did. Users with low DK tended to select documents ranking toward the top of the search result lists, and those with high in DK tended to also select documents ranking down the search result lists. The findings help design search systems that can personalize search results to users with different levels of DK.},

abstract = {Several Academic Social Networking Sites (ASNSs) have been launched in the last few years and their number of members is growing. Researchers using ASNSs come from very divergent scientific backgrounds and academic levels, prompting one to ask the question, What kind of communication and self‐presentation behaviors occur within these structures? The qualitative study presented in this article analyzed the communication behavior of a selected sample on ResearchGate (RG). It investigates how researchers present themselves on their personal‐profile sites and how they interact with other researchers. Overall, the results show that mostly young male academics without previous connections to each other (for example, faculty colleges) use RG for their scholarly exchanges. In general, communication behavior is characterized by an objective, professional, unemotional choice of words and seldom the use of polite salutations or words of farewell. However, there seems to be a correlation between long discussion and an increased use of colloquial and emotional language. Based on our findings, we derived preliminary practical recommendations for communications on ASNSs to improve the relationships in online academic interactions, to foster inclusiveness of gender and culture, and to reduce insecurity in matters of communication, presentation, and the exchange of scientific data.},

This article explores the conceptual frameworks, methods, and data sources used in bibliometrics to study the nature of the humanities, and its differences and similarities in comparison with other scientific domains. We give a historical overview of bibliometric scholarship between 1965 and 2018 that studies the humanities empirically and distinguishes between two periods in which the configuration of the bibliometric system differs remarkably. The first period, 1965 to the 1980s, is characterized by bibliometric methods embedded in a sociological theoretical framework, the development and use of the Price Index, and small samples of journal publications from which references are used as data sources. The second period, the 1980s to the present day, is characterized by a new intellectual hinterland—that of science policy and research evaluation—in which bibliometric methods become embedded. Here metadata of publications becomes the primary data source with which publication profiles of humanistic scholarly communities are analyzed. We unpack the differences between these two periods and critically discuss the analytical avenues that different approaches offer.},

However, measuring China's research output remains a challenge because Chinese scholars may publish their research in either international or national journals, yet no bibliometric database covers both the Chinese and English scientific literature. The purpose of this study is to compare Web of Science (WoS) with a Chinese bibliometric database in terms of authors and their performance, demonstrate the extent of the overlap between the two groups of Chinese most productive authors in both international and Chinese bibliometric databases, and determine how different disciplines may affect this overlap. The results of this study indicate that Chinese bibliometric databases, or a combination of WoS and Chinese bibliometric databases, should be used to evaluate Chinese research performance except in the few disciplines in which Chinese research performance could be assessed using WoS only.},

Author verification is a fundamental task where, given a set of texts written by a certain author, we should decide whether another text is also by that author. In this article we systematically study the usefulness of topic modeling in author verification. We examine several author verification methods that cover the main paradigms, namely, intrinsic (attempt to solve a one‐class classification task) and extrinsic (attempt to solve a binary classification task) methods as well as profile‐based (all documents of known authorship are treated cumulatively) and instance‐based (each document of known authorship is treated separately) approaches combined with well‐known topic modeling methods such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). We use benchmark data sets and demonstrate that LDA is better combined with extrinsic methods, while the most effective intrinsic method is based on LSI. Moreover, topic modeling seems to be particularly effective for profile‐based approaches and the performance is enhanced when latent topics are extracted by an enriched set of documents. The comparison to state‐of‐the‐art methods demonstrates the great potential of the approaches presented in this study. It is also demonstrates that even when genre‐agnostic external documents are used, the proposed extrinsic models are very competitive.},

According to different biblical scholars, the number of letters really attributed to Paul varies from 4 to 13, with a majority agreeing on seven. This article proposes to revisit this authorship attribution problem by considering two effective methods (Burrows' Delta, Labb\'{e}'s intertextual distance). Based on these results, a hierarchical clustering is then applied showing that four clusters can be derived, namely: {Colossians‐Ephesians}, {1 and 2 Thessalonians}, {Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy}, and {Romans, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians}. Moreover, a verification method based on the impostors' strategy indicates clearly that the group {Colossians‐Ephesians} is written by the same author who seems not to be Paul. The same conclusion can be found for the cluster {Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy}. The Letter to Philemon stays as a singleton, without any close stylistic relationship with the other epistles. Finally, a group of four letters {Romans, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians} is certainly written by the same author (Paul), but the verification protocol also indicates that 2 Corinthians is related to 1 Thessalonians, rendering a clear and simple interpretation difficult.},

Previous work has stressed that data‐sharing projects need to be sustainable in the long term, and highlighted the need for a deeper understanding of the operation model of existing data‐sharing initiatives. To investigate this important issue, we took a qualitative approach to uncover the dynamics of value creation in data sharing. Using a case study method, we examined two data‐sharing sites across different areas. We conducted semistructured interviews with managers from data centers and other stakeholders, and reviewed documents about the technical and managerial practices to determine the main characteristics of their business models. In addition, we applied the e3‐value modeling methodology to tease out the value flows within each site. Our findings demonstrated the importance of the value network dimension of a business model, as data sharing relies on a set of actors creating and getting value in the process, and the significance of intangible assets. The main contributions of this study include extending current understanding on data‐sharing business models by analyzing key dimensions, and uncovering how value is created and transferred in data sharing.},

This article fills this gap by examining information behaviors of international newcomer students during adjustment to local environments, that is, local information behavior (LIB). Drawing on prior work, we focus on the local co‐national context—the degree to which there are co‐nationals available in one's local environments—to analyze the LIBs of 149 first‐year graduate students and 57 follow‐up interviewees, who were classified into: International‐common group (students from China, India, and Korea—with many local co‐nationals), International‐less‐common group (students from other countries—with fewer local co‐nationals), and Domestic‐out‐of‐state group (students from other U.S. states; control group). We identify differences in international newcomer students' use of information sources during adjustment and the role that local co‐national contexts play in these differences. These results suggest ways that information scholars and practitioners might account for the influences of local co‐national contexts when examining information behaviors of internationally mobile students and designing systems and services for newcomers from around the world.},

We zoom in to the state of California and in more detail to Silicon Valley. Our results do not support the assumption of a national system of innovations in the U.S.A. Innovation systems appear to operate at the level of the states; the CBSA are too small, so that systemness spills across their borders. Decomposition of the sample in terms of high‐tech manufacturing (HTM), medium‐high‐tech manufacturing (MHTM), knowledge‐intensive services (KIS), and high‐tech services (HTKIS) does not change this pattern, but refines it. The East Coast—New Jersey, Boston, and New York—and California are the major players, with Texas a third one in the case of HTKIS. Chicago and industrial centers in the Midwest also contribute synergy. Within California, Los Angeles contributes synergy in the sectors of manufacturing, the San Francisco area in KIS. KIS in Silicon Valley and the Bay Area—a CSA composed of seven CBSA—spill over to other regions and even globally.},

In this study, we used a multiscale framework to reduce the effects caused by noise and to extract explainable geometric properties to characterize finite metric spaces. We conducted lab experiments that integrated the use of eye‐tracking, electrodermal activity (EDA), and user logs to explore users' information‐seeking behaviors on search engine result pages (SERPs). Experimental results of 1,590 search queries showed that the proposed strategies effectively predicted query‐level user satisfaction using EDA and eye‐tracking data. The bootstrap analysis showed that combining EDA and eye‐tracking data with user behavior data extracted from user logs led to a significantly better linear model fit than using user behavior data alone. Furthermore, cross‐user and cross‐task validations showed that our methods can be generalized to different search engine users performing different preassigned tasks.},

abstract = {The main goal of information retrieval (IR) is to satisfy information need (IN). IN refers to a complex concept: at the very initial state of the phenomenon (that is, at a visceral level), even the searcher may not be aware of its existence. Thus, despite advances in the past few decades in both the IR and relevant scientific communities, we do not fully understand how an IN emerges and how it is physically manifested. In this article we aim to inform a holistic view of the realization of IN using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We collected new data of brain activity of 24 participants while they formulated and stated a realization of IN in a Question Answering task, focusing on a distributed set of brain regions associated with activities related to IN, found in our previous study. Results of a functional connectivity analysis led us to propose a neuropsychological model of the realization of IN. Our model consists of three components: (a) a successful memory retrieval component, (b) an information flow regulation component, and (c) a high‐level perception component. We believe this study constitutes an important step in unraveling the nature of IN and how to better satisfy IN.},

abstract = {The use of implicit relevance feedback from neurophysiology could deliver effortless information retrieval. However, both computing neurophysiologic responses and retrieving documents are characterized by uncertainty because of noisy signals and incomplete or inconsistent representations of the data. We present the first‐of‐its‐kind, fully integrated information retrieval system that makes use of online implicit relevance feedback generated from brain activity as measured through electroencephalography (EEG), and eye movements. The findings of the evaluation experiment (N = 16) show that we are able to compute online neurophysiology‐based relevance feedback with performance significantly better than chance in complex data domains and realistic search tasks. We contribute by demonstrating how to integrate in interactive intent modeling this inherently noisy implicit relevance feedback combined with scarce explicit feedback. Although experimental measures of task performance did not allow us to demonstrate how the classification outcomes translated into search task performance, the experiment proved that our approach is able to generate relevance feedback from brain signals and eye movements in a realistic scenario, thus providing promising implications for future work in neuroadaptive information retrieval (IR).},

We conduct a quasi‐field experiment with 30 bilingual searchers and the results suggested that the ISP model was applicable in studying searchers' information retrieval behavior in search tasks. The ISP model was applicable in studying searchers' information retrieval behavior in simple tasks. However, searchers' emotional responses differed from those of the ISP model for a complex task. By testing searchers using different search strategies, the results suggested that search engines with multilanguage search functions provide an advantage for bilingual searchers in the Internet's multilingual environment. The findings showed that when searchers used a search engine as a tool for problem solving, they might experience different feelings in each ISP stage than in searching for information for a term paper using a library. The results echo other research findings that indicate that information seeking is a multifaceted phenomenon.},

abstract = {Information from microblogs is gaining increasing attention from researchers interested in analyzing fluctuations in stock markets. Behavioral financial theory draws on social psychology to explain some of the irrational behaviors associated with financial decisions to help explain some of the fluctuations. In this study we argue that social media users who demonstrate an interest in finance can offer insights into ways in which irrational behaviors may affect a stock market. To test this, we analyzed all the data collected over a 3‐month period in 2011 from Tencent Weibo (one of the largest microblogging websites in China). We designed a social influence (SI)‐based Tencent finance‐related moods model to simulate investors' irrational behaviors, and designed a Tencent Moods‐based Stock Trend Analysis (TM_STA) model to detect correlations between Tencent moods and the Hushen‐300 index (one of the most important financial indexes in China). Experimental results show that the proposed method can help explain the data fluctuation. The findings support the existing behavioral financial theory, and can help to understand short‐term rises and falls in a stock market. We use behavioral financial theory to further explain our findings, and to propose a trading model to verify the proposed model.},

abstract = {It is increasingly important to build topic linkages between scientific publications and patents for the purpose of understanding the relationships between science and technology. Previous studies on the linkages mainly focus on the analysis of nonpatent references on the front page of patents, or the resulting citation‐link networks, but with unsatisfactory performance. In the meanwhile, abundant mentioned entities in the scholarly articles and patents further complicate topic linkages. To deal with this situation, a novel statistical entity‐topic model (named the CCorrLDA2 model), armed with the collapsed Gibbs sampling inference algorithm, is proposed to discover the hidden topics respectively from the academic articles and patents. In order to reduce the negative impact on topic similarity calculation, word tokens and entity mentions are grouped by the Brown clustering method. Then a topic linkages construction problem is transformed into the well‐known optimal transportation problem after topic similarity is calculated on the basis of symmetrized Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence. Extensive experimental results indicate that our approach is feasible to build topic linkages with more superior performance than the counterparts.},

The topic relevance model uses event‐related potential (ERP) components to describe the process of topic relevance judgment. More specifically, the topic relevance model indicates that N400 and P600, which have been successfully applied to the mismatch process of a stimulus and the discourse‐internal reorganization and integration process of a stimulus, respectively, are used for the topic mismatch process of a topic‐irrelevant video shot and the topic formation process of a topic‐relevant video shot. To evaluate our proposed ERP/MMR‐based method, we compared the video skims generated by the ERP/MMR‐based, ERP‐based, and shot boundary detection (SBD) methods with ground truth skims. The results showed that at a significance level of 0.05, the ROUGE‐1 scores of the ERP/MMR method are statistically higher than those of the SBD method, and the diversity scores of the ERP/MMR method are statistically higher than those of the ERP method. This study suggested that the proposed method may be applied to the construction of a video skim without operational intervention, such as the insertion of a black screen between video shots.},

Tag is represented inked red or green according to users' personal experiences and judgments about purchased items: red for positive comments, green for negative ones. The valence of users' emotion induced by red or green is controversial. This study firstly discovers that colored tags inked in red incite users' positive emotion (evaluations) and colored tags inked in green incite negative emotion (evaluations) using an ERP experiment, which is manifested in ERP components (e.g., N170, N2c, and LPC). There are two main features of Tag: the text of Tag (abbr. Text) and the color of Tag (abbr.Color). Our study then proves that Color (red or green) is the dominant factor in users' decision behavior compared with Text under the high cognitive load condition, while users' decision behavior is influenced by Text (positive tags or negative tags) predominately rather than by Color under the low cognitive load condition with the help of Eye tracking instrument. Those findings can help to design colored tags for recommendation systems on e‐commerce websites and other online platforms.},

The goal of this substudy was to examine the relationships between measures of self‐reported health information behavior and neural measures of health information processing in a sample of 19 prehypertensive African Americans (mean age = 52.5, 52.6% women). We measured (a) health information seeking, sharing, and use (surveys) and (b) neural activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess response to health information videos. We hypothesized that differential activation (comparison of analytic vs. empathic brain activity when watching a specific type of video) would indicate better function in three, distinct cognitive domains: (a) Analytic Network, (b) Default Mode Network (DMN), and (c) ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Scores on the information sharing measure (but not seeking or use) were positively associated with differential activation in the vmPFC (rs = .53, p = .02) and the DMN (rs = .43, p = .06). Our findings correspond with previous work indicating that activation of the DMN and vmPFC is associated with sharing information to persuade others and with behavior change. Although health information is commonly conveyed as detached and analytic in nature, our findings suggest that neural processing of socially and emotionally salient health information is more closely associated with health information sharing.},

abstract = {Clustering of like‐minded users is basically the goal of community detection (CD) in social networks and many researchers have proposed different algorithms for the same. In signed social networks (SSNs) where type of link is also considered besides the links itself, CD aims to partition the network in such a way to have less positive inter‐connections and less negative intra‐connections among communities. So, approaches used for CD in unsigned networks do not perform well when directly applied on signed networks. Most of the CD algorithms are based on single objective optimization criteria of optimizing modularity which focuses only on link density without considering the type of links existing in the network. In this work, a multiobjective approach for CD in SSNs is proposed considering both the link density as well as the sign of links. Precisely we are developing a method using modularity, frustration and social balance factor as multiple objectives to be optimized (M‐F‐SBF model). NSGA‐II algorithm is used to maintain elitism and diversity in the solutions. Experiments are performed on both existing benchmarked and real‐world datasets show that our approach has led to better solutions, clearly indicating the effectiveness of our proposed M‐F‐SBF model.},

The structure of academics' ego‐networks on social networking sites differs by platform. Networks on academic sites were smaller and more highly clustered, whereas Twitter networks were larger and more diffuse. Institutions and research interests define communities on academic sites, compared with research topics and personal interests on Twitter.

An authorship verification accuracy greater than 90% was accomplished via the application of stylometric methods on four different languages (English, Greek, Spanish, and Dutch, while the verification for Dutch is slightly lower). For the multilingual case, the highest authorship verification accuracy using basic machine‐learning methods, over 90%, was achieved by the application of the kNN and SVM‐SMO methods, using the feature selection method SVM‐RFE. The improvement in authorship verification accuracy in multilingual cases, over 94%, was accomplished via ensemble learning methods, with the MultiboostAB method being a bit more accurate, but Random Forest is generally more appropriate.},

abstract = {Finding relevant publications is a common task. Typically, a researcher browses through a list of publications and traces additional relevant publications. When relevant publications are identified, the list may be expanded by the citation links of the relevant publications. The information needs of researchers may change as they go through such iterative processes. The exploration process quickly becomes cumbersome as the list expands. Most existing academic search systems tend to be limited in terms of the extent to which searchers can adapt their search as they proceed. In this article, we introduce an adaptive visual exploration system named PaperPoles to support exploration of scientific publications in a context‐aware environment. Searchers can express their information needs by intuitively formulating positive and negative queries. The search results are grouped and displayed in a cluster view, which shows aspects and relevance patterns of the results to support navigation and exploration. We conducted an experiment to compare PaperPoles with a list‐based interface in performing two academic search tasks with different complexity. The results show that PaperPoles can improve the accuracy of searching for the simple and complex tasks. It can also reduce the completion time of searching and improve exploration effectiveness in the complex task. PaperPoles demonstrates a potentially effective workflow for adaptive visual search of complex information.},

Our interviews, weblogs, ethnography, and document analyses reveal that a few large contributors provide a steady flow of content, but most are academic researchers who submit data sets infrequently and often restrict access to their files. Consumers are a diverse group that overlaps minimally with contributors. Archivists devote about half their time to aiding contributors with curation processes and half to assisting consumers. Given the diversity and infrequency of usage, human assistance in curation and search remains essential. DANS' knowledge infrastructure encompasses public and private stakeholders who contribute, consume, harvest, and serve their data—many of whom did not exist at the time the DANS collections originated—reinforcing the need for continuous investment in digital data archives as their communities, technologies, and services evolve.},

The proposed models are calibrated to clickstream data collected from an educational institute over a seven‐and‐a‐half month period. Based on the best fit model, a metric, utility loss, is constructed to measure the performance of each link and arrange them accordingly. Empirical results show that the proposed metric is highly efficient for prioritizing the links on a homepage and the methodology can also be used to study the feasibility of introducing a new function in a Website.},

In a two‐phase survey, we investigate scholars' familiarity and usage of traditional metrics and altmetrics. In this paper, we present the second phase with 448 participants. We found few traditional metrics, like the Journal Impact Factor and number of citations, are familiar to and often used by scholars for research evaluation. Among altmetrics, only views/downloads, readers, and followers are known to more than half the respondents. Unseen benefits and lack of time are hindrances to using metrics for the evaluation of research outputs. Although social media are well‐known, scholars prefer promoting their research by publishing in journals and attending conferences. We found social media usage, perceived ease of use and usefulness of altmetrics affect the usage of altmetrics. Findings suggest altmetrics have attracted attention in academia and could be considered complementary to traditional metrics. We acknowledge that due to the limited sample size, statistics and demographics in this study, findings cannot be said to be representative of the entire academic population worldwide. Future studies are needed that cover a wider range of academic disciplines around the world.},

abstract = {Text representation models are the fundamental basis for information retrieval and text mining tasks. Although different text models have been proposed, they typically target specific task aspects in isolation, such as time efficiency, accuracy, or applicability for different scenarios. Here we present Bag of Textual Graphs (BoTG), a general text representation model that addresses these three requirements at the same time. The proposed textual representation is based on a graph‐based scheme that encodes term proximity and term ordering, and represents text documents into an efficient vector space that addresses all these aspects as well as provides discriminative textual patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted in two experimental scenarios—classification and retrieval—considering multiple well‐known text collections. We also compare our model against several methods from the literature. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is generic enough to handle different tasks and collections. It is also more efficient than the widely used state‐of‐the‐art methods in textual classification and retrieval tasks, with a competitive effectiveness, sometimes with gains by large margins.},

abstract = {Human Information Behavior (HIB) research commonly examines behavior in the context of why information is acquired and how it will be used, but usually at the level of the work or everyday‐life tasks the information will support. HIB has not been examined in detail at the broader contextual level of intellectual purpose (that is, the higher‐order conceptual tasks the information was acquired to support). Examination at this level can enhance holistic understanding of HIB as a “means to an intellectual end” and inform the design of digital information environments that support information interaction for specific intellectual purposes. We investigate information‐based ideation (IBI) as a specific intellectual information acquisition and use context by conducting Critical Incident‐style interviews with 10 game designers, focusing on how they interact with information to generate and develop creative design ideas. Our findings give rise to a framework of their ideation‐focused HIB, which systems designers can leverage to reason about how best to support certain behaviors to drive design ideation. These findings emphasize the importance of intellectual purpose as a driver for acquisition and desired outcome of use.},

abstract = {The web has been, in the last decades, the place where information retrieval achieved its maximum importance, given its ubiquity and the sheer volume of information. However, its exponential growth made the retrieval task increasingly hard, relying in its effectiveness on idiosyncratic and somewhat biased ranking algorithms. To deal with this problem, a “new” web, called the Semantic Web (SW), was proposed, bringing along concepts like “Web of Data” and “Linked Data,” although the definitions and connections among these concepts are often unclear. Based on a qualitative approach built over a literature review, a definition of SW is presented, discussing the related concepts sometimes used as synonyms. It concludes that the SW is a comprehensive and ambitious construct that includes the great purpose of making the web a global database. It also follows the specifications developed and/or associated with its operationalization and the necessary procedures for the connection of data in an open format on the web. The goals of this comprehensive SW are the union of two outcomes still tenuously connected: the virtually unlimited possibility of connections between data—the web domain—with the potentiality of the automated inference of “intelligent” systems—the semantic component.},

However, current methods in role analysis have overlooked content generated by users (e.g., posts) in social media and hence focus more on user behavior analysis. The user‐generated content is very important for characterizing users. In this paper, we propose a novel method which integrates both user behavior and posted content by users to identify roles in online social networks. The proposed method models a role as a joint distribution of Gaussian distribution and multinomial distribution, which represent user behavioral feature and content feature respectively. The proposed method can be used to determine the number of roles concerned automatically. The experimental results show that the proposed method can be used to identify various roles more effectively and to get more insights on such characteristics.},

This article presents a mixed‐methods study of LibraryThing and Goodreads, which have characteristics of information‐centric online communities and social digital libraries, with attention to their roles as boundary objects, users' information values, and information behavior, and other boundaries and boundary objects at play. Content analysis of messages, a survey of users, and qualitative interviews show LibraryThing and Goodreads help establish community and organizational structure; support sharing of information values; and facilitate the building and maintenance of social ties. Translation of meanings and understandings within and between communities is a key activity in these roles. Online communities and social digital libraries should highlight translation processes and resources; provide user profiles and off‐topic spaces and encourage their use; take a sociotechnical approach to tailor technology and community features to the right audiences; and facilitate the establishment of shared structure, values, and ties and the work of boundary spanners. Further implications exist for research on and theorizing of information‐centric online communities, boundaries, and boundary objects as part of the sociotechnical infrastructure surrounding online information sharing.},

abstract = {The Internet has become the first source of consumer health information. Most theoretical and empirical studies are centered on information needs and seeking, rather than on information outcomes. This review's purpose is to explore and explain health outcomes of Online Consumer Health Information (OCHI) in primary care. A participatory systematic mixed studies review with a framework synthesis was undertaken. Starting from an initial conceptual framework, our specific objectives were to (a) identify types of OCHI outcomes in primary care, (b) identify factors associated with these outcomes, and (c) integrate these factors and outcomes into a comprehensive revised framework combining an information theory and a psychosocial theory of behavior. The results of 65 included studies were synthesized using a qualitative thematic data analysis. The themes derived from the literature underwent a harmonization process that produced a comprehensive typology of OCHI outcomes. The revised conceptual framework specifies four individual and one organizational level of OCHI outcomes, while including factors such as consumers' information needs and four interdependent contextual factors. It contributes to theoretical knowledge about OCHI health outcomes, and informs future research, information assessment methods, and tools to help consumers find and use health information.},

abstract = {Several studies have found that collaboration networks are scale‐free, proposing that such networks can be modeled by specific network evolution mechanisms like preferential attachment. This study argues that collaboration networks can look more or less scale‐free depending on the methods for resolving author name ambiguity in bibliographic data. Analyzing networks constructed from multiple datasets containing 3.4 M ∼ 9.6 M publication records, this study shows that collaboration networks in which author names are disambiguated by the commonly used heuristic, i.e., forename‐initial‐based name matching, tend to produce degree distributions better fitted to power‐law slopes with the typical scaling parameter (2 &lt; α &lt; 3) than networks disambiguated by more accurate algorithm‐based methods. Such tendency is observed across collaboration networks generated under various conditions such as cumulative years, 5‐ and 1‐year sliding windows, and random sampling, and through simulation, found to arise due mainly to artefactual entities created by inaccurate disambiguation. This cautionary study calls for special attention from scholars analyzing network data in which entities such as people, organization, and gene can be merged or split by improper disambiguation.},

Strikingly, OAMJ authors showed a low understanding of soundness‐only peer review: two‐thirds believed OAMJs took into account novelty, significance, and relevance, although there were marked geographical variations. Author satisfaction with OAMJs, however, was high, with more than 80% of OAMJ authors saying they would publish again in the same journal, although there were variations by title, and levels were slightly lower than subscription journals (over 90%). Their reasons for choosing to publish in OAMJs included a wide variety of factors, not significantly different from reasons given by authors of other journals, with the most important including the quality of the journal and quality of peer review. About half of OAMJ articles had been submitted elsewhere before submission to the OAMJ with some evidence of a “cascade” of articles between journals from the same publisher.},

Our best results on the RepLab dataset (which improves the state of the art) uses language models to learn the domain‐specific vocabulary used by influencers and combines domain and authority models using a Learning to Rank algorithm. Our experiments show that (a) both authority and domain evidence can be trained from the vocabulary of influencers; (b) once the language of influencers is modeled as a likelihood signal, further supervised learning and additional network‐based signals only provide marginal improvements; and (c) the availability of training data sets is crucial to obtain competitive results in the task. Our most remarkable finding is that influencers do use a distinctive vocabulary, which is a more reliable signal than nontextual network indicators such as the number of followers, retweets, and so on.},

abstract = {Since natural disasters can affect many people over a vast area, studying information‐seeking behavior (ISB) during disasters is of great importance. Many previous studies have relied on online social network data, providing insights into the ISB of those with Internet access. However, in a large‐scale natural disaster such as the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, people in the most severely affected areas tended to have limited Internet access. Therefore, an alternative data source should be explored to investigate disaster‐related ISB. This study's contributions are twofold. First, we provide a detailed description of natural disaster‐related ISB of people who experienced a large‐scale earthquake and tsunami, based on analysis of written testimonies published by local authorities. This provided insight into the relationship between information needs, channels, and sources of disaster‐related ISB. Also, our approach facilitates the study of ISB of people without Internet access both during and after a disaster. Second, we provide empirical evidence to demonstrate that the temporal stages of a disaster can characterize people's ISB during the disaster. Therefore, we propose further consideration of the temporal aspects of events for improved understanding of disaster‐related ISB.},

abstract = {Text reuse is becoming a serious issue in many fields and research shows that it is much harder to detect when it occurs across languages. The recent rise in multi‐lingual content on the Web has increased cross‐language text reuse to an unprecedented scale. Although researchers have proposed methods to detect it, one major drawback is the unavailability of large‐scale gold standard evaluation resources built on real cases. To overcome this problem, we propose a cross‐language sentence/passage level text reuse corpus for the English‐Urdu language pair. The Cross‐Language English‐Urdu Corpus (CLEU) has source text in English whereas the derived text is in Urdu. It contains in total 3,235 sentence/passage pairs manually tagged into three categories that is near copy, paraphrased copy, and independently written. Further, as a second contribution, we evaluate the Translation plus Mono‐lingual Analysis method using three sets of experiments on the proposed dataset to highlight its usefulness. Evaluation results (f1=0.732 binary, f1=0.552 ternary classification) indicate that it is harder to detect cross‐language real cases of text reuse, especially when the language pairs have unrelated scripts. The corpus is a useful benchmark resource for the future development and assessment of cross‐language text reuse detection systems for the English‐Urdu language pair.},

The traditional cluster hypothesis also does not consider the dependency between related queries. The goal of this paper is to leverage similar search intents to perform ranking consistency so that the search performance can be improved accordingly. Different from the previous supervised approach, which learns relevance by click‐through data, we propose a novel cocluster hypothesis to bridge the gap between relevance ranking and ranking consistency. A nearest‐neighbors test is also designed to measure the extent to which the cocluster hypothesis holds. Based on the hypothesis, we further propose a two‐stage unsupervised approach, in which two ranking heuristics and a cost function are developed to optimize the combination of consistency and uniqueness (or inconsistency). Extensive experiments have been conducted on a real and large‐scale search engine log. The experimental results not only verify the applicability of the proposed cocluster hypothesis but also show that our approach is effective in boosting the retrieval performance of the commercial search engine and reaches a comparable performance to the supervised approach.},

In recent times, there have been several research efforts toward devising a variety of techniques to summarize tweets in Twitter. However, these techniques are either not personal (that is, consider only tweets in the timeline of a specific user) or are too expensive to be realized on a mobile device. Given that 80% of active Twitter users access the site on mobile devices, in this article we present a lightweight, personal, on‐demand, topic modeling‐based tweets summarization engine called TOTEM, designed for such devices. Specifically, TOTEM first preprocesses recent tweets in a user's timeline and exploits Latent Dirichlet Allocation‐based topic modeling to assign each preprocessed tweet to a topic. Then it generates a ranked list of relevant tweets, a topic label, and a topic summary for each of the topics. Our experimental study with real‐world data sets demonstrates the superiority of TOTEM.},

This article is the first to use mixed method to examine the extent of alphabetic author order and to examine why researchers adopt a certain author order norm in the fields of economics and political science. The article finds that alphabetic authorship has been and is the norm in economics, while some tendency towards it exists in political science. The differences in the intellectual and social organization of the fields seem to be a factor in the extent that these researchers will adopt a certain norm. Furthermore, the increasing number of authors per article and the publish‐or‐perish culture seems to put pressure on the alphabetic norm because it creates greater attention to the reputational advantages of being first‐author.},

abstract = {Virtual collaborations bring together people who must work together despite having varied access to and understanding of the work at hand. In many cases, the collaborations are technology supported, meaning that the work is done through shared documents. We develop a framework articulating the characteristics of documents supporting collaborators with access to asymmetric knowledge versus those with access to symmetric knowledge. Drawing on theories about document genre, boundary objects, and provenance, we hypothesize that documents supporting asymmetric collaborators are likely to articulate or prescribe their own (a) purpose, (b) context of use, (c) content and form, and (d) provenance in greater detail than documents supporting symmetric collaborators. We explore these hypotheses through content analysis of documents and instructions for documents from a variety of free/libre open‐source projects (FLOSS). We present findings consistent with the hypotheses developed as well as results extending beyond our theory‐derived assumptions. When participants have access to the same knowledge, the study suggests that prescriptions about the content of documents become less important compared with prescriptions about the context, provenance, and process of work. The study contributes with a dynamic perspective on communicative practices that consider an often‐uneven distribution of knowledge in virtual collaborations.},

abstract = {Today there is the emerging horizon of smart infrastructure due to rapid developments in artificial intelligence, embedded sensing, pervasive computing, and ubiquitous mobility. To navigate this landscape and drive innovations, Virginia Tech launched the strategic development of Intelligent Infrastructure for Human Centered Communities or IIHCC. It is timely to study the integrative design process and transdisciplinary discourse for the “smart” future. This study employed qualitative research methods including ethnographic participant observation, document analysis, and semistructured interviews. The mixed‐methods approach is especially useful for capturing typical scenarios, emergent issues, and practical examples surrounding the smart infrastructure endeavors and the array of challenges and creative frictions encountered. Taking a sociotechnical perspective, this study explored how IIHCC can achieve significant program synergies and inspire new collaborations across intellectual boundaries. Furthermore, it investigated how libraries can work collaboratively and constructively with the community to build a stimulating culture of a transdisciplinary mechanism and collective intelligence. Tying all these together, the study then discusses how we can achieve a synergistic discourse by way of data as distinct unifiers for cross‐domain collaborations. It concludes by presenting multidimensional opportunities and multispectral engagement for libraries to potentially chart a new course and become a driving force in this evolution.},

This article describes the design and development of a novel ontology‐based framework to illustrate how ontologies can interface with distributed data sources. The framework is then tested using a survey instrument and an integrated research model of user satisfaction and technology acceptance. A description is provided of extensions to an industry standard ontology, specifically the Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO), towards enabling greater data interchange. Our results reveal a significant reduction in manual processes, increase in data quality, and improved data aggregation by employing the framework. The research model reveals the range of factors that drive acceptance of the framework. Additional interview evidence reveals that the ontological framework also allows organizations to react to regulatory changes with much‐improved timeframes and provides opportunities to test for data quality.},

abstract = {This study investigates motivations for self‐archiving research items on academic social networking sites (ASNSs). A model of these motivations was developed based on two existing motivation models: motivation for self‐archiving in academia and motivations for information sharing in social media. The proposed model is composed of 18 factors drawn from personal, social, professional, and external contexts, including enjoyment, personal/professional gain, reputation, learning, self‐efficacy, altruism, reciprocity, trust, community interest, social engagement, publicity, accessibility, self‐archiving culture, influence of external actors, credibility, system stability, copyright concerns, additional time, and effort. Two hundred and twenty‐six ResearchGate users participated in the survey. Accessibility was the most highly rated factor, followed by altruism, reciprocity, trust, self‐efficacy, reputation, publicity, and others. Personal, social, and professional factors were also highly rated, while external factors were rated relatively low. Motivations were correlated with one another, demonstrating that RG motivations for self‐archiving could increase or decrease based on several factors in combination with motivations from the personal, social, professional, and external contexts. We believe the findings from this study can increase our understanding of users' motivations in sharing their research and provide useful implications for the development and improvement of ASNS services, thereby attracting more active users.},

abstract = {Advancements in computer‐mediated exercise put forward the feasibility of telerehabilitation, but it remains a challenge to retain patients' engagement in exercises. Building on our previous study demonstrating enhanced engagement in citizen science through social information about others' contributions, we propose a novel framework for effective telerehabilitation that integrates citizen science and social information into physical exercise. We hypothesized that social information about others' contributions would augment engagement in physical activity by encouraging people to invest more effort toward discovery of novel information in a citizen science context. We recruited healthy participants to monitor the environment of a polluted canal by tagging images using a haptic device toward gathering environmental information. Along with the images, we displayed the locations of the tags created by the previous participants. We found that participants increased both the amount and duration of physical activity when presented with a larger number of the previous tags. Further, they increased the diversity of tagged objects by avoiding the locations tagged by the previous participants, thereby generating richer information about the environment. Our results suggest that social information is a viable means to augment engagement in rehabilitation exercise by incentivizing the contribution to scientific activities.},

However, they rarely make use of the interrelationship among documents on readability, which can help increase the accuracy of readability assessment. In this article, we adopt a graph‐based classification method to model and utilize the relationship among documents using the coupled bag‐of‐words model. We propose a word coupling method to build the coupled bag‐of‐words model by estimating the correlation between words on reading difficulty. In addition, we propose a two‐view graph propagation method to make use of both the coupled bag‐of‐words model and the linguistic features. Our method employs a graph merging operation to combine graphs built according to different views, and improves the label propagation by incorporating the ordinal relation among reading levels. Experiments were conducted on both English and Chinese data sets, and the results demonstrate both effectiveness and potential of the method.},

Among 49 articles suffering delayed recognition we found 13 that are also under‐cited influential. Based on a thorough investigation of these special cases we found that so‐called authoritative citers play an important role in uniting the two different document types into a special citation chimera.

The researchers gathered interview data from 24 mothers. Resulting data were inductively analyzed using Chatman's (1996) theory of information poverty. We propose information marginalization as a complimentary concept to describe the contextual conditions that contribute to a range of defensive information behaviors and suggest that assessment of these contextual conditions be a part of the system design process. This study has implications for the development and design of systems and service models intended to provide access to information and services for individuals with disability and contributes to a critical literature on information poverty.},

abstract = {This research article puts forward a method to identify the national heritage of authors based on the morphology of their surnames. Most studies in the field use variants of dictionary‐based surname methods to identify ethnic communities, an approach that suffers from methodological limitations. Using the public file of ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifiers in 2015, we developed a surname‐based identification method and applied it to infer Russian heritage from suffix‐based morphological regularities. The method was developed conceptually and tested in an undersampled control set. Identification based on surname morphology was then complemented by using first‐name data to eliminate false‐positive results. The method achieved 98% precision and 94% recall rates—superior to most other methods that use name data. The procedure can be adapted to identify the heritage of a variety of national groups with morphologically regular naming traditions. We elaborate on how the method can be employed to overcome long‐standing limitations of using name data in bibliometric datasets. This identification method can contribute to advancing research in scientific mobility and migration, patenting by certain groups, publishing and collaboration, transnational and scientific diaspora links, and the effects of diversity on the innovative performance of organizations, regions, and countries.},

Using the so‐called “excellence indicator” PPtop‐10%—the proportion of the top‐10% most‐highly‐cited papers assigned to a university—we pursue a classification using (a) overlapping stability intervals, (b) statistical‐significance tests, and (c) effect sizes of differences among 902 universities in 54 countries; we focus on the UK, Germany, Brazil, and the USA as national examples. Although the groupings remain largely the same using different statistical significance levels or overlapping stability intervals, these classifications are uncorrelated with those based on effect sizes. Effect sizes for the differences between universities are small (w &lt; .2). The more detailed analysis of universities at the country level suggests that distinctions beyond three or perhaps four groups of universities (high, middle, low) may not be meaningful. Given similar institutional incentives, isomorphism within each eco‐system of universities should not be underestimated. Our results suggest that networks based on overlapping stability intervals can provide a first impression of the relevant groupings among universities. However, the clusters are not well‐defined divisions between groups of universities.},

We divided these articles into three groups according to the ethnic backgrounds of the first and corresponding authors, obtained by Ethnea, and examined the scientific writing styles in English from a two‐fold perspective of linguistic complexity: (a) syntactic complexity, including measurements of sentence length and sentence complexity; and (b) lexical complexity, including measurements of lexical diversity, lexical density, and lexical sophistication. The observations suggest marginal differences between groups in syntactical and lexical complexity.},

Using the Hierarchical Linear Modeling software package and the 2‐wave data from 166 individuals in 51 wiki‐based teams, we found cross‐level interaction effects between individual epistemic motivation and team task reflexivity on different knowledge contribution behaviors on wikis. Epistemic motivation exerted a positive effect on adding, which was strengthened by team task reflexivity. The effect of epistemic motivation on deleting was positive only when task reflexivity was high. In addition, epistemic motivation was strongly positively related to revising, regardless of the level of task reflexivity involved.},

The current study simplified the scheme through another experiment that followed the same design as LKC15 and involved 32 university students. The study had one added questionnaire item that provided a list of the 21 difficulty reasons in the multiple‐choice format. By comparing the current study with LKC15, a concept of primary top difficulty reasons was proposed, which reasonably simplified the 21‐item scheme to an 8‐item top reason list. This limited number of reasons is more manageable and makes it feasible for search systems to predict task difficulty reasons from observable user behaviors, which builds the basis for systems to improve user satisfaction based on predicted search difficulty reasons.},

abstract = {Knowledge withholding, which is defined as the likelihood that an individual devotes less than full effort to knowledge contribution, can be regarded as an emerging social deviance behavior for knowledge practice in online knowledge spaces. However, prior studies placed a great emphasis on proactive knowledge behaviors, such as knowledge sharing and contribution, but failed to consider the uniqueness of knowledge withholding. To capture the social‐deviant nature of knowledge withholding and to better understand how people deal with counterproductive knowledge behaviors, this study develops a research model based on the secondary control perspective. Empirical analyses were conducted using the data collected from an online knowledge space. The results indicate that both predictive control and vicarious control exert a positive influence on knowledge withholding. This study also incorporates knowledge‐withholding acceptability as a moderating variable of secondary control strategies. In particular, knowledge‐withholding acceptability enhances the impact of predictive control, whereas it weakens the effect of vicarious control on knowledge withholding. This study concludes with a discussion of the key findings, and the implications for both research and practice.},

abstract = {We examine the concept of personal knowledge management using data drawn from our study of digital nomads. We make two contributions: an empirical and conceptual development of knowledge management as it relates to independent workers and an advancement of social informatics that builds on Gibson's ecological perspective. Digital nomads provide an empirical basis to better understand how knowledge management is shifting from organization‐centric, with its concomitant emphasis on organizational information systems, to worker‐centric, which relies on personal knowledge ecologies. We advance this concept as a combination of personal knowledge management activities and the digital technologies that support them. Our data make clear that individuals are the locus of personal knowledge ecologies, but these ecologies are embedded in a larger community of collaborators, clients, and peers who are often extensively mediated by digital technologies. This embedding and mediation are at the core of the sociotechnical arrangements that define the personal knowledge ecologies that we document.},

abstract = {Agricultural research in developing countries often involves collaboration between dispersed multicultural teams of scientists from developed and developing countries. The teams use information and computing technologies (ICTs) to communicate between team members, who originate from different cultures using different languages. This paper investigates the usability and utility of a range of ICTs used for communication between team members from different cultures. The research used an intercultural heuristic evaluation tool, or I‐CHET, to evaluate nine ICTs used by Australian and Lao scientists for team communication. The evaluation showed that asynchronous ICTs (e.g., e‐mail) were preferred by non‐native English speakers, while synchronous media (e.g., audio conferencing, instant messaging, Skype) presented considerable problems between team members from different cultures. Most ICTs evaluated in the study demonstrated little consideration for non‐native English speakers and for inexperienced ICTs users. However, all evaluated ICTs demonstrated the ability to transmit information and encourage communication between information users in scientific collaborations. The I‐CHET assessment tool highlights the ongoing need for a “toolbox” of communication ICTs for research collaborations that can be adapted to suit the cultural and professional needs of multinational teams, worldwide.},

abstract = {Social informatics researchers use a variety of techniques to explore the intersections between technology and society. Current interest has turned to making more explicit our commonly tacit knowledge processes that involve people and technology. Knowledge creation, sharing, and management processes are commonly hidden, and this is even more the case regarding ignorance processes such as the denial and obfuscation of knowledge. Understanding the construction, generation, and perpetuation of ignorance can: (i) provide insights into social phenomena that might otherwise seem inexplicable (for instance, persistence of “urban myths”), and (ii) enable development of interventions to either facilitate (as with privacy‐sensitive material) or combat (as with malicious disinformation) ignorance. Although several pressing information issues relate to ignorance, agnotology (the study of ignorance) has only recently entered into the information science literature. An agnotologic approach expands the repertoire of methods and approaches in social informatics, better enabling the field to grapple with pressing contemporary issues of mis/dis/lack of information. Using Robert Proctor's typology of constructions of ignorance, this article describes ways that each type may be germane to and within social informatics, highlighting social informatics topics that would benefit from agnotologic exploration, and suggesting theoretical and methodological approaches useful to a social informatics of ignorance.},

This qualitative study examines the practices of decision makers as they engage with DSS‐DD at a large U.S. Midwestern university and uncovers the socio‐technical characteristics that lead to limited or non‐use of dashboards. To examine these practices and characteristics, this study presents a framework grounded in socio‐technical interaction networks from social informatics and sociomateriality from information systems that explores the socio‐technical practices of users within organizations, while acknowledging the impact of the users' socio‐technical contexts on their DSS‐DD practices. The results show that during the design and implementation phases of these dashboards the institutional contexts that the dashboards are meant to inform are often ignored; and that as users interact with these systems they develop unintended and shadow practices that lead to limited or non‐use of the dashboards for decision making purposes. Additionally, the study finds that users' practices are influenced by their local socio‐technical networks, which includes their prior experiences using institutional data, other actors within their institutional unit, and the political and social contexts which shape the users' decision making behavior and data‐use practices.},

abstract = {Knowledge embodiment, taking a social informatics perspective, refers to the transformation of knowledge into a form in which its value becomes evident. Knowledge embodiment in robotic systems with artificial intelligence (AI robotic systems) actualizes the value of knowledge much more powerfully than other entities, potentially altering the connections among people or even displacing professionals. To understand the effects of knowledge embodiment in AI robotic systems on connections among people and technology, this study addresses 2 cumulative research questions: (i) What is the nature of knowledge embodiment, that is, how are knowledge and AI robots assembled for knowledge work? (ii) How does knowledge embodiment affect connections among people and technology (that is, social informatics)? A case study of a large hospital that has employed different AI robotic systems in many parts of its healthcare service provision process indicates 4 forms of knowledge embodiment, each with a distinct focus. Further, a social informatics analysis suggests four ways knowledge embodiment affects connections among people and technology and reveals related social and institutional issues that go beyond technological determinism. Implications of these findings for research on social informatics and information science are discussed.},

abstract = {The present challenge faced by scientists working with Big Data comes in the overwhelming volume and level of detail provided by current data sets. Exceeding traditional empirical approaches, Big Data opens a new perspective on scientific work in which data comes to play a role in the development of the scientific problematic to be developed. Addressing this reconfiguration of our relationship with data through readings of Wittgenstein, Macherey, and Popper, we propose a picture of science that encourages scientists to engage with the data in a direct way, using the data itself as an instrument for scientific investigation. Using GIS as a theme, we develop the concept of cyber‐human systems of thought and understanding to bridge the divide between representative (theoretical) thinking and (non‐theoretical) data‐driven science. At the foundation of these systems, we invoke the concept of the “semantic pixel” to establish a logical and virtual space linking data and the work of scientists. It is with this discussion of the relationship between analysts in their pursuit of knowledge and the rise of Big Data that this present discussion of the philosophical foundations of Big Data addresses the central questions raised by social informatics research.},

abstract = {Scientific and scholarly research is heterogeneous in that divergent viewpoints, and different interests must be brought together to achieve coherent accounts of research. The tensions caused by this multiplicity of interests and singularity of output frame most collaborative research practice. The goal of present study is to identify areas of tension in such collaborative and heterogeneous efforts. To this end, the present study investigates the co‐construction of archeological narrative at one of the largest multinational archeological campaigns in the world, the \c{C}atalh\"{o}y\"{u}k project in Turkey. This study conceptualizes archeological narratives as epistemic assemblages. Following Actor Network theorists, the archeological process is conceptualized as a series of translation processes (of heterogeneous engineering) that inscribe the found material remains of archeological investigation into a narrative. This complex process takes place within a heterogeneous sociotechnical network. This study decomposes this heterogeneous network to identify the areas of tension and struggle. Two sources of such tensions are identified as fragmentation and fault lines. Overcoming fragmentation and fault lines is key for the success of heterogeneous scientific work and maintaining productive scientific collaboration. The findings of this study have applications beyond archeology and can inform the design of cyberinfrastructure for heterogeneous collaborations.},

Robust analysis of 15,000+ citations to 548 articles indexed in PubMed indicates that the practice of correction and republication is a strong predictor of reduced post‐republication citation relative to controls. This bibliometric analysis shows that corrected articles are cited on average 51% less than controls overall and that the practice of correction and republication results in a fast‐acting and long‐lasting reduction in citation of flawed works by downstream researchers.},

abstract = {Scientific classification is an important topic in contemporary knowledge organization discourse, yet the nature of the relationships between scientific and bibliographic classifications has not been fully studied. This article considers the connections between scientific and bibliographic classifications for music, taking general discourse about scientific classification and domain analysis as its starting point. Three relationship characteristics are posited: similarity, causation, and time. In discussions about similarity, “accords” and “discords” are analyzed. Further, the idea of a scale of accord is introduced, and issues with assuming a univocal scientific or bibliographic classification of music are discussed. Causation and the idea of influence between scientific and bibliographic classifications for music are unpicked. The connections between accordance and influence are explored, and the concept of differing purposes for different classification approaches is analyzed. A temporal dimension is considered, and the dynamic nature of connections between music scientific and bibliographic classifications is established. The idea of bifurcation is introduced—a change of accordance over time—which is prominent for musical instrument classification. The concluding model visualizes similarity, causation and temporal aspects as three dimensions, showing how scientific and bibliographic classifications for music are connected through a set of interconnected and complex relationships.},

References of publications indexed in Web of Science Core Collection were analyzed for two periods (2005‐2009, 2010‐2013) and across 15 disciplines. Journal article authors cite more recent references and more references from serial publications than monograph authors. The difference between the sciences and the SSH is as obvious as the difference between periodical and non‐serial publications. However, the reference patterns of social sciences are much more similar to science fields than humanities, especially for monographs. The subject characteristics of reference pattern are strongly affected by publication types. Furthermore, journal publications have stronger associations between ageing indicators and the share of WoS journal references than monographs.},

Relevant metrics and content relating to the journals' social media accounts were also crawled for data analysis. From our results, the social media presence of scholarly journals lies between 7.1% and 14.2% across disciplines; and it has shown a steady increase in the last decade. The popularity of scholarly journals on social media is distinct across disciplines. Further, we investigated whether social media metrics of journals can predict the Journal Impact Factor (JIF). We found that the number of followers and disciplines have significant effects on the JIF. In addition, a word co‐occurrence network analysis was also conducted to identify popular topics discussed by scholarly journals on social media platforms. Finally, we highlight challenges and issues faced in this study and discuss future research directions.},

Our approach is to set up a traditional model in which the true quality or impact of a university department is determined by a panel of experts, but a citation metric is regarded as a reasonable proxy. However, the model assumes that the information contained in the scores provided by an expert panel exceeds that contained in a citation metric (HEFCE, 2015). Finally, we extend this model by including altmetric data to see if it adds information about a department's performance that cannot be gleaned from citations alone. We find the presence of altmetric data for the cited underpinning research to be highly correlated with peer review scores for societal impact. Conversely, no such connection was seen with the assessment of research quality. Our findings therefore suggest altmetric data could be useful as an aid to assessing impact.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis has become a very important tool for analysis of social media data. There are several methods developed, covering distinct aspects of the problem and disparate strategies. However, no single technique fits well in all cases or for all data sources. Supervised approaches may be able to adapt to specific situations, but require manually labeled training, which is very cumbersome and expensive to acquire, mainly for a new application. In this context, we propose to combine several popular and effective state‐of‐the‐practice sentiment analysis methods by means of an unsupervised bootstrapped strategy. One of our main goals is to reduce the large variability (low stability) of the unsupervised methods across different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that our combined method (aka, 10SENT) improves the effectiveness of the classification task, considering thirteen different data sets. Also, it tackles the key problem of cross‐domain low stability and produces the best (or close to best) results in almost all considered contexts, without any additional costs (e.g., manual labeling). Finally, we also investigate a transfer learning approach for sentiment analysis to gather additional (unsupervised) information for the proposed approach, and we show the potential of this technique to improve our results.},

It has been suggested that our reliance on online technologies such as search engines and social media may limit exposure to diverse points of view and make us vulnerable to manipulation by disinformation. In this article, we mine a massive data set of web traffic to quantify two kinds of bias: (i) homogeneity bias, which is the tendency to consume content from a narrow set of information sources, and (ii) popularity bias, which is the selective exposure to content from top sites. Our analysis reveals different bias levels across several widely used web platforms. Search exposes users to a diverse set of sources, while social media traffic tends to exhibit high popularity and homogeneity bias. When we focus our analysis on traffic to news sites, we find higher levels of popularity bias, with smaller differences across applications. Overall, our results quantify the extent to which our choices of online systems confine us inside “social bubbles.”},

abstract = {Drawing on identity theory and privacy research, this article argues that the need for self‐identity is a key factor affecting people's privacy behavior in social networking sites. I first unpack the mainstream, autonomy‐centric discourse of privacy, and then present a research model that illustrates a possible new theorization of the relationship between self‐identity and information privacy. An empirical study with Facebook users confirms the main hypotheses. In particular, the data show that the need for self‐identity is positively related to privacy management behaviors, which in turn result in increased self‐disclosure in online social networks. I subsequently argue that the so‐called “privacy paradox” is not a paradox per se in the context of online social networking; rather, privacy concerns reflect the ideology of an autonomous self, whereas social construction of self‐identity explains voluntary self‐disclosure.},

abstract = {Basic human values represent what we think are important to our lives that include security, independence, success, kindness, and pleasure. Each of us holds different values with different degrees of importance. Existing studies show that values of a person can be identified from their social network usage. However, the value priority of a person may change over time due to different factors such as time, event, influence, social structure, and technology. In this research, we are the first to investigate whether the change of value priorities can be identified from social network usage. We propose a weighted hybrid time‐series‐based model to capture the change of values of a social network user. We conducted an experimental study with 726 Facebook users and showed that our model accurately captures the value priority changes from the social network usage and achieves significantly higher accuracy than our baseline hidden Markov model‐based technique. We also validated the change of a user's value priorities in real life using a questionnaire‐based technique.},

abstract = {Twitter provides a channel of collecting and publishing instant information on major events like natural disasters. However, information flow on Twitter is of great volume. For a specific event, messages collected from the Twitter Stream based on either location constraint or predefined keywords would contain a lot of noise. In this article, we propose a method to achieve both high‐precision and high‐recall in collecting event‐related tweets. Our method involves an automatic keyword generation component, and an event‐related tweet identification component. For keyword generation, we consider three properties of candidate keywords, namely relevance, coverage, and evolvement. The keyword updating mechanism enables our method to track the main topics of tweets along event development. To minimize annotation effort in identifying event‐related tweets, we adopt active learning and incorporate multiple‐instance learning which assigns labels to bags instead of instances (that is, individual tweets). Through experiments on two real‐world events, we demonstrate the superiority of our method against state‐of‐the‐art alternatives.},

abstract = {Word segmentation is the task of inserting or deleting word boundary characters in order to separate character sequences that correspond to words in some language. In this article we propose an approach based on a beam search algorithm and a language model working at the byte/character level, the latter component implemented either as an n‐gram model or a recurrent neural network. The resulting system analyzes the text input with no word boundaries one token at a time, which can be a character or a byte, and uses the information gathered by the language model to determine if a boundary must be placed in the current position or not. Our aim is to use this system in a preprocessing step for a microtext normalization system. This means that it needs to effectively cope with the data sparsity present on this kind of texts. We also strove to surpass the performance of two readily available word segmentation systems: The well‐known and accessible Word Breaker by Microsoft, and the Python module WordSegment by Grant Jenks. The results show that we have met our objectives, and we hope to continue to improve both the precision and the efficiency of our system in the future.},

abstract = {To understand information accessibility issues, research has examined human and technical factors by taking a socio‐technical view. While this view provides a profound understanding of how people seek, use, and access information, it often overlooks the larger structure of the information landscapes that shape people's information access. However, theorizing the information landscape of a local community at the community level is challenging because of the diverse contexts and users. One way to minimize the complexity is to focus on the materiality of information. By highlighting the material aspects of information, it becomes possible to understand the community‐level structure of local information. This paper develops a theory of local information landscapes (LIL theory) to conceptualize the material structure of local information. LIL theory adapts a concept of the virtual as an ontological view of the local information that is embedded in technical infrastructures, spaces, and people. By complementing existing theories, this paper provides a new perspective on how information deserts manifest as a material pre‐condition of information inequality. Based on these theoretical models, a research agenda is presented for future studies of local communities.},

In other words, international collaboration improves the impact of research articles, whereas more government funding tends to have a small adverse effect when comparing OECD countries.},

This study examined the information interactions in an Israeli virtual health community on Facebook dealing with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease drawing from the “weak ties” network theory as a theoretical framework. Weak ties are social ties or acquaintances that can function as an important source for diversified experiential information and emotional support, reducing stigma and providing a sense of belonging. The study consisted of 23 semistructured interviews with registered members of the group. Findings of this study parallel the four functions of weak ties by allowing chronically ill patients: access to diverse sources of information including experiential information from others suffering from the same illness; the possibility to disclose personal information reducing fear from stigma or rejection; and a sense of belonging.},

Mayer's cognitive model was examined, wherein the topic integration process of a user evoked by a visual stimulus can be associated with long‐latency ERP components. We determined that long‐latency ERP components are suitable for measuring a user's neuronal response through a literature review. We hypothesized that N300 is specific to the categorization of all shots regardless of topic relevance, N400 is specific for the semantic mismatching process for topic‐irrelevant shots, and P600 is specific for the context updating process for topic‐relevant shots. In our experiment, the N400 component led to more negative ERP signals in response to topic‐irrelevant shots than to topic‐relevant shots and showed a fronto‐central scalp pattern. P600 elicited more positive ERP signals for topic‐relevant shots than for topic‐irrelevant shots and showed a fronto‐central scalp pattern. We used discriminant and artificial neural network (ANN) analyses to decode video shot relevance and observed that the ANN produced particularly high success rates: 91.3% from the training set and 100% from the test set.},

abstract = {Distance Education professionals have been constantly coming up with methods and techniques to increase student participation in an environment where learning happens continuously and asynchronously. An online discussion forum (ODF) is one of these mechanisms, but it will only be successful if students are willing to participate. Stimulating students is a challenge many institutions currently face. The objective of this study was to analyze the social interaction among participants in ODFs using Social Network Analysis. Knowing the characteristics of these networks and its participants is important to design actions to improve the use of ODFs. As a case study, data were collected from ODF logs of the majors in Business Administration and Accounting in a Brazilian private university. This study found out that these interaction networks are sparse, which shows that students could be more engaged in interacting and collaborating with others. Students, in general, tend to interact more in the first semester and interaction diminishes as time passes. The number of active ODF participants has been around 45–50%, which shows that students currently do not participate very often in ODFs. Their main incentive seems to exist when they are graded. Popular ODFs were also analyzed.},

We report findings from interviews and focus groups with 49 UK state and voluntary sector professionals providing support to young (&lt;21) mothers from areas of multiple deprivations. We evidence an important information intermediary role with three key contributions to information behaviors in disadvantaged and dependent circumstances. Intermediaries: facilitate information needs recognition, and consider purposeful action within problematic situations; are a key source of information in themselves, and a key integrative connection to other external sources not otherwise accessed; and tailor and personalize information for relevance, and communicate via incremental and recursive cycles that take into account learning needs. We provide parameters for a theory of information intermediary intervention to guide future examination of an important and understudied role; and conceptualize important theoretical relationships between information behavior and social capital, and in particular shared concepts of social integration, and the progressive and integrative intermediary role within. Our findings have significant practical implications for public health policy and digital health strategies, as they evidence an important human information intermediary role among an at‐risk group, with implications for disadvantaged and vulnerable populations more broadly.},

Our study explored the breadth of structural roles in Wikipedia (English version) and their linkage to various forms of activities. Our analyses show that despite the latitude in selecting their mode of participation, participants' structural and emergent roles are tightly coupled. Our discussion highlights that: (a) participants often stay close to the “production ground floor” despite the assignment into structural roles; and (b) there are typical modifications in activity patterns associated with role‐assignment, namely: functional specialization, multispecialization, defunctionalization, changes in communication patterns, management of identity, and role definition. We contribute to theory of coordination and roles, as well as provide some practical implications.},

Through interviews with 16 Korean immigrants in the United States, we explored their information behaviors in the settlement process. In line with prior work (Shoham &amp; Strauss, 2008), we found that Korean immigrants needed various types of information: housing, work, banking, transportation, law, school, health, and language. Out of these information types, the Korean immigrants prioritized information for education and struggled to seek health and legal information. We further uncovered that various information needs are closely intertwined and found an additional type of information need: to build a new social network after migration. They often used Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) as information sources while adapting the ICT infrastructures of the U.S. into their information practices. ICTs enabled them to build and maintain “local” and “global” identity; however, they may struggle to assess user‐generated content in the new context. We noted that their strong use of ICTs for intraethnic interaction might slow down their integration into the host society. We discuss implications for future work to support immigrants' settlement in the host country.},

Among the research findings are that many different methods will work, including a number of methods that are superficially language‐independent (such as an analysis of the most common “words” or “character n‐grams” in a document). Since all languages have words (and all written languages have characters), this method could (in theory) work on any language. However, it is not clear that the methods that work best on, for example English, would also work best on other languages. It is not even clear that the same level of performance is achievable in different languages, even under identical conditions. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to achieve “identical conditions” in practice. A new corpus, developed by George Mikros, provides very tight controls not only for author but also for topic, thus enabling a direct comparison of performance levels between the two languages Greek and English. We compare a number of different methods head‐to‐head on this corpus, and show that, overall, performance on English is higher than performance on Greek, often highly significantly so.},

To examine the chronological contributions of 13 factors on citations, a multiple sequential regression analysis was conducted for three timepoints of the publication cycle—paper submission, time of conferences, and months after conferences. Our results illustrate that online readers’ early attention of Citeulike bookmarks were found to have the most influence on the future impact of the conference papers. The early attention records from CN3 made noteworthy improvements to explaining both the Google and Scopus citations as well. We also found that the type of papers the number of papers presented at a conference, and the best article award records were significant factors influencing future citations.

A total of 581 completed surveys were analyzed to generate descriptive statistics, with textual analysis performed on comments provided to open questions. While just under half of the participant group had used metrics, the Australians reported use in twice the proportion of their Swedish peers. Institutional policies and processes were frequently associated with use, and the scholars' comments suggest a high level of awareness of some metrics as well as strategic behavior in demonstrating research performance.

abstract = {Conference publications in computer science (CS) have attracted scholarly attention due to their unique status as a main research outlet, unlike other science fields where journals are dominantly used for communicating research findings. One frequent research question has been how different conference and journal publications are, considering an article as a unit of analysis. This study takes an author‐based approach to analyze the publishing patterns of 517,763 scholars who have ever published both in CS conferences and journals for the last 57 years, as recorded in DBLP. The analysis shows that the majority of CS scholars tend to make their scholarly debut, publish more articles, and collaborate with more coauthors in conferences than in journals. Importantly, conference articles seem to serve as a distinct channel of scholarly communication, not a mere preceding step to journal publications: coauthors and title words of authors across conferences and journals tend not to overlap much. This study corroborates findings of previous studies on this topic from a distinctive perspective and suggests that conference authorship in CS calls for more special attention from scholars and administrators outside CS who have focused on journal publications to mine authorship data and evaluate scholarly performance.},

abstract = {In information retrieval evaluation, pooling is a well‐known technique to extract a sample of documents to be assessed for relevance. Given the pooled documents, a number of studies have proposed different prioritization methods to adjudicate documents for judgment. These methods follow different strategies to reduce the assessment effort. However, there is no clear guidance on how many relevance judgments are required for creating a reliable test collection. In this article we investigate and further develop methods to determine when to stop making relevance judgments. We propose a highly diversified set of stopping methods and provide a comprehensive analysis of the usefulness of the resulting test collections. Some of the stopping methods introduced here combine innovative estimates of recall with time series models used in Financial Trading. Experimental results on several representative collections show that some stopping methods can reduce up to 95% of the assessment effort and still produce a robust test collection. We demonstrate that the reduced set of judgments can be reliably employed to compare search systems using disparate effectiveness metrics such as Average Precision, NDCG, P@100, and Rank Biased Precision. With all these measures, the correlations found between full pool rankings and reduced pool rankings is very high.},

abstract = {As an increasing number of open government data (OGD) portals are created, an evaluation method is needed to assess these portals. In this study, we drew from the existing principles and evaluation methods to develop a User Interaction Framework, with concrete criteria in five dimensions: Access, Trust, Understand, Engage‐integrate, and Participate. The framework was then used to evaluate the current OGD sites created and maintained by 34 U.S. municipal government agencies. The results show that, overall, portals perform well in terms of providing access, but not so well in helping users understand and engage with data. These findings indicate room for improvement in multiple areas and suggest potential roles for information professionals as data mediators. The study also reveals that portals using the Socrata platform performed better, regarding user access, trust, engagement, and participation. However, the variability among portals indicates that some portals should improve their platforms to achieve greater user engagement and participation. In addition, city governments need to develop clear plans about what data should be available and how to make them available to their public.},

abstract = {The traditional approach to health care is being revolutionized by the rapid adoption of patient‐centered healthcare models. The successful transformation of patients from passive recipients to active participants is largely attributed to increased access to healthcare information. Online support groups present a platform to seek and exchange information in an inclusive environment. As the volume of text on online support groups continues to grow exponentially, it is imperative to improve the quality of retrieved information in terms of relevance, reliability, and usefulness. We present a text‐mining approach that generates a knowledge extraction layer to address this void in personalized information retrieval from online support groups. The knowledge extraction layer encapsulates an ensemble of text‐mining techniques with a domain ontology to interpose an investigable and extensible structure on hitherto unstructured text. This structure is not limited to personalized information retrieval for patients, as it also imparts aggregates for crowdsourcing analytics by healthcare researchers. The proposed approach was successfully trialed on an active online support group consisting of 800,000 posts by 72,066 participants. Demonstrations for both patient and researcher use cases accentuate the value of the proposed approach to unlock a broad spectrum of personalized and aggregate knowledge concealed within crowdsourced content.},

abstract = {While always integral to scientific activity, data work has recently emerged as a key set of processes within societal activities of all kinds. While data work presents new opportunities for discovery, value creation, and decision making, its emergence also raises significant ethical issues, including those of ownership, privacy, and trust. This article presents a review of data work, and how negotiating a trade‐off between its value and risks requires locating its processes within the contexts of its conditions and consequences. These include international, national, and sectoral conditions of law, policy, and regulation at a macro level; organizational conditions of information and data governance that aim to address the value and risks of data work at a meso level; along with attention to the everyday contexts of data and information handling by data information and other professionals at a micro level. In conclusion, a conceptual framework is presented that locates the processes of data work within the matrix of its macro meso and micro conditions, its consequences for individuals, organizations, and society, and the relations between them. Suggestions are given for how research into the study of data work—its value risks and governance— can be advanced by using this framework.},

abstract = {This study explores how user subject knowledge influences search task processes and outcomes, as well as how search behavior is influenced by subject‐oriented information visualization (IV) tools. To enable integrated searches, the proposed WikiMap
+ integrates search functions and IV tools (i.e., a topic network and hierarchical topic tree) and gathers information from Wikipedia pages and Google Search results. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed interfaces, we design subject‐oriented tasks and adopt extended evaluation measures. We recruited 48 novices and 48 knowledgeable users, that is, intermediates, for the evaluation. Our results show that novices using the proposed interface demonstrate better search performance than intermediates using Wikipedia. We therefore conclude that our tools help close the gap between novices and intermediates in information searches. The results also show that intermediates can take advantage of the search tool by leveraging the IV tools to browse subtopics, and formulate better queries with less effort. We conclude that embedding the IV and the search tools in the interface can result in different search behavior but improved task performance. We provide implications to design search systems to include IV features adapted to user levels of subject knowledge to help them achieve better task performance.},

abstract = {A theoretical framework for understanding public library development is presented; plural agonistics is used in combination with an approach inspired by posthumanism. The framework is related to examples from a study of two Swedish public libraries. Antagonism is viewed as foundational, and democracy as an ongoing process, the task being to transform antagonism to agonism, with institutions like libraries postulated as important spaces for adversaries to meet in dialogue. Libraries are viewed here as constantly becoming institutions, and the librarian's identity as an ongoing enactment of the library. To underscore the crucial role the library fills in society, it is conceptualized as a verb and a new word is proposed: to librarize. Discussions about the content of libraries are critical for librarians to find ways to perform the library. The ongoing debate is part of the professional performance of librarians. Librarians should, while acknowledging that there may be no single right way, debate over what is the most beneficial way to facilitate libraries’ vital role in democracy. Conceptualizing of the library as a verb and its implications for librarianship as a possible active agent for radical change within society are offered as articulations of resistance.},

However, most current methods focus on increasing the performance, leaving the semantic gap problem, which refers to the learned ranking models are hard to be understood, remaining intact. Therefore, in this article, we aim at learning an interpretable ranking model to tackle the semantic gap in fine‐grained image ranking. We propose to combine attribute‐based representation and online passive‐aggressive (PA) learning based ranking models to achieve this goal. Besides, considering the highly localized instances in fine‐grained image ranking, we introduce a supervised constrained clustering method to gather class‐balanced training instances for local PA‐based models, and incorporate the learned local models into a unified probabilistic framework. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state‐of‐the‐art methods in terms of accuracy and speed.},

When these caveats are overlooked, programming errors may emerge from misusing APIs, leading to heavy discussions on Q&amp;A websites like Stack Overflow. If the overlooked caveats could be mined from these discussions, they would be beneficial for programmers to avoid misuse of APIs. However, it is challenging because the discussions are informal, redundant, and diverse. For this, for example, we propose Disca, a novel approach for automatically Distilling desirable API negative caveats from unstructured Q&amp;A discussions. Through sentence selection and prominent term clustering, Disca ensures that distilled caveats are context‐independent, prominent, semantically diverse, and nonredundant. Quantitative evaluation in our experiments shows that the proposed Disca significantly outperforms four text‐summarization techniques. We also show that the distilled API negative caveats could greatly augment API documentation through qualitative analysis.},

Despite efforts for the preservation of cultural heritages around the world, no well‐accepted metadata schema has been developed for murals and stone cave temples, which are often high‐value heritages built in ancient times. In addition, the literature is scarce on the user‐centered evaluation of metadata schemas of this kind. This study therefore aims to offer insights on developing and evaluating a metadata schema for organizing information of these historic and complex cultural heritages. In‐depth interviews were conducted with a total of 30 users, including 18 professional and 12 public users, and interview transcripts were coded through a qualitative content analysis approach. Findings reveal the importance of specific metadata elements as perceived by the two groups of end users, which correlated with their cultural heritage information‐seeking behaviors. In addition, the issues of standardization of cataloging of cultural heritage information and interoperability among metadata schemas have been raised by users for enhancing the user experience with digital platforms of cultural heritage information. The coding schema developed in this study can serve as a framework for follow‐up evaluations of metadata schemas, contributing to the ongoing development of cultural heritage metadata.},

The higher a title's count (or percentile), the more famous it is—either absolutely or within a subject class. Degree of fame also indicates cultural impact, allowing that further documentation of impact may be needed. Using WorldCat data, we illustrate high, medium, and low degrees of fame with 170 titles published during 1990–1995 or 2001–2006 and spanning the 10 main Dewey classes. We use their total libcitation counts or their counts from members of the Association of Research Libraries, or both, as of late 2011. Our analysis of their fame draws on the recognizability of their authors, the extent to which they and their authors are covered by Wikipedia, and whether they have movie or TV versions. Ordinal scales based on Wikipedia coverage and on libcitation counts are very significantly associated.},

If cited, they also carry external credit from the citing papers. The proportion of a paper's credit allocated to references can be regarded as a credit output and serves as an input for these references. In this scenario, only the credit assigned to a paper's authors remains as the paper's deserved credit. The credit of papers can be transferred in a direction opposite that of knowledge diffusion. Via this method, the estimate of an individual reference's contribution incorporates content‐based citation analysis, a promising method to differentiate different citations. A paper's deserved credit represents the contribution of the paper's authors to the scientific community via the new knowledge they provide in the paper.

This study is the first attempt to investigate the top three help-seeking situations as well as associated factors in blind users' DL interactions. A mixed-method approach was adopted for this study. Multiple methods were applied to collect data from 30 blind subjects: questionnaires, presearch interviews, think aloud protocols, transaction logs, and postsearch interviews. The paper identifies the top three help-seeking situations, and associated factors in relation to user, system, task, and interaction. Moreover, different types of main-level factors were tested to investigate if they are correlated to each type of top situation, and qualitative data of sublevel factors offer insight into how these factors are associated with various situations. Without a clear understanding of these situations and factors, the objective of universal access to information in DLs cannot be achieved. DL design implications are further discussed with the goal of providing system design recommendations for reducing blind users' help-seeking situations.},

The problem becomes even more complicated when dealing with short and noisy micro-posts in Twitter that are about one general topic. In such a case, the goal of applying topic models is to extract subtopics. This results in topics represented by similar sets of keywords, which in turn makes the process of topic interpretation more confusing. In this paper we propose a new method that incorporates Twitter-LDA, WordNet, and hashtags to enhance the keyword labels that represent each topic. We emphasize the importance of different keywords to different topics based on the semantic relationships and the co-occurrences of keywords in hashtags. We also propose a method to find the best number of topics to represent the text document collection. Experiments on two real-life Twitter datasets on fashion suggest that our method performs better than the original Twitter-LDA in terms of perplexity, topic coherence, and the quality of keywords for topic labeling.},

abstract = {The fact that patents are documents highly constrained by law and structured by international treaties make them a unique body of publications for tracing the history and evolution of technology. The distinctiveness of prior art patent citations compared to bibliographic references in the nonpatent literature is discussed. Starting from these observations and using the patent classification scheme as a framework of reference, we have identified a data structure, the "technology footprint," derived from the patents cited as prior art for a selected set of patents. This data structure will provide us with dynamic information about the technological components of the selected set of patents, which represents a technology, company, or inventor. Two case studies are presented in order to illustrate the visualization of the technology footprint: one concerning an inventor-Mr. Engelbart, the inventor of the "computer mouse"-and another concerning the early years of a technology-computerized tomography.},

abstract = {An online exchange system is a web service that allows communities to trade items without the burden of manually selecting them, which saves users' time and effort. Even though online book-exchange systems have been developed, their services can further be improved by reducing the workload imposed on their users. To accomplish this task, we propose a recommendation-based book exchange system, called EasyEx, which identifies potential exchanges for a user solely based on a list of items the user is willing to part with. EasyEx is a novel and unique book-exchange system because unlike existing online exchange systems, it does not require a user to create and maintain a wish list, which is a list of items the user would like to receive as part of the exchange. Instead, EasyEx directly suggests items to users to increase serendipity and as a result expose them to items which may be unfamiliar, but appealing, to them. In identifying books to be exchanged, EasyEx employs known recommendation strategies, that is, personalized mean and matrix factorization, to predict book ratings, which are treated as the degrees of appeal to a user on recommended books. Furthermore, EasyEx incorporates OptaPlanner, which solves constraint satisfaction problems efficiently, as part of the recommendation-based exchange process to create exchange cycles. Experimental results have verified that EasyEx offers users recommended books that satisfy the users' interests and contributes to the item-exchange mechanism with a new design methodology.},

abstract = {Batik as a traditional art is well regarded due to its high aesthetic quality and cultural heritage values. It is not uncommon to reuse versatile decorative shape patterns across batiks. General-purpose image retrieval methods often fail to pay sufficient attention to such a frequent reuse of shape patterns in the graphical compositions of batiks, leading to suboptimal retrieval results, in particular for identifying batiks that use copyrighted shape patterns without proper authorization for law-enforcement purposes. To address the lack of an optimized image retrieval method suited for batiks, this study proposes a new method for retrieving salient shape patterns in batiks using a rich combination of global and local features. The global features deployed were extracted according to the Zernike moments ZMs; the local features adopted were extracted through curvelet transformations that characterize shape contours embedded in batiks. The method subsequently incorporated both types of features via matching a weighted bipartite graph to measure the visual similarity between any pair of batik shape patterns through supervised distance metric learning. The derived similarity metric can then be used to detect and retrieve similar shape patterns appearing across batiks, which in turn can be employed as a reliable similarity metric for retrieving batiks. To explore the usefulness of the proposed method, the performance of the new retrieval method is compared against that of three peer methods as well as two variants of the proposed method. The experimental results consistently and convincingly demonstrate that the new method indeed outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in retrieving salient shape patterns in batiks.},

In our study, we conducted a lab experiment to examine the effect of prediscussion note-taking on this phenomenon. The experiment used a murder-mystery hidden profile task. In all, 192 undergraduate students were recruited and randomly assigned into 48 four-person groups with gender being the matching variable i.e., each group consisted of four same-gender participants. During the decision-making processes, some groups were asked to take notes while reading task materials and had their notes available in the following group discussion, while the other groups were not given this opportunity. Our analysis results suggest that a the presence of an information piece in group members' notes positively correlates with its appearance in the subsequent discussion and note-taking positively affects the group's information repetition rate; b group decision quality positively correlates with the group's information sampling rate and negatively correlates with the group's information sampling/repetition bias; and c gender has no statistically significant moderating effect on the relationship between note-taking and information sharing. These results imply that prediscussion note-taking could facilitate information sharing but could not alleviate the biased information pooling in hidden profile tasks.},

Its finance is therefore subject to the Spanish Government OA mandate. A search was carried out for full-text OA copies of the 762 articles using the four tools being evaluated and with identification of the repository housing these items. Of the 762 articles concerned, 510 OA copies were found of 353 unique articles 46.3% in 68 repositories. OA copies were found of 81.9% of the articles in PubMed Central and copies of 49.5% of the articles in an institutional repository IR. BASE and GS identified 93.5% of the articles and OpenAIRE 86.7%. Recolecta identified just 62.2% of the articles deposited in a Spanish IR. BASE achieved the greatest success, by locating copies deposited in IR, while GS found those deposited in disciplinary repositories. None of the tools identified copies of all the articles, so they need to be used in a complementary way when evaluating OA policies.},

This study focuses on a special SNS discontinuance phenomenon-user exodus. Compared to individual discontinuance behavior studied in prior research, the SNS user exodus possesses its own characteristics: a huge magnitude of users abandon a given SNS product in a very short time. Given the fatal blow of exodus to SNS providers, this exploratory research seeks to unravel why and how the SNS user exodus occurs. Specifically, we conducted a mixed-method research combining laddering interview and network analysis. Drawing on the means-end chain theory, laddering interviews were first used to collect data from discontinuers of a Chinese SNS, Kaixin001, which has experienced a severe user dropout. Then we identified various factors triggering user exodus by content analysis. Last, network analysis was employed to establish the connections between various attributes, consequences, and values. The results showed that user exodus in SNS is strongly related to three types of value: functional, affective, and social value. More important, we also emphasized the dynamics process of exodus by highlighting the role of lurking. Possible contributions and implications of our findings are discussed.},

abstract = {We explore how ideas from infectious disease and genetics can be used to uncover patterns of cultural inheritance and innovation in a corpus of 591 national constitutions spanning 1789-2008. Legal "ideas" are encoded as "topics"-words statistically linked in documents-derived from topic modeling the corpus of constitutions. Using these topics we derive a diffusion network for borrowing from ancestral constitutions back to the US Constitution of 1789 and reveal that constitutions are complex cultural recombinants. We find systematic variation in patterns of borrowing from ancestral texts and "biological"-like behavior in patterns of inheritance, with the distribution of "offspring" arising through a bounded preferential-attachment process. This process leads to a small number of highly innovative influential constitutions some of which have yet to have been identified as so in the current literature. Our findings thus shed new light on the critical nodes of the constitution-making network. The constitutional network structure reflects periods of intense constitution creation, and systematic patterns of variation in constitutional lifespan and temporal influence.},

abstract = {Authorship attribution attempts to reveal the authors of documents. In recent years, research in this field has grown rapidly. However, the performance of state-of-the-art methods is heavily affected when text of known authorship and texts under investigation differ in topic and/or genre. So far, it is not clear how to quantify the personal style of authors in a way that is not affected by topic shifts or genre variations. In this paper, a set of text distortion methods are used attempting to mask topic-related information. These methods transform the input texts into a more topic-neutral form while maintaining the structure of documents associated with the personal style of the author. Using a controlled corpus that includes a fine-grained range of topics and genres it is demonstrated how the proposed approach can be combined with existing authorship attribution methods to enhance their performance in very challenging tasks, especially in cross-topic attribution. We also examine cross-genre attribution and the most challenging, yet realistic, cross-topic-and-genre attribution scenarios and show how the proposed techniques should be tuned to enhance performance in these tasks. Finally, we demonstrate that there are important differences in attribution effectiveness when either conversational genres, nonconversational genres, or a mix of them are considered.},

Considering the time factor, we adopt the methodology of Granger causality test and track 3,390 products on Amazon.com over a 2-month period. The results reveal that a causality loop exists between online consumer review volume and sales. Specifically, our findings indicate that the volume of negative consumer reviews drive consumers' purchasing decisions, but the volume of positive consumers reviews only marginally affects purchasing decisions. Also, consumers generate more positive reviews than negative reviews after sales. Our results highlight the importance of negative consumer reviews; negative reviews not only lead to sales, but sales, in turn, lead to higher volume of negative reviews. The findings suggest an alternative strategy for practitioners to address negative online consumer reviews and highlight the awareness effect of online consumer review postings that can later convert into purchase behaviors.},

abstract = {Common sense suggests that persistence is key to success. In academia, successful researchers have been found more likely to be persistent in publishing, but little attention has been given to how persistence in maintaining collaborative relationships affects career success. This paper proposes a new bibliometric understanding of persistence that considers the prominent role of collaboration in contemporary science. Using this perspective, we analyze the relationship between persistent collaboration and publication quality along several dimensions: degree of transdisciplinarity, difference in coauthor's scientific age and their scientific impact, and research-team size. Contrary to traditional wisdom, our results show that persistent scientific collaboration does not always result in high-quality papers. We find that the most persistent transdisciplinary collaboration tends to output high-impact publications, and that those coauthors with diverse scientific impact or scientific ages benefit from persistent collaboration more than homogeneous compositions. We also find that researchers persistently working in large groups tend to publish lower-impact papers. These results contradict the colloquial understanding of collaboration in academia and paint a more nuanced picture of how persistent scientific collaboration relates to success, a picture that can provide valuable insights to researchers, funding agencies, policy makers, and mentor-mentee program directors. Moreover, the methodology in this study showcases a feasible approach to measure persistent collaboration.},

However, the process by which the specific field is divided into subfields is problematic, in the sense that citation information among individual patents in different subfields is lost. If convergence technologies are common among different subfields, this problem can result in an inappropriate main path being found. To resolve this problem, we propose a new algorithm capable of extracting the main paths for each subfield of a technology by using the International Patent Classification IPC codes of patents. The proposed algorithm is applied to the waste management field to allow core technologies in the subfields of waste disposal, waste treatment, and the reuse of waste materials to be found. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is performed by considering the standard of the component ratio along a specific path to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm in the waste management field.},

abstract = {Modern information seekers face dynamic streams of large-scale heterogeneous data that are both intimidating and overwhelming. They need a strategy to filter this barrage of massive data sets, and to find all of the information responding to their information needs, despite the pressures imposed by schedules and budgets. In this applied research, we present an exploratory search strategy that allows professional information seekers to efficiently and effectively triage all of the data. We demonstrate that exploratory search is particularly useful for information filtering and large-scale information triage, regardless of the language of the data, and regardless of the particular industry, whether finance, medical, business, government, information technology, news, or legal. Our strategy reduces a dauntingly large volume of information into a manageable, high-precision data set, suitable for focused reading. This strategy is interdisciplinary, integrating concepts from information filtering, information triage, and exploratory search. Key aspects include advanced search software, interdisciplinary paired search, asynchronous collaborative search, attention to linguistic phenomena, and aggregated search results in the form of a search matrix or search grid. We present the positive results of a task-oriented evaluation in a real-world setting, discuss these results from a qualitative perspective, and share future research areas.},

abstract = {Considering repositories of web documents that are semantically linked and created in a collaborative fashion, as in the case of Wikipedia, a key problem faced by content providers is the placement of links in the articles. These links must support user navigation and provide a deeper semantic interpretation of the content. Current wikification methods exploit machine learning techniques to capture characteristics of the concepts and its associations. In previous work, we proposed a preliminary prediction model combining traditional predictors with a latent component which captures the concept graph topology by means of matrix factorization. In this work, we provide a detailed description of our method and a deeper comparison with a state-of-the-art wikification method using a sample of Wikipedia and report a gain up to 13% in F1 score. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the model performance showing the importance of the latent predictor component and the attributes derived from the associations between the concepts. Moreover, we include an analysis that allows us to conclude that the model is resilient to ambiguity without including a disambiguation phase. We finally report the positive impact of selecting training samples from specific content quality classes.},

abstract = {Innovations transform our research traditions and become the driving force to advance individual, group, and social creativity. Meanwhile, interdisciplinary research is increasingly being promoted as a route to advance the complex challenges we face as a society. In this paper, we use Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA citation as a proxy context for the diffusion of an innovation. With an analysis of topic evolution, we divide the diffusion process into five stages: testing and evaluation, implementation, improvement, extending, and fading. Through a correlation analysis of topic and subject, we show the application of LDA in different subjects. We also reveal the cross-boundary diffusion between different subjects based on the analysis of the interdisciplinary studies. The results show that as LDA is transferred into different areas, the adoption of each subject is relatively adjacent to those with similar research interests. Our findings further support researchers' understanding of the impact formation of innovation.},

abstract = {In recent years, a number of studies have introduced methods for identifying papers with delayed recognition so called "sleeping beauties," SBs or have presented single publications as cases of SBs. Most recently, Ke, Ferrara, Radicchi, and Flammini , Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA, 11224, 7426-7431 proposed the so called "beauty coefficient" denoted as B to quantify how much a given paper can be considered as a paper with delayed recognition. In this study, the new term smart girl SG is suggested to differentiate instant credit or "flashes in the pan" from SBs. Although SG and SB are qualitatively defined, the dynamic citation angle β is introduced in this study as a simple way for identifying SGs and SBs quantitatively - complementing the beauty coefficient B. The citation angles for all articles from 1980 n=166,870 in natural sciences are calculated for identifying SGs and SBs and their extent. We reveal that about 3% of the articles are typical SGs and about 0.1% typical SBs. The potential advantages of the citation angle approach are explained.},

abstract = {Benford's law is an empirical observation, first reported by Simon Newcomb in 1881 and then independently by Frank Benford in 1938: the first significant digits of numbers in large data are often distributed according to a logarithmically decreasing function. Being contrary to intuition, the law was forgotten as a mere curious observation. However, in the last two decades relevant literature has grown exponentially-an evolution typical of "Sleeping Beauties" SBs publications that go unnoticed sleep for a long time and then suddenly become the center of attention are awakened. Thus, in the present study, we show that the two papers, Newcomb and Benford , Newcomb , American Journal of Mathematics, 4, 39-40 and Benford 1938, Proc. Am. Phil. Soc., 78, 551-572 papers are clearly SBs. The former was in a deep sleep for 110 years, whereas the latter was in a deep sleep for a comparatively lesser period of 31 years up to 1968, and in a state of less deep sleep for another 27 years, up to 1995. Both SBs were awakened in the year 1995 by Hill , Statistical Science, 10, 354-363. In so doing, we show that the waking prince Hill, is more often quoted than the SB whom he kissed-in this Benford's law case, wondering whether this is a general effect-to be usefully studied.},

abstract = {Social influence has a great impact on human behavior, which has been widely investigated in various research fields. Even so, it has rarely been investigated in the online health community. In this paper, we focus on the multichannel access in online health communities, defining social influence as the average degree of multichannel access to a physician's colleagues. Based on the multinomial logistic regression model, we examined the direct effects of social influence and patients' rating to multichannel access. In addition, we explored the moderating effect of social influence on the relationship between patients' rating and multichannel access in online health communities. The results of the experiment and robustness testing support the propositions that social influence and patients' rating significantly and positively affect multichannel access in an online health community. The moderating effect of social influence is negative and significantly influences the accessible channels provided by the focal physician. This research contributes to the literature concerning online health communities, social influence, and multichannel access; it also has practical implications.},

abstract = {The information sciences have traditionally been at the center of metadata-focused research. The US National Security Agency NSA intelligence documents revealed by Edward Snowden in June of 2013 brought the term "metadata" into the public consciousness. Surprisingly little discussion in the information sciences has since occurred on the nature and importance of metadata within networked communication systems. The collection of digital metadata impacts the ways that people experience social and technical communication. Without such metadata, networked communication cannot exist. The NSA leaks, and numerous recent hacks of corporate and government communications, point to metadata as objects of new scholarly inquiry. If we are to engage in meaningful discussions about our digital traces, or make informed decisions about new policies and technologies, it is essential to develop theoretical and empirical frameworks that account for digital metadata. This opinion paper presents 5 key sociotechnical characteristics of metadata within digital networks that would benefit from stronger engagement by the information sciences.},

Current online MT services are available and affordable, but are not always effective for creating multilingual metadata records. In this study, we implemented 3 different MT strategies and evaluated their performance when translating English metadata records to Chinese and Spanish. These strategies included combining MT results from 3 online MT systems Google, Bing, and Yahoo! with and without additional linguistic resources, such as manually-generated parallel corpora, and metadata records in the two target languages obtained from international partners. The open-source statistical MT platform Moses was applied to design and implement the three translation strategies. Human evaluation of the MT results using adequacy and fluency demonstrated that two of the strategies produced higher quality translations than individual online MT systems for both languages. Especially, adding small, manually-generated parallel corpora of metadata records significantly improved translation performance. Our study suggested an effective and efficient MT approach for providing multilingual services for digital collections.},

abstract = {Nearly half of African-American women have hypertension, which increases their risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke. A plethora of consumer health information products and services exist to inform people with hypertension and to promote self-management among them. Promotion of information sharing by African-American women represents a promising, culturally applicable strategy for consumer health information services focused on hypertension self-management. Yet how African-American women share hypertension information with others is unclear. The purpose of this qualitative, descriptive study was to examine practices of information sharing in African-American women with hypertension. Thirteen women mean age=73, SD=9.87 participated in one of 2 focus groups held at an urban community health center. Thematic analysis revealed that the women shared information about how they self-managed their blood pressure i with female family members and friends, ii about ways in which they adapted self-management strategies to work for them, iii mostly in group settings, and iv because they wanted to prevent others from suffering and reinforce their own knowledge about hypertension self-management. New findings emerged regarding assessing "readiness" for information. Study findings will be used to inform the design of an information-sharing intervention to support self-management of hypertension in African-American women.},

Data pertaining to monographs were collected from the Danish PURE repository system as well as the BKCI 2005-2015 via their International Standard Book Numbers ISBNs. Each ISBN was then matched to the same ISBN and family-related ISBNs cataloged in two additional databases: OCLC-WorldCat and Goodreads. With the retrieval of all family-related ISBNs, we were able to determine the number of monograph expressions present in the BKCI and their collective relationship to one work. Our results show that the majority of missing expressions from the BKCI are emblematic i.e., first editions of monographs and that both the indexing and metadata structure of this commercial database could significantly improve with the introduction of distinct expression IDs i.e., for every distinct edition and unifying work-related IDs. This improved metadata structure would support the collection of more accurate publication and citation counts for monographs and has implications for developing new indicators based on bibliographic levels.},

This study proposes a research model from a knowledge power perspective, that is, Internet search affects patients' perception of their knowledge level. Our empirical study of more than 400 subjects suggests that for patients who searched online for disease information, the inconsistency between their self-diagnosis expectations and their physician's diagnosis reduces their trust in their physician. The effect is stronger for those who spent more time on Internet search. Patients with chronic conditions are less affected by the inconsistency, as are patients of physicians with a higher professional status. This study also found that physicians' interaction quality in the diagnosis process-how well they communicate with their patient-still plays a dominant role in gaining patient's trust. This finding suggests that even in the high-tech age, high-touch remains an important factor to physician-patient trust.},

To assess leadership profiles, we referred to the 10-factor model developed by Barchiesi and La Bella in 2007. We maintain the distinctiveness of the approach we propose, as it allows a rapid assessment of the perceived leadership capabilities of an enterprise, as they emerge from its social media interactions. It can also be used to show how companies respond and manage their communication when specific events take place, and to assess their stakeholder's reactions.},

abstract = {Citations are the cornerstone of knowledge propagation and the primary means of assessing the quality of research, as well as directing investments in science. Science is increasingly becoming "data-intensive," where large volumes of data are collected and analyzed to discover complex patterns through simulations and experiments, and most scientific reference works have been replaced by online curated data sets. Yet, given a data set, there is no quantitative, consistent, and established way of knowing how it has been used over time, who contributed to its curation, what results have been yielded, or what value it has. The development of a theory and practice of data citation is fundamental for considering data as first-class research objects with the same relevance and centrality of traditional scientific products. Many works in recent years have discussed data citation from different viewpoints: illustrating why data citation is needed, defining the principles and outlining recommendations for data citation systems, and providing computational methods for addressing specific issues of data citation. The current panorama is many-faceted and an overall view that brings together diverse aspects of this topic is still missing. Therefore, this paper aims to describe the lay of the land for data citation, both from the theoretical the why and what and the practical the how angle.},

In this paper, we present a systematic approach to analyze the differences in possibilities that two authors will cooperate as seen from the effects of homophily, transitivity, and preferential attachment. Exponential random graph models ERGMs are applied in this research. We find that different types of publications one author has written play diverse roles in his/her collaborations. An author's tendency to form new collaborations with her/his coauthors' collaborators is strong, where the more coauthors one author had before, the more new collaborators he/she will attract. We demonstrate that considering the authors' attributes and homophily effects as well as the transitivity and preferential attachment effects of the coauthorship network in which they are embedded helps us gain a comprehensive understanding of scientific collaboration.},

abstract = {In a big data environment, there are growing concerns about the violation of consumer rights regarding information privacy. To induce rational regulations for protecting personal information, it is necessary to separately estimate consumers' values related to different types of personal information. In this article, discrete choice experiments using hypothetical information leakage situations given certain compensation amounts and discrete choice models were used to quantitatively analyze the value of personal information. The results indicate that consumers generally place high value on information that could cause immediate and actual damage from the leakage after identification, such as basic personal information and purchase list and payment information. Consumers value location information and personal medical information differently based on their perceived importance of privacy and their prior experience with personal information leakage. We suggest that the level of regulation should differ according to the type of personal information based on the consumers' valuation. This article contributes to a better understanding of a quantitative approach to pricing personal information.},

abstract = {Subject indexing plays an important role in supporting subject access to information resources. Current subject indexing systems do not make adequate distinctions on the importance of assigned subject descriptors. Assigning numeric weights to subject descriptors to distinguish their importance to the documents can strengthen the role of subject metadata. Automated methods are more cost-effective. This study compares different automated weighting methods in different environments. Two evaluation methods were used to assess the performance. Experiments on three datasets in the biomedical domain suggest the performance of different weighting methods depends on whether it is an abstract or full text environment. Mutual information with bag-of-words representation shows the best average performance in the full text environment, while cosine with bag-of-words representation is the best in an abstract environment. The cosine measure has relatively consistent and robust performance. A direct weighting method, IDF Inverse Document Frequency, can produce quick and reasonable estimates of the weights. Bag-of-words representation generally outperforms the concept-based representation. Further improvement in performance can be obtained by using the learning-to-rank method to integrate different weighting methods. This study follows up Lu and Mao Journal of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 66, 1776-1784, 2015, in which an automated weighted subject indexing method was proposed and validated. The findings from this study contribute to more effective weighted subject indexing.},

abstract = {Scientific collaboration is vital to many fields, and it is common to see scholars seek out experienced researchers or experts in a domain with whom they can share knowledge, experience, and resources. To explore the diversity of research collaborations, this article performs a temporal analysis on the scientific careers of researchers in the field of computer science. Specifically, we analyze collaborators using 2 indicators: the research topic diversity, measured by the Author-Conference-Topic model and cosine, and the impact diversity, measured by the normalized standard deviation of h-indices. We find that the collaborators of high-impact researchers tend to study diverse research topics and have diverse h-indices. Moreover, by setting PhD graduation as an important milestone in researchers' careers, we examine several indicators related to scientific collaboration and their effects on a career. The results show that collaborating with authoritative authors plays an important role prior to a researcher's PhD graduation, but working with non-authoritative authors carries more weight after PhD graduation.},

abstract = {Within science, citation counts are widely used to estimate research impact but publication delays mean that they are not useful for recent research. This gap can be filled by Mendeley reader counts, which are valuable early impact indicators for academic articles because they appear before citations and correlate strongly with them. Nevertheless, it is not known how Mendeley readership counts accumulate within the year of publication, and so it is unclear how soon they can be used. In response, this paper reports a longitudinal weekly study of the Mendeley readers of articles in 6 library and information science journals from 2016. The results suggest that Mendeley readers accrue from when articles are first available online and continue to steadily build. For journals with large publication delays, articles can already have substantial numbers of readers by their publication date. Thus, Mendeley reader counts may even be useful as early impact indicators for articles before they have been officially published in a journal issue. If field normalized indicators are needed, then these can be generated when journal issues are published using the online first date.},

The review focuses on the expanded notion of videogames "the EN", a concept this paper introduces to collectively refer to the cultural and social aspects of videogames-for example, game culture, experiences, play, and community life and activity. The study's research aims are pursued on the basis of a critical systematic literature review of 42 publications originating from academic research and videogame-archiving projects. The study's main finding is that the archiving literature construes the EN of videogames in three principal ways: i as an essential part of the videogame as an archival object; ii as a useful resource in archiving videogames, able to provide documentation of game culture and social context; and iii as a useful resource in inquiries focused on the current state and recent history of society and culture from a sociotechnical viewpoint. The study suggests videogame community dynamics, videogame ontology, the development of archival theory, and videogame-archive studies as rewarding directions for further research.},

abstract = {This article proposes a content‐based image retrieval (CBIR) system that employs an informative pattern‐based descriptor. Recent literature has reported the development of efficient local‐pattern‐based descriptors, including the local vector pattern (LVP). This article extends the LVP formulation by making it more computationally efficient and informative. In the extended LVP‐based extraction process, the global index angles are determined using the mutual information between the patterns, which are obtained from a pair of indexed angles. Thus, the Proposed LVP (PLVP) no longer requires a step to identify patterns in every indexed angle found in the querying phase of the CBIR system. A CBIR system with the PLVP is developed in this article, and the system and its associated methods are tested using data from a benchmark texture database and a natural image database. A performance comparison of the PLVP and traditional patterns, such as the local binary pattern (LBP), completely modeled local binary pattern (CLBP) and local tetra pattern (LTrP), is conducted using the CBIR system. The experimental results reveal the superiority of the PLVP in terms of precision, recall, F‐score and computational efficiency.},

This research employed an integrated theoretical framework combining institutional theory and the theory of planned behavior. The combined theoretical framework can apply the institutional theory at the individual level and extend the theory of planned behavior by including relevant contexts. This study utilized a survey method to test the proposed research model and hypotheses. Study participants were recruited from the Community of Science's (CoS) Scholar Database, and a total of 1,528 scientists responded to the survey. A multilevel analysis method was used to analyze the 1,237 qualified responses. This research showed that scientists' data reuse intentions are influenced by both disciplinary level factors (availability of data repositories) and individual level factors (perceived usefulness, perceived concern, and the availability of internal resources). This study has practical implications for promoting data reuse practices. Three main areas that need to be improved are identified: Educating scientists, providing internal supports, and providing external resources and supports such as data repositories.},

We have created an ontological model that will allow various user groups interested in transmedia to search for and retrieve the information contained in these worlds based upon their structure. We conducted a domain analysis and user studies based on the contents of Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, the Marvel Universe, and Star Wars in order to build a new model using Ontology Web Language (OWL) and an artificial intelligence‐reasoning engine. This model can infer connections between transmedia properties such as characters, elements of power, items, places, events, and so on. This model will facilitate better search and retrieval of the information contained within these vast story universes for all users interested in them. The result of this project is an OWL ontology reflecting real user needs based upon user research, which is intuitive for users and can be used by artificial intelligence systems.},

For scanning, we apply a novel text‐mining method that uses a zigzagged search that reinvestigates past documents based on the updated chain. We also utilize social networks of news actors to reveal connections among news articles. We conduct 2 user studies in terms of 4 effectiveness measures—relevance, coverage, coherence, and ability to disclose relations. The first user study compares several versions of the framework, by varying parameters, to set a guideline for use. The second compares the framework with 3 baselines. The results show that our method provides statistically significant improvement in effectiveness in 61% of pairwise comparisons, with medium or large effect size; in the remainder, none of the baselines significantly outperforms our method.},

Compared to the face‐to‐face communications, it can be particularly more challenging for users to understand and evaluate another's perspective in online communications. On the other hand, the availability of the communication record in online communications offers a potential to leverage computational techniques to automatically detect user opinions and rationales. One promising approach to automatically detect the rationales is to detect the common discourse relations in rationale texts. However, no empirical work has been done with regard to which discourse relations are commonly present in the users’ rationales in online communications. To fill this gap, we annotated the discourse relations in the text segments that contain the rationales (N = 527 text segments). These text segments are obtained from five datasets that consist of five online posts and the first 100 comments. We identified 10 discourse relations that are commonly present in this sample. Our finding marks an important contribution to this rationale detection approach. We encourage more empirical work, preferably with a larger sample, to examine the generalizability of our findings.},

Based on our case studies, we identified 14 characteristics that can help describe a data science project. We then used these characteristics to create a model that defines two key dimensions of the project. Finally, by clustering the projects within these two dimensions, we identified four types of data science projects, and based on the type of project, we identified some of the sociotechnical challenges that project teams should expect to encounter when executing data science projects.},

abstract = {Modeling multidimensional relevance in information retrieval (IR) has attracted much attention in recent years. However, most existing studies are conducted through relatively small‐scale user studies, which may not reflect a real‐world and natural search scenario. In this article, we propose to study the multidimensional user relevance model (MURM) on large scale query logs, which record users' various search behaviors (e.g., query reformulations, clicks and dwelling time, etc.) in natural search settings. We advance an existing MURM model (including five dimensions: topicality, novelty, reliability, understandability, and scope) by providing two additional dimensions, that is, interest and habit. The two new dimensions represent personalized relevance judgment on retrieved documents. Further, for each dimension in the enriched MURM model, a set of computable features are formulated. By conducting extensive document ranking experiments on Bing's query logs and TREC session Track data, we systematically investigated the impact of each dimension on retrieval performance and gained a series of insightful findings which may bring benefits for the design of future IR systems.},

abstract = {Use of research synthesis methods has contributed to changes in research practices. In disciplinary literatures, authors indicate motivations to use the methods include needs to (a) translate research‐based knowledge to inform practice and policy decisions, and (b) integrate relatively large and diverse knowledge bases to increase the generality of results and yield novel insights or explanations. This review presents two histories of the diffusion of research synthesis methods: a narrative history based primarily in the health and social sciences; and a bibliometric overview across science broadly. Engagement with research synthesis was strongly correlated with evidence‐based practice (EBP), and moderately with review prevalence. The social sciences were most diverse in terms of when research synthesis was adopted. Technology, physical sciences, and math appear to be relatively resistant though fields such as physics may be considered to have used similar methods long ago. Additional research is needed to assess the consequences of adoption within fields, including changes in how researchers engage with knowledge resources. This review demonstrates that particularistic histories of science and technology may be fruitfully augmented with informetrics to examine how disciplinary diffusion narratives coincide with patterns across science more broadly, thereby opening up disciplinary knowledge to inform future research.},

abstract = {User engagement (UE) is a quality of user experience characterized by the depth of an actor's cognitive, temporal, and/or emotional investment in an interaction with a digital system. Currently more art than science, UE has gained theoretical and methodological traction over the past decade, yet there is still a need to establish empirical links between UE and desired outcomes (e.g., learning, behavior change), and to understand the myriad user, system, contextual, and so on, factors that predict successful digital engagement. This paper focuses on the relationship between UE and media format as a potential antecedent, and the outcome of learning, operationalized as short‐term knowledge retention. Participants interacted with two human‐interest stories in one of four media formats: video, audio, narrative text, or transcript‐style text; short‐term knowledge retention was measured using post‐task multiple choice and short‐answer questions. It was anticipated that format would have a strong effect on UE, and that more engaged users would recall more information about the stories. However, these hypotheses were not fully supported, and the nature of the relationship between UE and learning was more nuanced than expected. This research has implications for the design of information systems and, more fundamentally, the impetus to make digital environments engaging.},

This paper describes a sociotechnical study conducted from 2008 through 2015 to identify deceptive communicative intent within group context as manifested in language‐action cues. Specifically, this study used an online team‐based game that simulates real‐world deceptive insider scenarios to examine several dimensions of group communication. First, we studied how language‐action cues differ between groups with and groups without a compromised actor. We also examine how these cues differ within groups in terms of the group members' individual and collective interactions with the compromised actor. Finally, we look at how the cues of compromised actors differ from those of noncompromised actors, and how communication behavior changes after an actor is presented with an ethical dilemma. The results of the study further our understanding of language‐action cues as indicators for unmasking a potential deceptive insider.},

abstract = {In this paper, we perform an in-depth study into how clinicians represent their information needs and the influence this has on information retrieval IR effectiveness. While much research in IR has considered the effectiveness of IR systems, there is still a significant gap in the understanding of how users contribute to the effectiveness of these systems. The paper aims to contribute to this by studying how clinicians search for information. Multiple representations of an information need-from verbose patient case descriptions to ad-hoc queries-were considered in order to understand their effect on retrieval. Four clinicians provided queries and performed relevance assessment to form a test collection used in this study. The different query formulation strategies of each clinician, and their effectiveness, were investigated. The results show that query formulation had more impact on retrieval effectiveness than the particular retrieval systems used. The most effective queries were short, ad-hoc keyword queries. Different clinicians were observed to consistently adopt specific query formulation strategies. The most effective queriers were those who, given their information need, inferred novel keywords most likely to appear in relevant documents. This study reveals aspects of how people search within the clinical domain. This can help inform the development of new models and methods that specifically focus on the query formulation process to improve retrieval effectiveness.},

abstract = {For diversity and novelty evaluation in information retrieval, we expect that the novel documents are always ranked higher than the redundant ones and the relevant ones higher than the irrelevant ones. We also expect that the level of novelty and relevancy should be acknowledged. Accordingly, we expect that the evaluation algorithm would reward rankings that respect these expectations. Nevertheless, there are few research articles in the literature that study how to meet such expectations, even fewer in the field of biomedical information retrieval. In this article, we propose a new metric for novelty and relevancy evaluation in biomedical information retrieval based on an aspect-level performance measure introduced by TREC Genomics Track with formal results to show that those expectations above can be respected under ideal conditions. The empirical evaluation indicates that the proposed metric, geNov, is greatly sensitive to the desired characteristics above, and the three parameters are highly tuneable for different evaluation preferences. By experimentally comparing with state-of-the-art metrics for novelty and diversity, the proposed metric shows its advantages in recognizing the ranking quality in terms of novelty, redundancy, relevancy, and irrelevancy and in its discriminative power. Experiments reveal the proposed metric is faster to compute than state-of-the-art metrics.},

However, information from reports is represented in free text, which is difficult to query against for secondary use. Automatic extraction of important information, such as tumor events using natural language processing, offers possibilities in improved clinical decision support, cohort identification, and retrospective evidence-based research for cancer patients. The goal of this work was to classify tumor event attributes: negation, temporality, and malignancy, using biomedical ontology and linguistically enriched features. We report our results on an annotated corpus of 101 hepatocellular carcinoma patient radiology reports, and show that the improved classification improves overall template structuring. Classification performances for negation identification, past temporality classification, and malignancy classification were at 0.94, 0.62, and 0.77 F1, respectively. Incorporating the attributes into full templates led to an improvement of 0.72 F1 for tumor-related events over a baseline of 0.65 F1. Improvement of negation, malignancy, and temporality classifications led to significant improvements in template extraction for the majority of categories. We present our machine-learning approach to identifying these several tumor event attributes from radiology reports, as well as highlight challenges and areas for improvement.},

abstract = {This article demonstrates the benefits of using sequence representations based on word embeddings to inform the seed selection and sample selection processes in an active learning pipeline for clinical information extraction. Seed selection refers to choosing an initial sample set to label to form an initial learning model. Sample selection refers to selecting informative samples to update the model at each iteration of the active learning process. Compared to supervised machine learning approaches, active learning offers the opportunity to build statistical classifiers with a reduced amount of training samples that require manual annotation. Reducing the manual annotation effort can support automating the clinical information extraction process. This is particularly beneficial in the clinical domain, where manual annotation is a time-consuming and costly task, as it requires extensive labor from clinical experts. Our empirical findings demonstrate that a using sequence representations along with the length of sequence for seed selection shows potential towards more effective initial models, and b using sequence representations for sample selection leads to significantly lower manual annotation efforts, with up to 3% and 6% fewer tokens and concepts requiring annotation, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art query strategies.},

At the same time, many health providers consider knowledge of the latest literature in their field a key component for successful clinical practice. In this work, we introduce two systems designed to help retrieving medical literature. Both receive a long, discursive clinical note as input query, and return highly relevant literature that could be used in support of clinical practice. The first system is an improved version of a method previously proposed by the authors; it combines pseudo relevance feedback and a domain-specific term filter to reformulate the query. The second is an approach that uses a deep neural network to reformulate a clinical note. Both approaches were evaluated on the 2014 and 2015 TREC CDS datasets; in our tests, they outperform the previously proposed method by up to 28% in inferred NDCG; furthermore, they are competitive with the state of the art, achieving up to 8% improvement in inferred NDCG.},

In this article, we present the OntoNeo Ontology, an initiative to build a formal ontology in the obstetrics and neonatal domain. OntoNeo is a resource that has been designed to serve as a comprehensive infrastructure providing scientific research and healthcare professionals with access to relevant information. The goal of OntoNeo is twofold: a to organize specialized medical knowledge, and b to provide a potential consensual representation of the medical information found in electronic health records and medical information systems. To describe our initiative, we first provide background information about distinct theories underlying ontology, top-level computational ontologies and their applications in Biomedicine. Then, we present the methodology employed in the development of OntoNeo and the results obtained to date. Finally, we discuss the applicability of OntoNeo by presenting a proof of concept that illustrates its potential usefulness in the realm of healthcare information systems.},

In this article we elaborate on whether and how we can exploit biomedicine-related entities from the emerging Web of Data for improving through reranking the results returned by a search system. The aim is to promote relevant but low-ranked hits containing entities that are important to the current search context. We introduce an approach that is based on entity extraction applied on the retrieved documents, yielding a graph of documents along with entities, which in turn is analyzed probabilistically using a Random Walk-based method. The proposed approach is independent of the submitted query and the underlying retrieval models, and thus can be applied over any ranked list of medical search results. Evaluation results using the data set of TREC Clinical Decision Support track demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve the results returned by classic and widely applicable retrieval models. The results also enabled us to identify cases where the proposed reranking method fails to improve the ranking.},

However, many existing extraction methods are mainly in a supervised manner. It is costly and time-consuming to manually label drug-disease pairs datasets. There are many drug-disease pairs buried in free text. In this work, we first leverage a pattern-based method to automatically extract drug-disease pairs with treatment and inducement relationships from free text. Then, to reflect a drug-disease relation, a network embedding algorithm is proposed to calculate the degree of correlation of a drug-disease pair. In the experiments, we use the method to extract treatment and inducement drug-disease pairs from 27 million medical abstracts and titles available on PubMed. We extract 138,318 unique treatment pairs and 75,396 unique inducement pairs. Our algorithm achieves a precision of 0.912 and a recall of 0.898 in extracting the frequent treatment drug-disease pairs, and a precision of 0.923 and a recall of 0.833 in extracting the frequent inducement drug-disease pairs. Besides, our proposed information network embedding algorithm can efficiently reflect the degree of correlation of drug-disease pairs. Our algorithm can achieve a precision of 0.802, a recall of 0.783 in the fine-grained evaluation of extracting frequent pairs.},

abstract = {In recent years, social media has become a significant resource for improving healthcare and mental health. Mental health forums are online communities where people express their issues, and seek help from moderators and other users. In such forums, there are often posts with severe content indicating that the user is in acute distress and there is a risk of attempted self-harm. Moderators need to respond to these severe posts in a timely manner to prevent potential self-harm. However, the large volume of daily posted content makes it difficult for the moderators to locate and respond to these critical posts. We propose an approach for triaging user content into four severity categories that are defined based on an indication of self-harm ideation. Our models are based on a feature-rich classification framework, which includes lexical, psycholinguistic, contextual, and topic modeling features. Our approaches improve over the state of the art in triaging the content severity in mental health forums by large margins up to 17% improvement over the F-1 scores. Furthermore, using our proposed model, we analyze the mental state of users and we show that overall, long-term users of the forum demonstrate decreased severity of risk over time. Our analysis on the interaction of the moderators with the users further indicates that without an automatic way to identify critical content, it is indeed challenging for the moderators to provide timely response to the users in need.},

However, it is not always easy to find the desired information and in clinical routine the time to fulfil an information need is often very limited. Information retrieval systems are a useful tool to provide access to these documents/images in the biomedical literature related to information needs of medical professionals. Shangri-La is a medical retrieval system that can potentially help clinicians to make decisions on difficult cases. It retrieves articles from the biomedical literature when querying a case description and attached images. The system is based on a multimodal retrieval approach with a focus on the integration of visual information connected to text. The approach includes a query-adaptive multimodal fusion criterion that analyses if visual features are suitable to be fused with text for the retrieval. Furthermore, image modality information is integrated in the retrieval step. The approach is evaluated using the ImageCLEFmed 2013 medical retrieval benchmark and can thus be compared to other approaches. Results show that the final approach outperforms the best multimodal approach submitted to ImageCLEFmed 2013.},

abstract = {This study presents a large-scale analysis of the distribution and presence of Mendeley readership scores over time and across disciplines. We study whether Mendeley readership scores RS can identify highly cited publications more effectively than journal citation scores JCS. Web of Science WoS publications with digital object identifiers DOIs published during the period 2004-2013 and across five major scientific fields were analyzed. The main result of this study shows that RS are more effective in terms of precision/recall values than JCS to identify highly cited publications across all fields of science and publication years. The findings also show that 86.5% of all the publications are covered by Mendeley and have at least one reader. Also, the share of publications with Mendeley RS is increasing from 84% in 2004 to 89% in 2009, and decreasing from 88% in 2010 to 82% in 2013. However, it is noted that publications from 2010 onwards exhibit on average a higher density of readership versus citation scores. This indicates that compared to citation scores, RS are more prevalent for recent publications and hence they could work as an early indicator of research impact. These findings highlight the potential and value of Mendeley as a tool for scientometric purposes and particularly as a relevant tool to identify highly cited publications.},

abstract = {Hybrid open access refers to articles freely accessible via the Internet but which originate from an academic journal that provides most of its content via subscription. The effect of hybrid open access on citation counts and author behavior in the field of chemistry is something that has not been widely studied. We compared 814 open access articles and 27,621 subscription access articles published from 2006 through 2011 in American Chemical Society journals. As expected, the 2 comparison groups are not equal in all respects. Cumulative citation data were analyzed from years 2-5 following an article's publication date. A citation advantage for open access articles was correlated with the journal impact factor IF in low and medium IF journals, but not in high IF journals. Open access articles have a 24% higher mean citation rate than their subscription counterparts in low IF journals confidence limits 8-42%, p = .0022 and similarly, a 26% higher mean citation rate in medium IF journals confidence limits 14-40%, p &lt; .001. Open access articles in high IF journals had no significant difference compared to subscription access articles 13% lower mean citation rate, confidence limits -27-3%, p = .10. These results are correlative, not causative, and may not be completely due to an open access effect. Authors of the open access articles were also surveyed to determine why they chose a hybrid open access option, paid the required article processing charge, and whether they believed it was money well spent. Authors primarily chose open access because of funding mandates; however, most considered the money well spent because open access increases information access to the scientific community and the general public, and potentially increases citations to their scholarship.},

abstract = {The lifecycles of format technology have been a defining concern for digital stewardship research and practice. However, little evidence exists to provide robust methods for assessing the state of any given format technology and describing its evolution over time. This article introduces relevant models from diffusion theory and market research and presents a replicable analysis method to compute models of technology evolution. Data cleansing and the combination of multiple data sources enable the application of nonlinear regression to estimate the parameters of the Bass diffusion model on format technology market lifecycles. Through its application to a longitudinal data set from the UK Web Archive, we demonstrate that the method produces reliable results and show that the Bass model can be used to describe format lifecycles. By analyzing adoption patterns across market segments, new insights are inferred about how the diffusion of formats and products such as applications occurs over time. The analysis provides a stepping stone to a more robust and evidence-based approach to model technology evolution.},

Words that are randomly distributed across subjects are assumed to lack aboutness and the degree to which their usage deviates from a random pattern indicates the strength of the aboutness. To estimate aboutness, title words and their associated subjects are extracted from the titles of non-fiction English language books in the OCLC WorldCat database. The usage patterns of the title words are analyzed and used to compute aboutness coefficients for each of the common title words. Words with low aboutness coefficients An and In are commonly found in stop word lists, whereas words with high aboutness coefficients Carbonate, Autism are unambiguous and have a strong subject association. The aboutness coefficient potentially can enhance indexing, advance authority control, and improve retrieval.},

We demonstrate that high-quality standards in information presentation are not globally shared and that in many aspects, the language culture's influence determines what is perceived to be proper, desirable, and exemplary for encyclopedic entries. As a result, we demonstrate that standards for encyclopedic knowledge are not globally agreed-upon and "objective" but local and very subjective.},

abstract = {Outstanding scholars have generally been regarded as having special influence that enables them to publish articles in top-tier journals and obtain higher levels of research funding. This study proposes that the social effect of an outstanding scholar, which is derived from the halo effect and the Matthew effect, is favorable for the expansion of the scholar's personal research network and will improve that scholar's future research accomplishments. Data for a total of 101 outstanding information systems scholars and 36 ordinary scholars were collected. The definition of an outstanding scholar is based on the quality and quantity of their publications. The results show that the social effect of the outstanding scholars is beneficial for the development of a research network, including 3 types of network structures. In addition, being highly connected with colleagues leads to higher research accomplishments in terms of quantity, while being connected with colleagues from different sub-fields leads to higher research accomplishments in terms of novelty. Additionally, this study found that the social effect of outstanding scholars is a double-edged sword, with both positive and negative impacts on research accomplishments. The findings contribute several theoretical and practical implications for future research.},

abstract = {Although people disclose illicit activities such as drug use online, we currently know little about what information people choose to disclose and share or whether there are differences in behavior depending on the illicit activity being disclosed. This exploratory mixed-methods study examines how people discuss and disclose the use of two different drugs-marijuana and opioids-on Reddit. In this study, hermeneutic content analysis is employed to describe the type of comments people make in forums dedicated to discussions about illicit drugs. With inductive analysis, seven categories of comments were identified: disclosure, instruction and advice, culture, community norms, moralizing, legality, and banter. Our subsequent quantitative analysis indicates that although the amounts of disclosure are similar in each subreddit, there are more instances of instruction and advice in discussions about opiates, and more examples of banter in comments about marijuana use. In fact, both subreddits have high rates of banter. We argue that banter fosters disclosure in both subreddits, and that banter and disclosure are linked with information-seeking behaviors in online forums. This work has implications for future explorations of disclosure online and for public health interventions aimed at disseminating credible information about drug use to at-risk individuals.},

Specifically, the conceptual model integrates the fundamental attributes of the canonical AL service together with those more relevant of the new and widely considered AL Electronic Service e-services. As concerns the evaluation approach, it incorporates the Fuzzy Sets Theory FST so as to deal with the students' uncertainty over their own judgments on the AL service quality and a Structural Equation Model SEM to validate the conceptual model and to determine the key drivers of the AL service quality. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is proved by an empirical study concerning the AL of the Polytechnic School of the University of Palermo Italy. Data collected via a survey involving more than 600 students are used, and the key drivers of the AL service quality are found out. Particularly, the obtained results reveal that Collections and materials represents the main driver of the AL service quality followed by Infrastructure and Access to the service, whereas Staff plays the fundamental role of interface between AL service aspects and students' needs and necessities.},

This article presents a supervised machine learning system for linking named mentions of people in email messages to a collection-specific knowledge base, and that is also capable of NIL detection. This system learns from manually annotated training examples to leverage a rich set of features. The entity linking accuracy for entities present in the knowledge base is substantially and significantly better than the best previously reported results on the Enron email collection, comparable accuracy is reported for the challenging NIL detection task, and these results are for the first time replicated on a second email collection from a different source with comparable results.},

abstract = {The global popularity of microblogs has led to an increasing accumulation of large volumes of text data on microblogging platforms such as Twitter. These corpora are untapped resources to understand social expressions on diverse subjects. Microblog analysis aims to unlock the value of such expressions by discovering insights and events of significance hidden among swathes of text. Besides velocity; diversity of content, brevity, absence of structure and time-sensitivity are key challenges in microblog analysis. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised incremental machine learning and event detection technique to address these challenges. The proposed technique separates a microblog discussion into topics to address the key problem of diversity. It maintains a record of the evolution of each topic over time. Brevity, time-sensitivity and unstructured nature are addressed by these individual topic pathways which contribute to generate a temporal, topic-driven structure of a microblog discussion. The proposed event detection method continuously monitors these topic pathways using multiple domain-independent event indicators for events of significance. The autonomous nature of topic separation, topic pathway generation, new topic identification and event detection, appropriates the proposed technique for extensive applications in microblog analysis. We demonstrate these capabilities on tweets containing #microsoft and tweets containing #obama.},

We present different techniques to estimate co-utility probabilities, all of them independent of content information, and compare them with each other. We use these probabilities, as well as normalized predicted ratings, in an instance of an NP-hard problem termed the Max-Sum Dispersion Problem MSDP. A solution to MSDP hence corresponds to a set of items for recommendation. We study one heuristic and one exact solution to MSDP and perform comparisons among them. We also contrast our solutions the best heuristic to MSDP to different baselines by comparing the ratings users give to different recommendations. We obtain expressive gains in the utility of recommendations and our solutions also recommend higher-rated items to the majority of users. Finally, we show that our co-utility solutions are scalable in practice and do not harm recommendations' diversity.},

Previous social tagging studies have collected social tagging data and analyzed how tagging functions as a tool to organize and retrieve information. Many studies focused on the patterns of tagging rather than the users' perspectives. To provide a more comprehensive picture of users' social tagging activities in institutional collections, and how this compares to social tagging in a more personal context, we collected data from social tagging users by surveying 7,563 participants in the Library of Congress's Flickr Collection. We asked users to describe their motivations for activities within the LC Flickr Collection in their own words using open-ended questions. As a result, we identified 11 motivations using a bottom-up, open-coding approach: affective reactions, opinion on photo, interest in subject, contribution to description, knowledge sharing, improving findability, social network, appreciation, personal use, and personal relationship. Our study revealed that affective or emotional reactions play a critical role in the use of social tagging of institutional collections by comparing our findings to existing frameworks for tagging motivations. We also examined the relationships between participants' occupations and our 11 motivations.},

We created 4 variants of this system, manipulating 2 distinct properties of metaphor. We conducted a between-subjects experimental study with 80 participants to compare understanding and engagement when working with each version. We found that building on known image schemas improved response time on look-up tasks, while contextual detail predicted increases in persistence and the number of inferences drawn from the data. Schema-congruency combined with contextual detail produced the highest gains in comprehension. These findings provide concrete mechanisms by which designers presenting large data sets through metaphorical interfaces may improve their effectiveness and appeal with users.},

Their performance was evaluated using actual behavioral data from an experiment in which 2 types of information search tasks simple vs. difficult, were presented to younger and older participants. The results showed that the model predictions matched significantly better with the actual user behavior on difficult tasks compared to simple tasks and with younger participants compared to older participants, especially for difficult tasks. Also, the matches were significantly better with CoLiDeS+ compared to CoLiDeS, especially for difficult tasks. We conclude that the advanced capabilities of CoLiDeS+, such as incorporating contextual information and implementing backtracking strategies enable it to predict user behavior significantly better than CoLiDeS, especially on difficult tasks. The usefulness of these modeling outcomes for the design of support systems for older adults is discussed.},

This work investigates text relevance decision dynamics in a question-answering task by direct measurement of eye movement using eye-tracking and brain activity using electroencephalography EEG. The EEG measurements are correlated with the user's goal-directed attention allocation revealed by their eye movements. In a within-subject lab experiment N=24, participants read short news stories of varied relevance. Eye movement and EEG features were calculated in three epochs of reading each news story early, middle, final and for periods where relevant words were read. Perceived relevance classification models were learned for each epoch. The results show reading epochs where relevant words were processed could be distinguished from other epochs. The classification models show increasing divergence in processing relevant vs. irrelevant documents after the initial epoch. This suggests differences in cognitive processes used to assess texts of varied relevance levels and provides evidence for the potential to detect these differences in information search sessions using eye tracking and EEG.},

abstract = {Searching for health information is one of the most popular activities on the web. In this domain, users often misspell or lack knowledge of the proper medical terms to use in queries. To overcome these difficulties and attempt to retrieve higher-quality content, we developed a query suggestion system that provides alternative queries combining the Portuguese or English language with lay or medico-scientific terminology. Here we evaluate this system's impact on the medical accuracy of the knowledge acquired during the search. Evaluation shows that simply providing these suggestions contributes to reduce the quantity of incorrect content. This indicates that even when suggestions are not clicked, they are useful either for subsequent queries' formulation or for interpreting search results. Clicking on suggestions, regardless of type, leads to answers with more correct content. An analysis by type of suggestion and user characteristics showed that the benefits of certain languages and terminologies are more perceptible in users with certain levels of English proficiency and health literacy. This suggests a personalization of this suggestion system toward these characteristics. Overall, the effect of language is more preponderant than the effect of terminology. Clicks on English suggestions are clearly preferable to clicks on Portuguese ones.},

abstract = {Recently a number of well-known public figures have expressed concern about the future development of artificial intelligence AI, by noting that AI could get out of control and affect human beings and society in disastrous ways. Many of these cautionary notes are alarmist and unrealistic, and while there has been some pushback on these concerns, the deep flaws in the thinking that leads to them have not been called out. Much of the fear and trepidation is based on misunderstanding and confusion about what AI is and can ever be. In this work we identify 3 factors that contribute to this "AI anxiety": an exclusive focus on AI programs that leaves humans out of the picture, confusion about autonomy in computational entities and in humans, and an inaccurate conception of technological development. With this analysis we argue that there are good reasons for anxiety about AI but not for the reasons typically given by AI alarmists.},

abstract = {Text simplification often relies on dated, unproven readability formulas. As an alternative and motivated by the success of term familiarity, we test a complementary measure: grammar familiarity. Grammar familiarity is measured as the frequency of the 3rd level sentence parse tree and is useful for evaluating individual sentences. We created a database of 140K unique 3rd level parse structures by parsing and binning all 5.4M sentences in English Wikipedia. We then calculated the grammar frequencies across the corpus and created 11 frequency bins. We evaluate the measure with a user study and corpus analysis. For the user study, we selected 20 sentences randomly from each bin, controlling for sentence length and term frequency, and recruited 30 readers per sentence N = 6,600 on Amazon Mechanical Turk. We measured actual difficulty comprehension using a Cloze test, perceived difficulty using a 5-point Likert scale, and time taken. Sentences with more frequent grammatical structures, even with very different surface presentations, were easier to understand, perceived as easier, and took less time to read. Outcomes from readability formulas correlated with perceived but not with actual difficulty. Our corpus analysis shows how the metric can be used to understand grammar regularity in a broad range of corpora.},

In order to move beyond traditional evaluations of security threats, which generally consider security threats individually, analyses in this paper approach security vulnerability from a more holistic approach to analyze four risk categories concurrently: phishing, passwords, bring your own device BYOD, and company-supplied laptops. Findings from a survey of 250 employees at a medium-sized American information technology IT consulting firm identify higher-risk employees across the four risk areas and provide new insights into the challenges organizations face when trying to ensure the protection of company data.},

Two reader groups were elicited according to similar reading preference patterns. The readers enjoyed the entertainment, escape, and comfort that reading as a pleasurable activity offered. The aesthetic readers valued the artistic and aesthetic pleasures, widening vocabulary, and ability to express oneself through fiction books. We compared the search queries and search actions between the 2 reader groups. Our results demonstrated that preference patterns were associated with readers' search behavior, that is, the number of viewed search result pages, opened book pages, dwell time on book pages, and the type of search queries. Based on the findings, we present 3 search tactics for fiction books in library catalogs: i focused querying, ii topical browsing, and iii similarity-based tactic. The most popular search tactic in each search scenario was "focused querying" with known author in both reader groups.},

This review provides an extensive account of the state-of-the art in both scholarly use of social media and altmetrics. The review consists of 2 main parts: the first examines the use of social media in academia, reviewing the various functions these platforms have in the scholarly communication process and the factors that affect this use. The second part reviews empirical studies of altmetrics, discussing the various interpretations of altmetrics, data collection and methodological limitations, and differences according to platform. The review ends with a critical discussion of the implications of this transformation in the scholarly communication system.},

In particular, the results show that summaries generated from ASR transcripts are comparable, in utility and user-judged preference, to spoken summaries generated from error-free manual transcripts of the same collection. We also observed that content-based audio summaries are at least as preferred as synthesized summaries obtained from manually curated metadata, such as title and description. We describe a methodology for constructing a new test collection, which we have made publicly available.},

abstract = {During the past few decades, the rate of publication retractions has increased dramatically in academia. In this study, we investigate retractions from a quantitative perspective, aiming to answer two fundamental questions. One, how do retractions influence the scholarly impact of retracted papers, authors, and institutions? Two, does this influence propagate to the wider academic community through scholarly associations? Specifically, we analyzed a set of retracted articles indexed in Thomson Reuters Web of Science WoS, and ran multiple experiments to compare changes in scholarly impact against a control set of nonretracted articles, authors, and institutions. We further applied the Granger Causality test to investigate whether different scientific topics are dynamically affected by retracted papers occurring within those topics. Our results show two key findings: first, the scholarly impact of retracted papers and authors significantly decreases after retraction, and the most severe impact decrease correlates with retractions based on proven, purposeful scientific misconduct; second, this retraction penalty does not seem to spread through the broader scholarly social graph, but instead has a limited and localized effect. Our findings may provide useful insights for scholars or science committees to evaluate the scholarly value of papers, authors, or institutions related to retractions.},

By conducting a thematic analysis of four key UN policy documents related to sustainable development, this paper argues that alongside financial and other resources, access to, and use of, appropriate information are essential for achieving SDGs. The paper also reviews research on information and sustainability undertaken at the iSchools and the computer and human-computer interaction HCI communities. Given that the mission of iSchools is to connect people and society with the required information through the use of appropriate technologies and tools, this paper argues that iSchools can play a key role in helping people, institutions, and businesses, and thus countries around the world achieve SDGs. The paper identifies 4 broad areas of teaching and research that can help iSchools around the world prepare a trained workforce who can manage, and facilitate access to, information in specific domains and contexts. It is also argued that cooperation and collaborations among iSchools can promote a culture of sustainable information practices among university graduates and researchers in different disciplines that will pave the way for achieving SDGs in every sector.},

However, past studies have shown that the cost of organization can be too high for some users to be worth the effort. Mixed-initiative approaches attempt to reduce the burden of manual organization by automatically identifying and suggesting organizational units such as folders to users. However, little is known about how such mixed-initiative approaches influence users' organizational experiences. In this paper, we explore a mixed-initiative approach that suggests high-level organizational units to users to facilitate e-mail organization. In 2 in-situ experiments with 34 knowledge workers, we study how our mixed-initiative approach influenced users' experience with organization. We show that our approach made it easier to create organizational units without negatively affecting recall of those units, and led to the creation of units that otherwise would have not been created. Our findings suggest ways computers and people can most effectively work together to organize information.},

abstract = {Bibliometric data are frequently used to study the effects of events, such as the honoring of a scholar with an award, and to investigate changes of citation impact over time. However, the number of yearly citations depends upon time for multiple reasons: a general time trends in citation data, b changing coverage of databases, c individual citation life-cycles, and d selection on citation impact. Hence, it is often ill-advised to simply compare the average number of citations before and after an event to estimate its causal effect. Using a recent publication in this journal on the potential citation chain reaction of a Nobel Prize, we demonstrate that a simple pre-post comparison can lead to biased and misleading results. We propose using matched control groups to improve causal inference and illustrate that the inclusion of a tailor-made synthetic control group in the statistical analysis helps to avoid methodological artifacts. Our results suggest that there is neither a Nobel Prize effect as regards citation impact of the Nobel laureate under investigation nor a related chain reaction in the citation network, as suggested in the original study. Finally, we explain that these methodological recommendations extend far beyond the study of Nobel Prize effects in citation data.},

It presents the results of a survey covering higher education libraries in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the UK. The results indicate that libraries have provided leadership in RDM, particularly in advocacy and policy development. Service development is still limited, focused especially on advisory and consultancy services such as data management planning support and data-related training, rather than technical services such as provision of a data catalog, and curation of active data. Data curation skills development is underway in libraries, but skills and capabilities are not consistently in place and remain a concern. Other major challenges include resourcing, working with other support services, and achieving "buy in" from researchers and senior managers. Results are compared with previous studies in order to assess trends and relative maturity levels. The range of RDM activities explored in this study are positioned on a "landscape maturity model," which reflects current and planned research data services and practice in academic libraries, representing a "snapshot" of current developments and a baseline for future research.},

abstract = {This paper reports analysis of data from higher education institutions in the UK on their experience of the open-access OA publishing market working within a policy environment favoring "Gold" OA OA publishing in journals. It models the "total cost of publication"-comprising costs of journal subscriptions, OA article-processing charges APCs, and new administrative costs-for a sample of 24 institutions. APCs are shown to constitute 12% of the "total cost of publication," APC administration, 1%, and subscriptions, 87% for a sample of seven publishers. APC expenditure in institutions rose between 2012 and 2014 at the same time as rising subscription costs.

"Hybrid" options subscription journals also offering OA for individual articles on payment of an APC were considerably more expensive than fully OA titles, but the data indicate a correlation between APC price and journal quality as reflected in the citation rates of journals. The policy implications of these developments are explored, particularly in relation to hybrid OA and potential of offsetting subscription and APC costs.},

abstract = {This paper presents the first large-scale investigation of the users and uses of WorldCat.org, the world's largest bibliographic database and global union catalog. Using a mixed-methods approach involving focus group interviews with 120 participants, an online survey with 2,918 responses, and an analysis of transaction logs of approximately 15 million sessions from WorldCat.org, the study provides a new understanding of the context for global union catalog use. We find that WorldCat.org is accessed by a diverse population, with the three primary user groups being librarians, students, and academics. Use of the system is found to fall within three broad types of work-task professional, academic, and leisure, and we also present an emergent taxonomy of search tasks that encompass known-item, unknown-item, and institutional information searches. Our results support the notion that union catalogs are primarily used for known-item searches, although the volume of traffic to WorldCat.org means that unknown-item searches nonetheless represent an estimated 250,000 sessions per month. Search engine referrals account for almost half of all traffic, but although WorldCat.org effectively connects users referred from institutional library catalogs to other libraries holding a sought item, users arriving from a search engine are less likely to connect to a library.},

Angewandte Chemie International Edition AC, a leading international journal in chemistry, signals high-quality papers through designating them as a "very important paper" VIP. This study aims to investigate the citation impact of Communications in AC receiving the special feature VIP, both cumulated and over time. Using propensity score matching, treatment group VIP and control group non-VIP were balanced for 14 covariates to estimate the unconfounded "average treatment effect on the treated" for the VIP designation. Out of N = 3,011 Communications published in 2007 and 2008, N = 207 received the special feature VIP. For each Communication, data were collected from AC e.g., referees' ratings and from the databases Chemical Abstracts e.g., sections and the Web of Science e.g., citations. The estimated unconfounded average treatment effect on the treated that is, Communications designated as a VIP was statistically significant and amounted to 19.83 citations. In addition, the special feature VIP fostered the cumulated annual citation growth. For instance, the time until a Communication reached its maximum annual number of citations, was reduced.},

Controlling for field and impact factor, the odds that an open access journal is referenced on the English Wikipedia are 47% higher compared to paywall journals. These findings provide evidence is that a major consequence of open access policies is to significantly amplify the diffusion of science, through an intermediary like Wikipedia, to a broad audience.},

abstract = {Query reformulations can occur multiple times in a session, and queries observed in the same session tend to be related to each other. Due to the interdependent nature of queries in a session, it has been challenging to analyze query reformulation data while controlling for possible dependencies among queries. This study proposes a multilevel modeling approach in an attempt to analyze the effects of contextual factors and system features on types of query reformulation, as well as the relationship between types of query reformulation and search performance within a single research model. The results revealed that system features and users' educational background significantly influence users' query reformulation behaviors. Also, types of query reformulation had a significant impact on search performance. The main contribution of this study lies in that it adopted the multilevel modeling method to analyze query reformulation behavior while considering the nested structure of search session data. Multilevel analysis enables us to design an extensible research model to include both session-level and action-level factors, which provides a more extended understanding of the relationships among factors that influence query reformulation behavior and search performance. The multilevel modeling used in this study has practical implications for future query reformulation studies.},

abstract = {Human computation games HCGs harness human intelligence through enjoyable gameplay to address computational problems that are beyond the power of computer programs but trivial for humans. With the popularity of crowdsourcing, different types of HCGs have been developed using various gameplay mechanics to attract online users to contribute outputs. Two commonly used mechanics are collaboration and competition. Yet there is little research examining whether HCGs perform better than nongame applications in terms of motivations and perceptions. Thus, this study investigates the effects of collaborative and competitive mechanics on intrinsic motivation and perceived output quality in mobile content sharing HCGs. Using a within-subjects experiment, 160 participants were recruited from 2 local universities. The findings suggest that the nongame application was perceived to yield better quality output than both HCGs, but the latter offered a greater satisfaction of motivational needs, which may motivate individuals to continue playing them. Taken together, the present findings inform researchers and designers of HCGs that games could serve as a motivator to encourage participation. However, the usefulness of HCGs may be dependent on how one can effectively manage the entertainment-output generation duality of such games. This article concludes by presenting implications, limitations, and future research directions.},

This article investigates the extent to which academics exploit journalism using content and citation analyses of online BBC News stories cited by Scopus articles. A total of 27,234 Scopus-indexed publications have cited at least one BBC News story, with a steady annual increase. Citations from the arts and humanities 2.8% of publications in 2015 and social sciences 1.5% were more likely than citations from medicine 0.1% and science &lt;0.1%. Surprisingly, half of the sampled Scopus-cited science and technology 53% and medicine and health 47% stories were based on academic research, rather than otherwise unpublished information, suggesting that researchers have chosen a lower-quality secondary source for their citations. Nevertheless, the BBC News stories that were most frequently cited by Scopus, Google Books, and Wikipedia introduced new information from many different topics, including politics, business, economics, statistics, and reports about events. Thus, news stories are mediating real-world knowledge into the academic domain, a potential cause for concern.},

The selection of friends or followees responds to several reasons whose importance might differ according to the characteristics and preferences of each user. Furthermore, those preferences might also change over time. Consequently, understanding how friends or followees are selected emerges as a key design factor of strategies for personalized recommendations. In this work, we argue that the criteria for recommending followees needs to be adapted and combined according to each user's behavior, preferences, and characteristics. A method is proposed for adapting such criteria to the characteristics of the previously selected followees. Moreover, the criteria can evolve over time to adapt to changes in user behavior, and broaden the diversity of the recommendation of potential followees based on novelty. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed method improved precision results regarding static criteria weighting strategies and traditional rank aggregation techniques.},

One area where consumers are particularly prone to make costly decision-making errors is long-term saving, which requires understanding of complex concepts such as uncertainty and trade-offs. Although most people are poorly equipped to deal with such concepts, interactive design can potentially help users make better decisions. We developed an interactive information label to assist consumers with retirement saving decision-making. To evaluate it, we exposed 450 users to one of four user interface conditions in a retirement saving simulator where they made 35 yearly decisions under changing circumstances. We found a significantly better ability of users to reach their goals with the information label. Furthermore, users who interacted with the label made better decisions than those who were presented with a static information label. Lastly, we found the label particularly effective in helping novice savers.},

This article studies how to model user-item personalized discount sensitivity and incorporate it into a real time contextual recommender system in such a way that it can be integrated into a commercial service. We propose a novel approach for modeling context-aware user-item personalized discount sensitivity in a sparse data scenario and present a new CARS algorithm that combines coclustering and random forest classification CBRF to incorporate the personalized discount sensitivity. We conducted an experimental study with real consumers and mobile discount coupons to evaluate our solution. We compared the CBRF algorithm to the widely used context-aware matrix factorization CAMF algorithm. The experimental results suggest that incorporating personalized discount sensitivity significantly improves the consumption prediction accuracy and that the suggested CBRF algorithm provides better prediction results for this use case.},

Moreover, there typically exists rich complementary information that can be delivered to the visitor about exhibits of interest, but only a fraction of this information can be consumed during the limited time of the visit. Recommender systems may help visitors to cope with this information overload. Ideally, the recommender system of choice should model user preferences, as well as background knowledge about the museum's environment, considering aspects of physical and thematic relevancy. We propose a personalized graph-based recommender framework, representing rating history and background multi-facet information jointly as a relational graph. A random walk measure is applied to rank available complementary multimedia presentations by their relevancy to a visitor's profile, integrating the various dimensions. We report the results of experiments conducted using authentic data collected at the Hecht museum.http://mushecht.haifa.ac.il/ An evaluation of multiple graph variants, compared with several popular and state-of-the-art recommendation methods, indicates on advantages of the graph-based approach.},

In an observational study, participants N=247 completed two information research tasks on preset search engine results pages, on which three credibility cues source reputation, message neutrality, and social recommendations as well as the search result ranking were systematically varied. The results of our study confirm the significance of the ranking. Of the three credibility cues, only reputation had an additional effect on selection probabilities. Personal characteristics prior knowledge about the researched issues, search engine usage patterns, etc. did not influence the preference for search results linked with certain credibility cues. These findings are discussed in light of situational and contextual characteristics e.g., involvement, low-cost scenarios.},

About two thirds of uploaded SlideShare documents are presentation slides, with the remainder often being files associated with presentations or video recordings of talks. SlideShare is therefore a presentation-centered site with a predominantly professional user base. Although a minority of the uploaded SlideShare documents are cited by, or cite, academic publications, probably too few articles are cited by SlideShare to consider extracting SlideShare citations for research evaluation.

abstract = {Whereas traditional science maps emphasize citation statistics and static relationships, this paper presents a term-based method to identify and visualize the evolutionary pathways of scientific topics in a series of time slices. First, we create a data preprocessing model for accurate term cleaning, consolidating, and clustering. Then we construct a simulated data streaming function and introduce a learning process to train a relationship identification function to adapt to changing environments in real time, where relationships of topic evolution, fusion, death, and novelty are identified. The main result of the method is a map of scientific evolutionary pathways. The visual routines provide a way to indicate the interactions among scientific subjects and a version in a series of time slices helps further illustrate such evolutionary pathways in detail.

abstract = {Music mood recognition MMR has attracted much attention in music information retrieval research, yet there are few MMR studies that focus on non-Western music. In addition, little has been done on connecting the 2 most adopted music mood representation models: categorical and dimensional. To bridge these gaps, we constructed a new data set consisting of 818 Chinese Pop C-Pop songs, 3 complete sets of mood annotations in both representations, as well as audio features corresponding to 5 distinct categories of musical characteristics. The mood space of C-Pop songs was analyzed and compared to that of Western Pop songs. We also explored the relationship between categorical and dimensional annotations and the results revealed that one set of annotations could be reliably predicted by the other. Classification and regression experiments were conducted on the data set, providing benchmarks for future research on MMR of non-Western music. Based on these analyses, we reflect and discuss the implications of the findings to MMR research.},

abstract = {Although peer-review and citation counts are commonly used to help assess the scholarly impact of published research, informal reader feedback might also be exploited to help assess the wider impacts of books, such as their educational or cultural value. The social website Goodreads seems to be a reasonable source for this purpose because it includes a large number of book reviews and ratings by many users inside and outside of academia. To check this, Goodreads book metrics were compared with different book-based impact indicators for 15,928 academic books across broad fields. Goodreads engagements were numerous enough in the arts 85% of books had at least one, humanities 80%, and social sciences 67% for use as a source of impact evidence. Low and moderate correlations between Goodreads book metrics and scholarly or non-scholarly indicators suggest that reader feedback in Goodreads reflects the many purposes of books rather than a single type of impact. Although Goodreads book metrics can be manipulated, they could be used guardedly by academics, authors, and publishers in evaluations.},

abstract = {Over the years, Twitter has become a popular platform for information dissemination and information gathering. However, the popularity of Twitter has attracted not only legitimate users but also spammers who exploit social graphs, popular keywords, and hashtags for malicious purposes. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the HSpam14 dataset, which contains 14 million tweets with spam and ham i.e., nonspam labels, to understand spamming activities on Twitter. The primary focus of this paper is to analyze various aspects of spam on Twitter based on hashtags, tweet contents, and user profiles, which are useful for both tweet-level and user-level spam detection. First, we compare the usage of hashtags in spam and ham tweets based on frequency, position, orthography, and co-occurrence. Second, for content-based analysis, we analyze the variations in word usage, metadata, and near-duplicate tweets. Third, for user-based analysis, we investigate user profile information. In our study, we validate that spammers use popular hashtags to promote their tweets. We also observe differences in the usage of words in spam and ham tweets. Spam tweets are more likely to be emphasized using exclamation points and capitalized words. Furthermore, we observe that spammers use multiple accounts to post near-duplicate tweets to promote their services and products. Unlike spammers, legitimate users are likely to provide more information such as their locations and personal descriptions in their profiles. In summary, this study presents a comprehensive analysis of hashtags, tweet contents, and user profiles in Twitter spamming.},

However, low recognition accuracy becomes the biggest barrier that limits their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework termed Boosting Attribute Recognition BAR for the image recognition task. Our framework stems from matrix factorization, and can explore latent relationships from the aspect of attribute and image simultaneously. Furthermore, to apply our framework in large-scale visual recognition tasks, we present both offline and online learning implementation of the proposed framework. Extensive experiments on 3 data sets demonstrate that our framework achieves a sound accuracy of attribute recognition.},

Text postings only become the actions they perform, such as an information request or deliverable, through the recipient's work of reading. Text postings thus are designed for their recipients and are built in ways that instruct particular readings. In this paper, I show that patron requests are interactional achievements co-constituted by librarians and patrons through the exchange of text postings that are designed to be seen as requests. The Reference and User Services Association offers guidelines for online interactions between librarians and patrons. However, such guidelines provide only general recommendations by which librarians may overcome difficulties in identifying the specific information needs of patrons. I examine actual chat logs of virtual reference interactions and describe how librarians engage with patrons to co-construct actionable requests to specify and fulfill patron information needs. Conversation analytic methods are used to identify the way texts are produced to instruct recipients in the ways they are to be read and how these texts serve, through reading's work, as an analysis of the actions prior texts perform.},

abstract = {Twitter has attracted billions of users for life logging and sharing activities and opinions. In their tweets, users often reveal their location information and short-term visiting histories or plans. Capturing user's short-term activities could benefit many applications for providing the right context at the right time and location. In this paper we are interested in extracting locations mentioned in tweets at fine-grained granularity, with temporal awareness. Specifically, we recognize the points-of-interest POIs mentioned in a tweet and predict whether the user has visited, is currently at, or will soon visit the mentioned POIs. A POI can be a restaurant, a shopping mall, a bookstore, or any other fine-grained location. Our proposed framework, named TS-Petar Two-Stage POI Extractor with Temporal Awareness, consists of two main components: a POI inventory and a two-stage time-aware POI tagger. The POI inventory is built by exploiting the crowd wisdom of the Foursquare community. It contains both POIs' formal names and their informal abbreviations, commonly observed in Foursquare check-ins. The time-aware POI tagger, based on the Conditional Random Field CRF model, is devised to disambiguate the POI mentions and to resolve their associated temporal awareness accordingly. Three sets of contextual features linguistic, temporal, and inventory features and two labeling schema features OP and BILOU schemas are explored for the time-aware POI extraction task. Our empirical study shows that the subtask of POI disambiguation and the subtask of temporal awareness resolution call for different feature settings for best performance. We have also evaluated the proposed TS-Petar against several strong baseline methods. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage approach achieves the best accuracy and outperforms all baseline methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.},

The best state-of-the-art approaches require training data in order to learn thresholds for deciding when to group the webpages. However, the ambiguity level of person names on the web could not be previously estimated and the results of those methods strongly depend on the thresholds obtained with the training collections. We present the concept of adaptive threshold, which avoids the need of a previous supervised learning process, depending only on the content of the compared documents to decide if they refer to the same person. We evaluated our approach using three datasets reaching close results to those obtained by the most successful algorithms in the state-of-the-art that require such a learning process, and outperforming the results of those obtained by algorithms that do not require it.},

abstract = {As the field of digital preservation DP matures, there is an increasing need to systematically assess an organization's abilities to achieve its digital preservation goals, and a wide variety of assessment tools have been created for this purpose. This article aims to map the landscape of research in this area, evaluate the current maturity of knowledge on this central question in DP and provide direction for future research. To do so, this paper reviews assessment frameworks in digital preservation through a systematic literature search and categorizes the literature by type of research. The analysis shows that publication output around assessment in digital preservation has increased markedly over time, but most existing work focuses on developing new models rather than rigorous evaluation and validation of existing frameworks. Significant gaps are present in the application of robust conceptual foundations and design methods, and in the level of empirical evidence available to enable the evaluation and validation of assessment models. The analysis and comparison with other fields suggest that the design of assessment models in DP should be studied rigorously in both theory and practice, and that the development of future models will benefit from applying existing methods, processes, and principles for model design.},

Seven reference librarians tested a set of protocols to determine whether it was possible to use the types and foci of the questions extracted from customer requests submitted to the National Library of Medicine to find authoritative answers to these questions. Librarians tested the protocols manually to determine if the process was sufficiently robust and accurate to later automate. Results indicated that the extracted terms provide enough information to find authoritative answers for about 60% of questions and that certain question types are more likely to result in authoritative answers than others. The question corpus and analysis performed for this project will inform automatic question answering systems, and could lead to suggestions for new content to include in MedlinePlus. This approach can serve as an example to researchers interested in methods of evaluating question answering tools and the contents of online databases.},

This study aimed to bridge the gap by exploring i the relationship between task complexity and difficulty; ii factors affecting task difficulty; and iii the relationship between task difficulty, task complexity, and user search behaviors in MIR. An empirical user experiment was conducted with 51 participants and a novel MIR system. The participants searched for 6 topics across 3 complexity levels. The results revealed that i perceived task difficulty in music search is influenced by task complexity, user background, system affordances, and task uncertainty and enjoyability; and ii perceived task difficulty in MIR is significantly correlated with effectiveness metrics such as the number of songs found, number of clicks, and task completion time. The findings have implications for the design of music search tasks in research or use cases in system development as well as future MIR systems that can detect task difficulty based on user effectiveness metrics.},

We propose a nomological model of online serendipity experiences, conceptualizing both cognitive and behavioral antecedents. Based on a survey of 1,173 German Internet users, we conduct structural equation modeling and multigroup analyses to differentiate the antecedents and effects of serendipity across three distinct contexts: online shopping, information services, and social networking sites. Our findings confirm that antecedents and outcomes of digital serendipity vary by context, with serendipity only being associated with user satisfaction in the context of social network sites.},

abstract = {This article reviews the ways in which the work and ideas of political philosopher John Rawls have been appropriated or applied by scholars of information science, technology, and related areas since 1990. The article begins with an overview of Rawls's work, paying particular attention to its foundations and methods. Subsequently, a 2-phase discussion of the literature is presented. The first phase reviews engagements with Rawls from more than 150 scholarly articles from databases and journals dedicated to information and technology ethics, information/technology studies, philosophy of technology, and technology and human values. The second phase focuses on scholars who have demonstrated a significant commitment to Rawlsian theory in these areas. Overall, the review demonstrates that most significant applications of Rawls are oriented toward unequal distributions of informational goods exacerbated by advanced information and communication technologies ICTs. Critically, however, scholars in this area have overlooked the relevance of Rawls's foundations for the sorts of complex networked relationships afforded by those same advanced ICTs. Rather than representing a fatal gap, it opens up a new avenue for the renewed consideration of Rawls-his ideas on the basic structure of society and the importance of self-respect are offered as 2 possible paths forward.},

Such scholarship promotes reuse of digital data, provokes new research questions, and cultivates new audiences. Digital curation, the process of managing a trusted body of information for current and future use, helps maximize the value of research in digital humanities. Predicated on semistructured interviews, this naturalistic case study explores the creation, use, storage, and planned reuse of data by 45 interviewees involved with 19 Office of Digital Humanities Start-Up Grant SUG projects. Interviewees grappled with challenges surrounding data, collaboration and communication, planning and project management, awareness and outreach, resources, and technology. Overall this study explores the existing digital curation practices and needs of scholars engaged in innovative digital humanities work and to discern how closely these practices and needs align with the digital curation literature.},

We measured referee behavior and referees' agreement. We found that the disciplinary background and the academic status of the referee have an influence on the report time, the type of recommendation and the acceptance of the reviewing task. Referees from the humanities tend to be more generous in their recommendations than other referees, especially economists and environmental scientists. Second, we found that senior researchers are harsher in their judgments than junior researchers, and the latter accept requests to review more often and are faster in reporting. Finally, we found that articles that had been refereed and recommended for publication by a multidisciplinary set of referees were subsequently more likely to receive citations than those that had been reviewed by referees from the same discipline. Our results show that common standards of evaluation can be established even in multidisciplinary communities.},

abstract = {Histories of information help clarify the values and intellectual commitments of the discipline. This study takes a rhetorical history approach to better understand the development of information studies as a discipline. Information studies historians have identified that the Cold War period was critical for the development of information science and consequently of its modern-day incarnations. Due to post-World War II prosperity, the 1960s saw a surge in interest in scientific and technical information. Many from government, education, and private sectors took interest in developing new ways to compete with Soviet science. This interest led to the National Science Foundation NSF-funded Georgia Tech conferences of 1961 and 1962, which are analyzed here. I find that concerns about the "science information problem" provided language that was critical for transforming some of the information studies' central concepts. In particular, I find that the idea of an "information scientist" was made possible by national funding for science information. I suggest that attending to the discursive traffic between public and disciplinary discourse of information studies can better attune the field to its intellectual commitments.},

abstract = {Journal rankings, frequently determined by the journal impact factor or similar indices, are quantitative measures for evaluating a journal's performance in its discipline, which is presently a major research thrust in the bibliometrics field. Recently, text mining was adopted to augment journal ranking-based evaluation with the content analysis of a discipline taking a time-variant factor into consideration. However, previous studies focused mainly on a silo analysis of a discipline using either citation-or content-oriented approaches, and no attempt was made to analyze topical journal ranking and its change over time in a seamless and integrated manner. To address this issue, we propose a journal-time-topic model, an extension of Dirichlet multinomial regression, which we applied to the field of bioinformatics to understand journal contribution to topics in a field and the shift of topic trends. The journal-time-topic model allows us to identify which journals are the major leaders in what topics and the manner in which their topical focus. It also helps reveal an interesting distinct pattern in the journal impact factor of high- and low-ranked journals. The study results shed a new light for understanding topic specific journal rankings and shifts in journals' concentration on a subject.},

abstract = {The domain of cultural variations in interpersonal communication is becoming increasingly important in various areas, including human-human interaction e.g., business settings and human-computer interaction e.g., during simulations, or with social robots. User-generated content UGC in social media can provide an invaluable source of culturally diverse viewpoints for supporting the understanding of cultural variations. However, discovering and organizing UGC is notoriously challenging and laborious for humans, especially in ill-defined domains such as culture. This calls for computational approaches to automate the UGC sensemaking process by using tagging, linking, and exploring. Semantic technologies allow automated structuring and qualitative analysis of UGC, but are dependent on the availability of an ontology representing the main concepts in a specific domain. For the domain of cultural variations in interpersonal communication, no ontological model exists. This paper presents the first such ontological model, called AMOn+, which defines cultural variations and enables tagging culture-related mentions in textual content. AMOn+ is designed based on a novel interdisciplinary approach that combines theoretical models of culture with crowdsourced knowledge DBpedia. An evaluation of AMOn+ demonstrated its fitness-for-purpose regarding domain coverage for annotating culture-related concepts mentioned in text corpora. This ontology can underpin computational models for making sense of UGC.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet and its applications, growing volumes of documents increasingly become interconnected to form large-scale document networks. Accordingly, topic modeling in a network of documents has been attracting continuous research attention. Most of the existing network-based topic models assume that topics in a document are influenced by its directly linked neighbouring documents in a document network and overlook the potential influence from indirectly linked ones. The existing work also has not carefully modeled variations of such influence among neighboring documents. Recognizing these modeling limitations, this paper introduces a novel Local Context-Aware LDA Model LC-LDA, which is capable of observing a local context comprising a rich collection of documents that may directly or indirectly influence the topic distributions of a target document. The proposed model can also differentiate the respective influence of each document in the local context on the target document according to both structural and temporal relationships between the two documents. The proposed model is extensively evaluated through multiple document clustering and classification tasks conducted over several large-scale document sets. Evaluation results clearly and consistently demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the new model with respect to several state-of-the-art peer models.},

abstract = {This study aims to identify different styles of personal digital information categorization based on the mindscape of the categorizers. To collect data, a questionnaire, a diary study, and 2 semistructured interviews were conducted with each of 18 participants. Then a content analysis was used to analyze the data. Based on the analysis of the data, this study identified 3 different types of categorizers: i rigid categorizers, ii fuzzy categorizers, and iii flexible categorizers. This study provides a unique way to understand personal information categorization by showing how it reflects the mindscapes of the categorizers. In particular, this study explains why people organize their personal information differently and have different tendencies in developing and maintaining their organizational structures. The findings provide insights on different ways of categorizing personal information and deepen our knowledge of categorization, personal information management, and information behavior. In practice, understanding different types of personal digital information categorization can make contributions to the development of systems, tools, and applications that support effective personal digital information categorization.},

We compare both the processes of conducting these analyses and the results they produce to derive insights about each method's unique advantages and drawbacks, as well as the broader roles that these methods play in the respective fields where they are often used. These insights allow us to make more informed decisions about the tradeoffs in choosing different methods for analyzing textual data.

These different areas of knowledge have different restrictions on use of vocabulary; thesauri are used only in information search and retrieval contexts, whereas lexicons are mental systems and generally applicable in all domains of life. A set of vocabulary requirements that defines the more concrete characteristics of vocabulary items in the 2 contexts can be derived from this framework: lexicon items have to be learnable, complex, transparent, etc., whereas thesaurus terms must be effective, current and relevant, searchable, etc. The differences in vocabulary properties correlate with 2 other factors, the well-known dimension of Control deliberate, social activities of building and maintaining vocabularies, and Syntagmatization, which is less known and describes vocabulary items' varying formal preparedness to exit the thesaurus/lexicon, enter into linear syntactic constructions, and, finally, acquire communicative functionality. It is proposed that there is an inverse relationship between Control and Syntagmatization.},

Up to now, research has mainly focused on the evaluation of webpages, while the evaluation of SERPs received less attention. Furthermore, task complexity is often not taken into account. A within-subjects design was used to study the influence of task complexity on search query formulation, evaluation of search results, and task performance. Three search tasks were used: a fact-finding, cause-effect, and a controversial topic task. To measure perceptual search processes, we used a combination of log files, eye-tracking data, answer forms, and think-aloud protocols. The results reveal that an increase in task complexity results in more search queries and used keywords, more time to formulate search queries, and more considered search results on the SERPs. Furthermore, higher ranked search results were considered more often than lower ranked results. However, not all the results for the most complex task were in line with expectations. These conflicting results can be explained by a lack of prior knowledge and the possible interference of prior attitudes.},

abstract = {In the information science literature, recent studies have used patent databases and patent classification information to construct network maps of patent technology classes. In such a patent technology map, almost all pairs of technology classes are connected, whereas most of the connections between them are extremely weak. This observation suggests the possibility of filtering the patent network map by removing weak links. However, removing links may reduce the explanatory power of the network on inventor or organization diversification. The network links may explain the patent portfolio diversification paths of inventors and inventing organizations. We measure the diversification explanatory power of the patent network map, and present a method to objectively choose an optimal tradeoff between explanatory power and removing weak links. We show that this method can remove a degree of arbitrariness compared with previous filtering methods based on arbitrary thresholds, and also identify previous filtering methods that created filters outside the optimal tradeoff. The filtered map aims to aid in network visualization analyses of the technological diversification of inventors, organizations, and other innovation agents, and potential foresight analysis. Such applications to a prolific inventor Leonard Forbes and company Google are demonstrated.},

However, concerns remain over unequal technological access in our society, as political resources available on the internet empower those with the resources and motivation to take advantage of them, leaving those who are disengaged farther behind. Hence, those who face digital inequalities are not only deprived of the benefits of the so-called Information Society, they are also deprived of exercising their civic rights. To promote political engagement among the marginalized, we analyze different sociotechnical factors that may play a role in promoting their inclusion in future political activities. We employed a survey for marginalized communities to analyze a set of research questions relating to sociotechnical factors. We show that online content creation, digital freedom, and access to the mobile Internet may positively impact political engagement. The development of these factors may not only promote the inclusion of marginalized populations in future political events, but also help to build a more equal society where everyone's voice has a chance to be heard.},

The present study contributes a detailed analysis of the query behavior of 10 students as they completed assigned exercises during a semester-long course on expert search. Detailed query logs were coded for three dimensions of query expression: the information structure searched, the type of query term used, and intent of the query with respect to specificity. Patterns of query formulation were found to evidence a progression of instruction, suggesting that the students gained knowledge of fundamental system-independent constructs that underlie expert search, and that domain-independent search expertise may be defined as the ability to use these constructs.

abstract = {The practice of citation is foundational for the propagation of knowledge along with scientific development and it is one of the core aspects on which scholarship and scientific publishing rely. Within the broad context of data citation, we focus on the automatic construction of citations problem for hierarchically structured data. We present the "learning to cite" framework, which enables the automatic construction of human- and machine-readable citations with different levels of coarseness. The main goal is to reduce the human intervention on data to a minimum and to provide a citation system general enough to work on heterogeneous and complex XML data sets. We describe how this framework can be realized by a system for creating citations to single nodes within an XML data set and, as a use case, show how it can be applied in the context of digital archives. We conduct an extensive evaluation of the proposed citation system by analyzing its effectiveness from the correctness and completeness viewpoints, showing that it represents a suitable solution that can be easily employed in real-world environments and that reduces human intervention on data to a minimum.},

abstract = {The Internet has triggered transformational change in the dissemination of science in the form of a global transition to open access OA publishing. Heavy investment favoring Gold over Green OA has been associated with increased total publication costs, inequality of opportunity to publish, and concerns about integrity in science reporting. Notwithstanding current fluidity because of ongoing competition for market share between supporters of the major alternative publishing strategies, emerging trends indicate the need for material and human resources to be redirected away from Gold and toward Green OA. Doing so will reduce total publication costs, increase equality of access for authors and readers, and remove the financial incentives that have encouraged poor and corrupt publishing practices.},

This study seeks to facilitate a better understanding of digital humanities by studying the motivations and practices of digital humanists as information workers in the humanities. To this end, we observe information work through interviews with DH scholars about their work practices and through a survey of DH programs such as graduate degrees, certificates, minors, and training institutes. In this study we focus on how the goals behind methodology a link between theories and method surface in everyday DH work practices and in DH curricula in order to investigate if the critiques that have appeared in relation to DH information work are well founded and to suggest alternative narratives about information work in DH that will help advance the impact of the field in the humanities and beyond.},

A growing emphasis on open science and reproducibility is changing how authors cite and acknowledge "research infrastructures"-entities that are used as inputs to or as underlying foundations for scholarly research, including data sets, software packages, computational models, observational platforms, and computing facilities. At the same time, stakeholder interest in quantitative understanding of impact is spurring increased collection and analysis of metrics related to use of research infrastructures. This article reviews work spanning several decades on tracing and assessing the outcomes and impacts from these kinds of research infrastructures. We discuss how research infrastructures are identified and referenced by scholars in the research literature and how those references are being collected and analyzed for the purposes of evaluating impact. Synthesizing common features of a wide range of studies, we identify notable challenges that impede the analysis of impact metrics for research infrastructures and outline key open research questions that can guide future research and applications related to such metrics.},

abstract = {The knowledge workforce is changing: global economic factors, increasing professional specialization, and rapid technological advancements mean that more individuals than ever can be found working in independent, modular, and mobile arrangements. Little is known about professional information practices or actions outside of traditional, centralized offices; however, the dynamic, unconventional, and less stable mobile work context diverges substantially from this model, and presents significant challenges and opportunities for the accomplishing of work tasks. This article identifies 5 main information practices geared toward mobilizing work, based on in-depth interviews with 31 mobile knowledge workers MKWs. It then uses these 5 practices as starting points for beginning to delineate the context of mobile knowledge work. We find that the information practices and information contexts of MKWs are mutually constitutive: challenges and opportunities of their work arrangements are what enable the development of practices that continually reconstruct productive spatial, temporal, social, and material contexts for work. This article contributes to an empirical understanding of the information practices of an increasingly visible yet understudied population, and to a theoretical understanding of the contemporary mobile knowledge work information context.},

abstract = {The abundance of medical resources has encouraged the development of systems that allow for efficient searches of information in large medical image data sets. State-of-the-art image retrieval models are classified into three categories: content-based visual models, textual models, and combined models. Content-based models use visual features to answer image queries, textual image retrieval models use word matching to answer textual queries, and combined image retrieval models, use both textual and visual features to answer queries. Nevertheless, most of previous works in this field have used the same image retrieval model independently of the query type. In this article, we define a list of generic and specific medical query features and exploit them in an association rule mining technique to discover correlations between query features and image retrieval models. Based on these rules, we propose to use an associative classifier NaiveClass to find the best suitable retrieval model given a new textual query. We also propose a second associative classifier SmartClass to select the most appropriate default class for the query. Experiments are performed on Medical ImageCLEF queries from 2008 to 2012 to evaluate the impact of the proposed query features on the classification performance. The results show that combining our proposed specific and generic query features is effective in query classification.},

abstract = {Using visual analytic systems effectively may incur a steep learning curve for users, especially for those who have little prior knowledge of either using the tool or accomplishing analytic tasks. How do users deal with a steep learning curve over time? Are there particularly problematic aspects of an analytic process? In this article we investigate these questions through an integrative study of the use of CiteSpace-a visual analytic tool for finding trends and patterns in scientific literature. In particular, we analyze millions of interactive events in logs generated by users worldwide over a 14-month period. The key findings are: i three levels of proficiency are identified, namely, level 1: low proficiency, level 2: intermediate proficiency, and level 3: high proficiency, and ii behavioral patterns at level 3 are resulted from a more engaging interaction with the system, involving a wider variety of events and being characterized by longer state transition paths, whereas behavioral patterns at levels 1 and 2 seem to focus on learning how to use the tool. This study contributes to the development and evaluation of visual analytic systems in realistic settings and provides a valuable addition to the study of interactive visual analytic processes.},

We explore whether the peaks in the spectrograms generated by Reference Publication Years Spectroscopy RPYS indicate such long-term impact by comparing across RPYS for subsequent time intervals. Multi-RPYS enables us to distinguish between short-term citation peaks at the research front that decay within 10 years versus historically constitutive long-term citations that function as concept symbols. Using these constitutive citations, one is able to cluster document sets e.g., journals in terms of intellectually shared histories. We test this premise by clustering 40 journals in the Web of Science Category of Information and Library Science using multi-RPYS. It follows that RPYS can not only be used for retrieving roots of sets under study cited, but also for algorithmic historiography of the citing sets. Significant references are historically rooted symbols among other citations that function as currency.},

The results show gender differences in authorship in almost all categories and gender differences the level of interest in, and ratings of, books in a minority of categories. Perhaps surprisingly in this context, there is not a clear gender-based relationship between the success of an author and their prevalence within a genre. The unexpected almost universal authorship gender differences should give new impetus to investigations of the importance of gender in fiction and the success of minority genders in some genres should encourage publishers and librarians to take their work seriously, except perhaps for most male-authored chick-lit.},

We collected data on 22 information professionals in authentic work situations in three organization types: city administration, universities, and companies. The data comprise 286 WTs and 420 search tasks STs. The data include transaction logs, video recordings, daily questionnaires, interviews. and observation. The data were analyzed quantitatively. Even if the participants used a range of search media, most STs were simple throughout the data, and up to 42% of WTs did not include searching. WT's effects on STs are not straightforward: different WT types react differently to WT complexity. Due to the simplicity of authentic searching, the WT/ST types in interactive IR experiments should be reconsidered.},

To apply search tactics in the information retrieval IR processes, users make decisions and take actions in the search process, while IR systems assist them by providing different system features. After analyzing 61 participants' information searching diaries and questionnaires we identified various types of user involvement and system support in applying different types of search tactics. Based on quantitative analysis, search tactics were classified into 3 groups: user-dominated, system-dominated, and balanced tactics. We further explored types of user involvement and types of system support in applying search tactics from the 3 groups. The findings show that users and systems play major roles in applying user-dominated and system-dominated tactics, respectively. When applying balanced tactics, users and systems must collaborate closely with each other. In this article, we propose a model that illustrates user involvement and system support as they occur in user-dominated tactics, system-dominated tactics, and balanced tactics. Most important, IR system design implications are discussed to facilitate effective and efficient applications of the 3 groups of search tactics.},

We analyzed 829,924 articles that received 16,490,346 citations. The number of articles published through coauthorship accounts for 89%. The citation-based performance and coauthorship patterns exhibit a power-law correlation with a scaling exponent of 1.20±0.07. Citations to a subfield's research articles tended to increase 2.1.20 or 2.30 times each time it doubled the number of coauthored papers. The scaling exponent for the power-law relationship for single-authored papers was 0.85±0.11. The citations to a subfield's single-authored research articles increased 2.0.85 or 1.89 times each time the research area doubled the number of single-authored papers. The Matthew Effect is stronger for coauthored papers than for single-authored. In fact, with a scaling exponent &lt;1.0 the impact of single-authored papers exhibits a cumulative disadvantage or inverse Matthew Effect.},

One topic discussed vehemently online that could benefit from this type of analysis is vaccines. We carried out a study analyzing the web presence of both sides of this debate. We collected a variety of webometric data and analyzed the data both quantitatively and qualitatively. The study found far more anti- than pro-vaccine web domains. The anti and pro sides had similar web visibility as measured by the number of links coming from general websites and Tweets. However, the links to the pro domains were of higher quality measured by PageRank scores. The result from the qualitative content analysis confirmed this finding. The analysis of site ages revealed that the battle between the two sides had a long history and is still ongoing. The web scene was polarized with either pro or anti views and little neutral ground. The study suggests ways that professional information can be promoted more effectively on the web. The study demonstrates that webometrics analysis is effective in studying online information dissemination. This kind of analysis can be used to study not only health information but other information as well.},

abstract = {Prominent news sites on the web provide hundreds of news articles daily. The abundance of news content competing to attract online attention, coupled with the manual effort involved in article selection, necessitates the timely prediction of future popularity of these news articles. The future popularity of a news article can be estimated using signals indicating the article's penetration in social media e.g., number of tweets in addition to traditional web analytics e.g., number of page views. In practice, it is important to make such estimations as early as possible, preferably before the article is made available on the news site i.e., at cold start. In this paper we perform a study on cold-start news popularity prediction using a collection of 13,319 news articles obtained from Yahoo News, a major news provider. We characterize the popularity of news articles through a set of online metrics and try to predict their values across time using machine learning techniques on a large collection of features obtained from various sources. Our findings indicate that predicting news popularity at cold start is a difficult task, contrary to the findings of a prior work on the same topic. Most articles' popularity may not be accurately anticipated solely on the basis of content features, without having the early-stage popularity values.},

Portable, web-enabled music devices are widespread, and listeners now enjoy a plethora of options regarding formats, devices, and access methods. Yet in this mobile music environment, listeners' access and management strategies for music collections are poorly understood, because behaviors surrounding the organization and retrieval of music collections have received little formal study. Our current research seeks to enrich our knowledge of people's music listening and collecting behavior through a series of systematic user studies. In this paper we present our findings from interviews involving 20 adult and 20 teen users of commercial cloud music services. Our results contribute to theoretical understandings of users' music information behavior in a time of upheaval in music usage patterns, and more generally, the purposes and meanings users ascribe to personal media collections in cloud-based systems. The findings suggest improvements to the future design of cloud-based music services, as well as to any information systems and services designed for personal media collections, benefiting both commercial entities and listeners.},

The exercise was carried out in order to assess whether these highly sophisticated, state-of-the-art filters can distinguish between papers that are controversial or have gone past their "sell-by date," and otherwise normal papers. We conclude that not even the arXiv filters, which are otherwise successful in filtering fringe-topic papers, can fully acquire "Domain-Specific Discrimination" and thus distinguish technical papers that are taken seriously by an expert community from those that are not. Finally, we discuss the implications this has for citizen and policy-maker engagement with the Primary Source Knowledge of a technical domain.},

abstract = {To understand the current state of a discipline and to discover new knowledge of a certain theme, one builds bibliometric content networks based on the present knowledge entities. However, such networks can vary according to the collection of data sets relevant to the theme by querying knowledge entities. In this study we classify three different bibliometric content networks. The primary bibliometric network is based on knowledge entities relevant to a keyword of the theme, the secondary network is based on entities associated with the lower concepts of the keyword, and the tertiary network is based on entities influenced by the theme. To explore the content and properties of these networks, we propose a tomographic content analysis that takes a slice-and-dice approach to analyzing the networks. Our findings indicate that the primary network is best suited to understanding the current knowledge on a certain topic, whereas the secondary network is good at discovering new knowledge across fields associated with the topic, and the tertiary network is appropriate for outlining the current knowledge of the topic and relevant studies.},

Applying text mining techniques and social network analysis to data from various sources, our research revealed how the iSchool community gradually built its own identity over time, including the growing number of faculty members who received their doctorates from the field that studies information, the deviation from computer science and library science, the rising emphasis on the intersection of information, technology, and people, and the increasing educational and research homogeneity as a community.

Yet, the true nature of citations and their proper interpretation have been the center of a long, but still unresolved discussion in Bibliometrics. A comparison of 67,578 pairs of studies on the same healthcare topic, with the same publication age 1-15 years reveals that when one of the studies is being selected for citation, it has on average received about three times as many citations as the other study. However, the average citation-gap between selected or deselected studies narrows slightly over time, which fits poorly with the name-dropping interpretation and better with the quality and impact-interpretation. The results demonstrate that authors in the field of Healthcare tend to cite highly cited documents when they have a choice. This is more likely caused by differences related to quality than differences related to status of the publications cited.},

To this end, we conducted a large-scale user study with 86 participants who evaluated 2 different queries and 4 diverse result sets twice with an interval of 2 months. To analyze the results we investigate whether 2 types of patterns of user behavior from the theory of categorical thinking hold for the case of evaluation of search results: a coarseness and b locality. To quantify these patterns we devised 2 new measures of change in user judgements and distinguish between local when users swap between close ranks and relevance values and nonlocal changes. Two types of judgements were considered in this study: a relevance on a 4-point scale, and b ranking on a 10-point scale without ties. We found that users tend to change their judgements of the results over time in about 50% of cases for relevance and in 85% of cases for ranking. However, the majority of these changes were local.},

The longitudinal dimension of this study offers unique possibilities to see how users used the 3 different approaches over time. Various user information-seeking patterns and trends are identified through the query usage pattern analysis and session analysis. The study identified different user groups and found that a majority of the users tend to stick to their favorite information-seeking approach to meet their immediate information needs and do not seem to care whether alternative search options will offer greater benefits. The study also found that return users used CBR searching much more frequently than 1-time users and tend to use more query terms to look for information than 1-time users.},

This article seeks to address this gap through an international and interdisciplinary survey of academics. Issues covered include: use of and intentions regarding OAP, and perceptions regarding advantages and disadvantages of OAP, journal article publication services, peer review, and reuse. Despite reporting engagement in OAP, academics were unsure about their future intentions regarding OAP. Broadly, academics identified the potential for wider circulation as the key advantage of OAP, and were more positive about its benefits than they were negative about its disadvantages. As regards services, rigorous peer review, followed by rapid publication were most valued. Academics reported strong views on reuse of their work; they were relatively happy with noncommercial reuse, but not in favor of commercial reuse, adaptations, and inclusion in anthologies. Comparing science, technology, and medicine with arts, humanities, and social sciences showed a significant difference in attitude on a number of questions, but, in general, the effect size was small, suggesting that attitudes are relatively consistent across the academic community.},

Although researchers have attempted to explain the effect of SNS use on users' psychological well-being, previous studies have produced inconsistent results. In addition, most previous studies relied on healthy students as participants; other cohorts of SNSs users, in particular people living with serious health conditions, have been neglected. In this study, we carried out semistructured interviews with users of the Ovarian Cancer Australia OCA Facebook to assess how and in what ways SNS use impacts their psychological well-being. A theoretical model was proposed to develop a better understanding of the relationships between SNS use and the psychological well-being of cancer patients. Analysis of data collected through a subsequent quantitative survey confirmed the theoretical model and empirically revealed the extent to which SNS use impacts the psychological well-being of cancer patients. Findings showed the use of OCA Facebook enhances social support, enriches the experience of social connectedness, develops social presence and learning and ultimately improves the psychological well-being of cancer patients.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to systematically assess sources' e.g., journals and proceedings impact in knowledge trading. While there have been efforts at evaluating different aspects of journal impact, the dimension of knowledge trading is largely absent. To fill the gap, this study employed a set of trading-based indicators, including weighted degree centrality, Shannon entropy, and weighted betweenness centrality, to assess sources' trading impact. These indicators were applied to several time-sliced source-to-source citation networks that comprise 33,634 sources indexed in the Scopus database. The results show that several interdisciplinary sources, such as Nature, PLoS One, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and Science, and several specialty sources, such as Lancet, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Journal of the American Chemical Society, Journal of Biological Chemistry, and New England Journal of Medicine, have demonstrated their marked importance in knowledge trading. Furthermore, this study also reveals that, overall, sources have established more trading partners, increased their trading volumes, broadened their trading areas, and diversified their trading contents over the past 15 years from 1997 to 2011. These results inform the understanding of source-level impact assessment and knowledge diffusion.},

abstract = {On August 8, 2016, a story appeared on the top page of Yahoo that read "Trump: You people really believed me?" It was written by Walker Lundy of the Charlotte Observer in Charlotte, NC, USA on August 6, 2016. The article was shocking, even to a non-U.S. citizen, because it revealed the sudden, and unexpected, withdrawal of Donald J. Trump from the U.S. Presidential race, which would surely have been welcome news for the Hillary Clinton camp. Less than 24 hours later, that article could no longer be traced on Yahoo, and the original links led to a 404 error. The original story is still published on another Charlotte Observer webpage. National and independent polls related to the presidential election fluctuate, but pollsters are always influenced by news events related to either candidate. Yet, one has to wonder why Mr. Lundy would have published a false and misleading story, which was widely circulated, including by the powerful media engine Yahoo, that has serious national and international consequences. Some of the policies espoused by both presidential candidates are radically different, and thus any media story that can tilt the opinion of readers in the direction of one or other candidate needs to be carefully analyzed. Sowing doubt by using false or misleading journalism does not do the public any favors and casts a doubtful light on the practice of political journalism. The Charlotte Observer and Mr. Lundy failed to respond to a request for comment.},

Does topic modeling provide an alternative for co-word mapping in research practices using moderately sized document collections? We return to the word/document matrix using first a single text with a strong argument "The Leiden Manifesto" and then upscale to a sample of moderate size n=687 to study the pros and cons of the two approaches in terms of the resulting possibilities for making semantic maps that can serve an argument. The results from co-word mapping using two different routines versus topic modeling are significantly uncorrelated. Whereas components in the co-word maps can easily be designated, the topic models provide sets of words that are very differently organized. In these samples, the topic models seem to reveal similarities other than semantic ones e.g., linguistic ones. In other words, topic modeling does not replace co-word mapping in small and medium-sized sets; but the paper leaves open the possibility that topic modeling would work well for the semantic mapping of large sets.},

Findings show high recall around 93% of WoS funding data. By contrast, MEDLINE/PubMed data retrieved less than half of the UK cancer publications acknowledging at least one funder. Conversely, both databases have high precision +90%: That is, few cases of publications with no acknowledgment to funders are identified as having funding data. Nonetheless, funders acknowledged in UK cancer publications were not correctly listed by MEDLINE/PubMed and WoS in around 75% and 32% of the cases, respectively. Reference data on the UK cancer research funding system are used as a case study to demonstrate the utility of funding data for strategic intelligence applications e.g., mapping of funding landscape and co-funding activity, comparison of funders' research portfolios.},

abstract = {Tags keywords freely assigned by users to describe web content have become highly popular on Web 2.0 applications, because of the strong stimuli and easiness for users to create and describe their own content. This increase in tag popularity has led to a vast literature on tag recommendation methods. These methods aim at assisting users in the tagging process, possibly increasing the quality of the generated tags and, consequently, improving the quality of the information retrieval IR services that rely on tags as data sources. Regardless of the numerous and diversified previous studies on tag recommendation, to our knowledge, no previous work has summarized and organized them into a single survey article. In this article, we propose a taxonomy for tag recommendation methods, classifying them according to the target of the recommendations, their objectives, exploited data sources, and underlying techniques. Moreover, we provide a critical overview of these methods, pointing out their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we describe the main open challenges related to the field, such as tag ambiguity, cold start, and evaluation issues.},

abstract = {Personalized search approaches tailor search results to users' current interests, so as to help improve the likelihood of a user finding relevant documents for their query. Previous work on personalized search focuses on using the content of the user's query and of the documents clicked to model the user's preference. In this paper we focus on a different type of signal: We investigate the use of behavioral information for the purpose of search personalization. That is, we consider clicks and dwell time for reranking an initially retrieved list of documents. In particular, we i investigate the impact of distributions of users and queries on document reranking; ii estimate the relevance of a document for a query at 2 levels, at the query-level and at the word-level, to alleviate the problem of sparseness; and iii perform an experimental evaluation both for users seen during the training period and for users not seen during training. For the latter, we explore the use of information from similar users who have been seen during the training period. We use the dwell time on clicked documents to estimate a document's relevance to a query, and perform Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization to generate a relevance distribution of a document over queries. Our experiments show that: i for personalized ranking, behavioral information helps to improve retrieval effectiveness; and ii given a query, merging information inferred from behavior of a particular user and from behaviors of other users with a user-dependent adaptive weight outperforms any combination with a fixed weight.},

abstract = {In 1965, Price foresaw the day when a citation-based taxonomy of science and technology would be delineated and correspondingly used for science policy. A taxonomy needs to be comprehensive and accurate if it is to be useful for policy making, especially now that policy makers are utilizing citation-based indicators to evaluate people, institutions and laboratories. Determining the accuracy of a taxonomy, however, remains a challenge. Previous work on the accuracy of partition solutions is sparse, and the results of those studies, although useful, have not been definitive. In this study we compare the accuracies of topic-level taxonomies based on the clustering of documents using direct citation, bibliographic coupling, and co-citation. Using a set of new gold standards-articles with at least 100 references-we find that direct citation is better at concentrating references than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. Using the assumption that higher concentrations of references denote more accurate clusters, direct citation thus provides a more accurate representation of the taxonomy of scientific and technical knowledge than either bibliographic coupling or co-citation. We also find that discipline-level taxonomies based on journal schema are highly inaccurate compared to topic-level taxonomies, and recommend against their use.},

abstract = {Goodreads is an Amazon-owned book-based social web site for members to share books, read, review books, rate books, and connect with other readers. Goodreads has tens of millions of book reviews, recommendations, and ratings that may help librarians and readers to select relevant books. This article describes a first investigation of the properties of Goodreads users, using a random sample of 50,000 members. The results suggest that about three quarters of members with a public profile are female, and that there is little difference between male and female users in patterns of behavior, except for females registering more books and rating them less positively. Goodreads librarians and super-users engage extensively with most features of the site. The absence of strong correlations between book-based and social usage statistics e.g., numbers of friends, followers, books, reviews, and ratings suggests that members choose their own individual balance of social and book activities and rarely ignore one at the expense of the other. Goodreads is therefore neither primarily a book-based website nor primarily a social network site but is a genuine hybrid, social navigation site.},

abstract = {Data reuse refers to the secondary use of data-not for its original purpose but for studying new problems. Although reusing data might not yet be the norm in every discipline, the benefits of reusing shared data have been asserted by a number of researchers, and data reuse has been a major concern in many disciplines. Assessing data for trustworthiness becomes important in data reuse with the growth in data creation because of the lack of standards for ensuring data quality and potential harm from using poor-quality data. This research explores many facets of data reusers' trust in data generated by other researchers focusing on the trust judgment process with influential factors that determine reusers' trust. The author took an interpretive qualitative approach by using in-depth semistructured interviews as the primary research method. The study results suggest different stages of trust development associated with the process of data reuse. Data reusers' trust may remain the same throughout their experiences, but it can also be formed, lost, declined, and recovered during their data reuse experiences. These various stages reflect the dynamic nature of trust.},

abstract = {In recent years, the relationship of collaboration among scientists and the citation impact of papers have been frequently investigated. Most of the studies show that the two variables are closely related: An increasing collaboration activity measured in terms of number of authors, number of affiliations, and number of countries is associated with an increased citation impact. However, it is not clear whether the increased citation impact is based on the higher quality of papers that profit from more than one scientist giving expert input or other citation-specific factors. Thus, the current study addresses this question by using two comprehensive data sets with publications in the biomedical area including quality assessments by experts F1000Prime member scores and citation data for the publications. The study is based on more than 15,000 papers. Robust regression models are used to investigate the relationship between number of authors, number of affiliations, and number of countries, respectively, and citation impact-controlling for the papers' quality measured by F1000Prime expert ratings. The results point out that the effect of collaboration activities on impact is largely independent of the papers' quality. The citation advantage is apparently not quality related; citation-specific factors e.g., self-citations seem to be important here.},

However, these solutions besides being very expensive and having scalability problems, also may not benefit from eventual manual corrections, as they may be lost whenever the process of disambiguating the entire repository is required. In the real world, in which repositories are updated on a daily basis, incremental solutions that disambiguate only the newly introduced citation records, are likely to produce improved results in the long run. However, the problem of incremental author name disambiguation has been largely neglected in the literature. In this article we present a new author name disambiguation method, specially designed for the incremental scenario. In our experiments, our new method largely outperforms recent incremental proposals reported in the literature as well as the current state-of-the-art non-incremental method.},

abstract = {Understanding relative statures of channels for disseminating knowledge is of practical interest to both generators and consumers of knowledge flows. For generators, stature can influence attractiveness of alternative dissemination routes and deliberations of those who assess generator performance. For knowledge consumers, channel stature may influence knowledge content to which they are exposed. This study introduces a novel approach to conceptualizing and measuring stature of knowledge-dissemination channels: the power-impact PI technique. It is a flexible technique having 3 complementary variants, giving holistic insights about channel stature by accounting for both attraction of knowledge generators to a distribution channel and degree to which knowledge consumers choose to use a channel's knowledge content. Each PI variant is expressed in terms of multiple parameters, permitting customization of stature evaluation to suit its user's preferences. In the spirit of analytics, each PI variant is driven by objective evidence of actual behaviors. The PI technique is based on 2 building blocks: a power that channels have for attracting results of generators' knowledge work, and b impact that channel contents' exhibit on prospective recipients. Feasibility and functionality of the PI-technique design are demonstrated by applying it to solve a problem of journal stature evaluation for the information-systems discipline.},

Second, even though the references from the more recent articles generally cover a longer time span, the newer articles are cited more frequently than the older ones if the uneven article growth is not corrected for. Nevertheless, despite this change in the distribution of citations, the citation behavior of scientists does not seem to have changed.},

abstract = {In this article we evaluate context-aware recommendation systems for information re-finding by knowledge workers. We identify 4 criteria that are relevant for evaluating the quality of knowledge worker support: context relevance, document relevance, prediction of user action, and diversity of the suggestions. We compare 3 different context-aware recommendation methods for information re-finding in a writing support task. The first method uses contextual prefiltering and content-based recommendation CBR, the second uses the just-in-time information retrieval paradigm JITIR, and the third is a novel network-based recommendation system where context is part of the recommendation model CIA. We found that each method has its own strengths: CBR is strong at context relevance, JITIR captures document relevance well, and CIA achieves the best result at predicting user action. Weaknesses include that CBR depends on a manual source to determine the context and in JITIR the context query can fail when the textual content is not sufficient. We conclude that to truly support a knowledge worker, all 4 evaluation criteria are important. In light of that conclusion, we argue that the network-based approach the CIA offers has the highest robustness and flexibility for context-aware information recommendation.},

Opinion mining, also known as sentiment analysis, has received a lot of attention in recent times, as it provides a number of tools to analyze public opinion on a number of different topics. Comparative opinion mining is a subfield of opinion mining which deals with identifying and extracting information that is expressed in a comparative form e.g., "paper X is better than the Y". Comparative opinion mining plays a very important role when one tries to evaluate something because it provides a reference point for the comparison. This paper provides a review of the area of comparative opinion mining. It is the first review that cover specifically this topic as all previous reviews dealt mostly with general opinion mining. This survey covers comparative opinion mining from two different angles. One from the perspective of techniques and the other from the perspective of comparative opinion elements. It also incorporates preprocessing tools as well as data set that were used by past researchers that can be useful to future researchers in the field of comparative opinion mining.},

In August 2012, an online survey was used to inquire about the reading behavior and preference of 1,755 participants, ranging in age from 18 to 69 years. The participants contained equal numbers of men and women from five age brackets. Our main finding was that approximately 70% of total reading time was spent on digital media and that preferences favored print media. Cluster analysis of reading time by media was used to categorize respondents into eight clusters, and a second cluster analysis on stated preference digital or print yielded six clusters. The correspondence analysis between reading behavior clusters and preference clusters revealed that there is a mismatch between reading behavior and stated preference for either print or digital media.},

Anonymity policies have been a subject of debate for several decades within scholarly communities. Because of widespread criticism of traditional peer-review processes, a variety of new peer-review processes have emerged that manage the trade-offs between disclosure and concealment of identities in different ways. Based on an analysis of policies and guidelines for authors and reviewers provided by publication venues, we developed a framework for understanding how disclosure and concealment of identities is managed. We discuss the appropriate role of information technology and computer support for the peer-review process within that framework.},

We found that most users focus on stories that interest them and that even casual news readers engage in story-focused reading. During story-focused reading, users spend more time reading and a larger number of news sites are involved. In addition, readers employ different strategies to find articles related to a story. We also analyze how news sites promote story-focused reading by looking at how they link their articles to related content published by them, or by other sources. The results show that providing links to related content leads to a higher engagement of the users, and that this is the case even for links to external sites. We also show that the performance of links can be affected by their type, their position, and how many of them are present within an article.},

Yet little is known about the influences on these and ways in which academics might manage this approach to dissemination. Three groups of papers by academics in a center for speech-language-science available through a university repository were compared. The first group of target papers were blogged, and the blogs were systematically tweeted. The second group of connected control papers were nonblogged papers that we carefully matched for author, topic, and year of publication. The third group were papers by different staff members on a variety of topics-Unrelated Control Papers. The results suggest an effect of social media on download rate, which was limited not just to Target Papers but also generalized to Connected Control Papers. Unrelated Control Papers showed no increase over the same amount of time main effect of time, F1,27=55.6, p&lt;.001; Significant Group\texttimes{}Time Interaction, F2,27=7.9, p=.002. The effect on citation rates was less clear but followed the same trend. The only predictor of the 2015 citation rate was downloads after blogging r=0.450, p=.012. These preliminary results suggest that promotion of academic articles via social media may enhance download and citation rate and that this has implications for impact strategies.},

abstract = {Individual academics and research evaluators often need to assess the value of published research. Although citation counts are a recognized indicator of scholarly impact, alternative data is needed to provide evidence of other types of impact, including within education and wider society. Wikipedia is a logical choice for both of these because the role of a general encyclopaedia is to be an understandable repository of facts about a diverse array of topics and hence it may cite research to support its claims. To test whether Wikipedia could provide new evidence about the impact of scholarly research, this article counted citations to 302,328 articles and 18,735 monographs in English indexed by Scopus in the period 2005 to 2012. The results show that citations from Wikipedia to articles are too rare for most research evaluation purposes, with only 5% of articles being cited in all fields. In contrast, a third of monographs have at least one citation from Wikipedia, with the most in the arts and humanities. Hence, Wikipedia citations can provide extra impact evidence for academic monographs. Nevertheless, the results may be relatively easily manipulated and so Wikipedia is not recommended for evaluations affecting stakeholder interests.},

abstract = {This investigation examines perceptions of normality emerging from two distinct studies of information behavior associated with life disrupting health symptoms and theorizes the search for normality in the context of sense making theory. Study I explored the experiences of women striving to make sense of symptoms associated with menopause; Study II examined posts from two online discussion groups for people with symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder. Joint data analysis demonstrates that normality was initially perceived as the absence of illness. A breakdown in perceived normality because of disruptive symptoms created gaps and discontinuities in understanding. As participants interacted with information about the experiences of health-challenged peers, socially constructed notions of normality emerged. This was internalized as a "new normal." Findings demonstrate normality as an element of sense making that changes and develops over time, and experiential information and social contexts as central to health-related sense making. Re-establishing perceptions of normality, as experienced by health-challenged peers, was an important element of sense making. This investigation provides nuanced insight into notions of normality, extends understanding of social processes involved in sense making, and represents the first theorizing of and model development for normality within the information science and sense making literature.},

abstract = {We performed an exploratory case study to understand how subject indexing performed by television production staff using a semicontrolled vocabulary affects indexing quality. In the study we used triangulation, combining tag analysis and semistructured interviews, with production staff of the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation. The main findings reveal incomplete indexing of TV programs and their parts, in addition to low indexing consistency and uneven indexing exhaustivity. The informants expressed low motivation and a high level of uncertainty regarding the task. Internal guidelines and high domain knowledge among the indexers does not form a sufficient basis for creating quality and consistency in the vocabulary. The challenges that are revealed in the terminological analysis, combined with low indexing knowledge and lack of motivation, will create difficulties in the retrieval phase.},

abstract = {The idea of constructing science maps based on bibliographic data has intrigued researchers for decades, and various techniques have been developed to map the structure of research disciplines. Most science mapping studies use a single method. However, as research fields have various properties, a valid map of a field should actually be composed of a set of maps derived from a series of investigations using different methods. That leads to the question of what can be learned from a combination-triangulation-of these different science maps. In this paper we propose a method for triangulation, using the example of water science. We combine three different mapping approaches: journal-journal citation relations JJCR, shared author keywords SAK, and title word-cited reference co-occurrence TWRC. Our results demonstrate that triangulation of JJCR, SAK, and TWRC produces a more comprehensive picture than each method applied individually. The outcomes from the three different approaches can be associated with each other and systematically interpreted to provide insights into the complex multidisciplinary structure of the field of water research.},

abstract = {The article presents three advanced citation-based methods used to detect potential breakthrough articles among very highly cited articles. We approach the detection of such articles from three different perspectives in order to provide different typologies of breakthrough articles. In all three cases we use the hierarchical classification of scientific publications developed at CWTS based on direct citation relationships. We assume that such contextualized articles focus on similar research interests. We utilize the characteristics scores and scales CSS approach to partition citation distributions and implement a specific filtering algorithm to sort out potential highly-cited "followers," articles not considered breakthroughs. After invoking thresholds and filtering, three methods are explored: A very exclusive one where only the highest cited article in a micro-cluster is considered as a potential breakthrough article M1; as well as two conceptually different methods, one that detects potential breakthrough articles among the 2% highest cited articles according to CSS M2a, and finally a more restrictive version where, in addition to the CSS 2% filter, knowledge diffusion is also considered M2b. The advance citation-based methods are explored and evaluated using validated publication sets linked to different Danish funding instruments including centers of excellence.},

abstract = {Citation measures, and newer altmetric measures such as downloads are now commonly used to inform personnel decisions. How well do or can these measures measure or predict the past, current, or future scholarly performance of an individual? Using data from the Smithsonian/NASA Astrophysics Data System we analyze the publication, citation, download, and distinction histories of a cohort of 922 individuals who received a U.S. PhD in astronomy in the period 1972-1976. By examining the same and different measures at the same and different times for the same individuals we are able to show the capabilities and limitations of each measure. Because the distributions are lognormal, measurement uncertainties are multiplicative; we show that in order to state with 95% confidence that one person's citations and downloads are significantly higher than another person's, the log difference in the ratio of counts must be at least 0.3dex, which corresponds to a multiplicative factor of 2.},

abstract = {Domain experts are skilled in buliding a narrow ontology that reflects their subfield of expertise based on their work experience and personal beliefs. We call this type of ontology a single-viewpoint ontology. There can be a variety of such single viewpoint ontologies that represent a wide spectrum of subfields and expert opinions on the domain. However, to have a complete formal vocabulary for the domain they need to be linked and unified into a multiviewpoint model while having the subjective viewpoint statements marked and distinguished from the objectively true statements. In this study, we propose and implement a two-phase methodology for multiviewpoint ontology construction by nonexpert users. The proposed methodology was implemented for the domain of the effect of diet on health. A large-scale crowdsourcing experiment was conducted with about 750 ontological statements to determine whether each of these statements is objectively true, viewpoint, or erroneous. Typically, in crowdsourcing experiments the workers are asked for their personal opinions on the given subject. However, in our case their ability to objectively assess others' opinions was examined as well. Our results show substantially higher accuracy in classification for the objective assessment approach compared to the results based on personal opinions.},
