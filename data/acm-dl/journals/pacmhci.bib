abstract = {Memory analysis tools are essential for finding and fixing anomalies in the memory usage of software systems (e.g., memory leaks). Although numerous tools are available, hardly any empirical studies exist on their usefulness for developers in typical usage scenarios. Instead, most evaluations are limited to reporting performance metrics. We thus conducted a study to empirically assess the usefulness of the interactive memory analysis tool AntTracks Analyzer. Specifically, we first report findings from assessing the tool using a cognitive walkthrough, guided by the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations Framework. We then present the results of a qualitative user study involving 14 subjects who used AntTracks to detect and resolve memory anomalies. We report lessons learned from the study and implications for developers of interactive memory analysis tools. We hope that our results will help researchers and developers of memory analysis tools in defining, selecting, and improving tool capabilities.},

abstract = {PDF forms are ubiquitous. Businesses big and small, government agencies, health and educational institutions and many others have all embraced PDF forms. People use PDF forms for providing information to these entities. But people who are blind frequently find it very difficult to fill out PDF forms with screen readers, the standard assistive software that they use for interacting with computer applications. Firstly, many of the them are not even accessible as they are non-interactive and hence not editable on a computer. Secondly, even if they are interactive, it is not always easy to associate the correct labels with the form fields, either because the labels are not meaningful or the sequential reading order of the screen reader misses the visual cues that associate the correct labels with the fields. In this paper we present a solution to the accessibility problem of PDF forms. We leverage the fact that many people with visual impairments are familiar with web browsing and are proficient at filling out web forms. Thus, we create a web form layer over the PDF form via a high fidelity transformation process that attempts to preserve all the spatial relationships of the PDF elements including forms, their labels and the textual content. Blind people only interact with the web forms, and the filled out web form fields are transparently transferred to the corresponding fields in the PDF form. An optimization algorithm automatically adjusts the length and width of the PDF fields to accommodate arbitrary size field data. This ensures that the filled out PDF document does not have any truncated form-field values, and additionally, it is readable. A user study with fourteen users with visual impairments revealed that they were able to populate more form fields than the status quo and the self-reported user experience with the proposed interface was superior compared to the status quo.},

abstract = {The increasing number and complexity of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) pave the way for fully automated driving. Automated vehicles are said to increase road safety and prevent human-made (fatal) accidents, amongst others. In the lower levels of automation, however, the driver is still responsible as a fallback authority. As a consequence, systems that reliably monitor the driver's state, especially the risk factor drowsiness, become increasingly essential to ensure the driver's ability to take over control from the vehicle on time. In research, the use of supervised machine learning for drowsiness detection is the prevalent method. As the ground truth for drowsiness is both application- and user-dependent, and no golden standard exists for its definition, measures are usually applied in the form of observer ratings. Also, in this work, observer ratings were investigated with regard to the required level of detail/complexity. To this end, video data, recorded within a simulator study (N = 30) comprised of each 45-minute manual and automated driving sessions, were evaluated by trained raters. Correlation analysis results show that - depending on the number of drowsiness levels - a comparable ground truth can be generated by reducing the rating frequency and thus the rating complexity by a factor of five. The knowledge gained can be used in future studies in this research area, the collection of a reliable and valid ground truth of drowsiness, as well as for improving the process in developing interactive drowsiness detection systems.},

The approach has been evaluated by exploiting user requirements described by a group of experts in the domain of business trips. Such requirements gave rise to a set of BDD stories that have been used to automatically assess scenarios extracted from task models that were reengineered from an existing web system for booking business trips. The results have shown our approach, by performing a static analysis of the source files, was able to identify different types of inconsistencies between the user requirements and the set of task models analyzed.},

abstract = {Scientific workflow management systems such as Galaxy, Taverna and Workspace, have been developed to automate scientific workflow management and are increasingly being used to accelerate the specification, execution, visualization, and monitoring of data-intensive tasks. For example, the popular bioinformatics platform Galaxy is installed on over 168 servers around the world and the social networking space myExperiment shares almost 4,000 Galaxy scientific workflows among its 10,665 members. Most of these systems offer graphical interfaces for composing workflows. However, while graphical languages are considered easier to use, graphical workflow models are more difficult to comprehend and maintain as they become larger and more complex. Text-based languages are considered harder to use but have the potential to provide a clean and concise expression of workflow even for large and complex workflows. A recent study showed that some scientists prefer script/text-based environments to perform complex scientific analysis with workflows. Unfortunately, such environments are unable to meet the needs of scientists who prefer graphical workflows. In order to address the needs of both types of scientists and at the same time to have script-based workflow models because of their underlying benefits, we propose a visually guided workflow modeling framework that combines interactive graphical user interface elements in an integrated development environment with the power of a domain-specific language to compose independently developed and loosely coupled services into workflows. Our domain-specific language provides scientists with a clean, concise, and abstract view of workflow to better support workflow modeling. As a proof of concept, we developed VizSciFlow, a generalized scientific workflow management system that can be customized for use in a variety of scientific domains. As a first use case, we configured and customized VizSciFlow for the bioinformatics domain. We conducted three user studies to assess its usability, expressiveness, efficiency, and flexibility. Results are promising, and in particular, our user studies show that VizSciFlow is more desirable for users to use than either Python or Galaxy for solving complex scientific problems.},

This Cartesian coordinate system, although useful for computation like complexity analysis, gesture classification and recognition, becomes complex and inefficient when gestures need to be visualized and directly manipulated for editing. To address these challenges, a new mathematical representation of these gestures via a B\'{e}zier curve is defined to initiate a model-based approach for gesture direct manipulation (e.g., cut, copy, paste, translate, scale, rotate, deform, crop, compose, decompose). SketchADoodle, an Android-based mobile application for drawing, gesturing, demonstrates how the pseudo-code of the B\'{e}zier-based operations are engineered for real-time direct manipulation. We release the programming code for further development of gesture-based user interfaces based on B\'{e}zier curves.},

Website users can express their needs by re-arranging and modifying the website's layout and design. To explore and validate this idea, we present CrowdUI, a web-based tool that enables members of the community of a website to visually express their design improvement ideas, frustrations and needs, and to send this feedback to the person in charge of designing or maintaining the website.CrowdUI is validated in a study with 45 users of a popular social media and networking website. Second, our qualitative evaluation with 60 experienced web developers shows that CrowdUI is able to elicit diverse and meaningful feedback. Put together, our results suggest that CrowdUI's approach constitutes a productive setting for eliciting visual feedback from the user community as a complement to traditional ways of eliciting feedback and participatory design. Finally, based on our experiences, we discuss a design space for crowdsourced web design and provide design recommendations for similar future tools.},

abstract = {Fabric sensors have been introduced to enable flexible touch-based interaction. We advance the technical capabilities of a scalable and low-profile knitted capacitive touch sensing system by introducing methods to improve its touch localization accuracy. The sensor hardware design tends toward minimalism by using a single conductive yarn and two external connections located at each endpoint. Fewer connectors simplify the textile system integration, but this comes at the expense of reduced signal information output from the system. The electrical continuity of the sensing element, essential to the process of knitting, also increases the uncertainty of localizing touch. We propose using Bode analysis to measure changes in signal due to capacitive touch, as well as design a new algorithm, MSD, which retains the most significant aspects of the signal in terms of touch location identification. We do not classify location of touch, but focus on an invariant signal representation. To evaluate our methods, we introduce ELD, a distance metric to compute the similarity of pairs of key-presses, generalizable to computing distances of tensors of varying lengths. Our experiments show that the proposed sensing method results in high-fidelity signals. Furthermore, the sparse representation of key-presses produced by MSD significantly increases separability between different touch locations. Possible applications based on these sensors are also illustrated through prototypes and use case descriptions.},

abstract = {Web page performance is crucial in today's Internet ecosystem, and Web developers use various developer tools to analyze their page load performance. However, existing tools cannot be used to identify the critical bottlenecks during the page load process. In this work, we design an online tool called WProfX that allows Web developers to visually identify bottlenecks in their page structure. The key to WProfX is that unlike existing Web performance tools, WProfX not only visualizes the page load activity timings, but also extracts the dependencies between the activities. Using the dependency structure, WProfX identifies the critical bottleneck activities. This lets a developer quickly identify why their page is loading slow and conduct what-if analyses to study the effect of different optimizations.WProfX uses low-level tracing information exposed by most major browsers to extract the relationship between page load activities. The result is that WProfX works with most major browsers and newer browser versions. WProfX visualizes the page load process as a dependency graph of semantically meaningful Web activities and identifies the critical bottlenecks. We evaluate WProfX with 14 Web developers who perform three what-if analysis tasks involving identifying the page load bottleneck and evaluating the effect of a page optimization. All the participants were able to complete the tasks with WProfX, compared to less than 60% when using the popular developer tools available today. WProfX is currently being used by Web developers in a large telecom and at a Silicon Valley startup.},

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) has resulted in many-fold increase in sharing the global classrooms through customized online platforms, where a student can participate in the classes through her personal devices, such as personal computers, smartphones, tablets, etc. However, in the absence of direct interactions with the students during the delivery of the lectures, it becomes difficult to judge their involvements in the classroom. In academics, the degree of student's attention can indicate whether a course is efficacious in terms of clarity and information. An automated feedback can hence be generated to enhance the utility of the course. The precision of discernment in the context of human attention is a subject of surveillance. However, visual patterns indicating the magnitude of concentration can be deciphered by analyzing the visual emphasis and the way an individual visually gesticulates, while contemplating the object of interest. In this paper, we develop a methodology called Gestsatten which captures the learner's attentiveness from his visual gesture patterns. In this approach, the learner's visual gestures are tracked along with the region of focus. We consider two aspects in this approach -- first, we do not transfer learner's video outside her device, so we apply in-device computing to protect her privacy; second, considering the fact that a majority of the learners use handheld devices like smartphones to observe the MOOC videos, we develop a lightweight approach for in-device computation. A three level estimation of learner's attention is performed based on these information. We have implemented and tested Gestatten over 48 participants from different age groups, and we observe that the proposed technique can capture the attention level of a learner with high accuracy (average absolute error rate is 8.68%), which meets her ability to learn a topic as measured through a set of cognitive tests.},

However, designers are barely able to keep up with the current development cycle because their practices are too costly, while interaction issues accumulate in applications that end-users keep suffering. In this work, we propose a method for designers to rapidly explore solutions through visual programming to the interaction problems of an application under development, even when it has been already deployed. The method is realized by a tool called UX-Painter, an exploratory tool for designers to apply quick fixes to interaction issues at the client-side of a web application without the need of any script programming knowledge. The palette of available fixes in UX-Painter are client-side web refactorings, i.e., changes to web page elements that solve specific user interaction problems without changing the underlying functionality. UX-Painter allows designers to quickly set up new versions of a web application by combining refactorings to create alternative designs for user testing or an inspection review. UX-Painter also provides the means to communicate design improvements, as a sequence of refactorings with clear semantics. We show the feedback provided by interviews with designers about UX-Painter's functionality and the results of a user test about its usability.},

abstract = {We present a concept and tool for studying language use in everyday mobile text communication (e.g. chats). Our approach for the first time enables researchers to collect comprehensive data on language use during unconstrained natural typing (i.e. no study tasks) without logging readable messages to preserve privacy. We achieve this with a combination of three customisable text abstraction methods that run directly on participants' phones. We report on our implementation as an Android keyboard app and two evaluations: First, we simulate text reconstruction attempts on a large text corpus to inform conditions for minimising privacy risks. Second, we assess people's experiences in a two-week field deployment (N=20). We release our app as an open source project to the community to facilitate research on open questions in HCI, Linguistics and Psychology. We conclude with concrete ideas for future studies in these areas.},

Would a team be more viable if it could undo initial interactional missteps and try again? We introduce a technique that supports online and remote teams in creating multiple parallel worlds: the same team meets many times, led to believe that each convening is with a new team due to pseudonym masking while actual membership remains static. Afterward, the team moves forward with the parallel world with the highest viability by using the same pseudonyms and conversation history from that instance. In two experiments, we find that this technique improves team viability: teams that are reconvened from the highest-viability parallel world are significantly more viable than the same group meeting in a new parallel world. Our work suggests parallel worlds can help teams start off on the right foot - and stay there.},

Our findings indicate that the use of MAMAS helped 1) increase children's autonomy during mealtime, 2) enhance parents' self-awareness of their words and behaviors, 3) promote the parent--child relationship, and 4) positively influence the mealtime experiences of the entire family. The study also revealed some challenges in eating behavior interventions due to the complex dynamics of childhood eating problems. Based on the findings, we discuss how a mealtime assistant application can be better designed for parents and children with challenging eating behaviors.},

abstract = {Despite their pervasiveness, current text-based conversational agents (chatbots) are predominantly monolingual, while users are often multilingual. It is well-known that multilingual users mix languages while interacting with others, as well as in their interactions with computer systems (such as query formulation in text-/voice-based search interfaces and digital assistants). Linguists refer to this phenomenon as code-mixing or code-switching. Do multilingual users also prefer chatbots that can respond in a code-mixed language over those which cannot? In order to inform the design of chatbots for multilingual users, we conduct a mixed-method user-study (N=91) where we examine how conversational agents, that code-mix and reciprocate the users' mixing choices over multiple conversation turns, are evaluated and perceived by bilingual users. We design a human-in-the-loop chatbot with two different code-mixing policies -- (a) always code-mix irrespective of user behavior, and (b) nudge with subtle code-mixed cues and reciprocate only if the user, in turn, code-mixes. These two are contrasted with a monolingual chatbot that never code-mixed. Users are asked to interact with the bots, and provide ratings on perceived naturalness and personal preference. They are also asked open-ended questions around what they (dis)liked about the bots. Analysis of the chat logs, users' ratings, and qualitative responses reveal that multilingual users strongly prefer chatbots that can code-mix. We find that self-reported language proficiency is the strongest predictor of user preferences. Compared to the Always code-mix policy, Nudging emerges as a low-risk low-gain policy which is equally acceptable to all users. Nudging as a policy is further supported by the observation that users who rate the code-mixing bot higher typically tend to reciprocate the language mixing pattern of the bot. These findings present a first step towards developing conversational systems that are more human-like and engaging by virtue of adapting to the users' linguistic style.},

Previous ethnographic studies on paper strip systems anticipated a radical change in work practices with digital strip systems, but we are not aware of any studies that evaluated these predictions. We carried out contextual inquiries with controllers and focused on face-to-face and radio communication, interactions with the digital strip system and the workspace in general. In turn, we contribute (1) detailed descriptions of controllers' work practices, such as using tacit information from radio communication and 'standard advocates vs. tinkerers' operation modes, (2) respective implications for design and (3) discuss how the observed work practices are similar or different from the reported practices in the literature of the two preceding decades. Our key insights are, that documentation speed is faster with digital strips, although a high load in the case of radio frequency persists. Controllers retrieve tacit information from the radio communication and combine it with scattered cues from several displays to form empathic decisions that sometimes exceed the standard protocol. We conclude that the role of tacit information holds opportunities for future flight systems and should be considered in a holistic approach to individualized workspaces for controllers.},

abstract = {In "smart speaker'' digital assistant systems such as Google Home, there is no visual user interface, so people must learn about the system's capabilities and limitations by experimenting with different questions and commands. However, many new users give up quickly and limit their use to a few simple tasks. This is a problem for both the user and the system. Users who stop trying out new things cannot learn about new features and functionality, and the system receives less data upon which to base future improvements. Symbiosis---a mutually beneficial relationship---between AI systems like digital assistants and people is an important aspect of developing systems that are partners to humans and not just tools. In order to better understand requirements for symbiosis, we investigated the relationship between the types of digital assistant responses and users' subsequent questions, focusing on identifying interactions that were discouraging to users when speaking with a digital assistant. We conducted a user study with 20 participants who completed a series of information seeking tasks using the Google Home, and analyzed transcripts using a method based on applied conversation analysis. We found that the most common response from the Google Home, a version of "Sorry, I'm not sure how to help'', provided no feedback for participants to build on when forming their next question. However, responses that provided somewhat strange but tangentially related answers were actually more helpful for conversational grounding, which extended the interaction. We discuss the connection between grounding and symbiosis, and present recommendations for requirements for forming partnerships with digital assistants.},

abstract = {Online social networks (OSN) play an essential role for connecting people and allowing them to communicate online. OSN users share their thoughts, moments, and news with their network. The messages they share online can include sarcastic posts, where the intended meaning expressed by the written text is different from the literal one. This could result in miscommunication. Previous research in psycholinguistics has studied the sociocultural factors the might lead to sarcasm misunderstanding between speakers and listeners. However, there is a lack of such studies in the context of OSN. In this paper we fill this gap by performing a quantitative analysis on the influence of sociocultural variables, including gender, age, country, and English language nativeness, on the effectiveness of sarcastic communication online. We collect examples of sarcastic tweets directly from the authors who posted them. Further, we ask third-party annotators of different sociocultural backgrounds to label these tweets for sarcasm. Our analysis indicates that age, English language nativeness, and country are significantly influential and should be considered in the design of future social analysis tools that either study sarcasm directly, or look at related phenomena where sarcasm may have an influence. We also make observations about the social ecology surrounding sarcastic exchanges on OSNs. We conclude by suggesting ways in which our findings can be included in future work.},

Most sleep-tracking tools, however, are designed for adults and make it difficult for parents and children to track together. To examine how to design a family-centered sleep tracking tool, we designed DreamCatcher. DreamCatcher is an in-home, interactive, shared display that aggregates data from wrist-worn sleep sensors and self-reported mood. We deployed DreamCatcher as a probe to examine the design space of tracking sleep as a family. Ten families participated in the study probe between 15 and 50 days. This study uses a family systems perspective to explore research questions regarding the feasibility of children actively tracking health data alongside their parents and the effects of tracking and sharing on family dynamics. Our results indicate that children can be active tracking contributors and that having parents and children track together encourages turn-taking and working together. However, there were also moments when family members, in particular parents, felt discomfort from sharing their sleep and mood with other family members. Our research contributes to a growing understanding of designing family centered health-informatics tools to support the combined needs of parents and children.},

In the US, such programs are means-tested: applicants must complete long forms to prove financial distress before receiving aid. Online benefits screening tools provide a gloss of such forms, advising households about their eligibility prior to completing full applications. If incorrectly implemented, screening tools may discourage qualified households from applying for benefits. Unfortunately, errors in screening tools are difficult to detect because they surface one at a time and difficult to contest because unofficial determinations do not generate a paper trail. We introduce a method for auditing such tools in four steps: 1) generate test households, 2) automatically populate screening questions with household information and retrieve determinations, 3) translate eligibility guidelines into computer code to generate ground truth determinations, and 4) identify conflicting determinations to detect errors. We illustrated our method on a real screening tool with households modeled from census data. Our method exposed major errors with corresponding examples to reproduce them.

The CSCW and the larger computing community continue to evaluate and understand the potential negative impacts of research involving digital technologies. As more research involves digital data, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) take on the difficult task of evaluating and determining risks--likelihood of potential harms--from digital research. Learning more about IRBs' role in concretizing harm and its likelihood will help us critically examine the current approach to regulating digital research, and has implications for how researchers can reflect on their own data practices. We interviewed 22 U.S.-based IRB members and found that, for the interviewees, "being digital" added a risk. Being digital meant increasing possibilities of confidentiality breach, unintended collection of sensitive information, and unauthorized data reuse. Concurrently, interviewees found it difficult to pinpoint the direct harms that come out of those risks. The ambiguous, messy, and situated contexts of digital research data did not fit neatly into current human subjects research protection protocols. We discuss potential solutions for understanding risks and harms of digital technology and implications for the responsibilities of the CSCW and the larger computing community in conducting digital research.},

To improve satisfaction and engagement of such workers, who are vital for the sustainability of the marketplaces, recent works have used conversational interfaces to support the execution of a variety of crowdsourcing tasks. The rationale behind using conversational interfaces stems from the potential engagement that conversation can stimulate. Prior works in psychology have also shown that conversational styles can play an important role in communication. There are unexplored opportunities to estimate a worker's conversational style with an end goal of improving worker satisfaction, engagement and quality. Addressing this knowledge gap, we investigate the role of conversational styles in conversational microtask crowdsourcing. To this end, we design a conversational interface which supports task execution, and we propose methods to estimate the conversational style of a worker. Our experimental setup was designed to empirically observe how conversational styles of workers relate with quality-related outcomes. Results show that even a naive supervised classifier can predict the conversation style with high accuracy (80%), and crowd workers with an Involvement conversational style provided a significantly higher output quality, exhibited a higher user engagement and perceived less cognitive task load in comparison to their counterparts. Our findings have important implications on task design with respect to improving worker performance and their engagement in microtask crowdsourcing.},

abstract = {Chatbots are becoming increasingly popular. One promising application for chatbots is to elicit people's self-disclosure of their personal experiences, thoughts, and feelings. As receiving one's deep self-disclosure is critical for mental health professionals to understand people's mental status, chatbots show great potential in the mental health domain. However, there is a lack of research addressing if and how people self-disclose sensitive topics to a real mental health professional (MHP) through a chatbot. In this work, we designed, implemented and evaluated a chatbot that offered three chatting styles; we also conducted a study with 47 participants who were randomly assigned into three groups where each group experienced the chatbot's self-disclosure at varying levels respectively. After using the chatbot for a few weeks, participants were introduced to a MHP and were asked if they would like to share their self-disclosed content with the MHP. If they chose to share, the participants had the option of changing (adding, deleting, and editing) the content they self-disclosed to the chatbot. Comparing participants' self-disclosure data the week before and the week after sharing with the MHP, our results showed that, within each group, the depth of participants' self-disclosure to the chatbot remained after sharing with the MHP; participants exhibited deeper self-disclosure to the MHP through a more self-disclosing chatbot; further, through conversation log analysis, we found that some participants made different edits on their self-disclosed content before sharing it with the MHP. Participants' interview and survey feedback suggested an interaction between participants' trust in the chatbot and their trust in the MHP, which further explained participants' self-disclosure behavior.},

abstract = {The Blue Whale Challenge (BWC) is an online viral "game" that allegedly encourages youth and young adults towards self-harming behaviors that could eventually lead to suicide. The BWC can be situated within a larger phenomenon of viral online self-harm challenges, which may be propagated through both social media and news sources. Research has established that suicide is a global public health issue that is known to be influenced by media reporting. Violation of safe messaging guidelines has been shown to increase imitative suicides, particularly in youth and young adults. Given the confirmed effects of news media reporting, we analyzed 150 digital newspaper articles reporting on the BWC to assess whether they adhered to suicide prevention safe messaging guidelines. Overall, 81% of the articles violated at least one contagion-related guideline, most commonly normalizing suicide, discussing means of suicide, and sensationalizing. Even though the majority (91%) of the articles adhered to at least one health-promotion guideline, such as emphasizing prevention, the articles did not follow these guidelines on a deep and comprehensive level. Through thematic analysis, we also found evidence of potential misinformation in reporting, where the articles unequivocally attributed many suicides to the BWC with little or no evidence. Additionally, articles often stated an individual's reason for participating in the challenge without interviewing the individual or those close to the individual, another aspect of potential misinformation due to lack of evidence. A contribution of the current study is the synthesis of safe messaging guidelines that can be used in future research. This study contributes to the understanding of news reporting practices regarding suicide and self-harm in regard to the BWC and similar online challenges. We discuss how sensationalized news media reports on the BWC could unintentionally propagate suicide contagion effects that normalize self-harming behaviors among youth. We then examine implications for practice and policy, such using automated approaches to aid reporters in adhering to safe messaging guidelines.},

We offer suggestions on supporting online sanctioning that make norms more visible and signal violations in ways that avoid direct confrontation to reduce the risk of harming on-going social relationships.},

In this article I use interviews with r/AskHistorians moderators and community members, observation, and the full comment log of a highly upvoted thread to describe the impact of Reddit's design and culture on moderation work. Results show that visible moderation work that is often interpreted as censorship, and the default masculine whiteness of Reddit create challenges for moderators who use the subreddit as a public history site.

For many communication channels, people have some ability to explicitly specify their audience members and the different roles they can play. While existing accounts of communication behavior have largely focused on how people tailor the content of their messages, we focus on the configuring of the audience as a complementary family of decisions in communication. We formulate a general description of audience configuration choices, highlighting key aspects of the audience that people could configure to reflect a range of communicative goals. We then illustrate these ideas via a case study of email usage-a realistic domain where audience configuration choices are particularly fine-grained and explicit in how email senders fill the To and Cc address fields. In a large collection of enterprise emails, we explore how people configure their audiences, finding salient patterns relating a sender's choice of configuration to the types of participants in the email exchange, the content of the message, and the nature of the subsequent interactions. Our formulation and findings show how analyzing audience configurations can enrich and extend existing accounts of communication behavior, and frame research directions on audience configuration decisions in communication and collaboration.},

This growth has been accompanied by a muddying between the sharing and gig economy, and it has become unclear when an activity is sharing a resource vs. providing a service. To unpack this difference, we studied two successful carpooling groups (university students traveling home and commuting among professionals), which we contrast with previous literature on ride-hailing apps (e.g., Uber). The two communities that we studied differ in that: professionals, had more routine ride-sharing needs based on their commute; and students, arranged rides to return home for school breaks or long weekends. We detail how common needs and backgrounds impacted how carpoolers treated each other. Leveraging these findings, we outline design paths for both the sharing and gig economies to better realize the ideas of the sharing economy.},

While recent literature frequently reports on conformity in online group settings, the causes for online conformity are yet to be fully understood. This study aims to understand how social presencei.e., the sense of being connected to others via mediated communication, influences conformity among individuals placed in online groups while answering subjective and objective questions. Acknowledging its multifaceted nature, we investigate three aspects of online social presence: user representation (generic vs.user-specific avatars), interactivity (discussion vs.no discussion ), and response visibility (public vs.private ). Our results show an overall conformity rate of 30% and main effects from task objectivity, group size difference between the majority and the minority, and self-confidence on personal answer. Furthermore, we observe an interaction effect between interactivity and response visibility, such that conformity is highest in the presence of peer discussion and public responses, and lowest when these two elements are absent. We conclude with a discussion on the implications of our findings in designing online group settings, accounting for the effects of social presence on conformity.},

abstract = {Converting widely-available 2D images and videos, captured using an RGB camera, to 3D can help accelerate the training of machine learning systems in spatial reasoning domains ranging from in-home assistive robots to augmented reality to autonomous vehicles. However, automating this task is challenging because it requires not only accurately estimating object location and orientation, but also requires knowing currently unknown camera properties (e.g., focal length). A scalable way to combat this problem is to leverage people's spatial understanding of scenes by crowdsourcing visual annotations of 3D object properties. Unfortunately, getting people to directly estimate 3D properties reliably is difficult due to the limitations of image resolution, human motor accuracy, and people's 3D perception (i.e., humans do not "see" depth like a laser range finder). In this paper, we propose a crowd-machine hybrid approach that jointly uses crowds' approximate measurements of multiple in-scene objects to estimate the 3D state of a single target object. Our approach can generate accurate estimates of the target object by combining heterogeneous knowledge from multiple contributors regarding various different objects that share a spatial relationship with the target object. We evaluate our joint object estimation approach with 363 crowd workers and show that our method can reduce errors in the target object's 3D location estimation by over 40%, while requiring only $35$% as much human time. Our work introduces a novel way to enable groups of people with different perspectives and knowledge to achieve more accurate collective performance on challenging visual annotation tasks.},

However, not all expressions of mental illness are treated equally on these platforms. Different aggregates of human and technical control are used to report and ban content, accounts, and communities. Through two years of digital ethnography, including online observation and interviews, with people with eating disorders, we examine the experience of content moderation. We use a constructivist grounded theory approach to analysis that shows how practices of moderation across different platforms have particular consequences for members of marginalized groups, who are pressured to conform and compelled to resist. Above all, we argue that platform moderation is enmeshed with wider processes of conformity to specific versions of mental illness. Practices of moderation reassert certain bodies and experiences as 'normal' and valued, while rejecting others. At the same time, navigating and resisting these normative pressures further inscribes the marginal status of certain individuals. We discuss changes to the ways that platforms handle content related to eating disorders by drawing on the concept of multiplicity to inform design.},

In this paper a real-time interruption management system (IMS) is proposed that leverages speech information, the most commonly used and available means of communication within collaborative distributed environments. The key aspect of this paper includes a proposed real-time IMS system that leverages lexical affirmation cues to infer the end of a task or task boundary as a candidate interruption time. The performance results show the proposed real-time lexical Affirmation Cues based Interruption Management System (ACE-IMS) outperforms the current baseline real-time IMS system within the existing literature. ACE-IMS has the potential of reducing disruptive interruptions without incurring excessive missed opportunities to disseminate interruptions by utilizing only the most frequently used mode of human communication: voice. Thereby, providing a promising new baseline to further the system development of real-time interruption management systems within the ever-growing distributed collaborative domain.},

abstract = {OT (Operational Transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become core techniques widely used in today's working co-editors and adopted in industrial products. CRDT (Commutative Replicated Data Type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of WOOT (WithOut Operational Transformation). Follow-up CRDT variations are commonly labeled as "post-OT" techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutative in co-editors. On top of that, CRDT solutions have made broad claims of superiority over OT solutions, and often portrayed OT as an incorrect and inefficient technique. Over one decade later, however, CRDT is rarely found in working co-editors; OT remains the choice for building the vast majority of today's co-editors. Contradictions between the reality and CRDT's purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing researcher and developer communities. To seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative OT and CRDT solutions and working co-editors based on them. From this work, we have made important discoveries about OT and CRDT, and revealed facts and evidences that refute CRDT claims over OT on all accounts. These discoveries help explain the underlying reasons for the choice between OT and CRDT in the real world. We report these results in a series of three articles. In this article (the second in the series), we reveal the differences between OT and CRDT in their basic approaches to realizing the same general transformation and how such differences had resulted in different technical challenges and consequential correctness and complexity issues. Moreover, we reveal hidden complexity and algorithmic flaws with representative CRDT solutions, and discuss common myths and facts related to correctness and complexity of OT and CRDT. We hope the discoveries from this work help clear up common myths and confusions surrounding OT and CRDT, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications.},

In this study, we specifically focus on this data by examining how race and gender are defined and annotated in image databases used for facial analysis. We found that the majority of image databases rarely contain underlying source material for how those identities are defined. Further, when they are annotated with race and gender information, database authors rarely describe the process of annotation. Instead, classifications of race and gender are portrayed as insignificant, indisputable, and apolitical. We discuss the limitations of these approaches given the sociohistorical nature of race and gender. We posit that the lack of critical engagement with this nature renders databases opaque and less trustworthy. We conclude by encouraging database authors to address both the histories of classification inherently embedded into race and gender, as well as their positionality in embedding such classifications.},

abstract = {Online multiplayer games like Minecraft, gaining increasing popularity among present-day youth, include rich contexts for social interactions but are also rife with interpersonal conflict among players. Research shows that a variety of socio-technical mechanisms (e.g., server rules, chat filters, use of in-game controls to ban players, etc.) aim to limit and/or eliminate social conflict in games like Minecraft. However, avoiding social conflict need not necessarily always be a useful approach. Broadly defined in CSCW literature as a phenomenon that may arise even amidst mutual cooperation, social conflict can yield positive outcomes depending on how it is managed (e.g., [Easterbrook et al.,1993]). In fact, the aforementioned approaches to avoid conflict may not be helpful as they do not help youth understand how to address similar interpersonal differences that may occur in other social settings. Furthermore, prior research has established the value of developing conflict-resolution skills during early adolescence within safe settings, such as school/after-school wellness and prevention interventions (e.g.,[Shure, 1982], [Aber et al., 1998]), for later success in any given interpersonal relationship. While games like Minecraft offer authentic contexts for encountering social conflict, little work thus far has explored how to help youth develop conflict-resolution skills by design interventions within online interest-driven settings. Drawing from prior literature in CSCW, youth wellness and prevention programs, we translated offline evidence-based strategies into the design of an online, after-school program that was run within a moderated Minecraft server. The online program, titled Survival Lab, was designed to promote problem-solving and conflict-resolution skills in youth (ages 8-14 years). We conducted a field study for six months (30 youth participants, four college-age moderators, and one high-school volunteer aged 15 years) using in-game observations and digital trace ethnographic approaches. Our study data reveals that participating youth created community norms and developed insightful solutions to conflicts in Survival Lab. Our research offers three key takeaways. Firstly, online social games like Minecraft lend themselves as feasible settings for the translation of offline evidence-based design strategies in promoting the development of conflict-resolution and other social competencies among youth. Secondly, the design features that support structured and unstructured play while enabling freedom of choice for youth to engage as teams and/or individuals are viable for collective or community-level outcomes. Third and finally, moderators, as caring adults and near-peer mentors, play a vital role in facilitating the development of conflict-resolution skills and interest-driven learning among youth. We discuss the implications of our research for translating offline design to online play-based settings as sites and conclude with recommendations for future work.},

abstract = {Live streaming services allow people to concurrently consume and comment on media events with other people in real time. Durkheim's theory of "collective effervescence" suggests that face-to-face encounters in ritual events conjure emotional arousal, so people often feel happier and more excited while watching events like the Super Bowl with family and friends through the television than if they were alone. Does a stronger emotional intensity also occur in live streaming? Using a large-scale dataset of comments posted to news and media events on YouTube, we address this question by examining emotional intensity in live comments versus those produced retrospectively. Results reveal that live comments are overall more emotionally intense than retrospective comments across all temporal periods and all event types examined. Findings support the emotional amplification hypothesis and provide preliminary evidence for shared attention theory in explaining the amplification effect. These findings have important implications for live streaming platforms to optimize resources for content moderation and to improve psychological well-being for content moderators, and more broadly as society grapples with using technology to stay connected during social distancing required by the COVID-19 pandemic.},

abstract = {Domestic and personal photography are topics of longstanding interest to CSCW and HCI researchers. In this paper, we explore these topics in Bungoma County, Kenya. We used interview and observation methods to investigate how photographs are taken, displayed, organized, and shared, in 23 rural households. To more deeply understand participants' photography practices, we also gave them digital cameras, observed what they did with them, and asked them to engage in a photo-elicitation exercise. Our findings draw attention to the ways photographs are "relational objects" - that is, material objects that support the maintenance, reproduction, and transformation of social relations. We then describe these relations: economic (i.e., working as cameramen producing and distributing printed images); family (i.e., parents and children using printed images to tell family histories); and community (i.e., people using printed images to present an idealized self). The introduction of digital cameras into these households did not appear to change these practices; instead, it reinforced them. We discuss how considering relational objects in CSCW/HCI is useful for balancing the technologically determinist perspectives that are the basis of many prior studies of photography in these fields. In particular, we detail how considering the concept provides new perspectives on materiality, as well an alternative to the individualistic perspective, which underlies these communities' understanding of photography.},

Integrating psychosocial care into cancer services through the team-based Collaborative Care Management (CoCM) model has been proven to be effective in improving patient outcomes in cancer centers. However, there is currently a gap in understanding the challenges that patients and their care team encounter in managing co-morbid cancer and depression in integrated psycho-oncology care settings. Our formative study examines the challenges and needs of CoCM in cancer settings with perspectives from patients, care managers, oncologists, psychiatrists, and administrators, with a focus on technology opportunities to support CoCM. We find that: (1) patients with co-morbid cancer and depression struggle to navigate between their cancer and psychosocial care journeys, and (2) conceptualizing co-morbidities as separate and independent care journeys is insufficient for characterizing this complex care context. We then propose the parallel journeys framework as a conceptual design framework for characterizing challenges that patients and their care team encounter when cancer and psychosocial care journeys interact. We use the challenges discovered through the lens of this framework to highlight and prioritize technology design opportunities for supporting whole-person care for patients with co-morbid cancer and depression.},

The present work aims to shed light on the current sense-making and support-seeking practices exhibited by targets of racism, as well as to identify the core needs and barriers that future socio-technical interventions could potentially address. The long-term goal of this work is to understand how CSCW researchers and designers could best support members of marginalized groups to make sense of and to seek support for experiences with racism. Narrative episode interviews with targets of racism revealed a number of key entry points for intervention. For example, participants' personal stories confirmed that uncertainty, both about the nature and consequences of the experience of racism, is a key motivator for support-seeking. In addition, despite the need for support, participants largely do not trust public forms of social media for support-seeking. We discuss how participants' accounts of the complex labor involved in determining who "gets it" in identifying potential supporters, and in navigating the complexities of trust and agency in sharing their experiences, present clear implications for the design of new socio-technical platforms for members of racial minority groups.},

HCI4D/ICTD researchers are increasingly interested in more deeply understanding local cultures in the developing regions where they work, in designing technologies that are not strictly related to socioeconomic development, and in considering new design approaches. However, few use this subjective, design-led method in their research. In this paper, I present a case study detailing my experience designing and deploying cultural probes in Bungoma, Kenya. Returns from my comment cards and digital camera activities draw attention to probe recipients' unique experiences and to Bungoma's distinctive characteristics; they also inspired a series of speculative design proposals. My experience motivates a discussion that elaborates on how a cultural probes approach can benefit HCI4D/ICTD research by raising questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the pursuit of a single solution in design. More broadly, I offer a case study demonstrating an alternative way to approach design in HCI4D/ICTD.},

We conducted a series of participatory design workshops with reviewers in the domain of holistic college admissions to better understand the challenges and opportunities regarding storytelling.

In this paper, we explore how U.S. independent [indie] game developers' socio-technological practices inject forms of labor, capital, and production into the game development industry. Our findings highlight that indie game development 1) seeks to promote an alternative to business models of game development that depend on free and immaterial labor; 2) builds offline networks at different scales to develop collectives that can sustain their production; and 3) emphasizes how distributed collaboration, co-creation, and the use of free tools and middleware make game production more widely accessible. The research contributes to HCI research that seeks to explicate and mitigate emerging forms of exploitation enabled by new technologies and processes. Our critical review of indie developers' practices and strategies also extends the current conceptualization of labor and technology in CSCW.},

abstract = {Attracting and retaining newcomers is critical and challenging for online production communities such as Wikipedia, both because volunteers need specialized training and are likely to leave before being integrated into the community. In response to these challenges, the Wikimedia Foundation started the Wiki Education Project (Wiki Ed), an online program in which college students edit Wikipedia articles as class assignments. The Wiki Ed program incorporates many components of institutional socialization, a process many conventional organizations successfully use to integrate new employees through formalized on-boarding practices. Research has not adequately investigated whether Wiki Ed and similar programs are effective ways to integrate volunteers in online communities, and, if so, the mechanisms involved. This paper evaluates the Wiki Ed program by comparing 16,819 student editors in 770 Wiki Ed classes with new editors who joined Wikipedia in the conventional way. The evaluation shows that the Wiki Ed students did more work, improved articles more, and were more committed to Wikipedia. For example, compared to new editors who joined Wikipedia in the conventional way they were twice as likely to still be editing Wikipedia a year after their Wiki Ed class was finished. Further, students in classrooms that encouraged joint activity, a key component of institutional socialization, produced better quality work than those in classrooms where students worked independently. These findings are consistent with an interpretation that the Wiki Ed program was successful because it incorporated elements of institutionalized socialization.},

We interviewed full-time employees of a global technology company who hired freelancers as part of their job responsibilities. While there has been prior work describing freelancers' perspectives there has been little research on those that hire them, the "clients", especially in the corporate context. We found that while freelance platforms reduce many administrative burdens, there are number of conditions in which using freelance platforms in a corporate context creates high transaction costs and power asymmetries that make it difficult for clients to negotiate work rights and responsibilities. This leads corporate employee clients to feel "stuck in the middle" between their employer, the platform, and the freelancer. Ultimately, these transactions costs are a potential barrier to wider adoption. If corporations want to leverage the value of the freelance economy then better guardrails, guidelines, and perhaps even creative technology solutions will be needed.},

abstract = {While mobile instant messaging (MIM) facilitates ubiquitous interpersonal communication, its constant connectivity could build the expectation of an immediate response to messages, and its notifications flood could cause interruptions at inopportune moments. We examine two design concepts for MIM-private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications-that aim to lower the pressure for an immediate reply and reduce unnecessary interruptions by untimely notifications. Private status sharing reactively reveals a customized status with a selected partner(s) only when the partner has sent a message. Sender-controlled notifications give senders the control of choosing whether to send a notification for their own messages. We built MyButler, an Android app prototype that instantiates these two concepts and integrated it with KakaoTalk, a commercial MIM app. During a two-week field study with 11 pairs (5 couples and 6 friend pairs), participants expressed themselves through a total of 210 different statuses, 64.3% of which indicated the current activity or task of the user. Participants reported that private status sharing enabled them to explain their unavailability and relieved the pressure and expectations for timely attendance. We reveal more findings on the types of privately shared statuses and their roles in MIM communication; the in-situ behaviors and patterns of using sender-controlled notifications; and the motivations of MIM users in choosing whether to alert their messages. In terms of message notifications, senders chose to send 25.4% of the messages without any notification. We found that senders' decisions to alert are affected by the receiver's status, their own status to chat, and the possibility of message content exposure to others through notifications. Based on our findings, we draw insights into how the concepts of private status sharing and sender-controlled notifications can be applied in future designs and explorations.},

Our approach uses a novel Deep Affinity Network (DANTE) to predict the likelihood that two individuals in a scene are part of the same conversational group, considering their social context. The predicted pair-wise affinities are then used in a graph clustering framework to identify both small (e.g., dyads) and large groups. The results from our evaluation on multiple, established benchmarks suggest that combining powerful deep learning methods with classical clustering techniques can improve the detection of conversational groups in comparison to prior approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the practicality of our approach in a human-robot interaction scenario. Our efforts show that our work advances group detection not only in theory, but also in practice.},

While scholarly interest in model interpretability has grown rapidly in research communities like HCI, ML, and beyond, little is known about how practitioners perceive and aim to provide interpretability in the context of their existing workflows. This lack of understanding of interpretability as practiced may prevent interpretability research from addressing important needs, or lead to unrealistic solutions. To bridge this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews with industry practitioners to understand how they conceive of and design for interpretability while they plan, build, and use their models. Based on a qualitative analysis of our results, we differentiate interpretability roles, processes, goals and strategies as they exist within organizations making heavy use of ML models. The characterization of interpretability work that emerges from our analysis suggests that model interpretability frequently involves cooperation and mental model comparison between people in different roles, often aimed at building trust not only between people and models but also between people within the organization. We present implications for design that discuss gaps between the interpretability challenges that practitioners face in their practice and approaches proposed in the literature, highlighting possible research directions that can better address real-world needs.},

Thus, it can be challenging for audiences in particular to know whether to trust (or not trust) these CNRs and the information they provide. In this study, we conducted surveys and interviews with members of the public and experts in crisis informatics, emergency response, and communication studies to evaluate the trustworthiness of CNRs named after the 2017 Hurricane Irma. Findings showed that participants evaluated trustworthiness based on their perceptions of a CNR's content, information source, profile, and owner. Findings also show that if people perceive that a CNR owner has prior experience in crisis response, can help the public to respond to the event, understands the situation, has the best interests of affected individuals in mind, or will correct misinformation, they tend to trust that CNR. Participant demographics and expertise showed no effect on perceptions of trustworthiness.},

The findings suggest that engagement with authoritative resources (e.g., those constructed by project organizers) facilitates performance initially. However, as tasks become more difficult, volunteers seek and benefit from engagement with their own agent-centered resources and community-generated resources. These findings suggest a broader scope for the design of learning resources for peer production},

This paper proposes a set of two different methods by which researchers can identify types of non/use relevant to the particular sociotechnical settings they are studying. These methods are demonstrated by applying them to survey data about Facebook non/use. The results demonstrate that the different methods proposed here identify fairly comparable types of non/use. They also illustrate how the two methods make different trade offs between the granularity of the resulting typology and the total sample size. The paper also demonstrates how the different typologies resulting from these methods can be used in predictive modeling, allowing for the two methods to corroborate or disconfirm results from one another. The discussion considers implications and applications of these methods, both for research on technology non/use and for studying social computing more broadly.},

abstract = {Time-bounded events such as hackathons have become a global phenomenon. Scientific communities in particular show growing interest in organizing them to attract newcomers and develop technical artifacts to expand their code base. Current hackathon approaches presume that participants have sufficient expertise to work on projects on their own. They only provide occasional support by domain experts serving as mentors which might not be sufficient for newcomers. Drawing from work on workplace and educational mentoring, we developed and evaluated an approach where each hackathon team is supported by a community member who serves in a mentor role that goes beyond providing occasional support. Evaluating this approach, we found that teams who took ownership of their projects, set achievable goals early while building social ties with their mentor and receiving learning-oriented support reported positive perceptions related to their project and an increased interest in the scientific community that organized the hackathon. Our work thus contributes to our understanding of mentoring in hackathons, an area which has not been extensively studied. It also proposes a feasible approach for scientific communities to attract and integrate newcomers which is crucial for their long-term survival.},

This issue is particularly important in GUI-based programming-by-demonstration (PBD) systems due to the lack of direct developer control of script contents. Prior studies reported that these privacy concerns were the main barrier to script sharing in EUD. We present a new approach that can identify and obfuscate the potential personal information in GUI-based PBD scripts based on the uniqueness of information entries with respect to the corresponding app GUI context. Compared with the prior approaches, ours supports broader types of personal information beyond explicitly pre-specified ones, requires minimal user effort, addresses the threat of re-identification attacks, and can work with third-party apps from any task domain. Our approach also recovers obfuscated fields locally on the script consumer's side to preserve the shared scripts' transparency, readability, robustness, and generalizability. Our evaluation shows that our approach (1) accurately identifies the potential personal information in scripts across different apps in diverse task domains; (2) allows end-user developers to feel comfortable sharing their own scripts; and (3) enables script consumers to understand the operation of shared scripts despite the obfuscated fields.},

Therefore, we ask: how does a community recontextualize software development through the unique pressures of their work? To answer this, we explore the analytic community around baseball, or sabermetrics. To discover software development's place in the search for robust statistical insight in sports, we interview 10 participants in the sabermetric community and survey over 120 more data analysts, both in baseball and not. We explore how their work lives at the intersection of science and entertainment, and as a consequence, baseball data serves as an accessible yet deep subject to practice analytic skills. Software development exists within an iterative research process that cycles between defining rigorous statistical methods and preserving the flexibility to chase interesting problems. In this question-driven process, members of the community inhabit several overlapping roles of intentional work, in which software development can become the priority to support research and statistical infrastructure, and we discuss the way that the community can foster the balance of these skills.},

There is a growing concern that YouTube, the second largest search engine and the most popular video-sharing platform, has been promoting and recommending misinformative content for certain search topics. In this study, we audit YouTube to verify those claims. Our audit experiments investigate whether personalization (based on age, gender, geolocation, or watch history) contributes to amplifying misinformation. After shortlisting five popular topics known to contain misinformative content and compiling associated search queries representing them, we conduct two sets of audits-Search-and Watch-misinformative audits. Our audits resulted in a dataset of more than 56K videos compiled to link stance (whether promoting misinformation or not) with the personalization attribute audited. Our videos correspond to three major YouTube components: search results, Up-Next, and Top 5 recommendations. We find that demographics, such as, gender, age, and geolocation do not have a significant effect on amplifying misinformation in returned search results for users with brand new accounts. On the other hand, once a user develops a watch history, these attributes do affect the extent of misinformation recommended to them. Further analyses reveal a filter bubble effect, both in the Top 5 and Up-Next recommendations for all topics, except vaccine controversies; for these topics, watching videos that promote misinformation leads to more misinformative video recommendations. In conclusion, YouTube still has a long way to go to mitigate misinformation on its platform.},

To explore the causes and effects of online community migration, we examine transformative fandom, a longstanding, technology-agnostic community surrounding the creation, sharing, and discussion of creative works based on existing media. For over three decades, community members have left and joined many different online spaces, from Usenet to Tumblr to platforms of their own design. Through analysis of 28 in-depth interviews and 1,886 survey responses from fandom participants, we traced these migrations, the reasons behind them, and their impact on the community. Our findings highlight catalysts for migration that provide insights into factors that contribute to success and failure of platforms, including issues surrounding policy, design, and community. Further insights into the disruptive consequences of migrations (such as social fragmentation and lost content) suggest ways that platforms might both support commitment and better support migration when it occurs.},

We conducted an anonymous online survey (n=180) and an interview study (n=30) to understand the participation of Bangladeshi women in this movement. Our study concurs that while Bangladeshi women, who are regular users of social media, supported the spirit of this movement; did not participate in it, even though they had many bitter experiences. Our analysis shows that their non-participation was largely influenced by a cultural difference, patriarchy, perceived futility and lack of hope, and a reliance on alternatives. We discuss how our findings of women's use of technology platforms, which is conditioned and limited by male-dominated and conservative Bangladeshi society, relates to the broader issues in feminism that the GROUP community is interested in.},

In Software Engineering, crowdsourcing divides the software development tasks of to be carried out online by the crow and is simply called Software Crowdsourcing (SW CS). Most SW CS platforms support this emerging software development strategy and operate within a framework of competition among the crowd. Competitive SW CS platforms intentionally minimize communication and collaboration among the parties involved (customer, platform, and crowd) while they compete in the software development tasks. The goal of this paper is to investigate platform moderators in SW CS challenges. Platform moderators are individuals who work for the SW CS platforms to mediate customer and crowd. A qualitative analysis of the content of the communication forums hosted on the TopCoder platform was performed to analyze the messages exchanged by the platform moderators and the crowd. Our empirical results indicate that co-pilots enforce and, at the same time, extend the limitations of the documentation associated with the tasks to support crowd members, provide technical help to crowd members during the competitions, and engage the crowd in the challenges. Co-pilots are organized, work diligently, worrying about being fair, and, at the same time, seeking to find a balance between autonomy and dependency on the customer. We conclude by providing insights to improve the design of software crowdsourcing platforms.},

abstract = {Online and in the real world, communities are bonded together by emotional consensus around core issues. Emotional responses to scientific findings often play a pivotal role in these core issues. When there is too much diversity of opinion on topics of science, emotions flare up and give rise to conflict. This conflict threatens positive outcomes for research. Emotions have the power to shape how people process new information. They can color the public's understanding of science, motivate policy positions, even change lives. And yet little work has been done to evaluate the public's emotional response to science using quantitative methods. In this paper, we use a dataset of responses to scholarly articles on Facebook to analyze the dynamics of emotional valence, intensity, and diversity. We present a novel way of weighting click-based reactions that increases their comprehensibility, and use these weighted reactions to develop new metrics of aggregate emotional responses. We use our metrics along with LDA topic models and statistical testing to investigate how users' emotional responses differ from one scientific topic to another. We find that research articles related to gender, genetics, or agricultural/environmental sciences elicit significantly different emotional responses from users than other research topics. We also find that there is generally a positive response to scientific research on Facebook, and that articles generating a positive emotional response are more likely to be widely shared---a conclusion that contradicts previous studies of other social media platforms.},

To the extent that users can understand who knows what in their networks and target those friends appropriately, they can make effective use of the site as a knowledge base of information. This paper explores how targeting one's Facebook network when asking questions influences the breadth and quality of answers they receive. An experiment (N = 64) was conducted in which participants posted questions to their Facebook networks in four broadcast level conditions: status update to their full networks, status update to a custom subset of their networks, posting on a friend's Timeline, and sending a direct message. Results indicate that posting a question more broadly results in more information, which is moderated by perceptions of Facebook as a transactive memory system and as a source of social capital. However, informational and social value of responses is greatest when posting to a custom subset of their network. These results suggest that while targeting specific individuals may be the most effective means of gathering information in offline networks, the broadcast affordance of Facebook may be a more useful way to gather information on the site.?},

abstract = {Despite the growing interest in crowdsourcing, this new labor model has recently received severe criticism. The most important point of this criticism is that crowdworkers are often underpaid and overworked. This severely affects job satisfaction and productivity. Although there is a growing body of evidence exploring the work experiences of crowdworkers in various countries, there have been a very limited number of studies to the best of our knowledge exploring the work experiences of Chinese crowdworkers. In this paper we aim to address this gap. Based on a framework of well-established approaches, namely the Job Demands-Resources model, the Work Design Questionnaire, the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory, the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale, and the Organizational Commitment Questionnaire, we systematically study the work experiences of 289 crowdworkers who work for ZBJ.com - the most popular Chinese crowdsourcing platform. Our study examines these crowdworker experiences along four dimensions: (1) crowdsourcing job demands, (2) job resources available to the workers, (3) crowdwork experiences, and (4) platform commitment. Our results indicate significant differences across the four dimensions based on crowdworkers' gender, education, income, job nature, and health condition. Further, they illustrate that different crowdworkers have different needs and threshold of demands and resources and that this plays a significant role in terms of moderating the crowdwork experience and platform commitment. Overall, our study sheds light to the work experiences of the Chinese crowdworkers and at the same time contributes to furthering understandings related to the work experiences of crowdworkers.},

To understand the contexts from which WSAR workers communicate and the challenges they face, we interviewed WSAR workers and observed a mock-WSAR scenario. Our findings illustrate that WSAR workers face challenges in maintaining a shared mental model. This is primarily done through distributed communication using two-way radios and cell phones for text and photo messaging; yet both implicit and explicit communication suffer. WSAR workers send messages for various reasons and share different types of information with varying levels of urgency. This warrants the use of multiple communication modalities and information streams. However, bringing in more modalities introduces the risk of information overload, and thus WSAR workers today still primarily communicate remotely via the radio. Our work demonstrates opportunities for technology to provide implicit communication and awareness remotely, and to help teams maintain a shared mental model even when synchronous realtime communication is sparse. Furthermore, technology should be designed to bring together multiple streams of information and communication while making sure that they are presented in ways that aid WSAR workers rather than overwhelming them.},

To meet the growing demands of transparency and accountability, several academics came together and proposed the Santa Clara Principles on Transparency and Accountability in Content Moderation (SCP). In 2018, Reddit, home to uniquely moderated communities called subreddits, announced in its transparency report that the company is aligning its content moderation practices with the SCP. But do the moderators of subreddit communities follow these guidelines too? In this paper, we answer this question by employing a mixed-methods approach on public moderation logs collected from 204 subreddits over a period of five months, containing more than 0.5M instances of removals by both human moderators and AutoModerator. Our results reveal a lack of transparency in moderation practices. We find that while subreddits often rely on AutoModerator to sanction newcomer posts based on karma requirements and moderate uncivil content based on automated keyword lists, users are neither notified of these sanctions, nor are these practices formally stated in any of the subreddits' rules. We interviewed 13 Reddit moderators to hear their views on different facets of transparency and to determine why a lack of transparency is a widespread phenomenon. The interviews reveal that moderators' stance on transparency is divided, there is a lack of standardized process to appeal against content removal and Reddit's app and platform design often impede moderators' ability to be transparent in their moderation practices.},

abstract = {OT (Operational Transformation) was invented for supporting real-time co-editors in the late 1980s and has evolved to become a collection of core techniques widely used in today's working co-editors and adopted in major industrial products. CRDT (Commutative Replicated Data Type) for co-editors was first proposed around 2006, under the name of WOOT (WithOut Operational Transformation). Follow-up CRDT variations are commonly labeled as "post-OT" techniques capable of making concurrent operations natively commutativity in co-editors. On top of that, CRDT solutions have made broad claims of superiority over OT solutions, and routinely portrayed OT as an incorrect, complex and inefficient technique. Over one decade later, however, CRDT is rarely found in working co-editors, and OT remains the choice for building the vast majority of today's co-editors. Contradictions between the reality and CRDT's purported advantages have been the source of much confusion and debate in co-editing research and developer communities. Have the vast majority of co-editors been unfortunate in choosing the faulty and inferior OT, or those CRDT claims are false? What are the real differences between OT and CRDT for co-editors? What are the key factors and underlying reasons behind the choices between OT and CRDT in the real world? A thorough examination of these questions is relevant not only to researchers who are exploring the frontiers of co-editing technologies and systems, but also to practitioners who are seeking viable techniques to build real world applications. To seek truth from facts, we set out to conduct a comprehensive and critical review on representative OT and CRDT solutions and working co-editors based on them. From this work, we have made important discoveries about OT and CRDT, and revealed facts and evidences that refute CRDT claims over OT on all accounts. We report our discoveries in a series of articles and the current article is the first one in this series. In this paper, we present a general transformation framework for consistency maintenance in co-editors, which was distilled from dissecting and examining representative OT and CRDT solutions (and other alternative solutions) during this work, and report our discoveries under the guidance of this framework. In particular, we reveal that CRDT is like OT in following a general transformation approach, but achieves the same transformation indirectly, in contrast to OT direct transformation approach; and CRDT is not natively commutative for concurrent co-editing operations, but has to achieve the same OT commutativity indirectly as well, with consequential correctness and complexity issues. Uncovering the hidden transformation nature and demystifying the commutativity property of CRDT provides much-needed clarity about what CRDT really is and is not to co-editing, and serves as the foundation to explore the real differences between OT and CRDT in correctness, complexity, implementation, and real world applications, which are reported in follow-up articles. We hope discoveries from this work help clear up common misconceptions and confusions surrounding OT and CRDT, and accelerate progress in co-editing technology for real world applications.?},

abstract = {The phenomenon of end-user driven technological practices such as DIY making, hacking, crafting, and open design/manufacturing is shaping debates in HCI and CSCW about participatory innovation dynamics. However, prior research also reveals two limitations, namely, unequal participation in decision-making and the neglect of middle-tier "pro-amateur" end users. In this paper, we use independent [indie] game development as a case to explore the above-mentioned two key issues. Specifically, we highlight the importance of small teams, "crafting," and "democracy" in supporting and facilitating middle-tier end-users' engagement with technology. Our focus on indie game developers, an understudied group of middle-tier end users in HCI and CSCW, offers new empirical evidence of the dynamic process through which pro-amateurs can participate in technological innovation. Understanding their practices and the socio-technological challenges that they face, therefore, informs the design of more participatory technologies that both allow hobbyists' and experts' innovation and support the technological practices performed by users who are at the middle-tier. This not only promotes the democratization of technology and bottom-up innovation but also adds nuance to existing literature on end-user driven technological practices.},

How do people perceive the impacts on their lives should the Internet go out for an extended period of time? Would it be a minor inconvenience or Armageddon? We took a Futures Studies approach to conduct a conceptualized future, scenario-based study with 754 responses to a survey of mostly students at three universities and used framing theory to help explicate the findings from qualitative data analysis. Our data show that most respondents do believe a long-term complete Internet outage is possible; however, perceptions in terms of what the impacts would be range widely. Most participants employ an egocentric frame to understand the impacts in terms of changes in their personal relationships and activities, with both gains and losses envisioned. A minority frame their visions in terms of the societal level, with severe infrastructure problems resulting. This paper is the first to explore perceptions of the potential impacts of an Internet outage and provide implications for preparedness and design.},

Co-located sensemaking occurs when two or more sensemakers forage for useful information within a dataset, creating and leveraging knowledge structures individually and together. Group territories in MDEs support communicating and assembling findings, but questions remain regarding how to best represent individual sensemaking efforts in the group territory to support the sensemaking collaboration. This paper empirically examines exploration of a large Twitter dataset using three group territory paradigms: parallel, connected, and merged. Results reveal that merging group work increases task complexity while separating individuals' sections in the group territory supports monitoring, and more interactions are performed when individual work is not connected in the group territory.},

We use in-depth semi-structured interviews with 20 college student social media users to help build a picture of their sharing processes that can help platform designers and operators better combat fake news dissemination. Participants reflected on specific recently shared news pieces, including how the stories attracted attention, why they shared them, and their behavior after sharing. Interview results revealed different cognitive processes people engaged: before, during and after sharing. Before sharing, participants assessed the news content and evaluated the social value of sharing the particular news piece. During sharing, the audience of the post was selected. After sharing, users examined the feedback from others and revisited previous sharing decisions. The study highlights that decisions about news sharing involve a myriad of different considerations throughout different cognitive stages. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for combating the sharing of fake news.},

For an adequate consideration of these factors, detailed design guidelines and system concepts are currently missing. However, this study shows the potential that a common understanding of consumption data can emerge through suitable visualization to support everyday work and possibilities of data sharing. Therefore, we show exemplarily how a design can be derived from empirically collected requirements and how a system concept can look like that enrich current eco-feedback design research for the industrial context.},

In this paper, we discuss a design fiction that closes this research gap. The descriptions and results of the study are purely fictitious. Excluded is the State of the Art as well as the description of the legal situation of prisons in Germany. The analysis of the fictional study data designed here thus refers to the real world in order to derive ethical guidelines and draw practical conclusions. It is our intention to use these results as a possible basis for further research. The paper presents results of an explorative study dealing with the design, development and evaluation of an AI-based Smart Mirror System, Prison AI 2.0, in a German prison. Prison AI 2.0 was developed for daily use and voluntarily tested by eight prisoners over a period of 12 months to gain insight into their individual and social impact, with an emphasis on its ability to actively support rehabilitation. Based on qualitative data, our findings suggest that intelligent AI-based devices can actually help promote such an outcome. Our results also confirm the valuable impact of (Psychosocial) ICT on the psychological, social and individual aspects of prison life, and in particular how prisoners used the Smart Mirror system to improve and maintain their cognitive, mental and physical state and to restore social interactions with the outside world. With the presentation of these results we want to initiate discussions about the use of ICT by prisoners in closed prisons in order to identify opportunities and risks.},

Despite this, MR also has great potential for real-time co-located cooperation support with the need of short-term decisions and interactions. However, little is known on how this support can be provided. To bridge this gap, we conducted an experiment using a MR visual search task performed by dyads. Based on related work, visual search was chosen to represent typical challenges of short-term cooperative MR tasks. The aim of the experiment was to explore how the participants coordinate their searches and how this influences their performance in a task. We found that participants mainly used embodied and verbal cues to coordinate their searches (rather than virtual cues provided by the HMD) and that less communication worked significantly better, which is in (partial) contrast to existing findings. We discuss potential reasons for and impacts of these findings.},

Though the co-located game jam has been noted as educational, little is known about how learning happens within online game jams. To better understand the ways online game jams support self-development, we interviewed fifteen online jam participants about their learning experiences during their jams. Additionally, we observed and analyzed several jams using activity theory. We found that online game jams support participants' learning through extensive feedback from others during and after the jam. Such feedback sessions were a key social and participatory learning elements for online jams, providing much-need social support. In contrast to the group-focused development in offline jams many participants in our study chose to develop games alone. Many individuals participated in online game jams regularly, treating them as a broader experience than singular events. We use these findings to discuss how we might better design for self-directed learning online and offer suggestions on how to better attune online game jams to the needs of participants.},

In this work, we explore issues and solutions in building heterogeneous co-editing systems, which allow multiple users to use different editors to edit shared documents in the same session. To drive our exploration, we built a prototype heterogeneous co-editing system, named CoVim+CoEmacs, which allows multiple users to use full functionalities and UI features of two comprehensive and rivalry text editors, Vim and Emacs, in the same co-editing session. In this paper, we focus on technical issues in designing and implementing heterogeneous co-editors in general and CoVim+CoEmacs in particular. We have motivated this work by potential usage benefits of heterogeneous co-editing systems and used working scenarios under the CoVim+CoEmacs prototype to illustrate some novel usages and inner workings of such systems, but left systematic user studies on heterogeneous co-editing to future work. We hope the insights and experiences drawn from this work can not only contribute to advancing state-of-the-art collaborative system design and implementation, but also provide inspiration to future heterogeneous collaborative application system designers.},

As with other types of welfare schemes, the application serves as a mechanism of both support and control. From our study, we illustrate how an increased reliance on data is transforming the citizen-caseworker interaction in social welfare. We characterize this transformation as 'dataRication': a phenomenon where the increased reliance on data for decision-support across contexts of data production makes it challenging for individual citizens to contest or correct data-born accounts of their situation. Our contribution is two-fold: Rirst, we empirically characterize the citizen-caseworker interaction in the application process. Second, we discuss how citizens' private resourcing complements the formal application process and provides them with strategies to give authority to their case and exercise personal autonomy. The private resourcing practices we observed show how integrating supplementary accounts from citizens into the systems that caseworkers rely on could make citizens' experiences and social context legible. This in turn has policy and technology design implications as public services increasingly introduce data-driven modes of case management.},

In online creative communities that focus on remix, community members must navigate copyright complexities regarding how they are permitted to re-use existing content. This paper focuses on one such community--transformative fandom--where strong social norms regulate behavior beyond copyright law. We conducted interviews with fan creators about their "unwritten rules" surrounding copying and remix and identified highly consistent social norms that have been remarkably effective in policing this community. In examining how these norms have formed over time, and how they are enforced, we conclude that the effectiveness of norms in encouraging cooperative behavior is due in part to a strong sense of social identity within the community. Furthermore, our findings suggest the benefits of creating formal rules within a community that support existing norms, rather than imposing rules from external sources.},

To alleviate mental health issues and to support identity re-negotiation, mothers are increasingly turning to online mothers' groups, particularly private and secret Facebook groups; these can provide a complex system of social, emotional, and practical support for new mothers. In this paper we present findings from an exploratory interview study of how new mothers create, find, use, and participate in ICTs, specifically online mothers' groups, to combat the lack of formal support systems by developing substitute networks. Utilizing a framework of critical infrastructures, we found that these online substitute networks were created by women, for women, in an effort to fill much needed social, political, and medical gaps that fail to see 'woman and mother' as a whole being, rather than simply as a 'discarded candy wrapper'. Our study contributes to the growing literature on ICT use by mothers for supporting and negotiating new identities, by illustrating how these infrastructures can be re-designed and appropriated in use, for critical utilization.},

However, what's easily overlooked in supporting group creativity is the potential use of nonverbal behavior in communication. When people communicate verbally (e.g., discussing a topic through conversation), they may also co-produce hand movements along with verbal contents as part of the communication process. Going beyond using external interventions for creativity gain, we examine the potential to facilitate worker's in-conversation gesture use as an intrinsic mechanism for bolstering group creativity. In this paper, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the usage and function of hand gestures in computer-mediated group brainstorming. Through a laboratory study, we verified that metaphoric gestures, or producing spatial cues with hands to convey intended concepts, can best influence self's and partner's idea generation. Also, the positive effect of metaphoric gesture is independent of media richness of communication medium (e.g., whether there's visibility or not). The results help to fill in the knowledge gap regarding how gesture use may relate to group creativity, and reveal the potential viability of shaping metaphoric gesture use as an intrinsic creativity support.},

We argue that many issues in recruitment boil down to lack of understanding the process of decision-making from social matching perspective, covering aspects like identification of relevant selection criteria and choice of the most suitable candidate. To better understand the appropriate roles of information technology (IT) in this domain, we interviewed 21 expert matchmakers, such as HR specialists and headhunters. Based on qualitative analysis of their experiences, we provide a bottom-up framework of the decision-making stages in recruitment, focusing on the pertinent challenges from the perspective of social matching. The findings indicate that, particularly, the epistemic asymmetry between the recruiter and candidates regarding the expected qualities calls for deliberation throughout the decision-making process. Matchmakers also struggle between contradictory ideals of agility and holistic decision-making. Based on the findings and relevant literature, we propose six roles that IT could play in social matching decisions in recruitment.},

abstract = {Digital participation has become an important issue in modern societies, typically focusing on groups prone to marginalization. From this perspective, less attention has yet been paid to imprisoned persons. Many penitentiary systems are formally characterized by the basic requirement of resocialization. Accordingly, life in prison should be largely adapted to conditions outside and to fundamental social changes, which must be considered in designing the framework for prison systems. Still, the digital opening of the prison is debated controversially, not least due to anticipated security issues. Hence, to raise awareness about challenges for digital participation of prisoners, we conducted a knowledge-sociological analysis (SKAD) of the public discourse on the use of ICT by prison inmates in Germany. We thereby seek to advance knowledge and insights from social and organizational practice arising from the use of ICT in context of total institutions and create the basis for action from a socio-informatics perspective.},

At the same time, studies have been showing mixed driver experiences on the platform while many of the drivers are working part-time. In this research, we seek to understand why drivers on this platform are working part-time, how this impacts their view of the platform, and what this means for more accurately evaluating the design of these platforms. To investigate this question, we focused on situating ride-sharing in the lives and constellation of gigs that drivers maintain. We collected 53 survey responses and conducted 10 semi-structured interviews with drivers to probe these questions. We found that the extent that drivers categorize themselves as part-time is less about the number of hours worked and more about how dependent they are on ride-sharing income. The level of this dependency seemed to heavily influence how they interacted with the platform and their attitudes towards difficulties faced. It seemed to us that in some ways that the design or functioning of the platform almost pushed users towards working part-time. We discuss the importance of taking these different types of workers and their situations into consideration when evaluating the design and usability of these platforms.},

Over a period of three months, we observed and interviewed ten women aged 42 - 78 to explore how they experienced being involved in knitting, sewing, crocheting, card making and other similar craft forms. Using the ethos of care as a lens to interpret our data, we found that our participants perceived making as an 'outlet' for them to perform activities that support their physical and mental wellbeing. Moreover, they perceived making as a tool to support others in need and help the larger community rather than a self-serving achievement. We also observed how the use of technology was inherent into their craft making activities that supported not only the making processes but also sharing these with others. Our findings highlight the 'care work' that goes into making in such a social setting that generally goes unnoticed when the focus is purely on instrumental and objective aspects of making. We believe that these findings will inform CSCW researchers to think about the not-so-visible qualities of making that elevate care (for self and for others), and to support these via the design of innovative technologies.?},

By focusing on the motivations rather than any particular social media platform, we were able to uncover reasons for voluntary non-use and reversion when users have a choice of several social media platforms. Our findings provide an ecological view of social media non-use and reversion highlighting that 1) previous findings of social media non-use and reversion reported on a single social media platform (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) are seen across several other platforms too; 2) access to multiple social media platforms in itself readily leads to non-use of one platform in favor of the use of another for reasons such as lack of differentiation and/or richness of features, device constraints of storage/ memory space or operating system support, perceptions of fading popularity, and availability of "a new kid on the block;" 3) findings of non-use and reversion practices and motivations that were seemingly incongruent between previous studies of different or same social media platforms tend to coalesce when we take a wider look at the social media landscape. By adopting the theoretical lens of cognitive biases in decision-making we were able to explain why users quit but decide to revert to using again in the environment of various positive and negative experiences on a particular platform, and to reconcile the seemingly paradoxical reasons for social media non-use and reversion.},

However, individuals often encounter psychological barriers that deter them from asking for help. For example, people might have different concerns about asking for help, including acknowledging incompetence, bothering others, and accruing social debt. These perceived social costs limit the potential benefits of help solicitations. In this study, we attempt to investigate whether anonymity (posting a question anonymously), ephemerality (allowing questions to be visible for only a short period), and system routing (having the system handle the question routing) could reduce social costs in a typical online help-seeking behavior-question asking. We built a platform to support these three features and conducted a controlled within-subjects experiment to test their effects on the social costs of posting questions. Results suggest that the presence of anonymity, ephemerality, and system routing reduce social costs. Further, we find that employing anonymity and system routing features did not lower the quality and quantity of answers to the questions in our system.},

abstract = {Denmark is a generous welfare state which provides resources and legal means for fathers to take their parental role seriously and engage with their children. In this paper, we explore the relation between Danish fathers' interaction online and the societal, legal, and economic infrastructures in which they are situated. By focusing on how fathers living in Denmark make use of the Internet and social media sites to facilitate their role as parents, we are able to explore how online engagement is shaped by the different societal 'norms' of parenting. Our research outlines the ways in which societal infrastructures influence how fathers perceive, and subsequently make use of social media in relation to child-caring. We find that fathers discuss their experiences of legal inequities and stereotypical discrimination on social network sites like Facebook. We also study fathers' online reviews of a Danish parenting App, FAR, designed specifically to support fathers. By analyzing social media discussions around fatherhood in Denmark, we found connections to the ways in which the current political climate shapes and influences fatherhood in Denmark, as they reflect the societal infrastructures which situate fathers in contemporary Denmark. Further, we found a strong political interest for collective action to transform the societal infrastructures to support legal equality for child caretaking across genders. This strong political motivation is distinct from existing studies exploring how fatherhood is displayed on social media in other countries such as the USA. On this basis, we argue that research exploring social media use in institutions which are strongly shaped by societal norms, must explicitly consider the role which society takes in shaping such institutions, and include these aspects into the analysis. Our data show that fathers use social media sites as platforms to produce a fatherhood more in line with their lived experience of parenting, and that they advocate for collective political action to strengthen fathers' legal rights.},

Our goal was not only to explore these enjoyable experiences, but more broadly to examine how technology use was recontextualized 'away' from the everyday. Outdoor activities are commonly presented as an escape from our technology-infused world. In contrast, our interviews reveal experiences that are heavily dependent on technology, both digital and not. However, digital technology - and in particular the mobile phone - is reconfigured when taken out of its ordinary, often urban and indoor, context. We first present a diversity of 'aways' during outdoor activities by depicting cherished freedoms and interpersonal preferences. We then describe how participants managed connection and disconnection while away and upon coming back. To conclude, we discuss how constructions of away can support more purposeful engagements with digital technology, and how pointed (dis)connection can be useful for technology design also in non-outdoor settings.},

In contrast to prior works' general account of building a high level of common ground, the breakdowns of content common ground together with the strengthen of process common ground in this process is more beneficial for scientific discovery.

abstract = {In this note, I quantitatively examine various trends in the lengths of published papers in ACM CSCW from 2000-2018, focusing on several major transitions in editorial and reviewing policy. The focus is on the rise and fall of the 4-page note, which was introduced in 2004 as a separate submission type to the 10-page double-column "full paper" format. From 2004-2012, 4-page notes of 2,500 to 4,500 words consistently represented about 20-35% of all publications. In 2013, minimum and maximum page lengths were officially removed, with no formal distinction made between full papers and notes. The note soon completely disappeared as a distinct genre, which co-occurred with a trend in steadily rising paper lengths. I discuss such findings both as they directly relate to local concerns in CSCW and in the context of longstanding theoretical discussions around genre theory and how socio-technical structures and affordances impact participation in distributed, computer-mediated organizations and user-generated content platforms. There are many possible explanations for the decline of the note and the emergence of longer and longer papers, which I identify for future work. I conclude by addressing the implications of such findings for the CSCW community, particularly given how genre norms impact what kinds of scholarship and scholars thrive in CSCW, as well as whether new top-down rules or bottom-up guidelines ought to be developed around paper lengths and different kinds of contributions.},

First, we provide needed definitions and a framework for conceptualizing strategic information operations, highlighting related literatures and noting historical context. Next, we examine three case studies of online information operations using a sociotechnical lens that draws on CSCW theories and methods to account for the mutual shaping of technology, social structure, and human action. Through this lens, we contribute a more nuanced understanding of these operations (beyond "bots" and "trolls") and highlight a persistent challenge for researchers, platform designers, and policy makers-distinguishing between orchestrated, explicitly coordinated, information operations and the emergent, organic behaviors of an online crowd.},

abstract = {This paper presents a unique finding from a larger research project exploring social media use for social support among youth development program participants in Lafayette, IN. Through participant observation and semi-structured interviews conducted with Boys and Girls Club members ages 9-15, youth revealed varied uses of social media to sustain unexpected cross-age friendships. These friendships were perceived as integral sources of social support, and members described them to be some of the most significant in their lives at the time of their interviews. This finding raises important questions about the significant role social media may play in the maintenance of such cross-age relationships and mentorships, considering the absence of consistent face-to-face contact during the school day. Ultimately, participation in youth development programs in combination with social media use fosters these mentorships and encourages maturity and stability among these youth, which validates these unique friendships as important sources of social support. This finding offers implications for integrating digital and social media into youth development spaces, as well as for informing social and digital media designers of this particular use case.},

Although the design of these platforms may foster unbalanced relationships, in this paper, we outline how freelancers and clients on the gig platform Upwork can leverage a network of alliances with external digital platforms to repossess their displaced agency within the gig economy. Building on 39 interviews with Upwork freelancers and clients, we found a dynamic ecosystem of digital platforms that facilitate gig work through and around the Upwork platform. We use actor-network theory to: 1) delineate Upwork's strategy to establish a comprehensive and isolated platform within the gig economy, 2) track human and nonhuman alliances that run counter to Upwork's system design and control mechanisms, and 3) capture the existence of a larger ecosystem of external digital platforms that undergird online freelancing. This work explicates the tensions that Upwork users face, and also illustrates the multiplicity of actors that create alliances to work with, through, around, and against the platform's algorithmic management.},

I identify three framings of imaginaries about autonomous systems: (1) autonomous technology as physical objects, (2) as mathematical rules, and (3) as artificial mangers. I also identify two sometimes conflicting framings of imaginaries about distributed and decentralized technology: these technologies as a new form of production and as freedom from control. These imaginaries intersect in decentralized autonomous systems, and I examine what they can tell us about the design and governance of such technologies. Lastly, I suggest ways of using the concept of imaginaries in participatory design.},

abstract = {Video sharing platforms like YouTube are increasingly targeted by aggression and hate attacks. Prior work has shown how these attacks often take place as a result of "raids," i.e., organized efforts by ad-hoc mobs coordinating from third-party communities. Despite the increasing relevance of this phenomenon, however, online services often lack effective countermeasures to mitigate it. Unlike well-studied problems like spam and phishing, coordinated aggressive behavior both targets and is perpetrated by humans, making defense mechanisms that look for automated activity unsuitable. Therefore, the de-facto solution is to reactively rely on user reports and human moderation. In this paper, we propose an automated solution to identify YouTube videos that are likely to be targeted by coordinated harassers from fringe communities like 4chan. First, we characterize and model YouTube videos along several axes (metadata, audio transcripts, thumbnails) based on a ground truth dataset of videos that were targeted by raids. Then, we use an ensemble of classifiers to determine the likelihood that a video will be raided with very good results (AUC up to 94%). Overall, our work provides an important first step towards deploying proactive systems to detect and mitigate coordinated hate attacks on platforms like YouTube.},

Our interview study of 23 contemporary music composers and choreographers focuses on the role that artifacts play in shaping creative collaborations with performers.

Furthermore, we found that creators sculpt, layer, remix artifacts, moving fluidly across these different forms of interaction throughout the creative process. We conclude that the slippages that occur at the seams between roles and interactions drive creativity forward by opening up pathways into the future.},

Tama was designed taking advantage of research on gaze in conversation. Rather than being activated with a wake word (such as "Ok Google") Tama detects the gaze of a user, moving an articulated 'head' to achieve mutual gaze. We tested Tama's use in a multi-party conversation task, with users successfully activating and receiving a response to over 371 queries (over 10 trials). When Tama worked well, there was no significant difference in length of interaction. However, interactions with Tama had a higher rate of repeated queries, causing longer interactions overall. Video analysis lets us explain the problems users had interacting with gaze. In the discussion, we describe implications for designing new gaze systems, using gaze both as input and output. We also discuss how the relationship to anthropomorphic design and taking advantage of learned skills of interaction. Finally, two paths for future work are proposed, one in the field of speech agents, and the second in using human gaze as an interaction modality more widely.},

Through formative interviews with 11 active moderators from 10 different subreddits, we learned about the limitations of currently available automated tools, and how a new system could extend their capabilities. Developed out of these interviews, Crossmod makes its decisions based on cross-community learning---an approach that leverages a large corpus of previous moderator decisions via an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, we deployed Crossmod in a controlled environment, simulating real-time conversations from two large subreddits with over 10M subscribers each. To evaluate Crossmod's moderation recommendations, 4 moderators reviewed comments scored by Crossmod that had been drawn randomly from existing threads. Crossmod achieved an overall accuracy of 86% when detecting comments that would be removed by moderators, with high recall (over 87.5%). Additionally, moderators reported that they would have removed 95.3% of the comments flagged by Crossmod; however, 98.3% of these comments were still online at the time of this writing (i.e., not removed by the current moderation system). To the best of our knowledge, Crossmod is the first open source, AI-backed sociotechnical moderation system to be designed using participatory methods.},

Our findings show that insufficient resources, schedules, and the distant location of government-supported healthcare facilities were major challenges for the villagers. We also found that villagers' limited knowledge and mistrust of care-providing infrastructure block them from the benefits of available ICT-based supports and resources.

However, when managing a rare disease, patients and their primary caregivers often work with healthcare systems that lack the infrastructure to diagnosis, treat, or provide education on the disease. Little research has explored care coordination practices between patients, family members, and healthcare providers under these circumstances. With the goal of identifying opportunities for technological support, we conducted qualitative interviews with the primary caregivers of children with a rare neurodegenerative disorder, ataxia-telangiectasia. We report on the responsibilities that the primary caregivers take on in response to care teams' lack of experience with the illness, and the ways in which an online health community supports this care coordination work. We also describe barriers that limited participants' use of the online health community, including the emotional consequences of participation and information overload. Based on these findings, we discuss two promising research agendas for supporting rare disease management: facilitating primary caregivers' care coordination tasks and increasing access to online community knowledge.},

Despite the recent effort on thoroughly examining who workers in the gig economy are and what their experience in the gig economy are like, our knowledge on how exactly do workers provide their skills in gig economy, and how worker's strategies on skill provision and expansion relate to their success in gig economy is still lacking. In this paper, we conduct a case study on a prominent gig economy platform, Fiverr.com, to better understand the provision of skills on it through large-scale, data-driven analysis. In particular, we propose the concept of "skill space" from a network perspective to characterize the relationship between different skills by measuring how frequently workers provide different skills together. Through our analysis, we reveal interesting patterns in worker's provision of skills on Fiverr. We then show how these patterns change over time and differ across subgroups of workers with different characteristics. In addition, we find that providing a set of skills that are highly related with each other correlates with a better overall performance in gig economy, and when workers expand their skillsets, expanding to a new skill that is highly-related to the existing skills takes less time and is associated with better performance on the new skill. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for gig economy workers and platform in general.},

This effort requires the engagement of scholars and practitioners from many disciplines. And yet, these disciplines often conceptualize the operative values very differently while referring to them using the same vocabulary. The resulting conflation of ideas confuses discussions about values in technology at disciplinary boundaries. In the service of improving this situation, this paper examines the value of shared vocabularies, analytics, and other tools that facilitate conversations about values in light of these disciplinary specific conceptualizations, the role such tools play in furthering research and practice, outlines different conceptions of "fairness" deployed in discussions about computer systems, and provides an analytic tool for interdisciplinary discussions and collaborations around the concept of fairness. We use a case study of risk assessments in criminal justice applications to both motivate our effort--describing how conflation of different concepts under the banner of "fairness" led to unproductive confusion--and illustrate the value of the fairness analytic by demonstrating how the rigorous analysis it enables can assist in identifying key areas of theoretical, political, and practical misunderstanding or disagreement, and where desired support alignment or collaboration in the absence of consensus.},

Nevertheless, due to the complexity of financial and legal regulations and of policy restrictions, access to and information about available courses are in practice hard to find, and non-funded volunteer initiatives are scarcely visible at all. To address this problem, a newly developed language-course wizard provides orientation for refugees and migrants. Findings indicate that its visual representation is apt to span a broad range of cultural as well as educational backgrounds. Our work demonstrates the need for a detailed approach to understanding the challenges that refugees and other migrants face in practice.

A better understanding is needed with the rise of remote workers in a wide array of industries from oil rig repair to surgery, and the proliferation of heads-up displays or telecommunications devices to support these future work practices. In this study, we explore how the information conveyed through a telepointer is taken up and acted upon by surgical trainees in a laparoscopic surgical telementoring setting. We collected audio and video data of 12 surgical trainees who performed standard laparoscopic surgical tasks on a physical model under the guidance of a surgical trainer. We investigated both action and talk to determine how the telepointer-based information was used. Our findings reveal three main challenges in using the instructional information conveyed through the telepointer including the trainees' tendency of attending to the telepointer instruction as the primary source of information. We argue that the found challenges are socio-technical in nature and require a redesign of the mentoring context as well as the technological tools.},

abstract = {Circadian rhythms determine daily sleep cycles, mood, and cognition. Depending on an individual's circadian preference, or chronotype (i.e.,"early birds" and "night owls"), the rhythms shift earlier or later in the day. Early birds experience circadian arousal peaks earlier in the morning than night owls. Prior work has shown that individuals are more effective at analytic tasks during their peak arousal times but are more creative during their off-peak times. We investigate if these findings hold true for small groups. We find that time of day and a group's majority chronotype impact performance on analytic and creative tasks. Physiological synchrony among group members positively predicts group satisfaction. Specifically, homogeneous groups perform worse on all tasks regardless of time of day, but they achieve greater physiological synchrony and feel more satisfied as a group. Based on these findings, we present and advocate for a temporal dimension of group diversity.},

While prior empirical studies have examined people's privacy concerns of smart homes and their desired ways of mitigating these concerns, the focus was primarily on the end users or device owners. Our research investigated the privacy perceptions and design ideas of smart home bystanders, i.e., people who are not the owners nor the primary users of smart home devices but can potentially be involved in the device usage, such as other family members or guests. We conducted focus groups and co-design activities with eighteen participants. We identified three impacting factors of bystanders' privacy perceptions (e.g., perceived norms) and a number of design factors to mitigate their privacy concerns (e.g., asking for device control). We highlighted bystanders' needs for privacy and controls, as well as the tension of privacy expectations between the owners/users and the bystanders in smart homes. We discussed how future designs can better support and balance the privacy needs of different stakeholders in smart homes.},

In this paper, we consider moderation practices and challenges in the context of real-time, voice-based communication through 25 in-depth interviews with moderators on Discord. Our findings suggest that the affordances of voice-based online communities change what it means to moderate content and interactions. Not only are there new ways to break rules that moderators of text-based communities find unfamiliar, such as disruptive noise and voice raiding, but acquiring evidence of rule-breaking behaviors is also more difficult due to the ephemerality of real-time voice. While moderators have developed new moderation strategies, these strategies are limited and often based on hearsay and first impressions, resulting in problems ranging from unsuccessful moderation to false accusations. Based on these findings, we discuss how voice communication complicates current understandings and assumptions about moderation, and outline ways that platform designers and administrators can design technology to facilitate moderation.},

It reports on ethnographic fieldwork from the Nairobi Play Project, a constructionist educational program serving adolescents aged 14-18 in urban and rural multi-ethnic refugee communities in Kenya. While the program offers programming and game design instruction, an equal goal is to foster interaction, collaboration, dialogue and understanding across cultural backgrounds. Based on fieldwork from two project cycles involving 5 after-school classes of 12-24 students each, we describe key affordances for encounter, important resistances to be managed or overcome, and emergent complications in the execution of such programs. We argue that many important accomplishments of intercultural learning occur through moments of friction, breakdowns, and gaps -- for example, technical challenges that produce sites of shared humour; frictions between intercultural activities and computing activities; acts of disrupting order; and unstructured time that students collaboratively fill in. We also describe significant complications in such programs, including pressures to adopt norms and practices consistent with dominant or majority cultures, and instances of intercultural bonding over artefacts with xenophobic themes. We reflect on the implications of these phenomena for the design of future programs that use computing as a backbone for intercultural learning or diversity and inclusion efforts in CSCW, ICTD, and allied fields of work.},

We work with ethnographic data - six months of observation in Washington D.C. and 48 interviews with staff in the House of Representatives. Customer relation management systems (CRMs) used by Congress are one of numerous technologies expected to enhance responsive communication between citizens and representatives. We find, instead, that these technologies promote the datafication of citizen information that configures and constrains how policymakers engage citizens as legitimate actors within the policy-making process. CRMs not only mediate communication between citizens and policymakers, they shape the idea of what communication between citizens and policymakers can be and how citizens are viewed in the eyes of policymakers and their staff. Thus, we extend our understanding of the ways in which material configurations of communication technologies influence not only how communication acts unfolds, but also how each partner conceives of and engages with the other. This has dramatic implications for the possibilities of digital communication channels to enhance, or uphold, the ideals of a representative democracy.},

abstract = {The livestreaming industry in China is gaining greater traction than its European and North American counterparts and has a profound impact on the stakeholders' online and offline lives. An emerging genre of livestreaming that has become increasingly popular in China is outdoor livestreaming. With outdoor livestreams, streamers broadcast outdoor activities, travel, or socialize with passersby in outdoor settings, often for 6 or more hours, and viewers watch such streams for hours each day. However, given that professionally produced content about travel and outdoor activities are not very popular, it is currently unknown what makes this category of livestreams so engaging and how these techniques can be applied to other content or genres. Thus, we conducted a mixed methods study consisting of a survey (N=287) and interviews (N = 20) to understand how viewers watch and engage with outdoor livestreams in China. The data revealed that outdoor livestreams encompass many categories of content, environments and passersby behaviors create challenges and uncertainty for viewers and streamers, and viewers watch livestreams for surprising lengths of time (e.g., sometimes more than 5 continuous hours). We also gained insights into how live commenting and virtual gifting encourage engagement. Lastly, we detail how the behaviors of dedicated fans and casual viewers differ and provide implications for the design of livestreaming services that support outdoor activities.},

abstract = {The enormous financial success of online advertising platforms is partially due to the precise targeting features they offer. Although researchers and journalists have found many ways that advertisers can target---or exclude---particular groups of users seeing their ads, comparatively little attention has been paid to the implications of the platform's ad delivery process, comprised of the platform's choices about which users see which ads. It has been hypothesized that this process can "skew" ad delivery in ways that the advertisers do not intend, making some users less likely than others to see particular ads based on their demographic characteristics. In this paper, we demonstrate that such skewed delivery occurs on Facebook, due to market and financial optimization effects as well as the platform's own predictions about the "relevance" of ads to different groups of users. We find that both the advertiser's budget and the content of the ad each significantly contribute to the skew of Facebook's ad delivery. Critically, we observe significant skew in delivery along gender and racial lines for "real" ads for employment and housing opportunities despite neutral targeting parameters. Our results demonstrate previously unknown mechanisms that can lead to potentially discriminatory ad delivery, even when advertisers set their targeting parameters to be highly inclusive. This underscores the need for policymakers and platforms to carefully consider the role of the ad delivery optimization run by ad platforms themselves---and not just the targeting choices of advertisers---in preventing discrimination in digital advertising.},

Drawing on an interdisciplinary body of work and reflexive methodological traditions, we propose and describe four facets of the methodology: relationality, difference, dialogic process, and critical subjectivity. Next, we provide examples of the methodology "in practice" by detailing how the facets were implemented in a six-month diary study of digital health tracking. We use the study findings to illustrate how the application of these four facets facilitated a collaborative and dialogic process that enhanced self-knowledge and resulted in a multifaceted understanding of individual and shared health experiences. Finally, we conclude by discussing the methodological contributions of duoethnography for socio-technical research critically examining normative values and ethics in design. We contend that the collaborative intentionality of duoethnography offers a unique contribution and unifying methodology that views the personal as a valuable site of knowledge production, positions knowledge formation as a dialogic process, and promotes alternative ways of knowing and meaning making.},

For instance, recent work has documented ambiance and physical characteristics of homes using pictures from Airbnb, but questions remain on whether this kind of curated data reliably represents everyday life situations. To describe the physical and ambiance features of homes of youth using manual annotations and machine-extracted features, we used a unique dataset of 301 crowdsourced videos of home environments recorded in-situ by young people on weekend nights. Agreement among five independent annotators was high for most studied variables. Results of the annotation task revealed various patterns of youth home spaces, such as the type of room attended (e.g., living room and bedroom), the number and gender of friends present, and the type of ongoing activities (e.g., watching TV alone; or drinking, chatting and eating in the presence of others.) Then, object and scene visual features of places, extracted via deep learning, were found to correlate with ambiances, while sound features did not. Finally, the results of a regression task for inferring ambiances from those features showed that six of the ambiance categories can be inferred with R 2 in the [0.21, 0.69] range. Our work is novel with regard to the type of data (crowdsourced videos of real homes of young people) and the analytical design (combined use of manual annotation and deep learning to identify relevant cues), and contributes to the understanding of home environments represented through digital media.},

Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork with low-income Latino immigrants and their liaisons, we explore how liaisons leverage technology, content, and people to align these worlds; bringing them closer to mutual understanding. We borrow inspiration from the analytical lens of seams suggested by Vertesi to explore how liaisons manage the "seams'' between worlds. This analysis provides a rich and unique perspective of the work that successfully engages immigrant parents with their children's education, as well as the tensions that challenge that engagement. This understanding of the work that liaisons do with and across seams provides insights to inform design directions for technology that could facilitate and amplify their efforts. Finally, we highlight how exploring the seams that liaisons work with can inform the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) on the role of technology in mediation.},

How can we design these algorithms to balance varying interests in a moral, legitimate way?

The key idea of the framework is to enable stakeholders to construct a computational model that represents their views and to have those models vote on their behalf to create algorithmic policy. As a case study, we applied this framework to a matching algorithm that operates an on-demand food donation transportation service in order to adjudicate equity and efficiency trade-offs. The service's stakeholders--donors, volunteers, recipient organizations, and nonprofit employees--used the framework to design the algorithm through a series of studies in which we researched their experiences. Our findings suggest that the framework successfully enabled participants to build models that they felt confident represented their own beliefs. Participatory algorithm design also improved both procedural fairness and the distributive outcomes of the algorithm, raised participants' algorithmic awareness, and helped identify inconsistencies in human decision-making in the governing organization. Our work demonstrates the feasibility, potential and challenges of community involvement in algorithm design.},

Person-Organization (P-O congruence is known to explain employee satisfaction, commitment and absenteeism. This paper proposes a new measure of P-O fit by empirically investigating the similarity of routine within an organization. This measure of routine fit is motivated by the theory of entrainment, which refers to the synchrony of individual and community behaviors. We use unobtrusive bluetooth sensing to examine how the concurrence of latent activity patterns is related to job performance and wellbeing. Routine fit echoes traditional constructs of congruence as it is significantly related to higher task performance and lower workplace deviance. Additionally however, it is also related to greater stress and higher arousal. Prior work in organizational psychology have used single-occasion survey instruments to infer uni-dimensional models of fit. These methods are limited by subjective perceptions of employees. In contrast, we demonstrate a data-driven and multidimensional approach to study normative routines in an organization as a measure of P-O fit. We discuss the potential of our approach in designing technologies that understand the congruence of employee routines and positively impact employee functioning at the workplace.},

We ask here whether, beyond the positive effects of shielding a community from undesirable content, does comment removal actually cause the behavior of the comment's author to improve? We examine this question in a particularly well-moderated community, the ChangeMyView subreddit.The standard analytic approach of interrupted time-series analysis unfortunately cannot answer this question of causality because it fails to distinguish the effect of having made a non-compliant comment from the effect of being subjected to moderator removal of that comment. We therefore leverage a "delayed feedback" approach based on the observation that some users may remain active between the time when they posted the non-compliant comment and the time when that comment is deleted. Applying this approach to such users, we reveal the causal role of comment deletion in reducing immediate noncompliance rates, although we do not find evidence of it having a causal role in inducing other behavior improvements. Our work thus empirically demonstrates both the promise and some potential limits of content removal as a positive moderation strategy, and points to future directions for identifying causal effects from observational data.},

abstract = {"Human-centered machine learning" (HCML) combines human insights and domain expertise with data-driven predictions to answer societal questions. This area's inherent interdisciplinarity causes tensions in the obligations researchers have to the humans whose data they use. This paper studies how scientific papers represent human research subjects in HCML. Using mental health status prediction on social media as a case study, we conduct thematic discourse analysis on 55 papers to examine these representations. We identify five discourses that weave a complex narrative of who the human subject is in this research: Disorder/Patient, Social Media, Scientific, Data/Machine Learning, and Person. We show how these five discourses create paradoxical subject and object representations of the human, which may inadvertently risk dehumanization. We also discuss the tensions and impacts of interdisciplinary research; the risks of this work to scientific rigor, online communities, and mental health; and guidelines for stronger HCML research in this nascent area.},

abstract = {Collective feedback can support an individual's decision-making process. For instance, individuals often seek the advice of friends, family, and co-workers to help them make privacy decisions. However, current technologies often do not provide mechanisms for this type of collaborative interaction. To address this gap, we propose a novel model of Community Oversight for Privacy and Security ("CO-oPS"), which identifies mechanisms for users to interact with people they trust to help one another make digital privacy and security decisions. We apply our CO-oPS model in the context of mobile applications ("apps"). To interrogate and refine this model, we conducted participatory design sessions with 32 participants in small groups of 2-4 people who know one another, with the goal of designing a mobile app that facilitates collaborative privacy and security decision-making. We describe and reflect on the opportunities and challenges that arise from the unequal motivation and trust in seeking support and giving support within and beyond a community. Through this research, we contribute a novel framework for collaborative digital privacy and security decision-making and provide empirical evidence towards how researchers and designers might translate this framework into design-based features.},

abstract = {The rise of co-working and co-living spaces, as well as related shared spaces such as makerspaces and hackerspaces-a group we refer to as various types of "co-spaces" - has helped facilitate a parallel expansion of the "digital nomad (DN)" lifestyle. Digital nomads, colloquially, are those individuals that leverage digital infrastructures and sociotechnical systems to live location-independent lives. In this paper, we use Oldenburg's framework of a first (home), second (work), and third (social) place as an analytical lens to investigate how digital nomads understand the affordance of these different types of spaces. We present an analysis of posts and comments on the '/r/digitalnomad' subreddit, a vibrant online community where DNs ask questions and share advice about the different types of places and amenities that are necessary to pursue their digital nomad lifestyle. We found that places are often assessed positively or negatively relative to one primary characteristic: either they provide a means for nomads to maintain a clear separation between the social and professional aspects of their lives, or they provide a means to merge these aspects together. Digital nomads that favor the first type of place tend to focus on searching for factors that they feel will promote their own work productivity, whereas DNs that favor the second type of place tend to focus on factors that they feel will allow them to balance their work and social lives. We also build on linkages between the notion of a third place and the more recent theoretical construct of social infrastructure. Ultimately, we demonstrate how DNs' interests in co-spaces provide a kind of edge-case for CSCW and HCI scholars to explore how sociotechnical systems, such as variants of co-spaces, inform one another as well as signify important details regarding new ways of living and engaging with technology.},

NAVC uses audio cues inspired by movie soundtracks to convey Attention, Agreement, Disagreement, Happiness, Thinking, and Surprise. When designing NAVC, we partnered with people who are blind or low-vision through a user-centered design process that included need-finding interviews and design reviews. To evaluate NAVC, we conducted a user study with 16 participants. The study provided feedback on the NAVC prototype and showed that the participants could easily discern some cues, like Attention and Agreement, but had trouble distinguishing others. The accuracy of the prototype in detecting conversation cues emerged as a key concern, especially in avoiding false positives and in detecting negative emotions, which tend to be masked in social conversations. This research identified challenges and design opportunities in using AI models to enable accessible video calling.},

In this work, we investigate the key types of information medical experts desire when they are first introduced to a diagnostic AI assistant. In a qualitative lab study, we interviewed 21 pathologists before, during, and after being presented deep neural network (DNN) predictions for prostate cancer diagnosis, to learn the types of information that they desired about the AI assistant. Our findings reveal that, far beyond understanding the local, case-specific reasoning behind any model decision, clinicians desired upfront information about basic, global properties of the model, such as its known strengths and limitations, its subjective point-of-view, and its overall design objective--what it's designed to be optimized for. Participants compared these information needs to the collaborative mental models they develop of their medical colleagues when seeking a second opinion: the medical perspectives and standards that those colleagues embody, and the compatibility of those perspectives with their own diagnostic patterns. These findings broaden and enrich discussions surrounding AI transparency for collaborative decision-making, providing a richer understanding of what experts find important in their introduction to AI assistants before integrating them into routine practice.},

In workshop 2, we introduced MoveOn, a technology probe that lets dancers decompose video into short, repeatable clips to support their learning. This served as an effective analysis tool for identifying the changes in focus and understanding their decomposition and recomposition processes. In workshop 3, we compared the teacher's and dancers' decomposition strategies, and how dancers learn on their own compared to teacher-created decompositions. We found that they all ungroup and regroup dance fragments, but with different foci of attention, which suggests that teacher-imposed decomposition is more effective for introductory dance students, whereas personal decomposition is more suitable for expert dancers. We discuss the implications for designing technology to support analysis, learning and teaching of dance through movement decomposition.},

abstract = {What does reliability mean for building a grounded theory? What about when writing an auto-ethnography? When is it appropriate to use measures like inter-rater reliability (IRR)? Reliability is a familiar concept in traditional scientific practice, but how, and even whether to establish reliability in qualitative research is an oft-debated question. For researchers in highly interdisciplinary fields like computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) and human-computer interaction (HCI), the question is particularly complex as collaborators bring diverse epistemologies and training to their research. In this article, we use two approaches to understand reliability in qualitative research. We first investigate and describe local norms in the CSCW and HCI literature, then we combine examples from these findings with guidelines from methods literature to help researchers answer questions like: "should I calculate IRR?" Drawing on a meta-analysis of a representative sample of CSCW and HCI papers from 2016-2018, we find that authors use a variety of approaches to communicate reliability; notably, IRR is rare, occurring in around 1/9 of qualitative papers. We reflect on current practices and propose guidelines for reporting on reliability in qualitative research using IRR as a central example of a form of agreement. The guidelines are designed to generate discussion and orient new CSCW and HCI scholars and reviewers to reliability in qualitative research.},

abstract = {Community health programs in low-resource settings (like rural Kenya) aim to provide essential health services to vulnerable populations. However, to date, there has been limited research that explores the design of mechanisms that enable care recipients to provide feedback regarding their satisfaction with the services they receive. Such feedback has the potential to increase the motivation of community health workers (CHWs), enhance training procedures, detect fraudulent behavior, and inform key performance indicators for health programs. Our paper explores the design and deployment of a USSD-based system that allows anyone who possesses a basic mobile phone to provide feedback regarding the health services and quality of care they received from a CHW or during a hospital visit. Our system was designed through iterative fieldwork in rural Kenya that engaged with multiple stakeholder groups, including care recipients, CHWs, and high-level decision makers. After designing and testing the system, we deployed it for seven weeks in Siaya, Kenya, collecting both quantitative system usage data and qualitative data from six focus groups with 42 participants. Findings from our deployment show that 168 care recipients engaged with the system, submitting 495 reports via USSD. We discuss the broader factors impacting deployment, including the feasibility of USSD, actionability of feedback, scalability, and sustainability. Taken together, our findings suggest that USSD is a promising approach for enabling care recipients to submit feedback in a way that balances privacy, equity, and sustainability.},

abstract = {Stress and depression are a common affliction in all walks of life. When left unmanaged, stress can inhibit productivity or cause depression. Depression can occur independently of stress. There has been a sharp rise in mobile health initiatives to monitor stress and depression. However, these initiatives usually require users to install dedicated apps or multiple sensors, making such solutions hard to scale. Moreover, they emphasise sensing individual factors and overlook social interactions, which plays a significant role in influencing stress and depression while being a part of a social system. We present StressMon, a stress and depression detection system that leverages single-attribute location data, passively sensed from the WiFi infrastructure. Using the location data, it extracts a detailed set of movement, and physical group interaction pattern features without requiring explicit user actions or software installation on client devices. These features are used in two different machine learning models to detect stress and depression. To validate StressMon, we conducted three different longitudinal studies at a university with different groups of students, totalling up to 108 participants. Our evaluation demonstrated StressMon detecting severely stressed students with a 96.01% True Positive Rate (TPR), an 80.76% True Negative Rate (TNR), and a 0.97 area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (a score of 1 indicates a perfect binary classifier) using a 6-day prediction window. In addition, StressMon was able to detect depression at 91.21% TPR, 66.71% TNR, and 0.88 AUC using a 15-day window. We end by discussing how StressMon can expand CSCW research, especially in areas involving collaborative practices for mental health management.},

abstract = {Patient safety errors account for over 400,000 preventable deaths annually in US in hospitals alone, 70% of which are caused by team communication breakdowns, stemming from hierarchical structures and asymmetrical power dynamics between physicians, nurses, patients, and others. Nurses are uniquely positioned to identify and prevent these errors, but they are often penalized for speaking up, particularly when physicians are responsible. Nevertheless, empowering nurses and building strong interdisciplinary teams can lead to improved patient safety and outcomes. Thus, our group has been developing a series of intelligent systems that support teaming in safety critical settings, Robot-Centric Team Support System (RoboTSS), and recently developed a group detection and tracking system for collaborative robots. In this paper, we explore how RoboTSS can be used to empower nurses in interprofessional team settings, through a three month long, collaborative design process with nurses across five US-based hospitals. The main findings and contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we found that participants envisioned using a robotic crash cart to guide resuscitation procedures to improve efficiency and reduce errors. Second, nurses discussed how RoboTSS can generate choreography for efficient spatial reconfigurations in co-located clinical teams, which is particularly important in time-sensitive situations such as resuscitation. Third, we found that nurses want to use RoboTSS to "stop the line," and disrupt power dynamics by policing unsafe physician behavior, such as avoiding safety protocols using a robotic crash cart. Fourth, nurses envisioned using our system to support real-time error identification, such as breaking the sterile field, and then communicating those errors to physicians, to relieve them of responsibility. Finally, based on our findings, we propose robot design implications that capture how nurses envision utilizing RoboTSS. We hope this work promotes further exploration in how to design technology to challenge authority in asymmetrical power relationships, particularly in healthcare, as strong teams save lives.},

This paper presents a qualitative analysis of data from a field study of an approach to helping survivors of intimate partner violence (IPV) with technology abuse. In this approach, called clinical computer security, a trained technologist performs a face-to-face consultation with an IPV survivor to help them understand and navigate technology issues. Findings from consultations with 31 survivors, as well as IPV professionals working on their behalf, uncovered a range of digital security and privacy vulnerabilities exacerbated by the nuanced social context of such abuse.In this paper we explore survivor experiences with, and reactions to, the consultations, discussing (1) the ways in which survivors present their tech concerns, (2) the cooperative work required to guide survivors towards understanding probable causes of tech insecurity, (3) survivors' reactions to the consultations, particularly when security vulnerabilities or spyware are discovered, and (4) the role we play as consultants and interventionists in the complex socio-technical systems involved in mitigating IPV. We conclude by discussing some of the broad ethical and sustainability challenges raised by our work, and provide design opportunities for tech platforms to better support survivors of IPV.},

abstract = {Both hashtag activists and news organizations assume that trending political hashtags effectively capture the nowness of social issues that people care about [20]. In fact, news organizations with growing social media presence increasingly capitalize the use of political hashtags in article headlines and social media news post - a practice aimed to generate new readership through lightweight news consumption of content by linking a particular story to a broader topic [28]. However, response to political hashtags can be complicated as demonstrated with the events surrounding #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter. In fact, the semantic simplicity of political hashtags often belies the complexities around the question of who gets to participate [71], what intersectional identities are included or excluded from the hashtag [45], as well as how the meaning of the hashtag expands and drifts [10] depending on the context through which it is expressed. Overtime, reports show increasing backlash [70, 73, 74] and polarization [21, 52, 66, 67, 70] against key issues embodied by political hashtags. In this vein, we assume that political hashtags affect how people make sense of and engage with media content. However, we do not know how the presence of political hashtags -signaling that a news story is related to a current social issue - influences the assumptions potential readers make about the social content of an article. In this work we conducted a randomized control experiment to examine how the presence of political hashtags (particularly the most prevalently used #MeToo and #BlackLivesMatter) in social media news posts shape reactions across a general audience (n=1979). Our findings show that compared to the control group, people shown news posts with political hashtags perceive the news topic as less socially important and are less motivated to know more about social issues related to the post. People also find the news more partisan and controversial when hashtags are included. In fact, negative perception associated with political hashtags (partisan bias &amp; topic controversy) mediates people's motivation to further engage with the news content). High-intensity Facebook users and politically moderate participants perceive news with political hashtags as more partisan compared to posts excluding hashtags. There are also significant differences in discourse patterns between the hashtag and control groups around how politically moderate respondents engage with the news content in their comments.},

abstract = {Intergroup contact has long been considered as an effective strategy to reduce prejudice between groups. However, recent studies suggest that exposure to opposing groups in online platforms can exacerbate polarization. To further understand the behavior of individuals who actively engage in intergroup contact in practice, we provide a large-scale observational study of intragroup behavioral differences between members with and without intergroup contact. We leverage the existing structure of NBA-related discussion forums on Reddit to study the context of professional sports. We identify fans of each NBA team as members of a group and trace whether they have intergroup contact. Our results show that members with intergroup contact use more negative and abusive language in their affiliated group than those without such contact, after controlling for activity levels. We further quantify different levels of intergroup contact and show that there may exist nonlinear mechanisms regarding how intergroup contact relates to intragroup behavior. Our findings provide complementary evidence to experimental studies in a novel context and also shed light on possible reasons for the different outcomes in prior studies.},

These design sharing platforms are important sources for design inspiration, but our survey with GUI designers suggests additional information needs unmet by existing design sharing platforms. First, designers need to see the practical use of certain GUI designs in real applications, rather than just artworks. Second, designers want to see not only the overall designs but also the detailed design of the GUI components. Third, designers need advanced GUI design search abilities (e.g., multi-facets search) and knowledge discovery support (e.g., demographic investigation, cross-company design comparison). This paper presents Gallery D.C. http://mui-collection.herokuapp.com/, a gallery of GUI design components that harness GUI designs crawled from millions of real-world applications using reverse-engineering and computer vision techniques. Through a process of invisible crowdsourcing, Gallery D.C. supports novel ways for designers to collect, analyze, search, summarize and compare GUI designs on a massive scale. We quantitatively evaluate the quality of Gallery D.C. and demonstrate that Gallery D.C. offers additional support for design sharing and knowledge discovery beyond existing platforms.},

abstract = {Much of political debate focuses on the concern that machines might take over. Yet in many domains it is much more plausible that the ultimate choice and responsibility remain with a human decision-maker, but that she is provided with machine advice. A quintessential illustration is the decision of a judge to bail or jail a defendant. In multiple jurisdictions in the US, judges have access to a machine prediction about a defendant's recidivism risk. In our study, we explore how receiving machine advice influences people's bail decisions. We run a vignette experiment with laypersons whom we test on a subsample of cases from the database of this prediction tool. In study 1, we ask them to predict whether defendants will recidivate before tried, and manipulate whether they have access to machine advice. We find that receiving machine advice has a small effect, which is biased in the direction of predicting no recidivism. In the field, human decision makers sometimes have a chance, after the fact, to learn whether the machine has given good advice. In study 2, after each trial we inform participants of ground truth. This does not make it more likely that they follow the advice, despite the fact that the machine is (on average) slightly more accurate than real judges. This also holds if initially the advice is mostly correct, or if it initially is mostly to predict (no) recidivism. Real judges know that their decisions affect defendants' lives. They may also be concerned about reelection or promotion. Hence a lot is at stake. In study 3 we emulate high stakes by giving participants a financial incentive. An incentive to find the ground truth, or to avoid false positive or false negatives, does not make participants more sensitive to machine advice. But an incentive to follow the advice is effective.},

The chatbot use cases emerged primarily as the first line of support. The participants, especially the mothers, were enthusiastic with the opportunity to ask questions and get reliable answers. We also observed the influencing role of female relative, e.g. mothers-in-law, in breastfeeding practices. Our analysis of user information-seeking suggests that a majority of questions (88%) are of nature that can be answered by a chatbot application. We further observe that the queries are embedded deeply into myths and existing belief systems. Therefore requiring the designers to focus on subtle aspects for providing information such as positive reinforcement and contextual sensitivity. Further, we discuss, different societal and ethical issues associated with Chatbot usage for a public health topic such as breastfeeding education.},

We designed a mobile learning-based peer-led educational intervention, and conducted an eight week long between-group study with 120 CHWs across four districts of Delhi, India. We found that CHWs were able to participate and use the system on their own leading to significant knowledge gains and increased desire to learn. With little guidance, CHWs exhibited benefits of collaborative learning in terms of positive interdependence on each other and use of interpersonal skills. The informal peer learning environment encouraged CHWs to have discourses on deeper societal aspects e.g. their role in society.},

While universalism in such research is widely rejected, sole focus on the "particular'' is also commonly critiqued. Kentaro Toyama unpacks this tension, calling for balance via "deliberate efforts to understand the interplay of human universals and cultural differences, and how it pertains to design.'' In this paper, one such deliberate effort, we introduce the notion of feminist solidarity---as theorized by Chandra Mohanty---for drawing connections across borders in CSCW and HCI research, design, and practice. To enable contributions in these fields to cross cultures and geographies in productive ways, we draw attention to commonalities in the struggles and processes of resistance operating in different contexts of study. To do this, we present lessons learned from conducting three comparative studies in six contexts, which were located across various borders. The primary contribution of our analysis is to leverage a feminist solidarity-based approach towards extending conversations on comparative, transnational, and feminist CSCW and HCI research, design, and practice. Our focus remains on resource-constrained regions across the world, in both the Global North and South.},

abstract = {Patient-Provider Communication (PPC) is crucial to the quality and outcome of healthcare practices. With the development of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), ICT mediated PPC has become increasingly commonplace, and has been extensively studied. However, prior research has primarily focused on the institutional use of ICTs for PPC, with institutional support and regulation, while the personal use of ICTs for this purpose has been mostly under-explored. This paper presents a qualitative study of the use of WeChat, a general mobile social application, that has been personally appropriated for PPC in China. Sixteen patients and seven physicians, who had experience using WeChat for PPC, were recruited and interviewed to gain an understanding from both perspectives on how WeChat was utilized for the communication purposes between them. We found that the use of WeChat helped to strengthen the relationship between patients and providers, and provided a psychological reassurance that the structure of the current Chinese health system doesn't provide. Most importantly, we found that the use of WeChat was dependent on the negotiation and management of boundaries that address various concerns associated with the use of ICTs for PPC, such as workload and safety. In this paper, we will highlight the boundary negotiation practices and discuss implications based on the findings.},

Research shows that social support and personal narrative construction are important when recovering from personal crises and traumatic events. As an online community focused on writing fanfiction and also consisting of a large number of LGBTQ members, transformative fandom provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between support, crisis, and narrative. Through an interview study with 31 LGBTQ fanfiction authors, our findings mirror Herman's model of trauma recovery: these spaces self-organize to support recovery work through constructing "community narratives" that help LGBTQ people establish safety when exploring their identity and build LGBTQ support structures without publicly outing themselves before they are ready, challenge stereotypes, and support others through reshaping existing media that perpetuate inaccurate or harmful LGBTQ narratives. These online communities embody "selective visibility"--that is, though not specifically designed as support structures for identity work and recovery, their design allows people to selectively find and create communities of support for stigmatized issues that they might be unable to safely seek out in other spaces. Based on lessons learned, we generate insights that can inform the design of safe support spaces online.},

We interviewed autistic adults about their perceptions of VC compared to other computer- mediated communications (CMC) and face-to-face interactions. We developed a neurodiversity-sensitive model of CMC that describes how stressors such as sensory sensitivities, cognitive load, and anxiety, contribute to their preferences for CMC channels. We learned that they apply significant effort to construct coping strategies to support their sensory, cognitive, and social needs. These strategies include moderating their sensory inputs, creating mental models of conversation partners, and attempting to mask their autism by adopting neurotypical behaviors. Without effective strategies, interviewees experience more stress, have less capacity to interpret verbal and non-verbal cues, and feel less empowered to participate. Our findings reveal critical needs for autistic users. We suggest design opportunities to support their ability to comfortably use VC, and in doing so, point the way towards making VC more comfortable for all.},

While the link between discrimination and diminished psychological and physical well-being is well established, existing research largely focuses on chronic discrimination and long-term outcomes. A better understanding of the short-term behavioral correlates of discrimination events could help us to concretely quantify such experiences, which in turn could support policy and intervention design. In this paper we specifically examine, for the first time, what behaviors change and in what ways in relation to discrimination. We use actively-reported and passively-measured markers of health and well-being in a sample of 209 first-year college students over the course of two academic quarters. We examine changes in indicators of psychological state in relation to reports of unfair treatment in terms of five categories of behaviors: physical activity, phone usage, social interaction, mobility, and sleep. We find that students who encounter unfair treatment become more physically active, interact more with their phone in the morning, make more calls in the evening, and spend more time in bed on the day of the event. Some of these patterns continue the next day. Our results further our understanding of the impact of discrimination and can inform intervention work.},

Through this study, we consider implications for the intervention and design of 'data-driven innovation', with a particular focus on distributed ledger technologies. We argue that these technologies inevitably engage in valuation, and require careful attention to the ongoing processes by which value is translated and performed by different stakeholders.},

We use a mixed methods approach to identify issues that emerge in the Native Candidates data set, including issues of representation and protean usage of the "Make America Great Again" hashtag #maga. When examining the feeds of selected candidates, we find that there can be a disconnect between the issues that candidates align themselves with on social media and the issues that they are associated with by others. We also find evidence of Indigenous issues spanning a vast political spectrum and being coupled with other issues in different ways by different candidates and audiences. Finally, we examine the intersection between Native American candidates and the#NativeVote movement to discover emergent issue networks, including networks around voter suppression and Indigenous political action. Critically, we discuss how our interdisciplinary Indigenous feminist approach to social media analysis illuminates issues of marginalized communities in both a systematic and inductive manner that allows us to discover new patterns and issues with limited a priori knowledge about a complex system.},

While previous work has focused on the challenges that people with disabilities experience using public transportation and how they interact with ridesharing drivers, little research has focused on the people in the "front seat" and how drivers support people with vision impairments during rides. To better understand these interactions, we interviewed 18 ridesharing drivers who had experience driving passengers with a disability, specifically people with vision impairments. Our findings show that ridesharing drivers engage in different forms of labor (i.e. physical, relational) to support passengers with disabilities and are seeking ways to learn more about disability. Contrary to most previous literature on ridesharing and the sharing economy, we find that drivers do not see this labor as a burden. We discuss ethical and design considerations for the complex process of disability disclosure, wherein passengers might benefit from having drivers know in advance about their disability, but also open themselves up to possible exploitation by drivers.},

abstract = {Live streaming is an emergent social medium that allows remote interaction between the streamer and an audience of any size. Major live-streaming platforms in some Asian countries have a digital gift-giving feature that allows viewers to directly reward streamers during live sessions. Streamers can later exchange the digital gifts they have received for money, and this monetary incentive appears likely to influence how they interact with their viewers and generate live-streaming content. However, the precise nature and mechanisms of such impact have not previously been explored. Therefore, this qualitative study with 13 streamer participants examines how digital gifting influences streamers' motivations and the nature of both the content that they generate and their social interactions with their audiences. It reports that the digital-gifting function serves as a major incentive for active streaming, but may also disincentivize some streamers from continuing to contribute, for reasons that will be explored. Moreover, the participants devised strategies for both content generation and social interaction with the specific objective of earning gifts from viewers: practices that, in some cases, appeared to limit the quality of their live-streaming content. It was also noted that the streamers tended to have constrained social relationships with their viewers, in part because such relationships were seen as unequal or one-sided due to gift-giving behavior. The paper concludes with a discussion of design considerations for the incorporation of gift-giving features into live-streaming platforms, and additional recommendations for future research and the design of such platforms.},

abstract = {Participatory sensing systems in which people actively participate in the data collection process must account for both the needs of data contributors and the data collection goals. Existing approaches tend to emphasize one or the other, with opportunistic and directed approaches making opposing tradeoffs between providing convenient opportunities for contributors and collecting high-fidelity data. This paper explores a new, hybrid approach, in which collected data-even if low-fidelity initially-can provide useful information to data contributors and inspire further contributions. We realize this approach with 4X, a multi-stage data collection framework that first collects data opportunistically by requesting contributions at specific locations along users' routes and then uses collected data to direct users to locations of interest to make additional contributions that build data fidelity and coverage. To study the efficacy of 4X, we implemented 4X into LES, an application for collecting information about campus locations and events. Results from two field deployments (N = 95, N = 18) show that the 4X framework created 34% more opportunities for contributing data without increasing disruption, and yielded 49% more data by directing users to locations of interest. Our results demonstrate the value and potential of multi-stage, dynamic data collection processes that draw on multiple sources of motivation for data, and how they can be used to better meet data collection goals as data becomes available while avoiding unnecessary disruption.},

In addition to studying how people share information and seek and provide emotional support, a growing area of interest is health activism. In this paper, we analyze how a project centered around sharing "real and raw" experiences with dementia provides a safe platform for people to share their authentic experiences. These accounts counter predominant depictions of dementia and push back on tokenistic involvement of people with this condition. In a study involving observations and interviews with members of this project, we find that people with dementia must negotiate several goals which at times compete with each other: sharing a "real and raw" look at dementia, changing attitudes, showcasing a polished presentation, and inhabiting a safe space. The paper concludes with a discussion of future directions for CSCW on configuring a space for dialogue on sensitive topics, health activism, and sharing online with dementia.},

In this paper, we conduct a qualitative and quantitative study of digital account sharing practices in the workplace. Across two surveys, we examine the sharing process at work, probing what accounts people share, how and why they share those accounts, and identifying the major challenges people face in sharing accounts. Our results demonstrate that account sharing in the modern workplace serves as a norm rather than a simple workaround; centralizing collaborative activity and reducing boundary management effort are key motivations for sharing. But people still struggle with a lack of activity accountability and awareness, conflicts over simultaneous access, difficulties controlling access, and collaborative password use. Our work provides insights into the current difficulties people face in workplace collaboration with online account sharing, as a result of inappropriate designs that still assume a single-user model for accounts. We highlight opportunities for CSCW and HCI researchers and designers to better support sharing by multiple people in a more usable and secure way.},

Whatever the cause of difficulty in conceiving, little is known about how men find support when dealing with fertility issues, or when or how online resources are being used. This paper reports on a qualitative study of anonymous online posts (N=603) from forums related to fertility that are used by men. We analysed this data using thematic analysis to understand how men are using online forums as a resource when experiencing fertility issues. We found that online forums play a valued role in facilitating connections between men experiencing an often stigmatised condition. These forums offer men accessible and private spaces which allow for more open discussion, helping them to make sense of their situation. We discuss our findings in relation to Genuis and Bronstein's model of finding a "new normal" and present our elaborated model of finding a "new normal" in the context of experiencing fertility problems.},

abstract = {This paper examines the use of the abstract comic form for persuading online charitable donations. Persuading individuals to contribute to charitable causes online is hard and responses to the appeals are typically low; charitable donations share the structure of public goods dilemmas where the rewards are distant and non-exclusive. In this paper, we examine if comics in abstract form are more persuasive than in the plain text form. Drawing on a rich literature on comics, we synthesized a three-panel abstract comic to create our appeal. We conducted a between-subject study with 307 participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk on the use of abstract comic form to appeal for charitable donations. As part of our experimental procedure, we sought to persuade individuals to contribute to a real charity focused on Autism research with monetary costs. We compared the average amount of donation to the charity under three conditions: the plain text message, an abstract comic that includes the plain text, and an abstract comic that additionally includes the social proof. We use Bayesian modeling to analyze the results, motivated by model transparency and its use in small-sized studies. Our experiments reveal that the message in abstract comic form elicited significantly more donations than text form (medium to large effect size=0.59). Incorporating social proof in the abstract comic message did not show a significant effect. Our studies have design implications: non-profits and governmental agencies interested in alleviating public goods dilemmas that share a similar structure to our experiment (single-shot task, distant, non-exclusive reward) ought to consider including messages in the abstract comic form as part of their online fund-raising campaign.},

abstract = {How does the number of collaborators affect individual productivity? Results of prior research have been conflicting, with some studies reporting an increase in individual productivity as the number of collaborators grows, while other studies showing that the free-rider effect skews the effort invested by individuals, making larger groups less productive. The difference between these schools of thought is substantial: if a super-scaling effect exists, as suggested by former studies, then as groups grow, their productivity will increase even faster than their size, super-linearly improving their efficiency. We address this question by studying two planetary-scale collaborative systems: GitHub and Wikipedia. By analyzing the activity of over 2 million users on these platforms, we discover that the interplay between group size and productivity exhibits complex, previously-unobserved dynamics: the productivity of smaller groups scales super-linearly with group size, but saturates at larger sizes. This effect is not an artifact of the heterogeneity of productivity: the relation between group size and productivity holds at the individual level. People tend to do more when collaborating with more people. We propose a generative model of individual productivity that captures the non-linearity in collaboration effort. The proposed model is able to explain and predict group work dynamics in GitHub and Wikipedia by capturing their maximally informative behavioral features, and it paves the way for a principled, data-driven science of collaboration.},

abstract = {Understanding the roles of social factors in online purchase behavior has been a long standing research problem. The recently emerging social e-commerce platforms leverage the stimulated word-of-mouth effect to promote the sales of items, which offers a peek into the complex interplay between the social influence and online purchasing behavior. In this paper, we investigate this problem on a full-scale purchase behavior dataset from one of the leading social e-commerce platforms, Beidian. Specifically, we conduct a comparison study between the social e-commerce and conventional e-commerce that are both integrated in Beidian to examine how social factors affect user's purchase behavior. We reveal that social e-commerce leads to a 3.09~10.37 times higher purchase conversion rate compared with the conventional settings, which indicates users make purchase with significantly fewer item explorations. Then, we propose and validate four primary mechanisms that contribute to the efficient purchase conversion: better matching, social enrichment, social proof and price sensitivity. Moreover, we identify several behavioral indicators that are able to measure the effect of these mechanisms, based on which we design an accurate predictive model (AUC=0.7738) for user's purchase decision. These results combine to shed light on how to understand and model the purchase behavior in social e-commerce.},

We found that participants tailored their apps to express their identities, organizational culture, and intimate bonds with others. They also experienced expression breakdowns: frustrations around barriers to transferring personal forms of expression across apps, which inspired inventive workarounds to maintain cross-app habits of expression, such as briefly switching apps to generate and export content for a particular conversation. We conclude with implications for personalized expression in ecosystems of communication apps.},

Though past work hints to human-like attributes that are ported onto these devices, the anthropomorphization of voice assistants has not been studied in depth. Through a study deploying Amazon Echo Dot Devices in the homes of older adults, we provide a preliminary assessment of how individuals 1) perceive having social interactions with the voice agent, and 2) ontologically categorize the voice assistants. Our discussion contributes to an understanding of how well-developed theories of anthropomorphism apply to voice assistants, such as how the socioemotional context of the user (e.g., loneliness) drives increased anthropomorphism. We conclude with recommendations for designing voice assistants with the ontological category in mind, as well as implications for the design of technologies for social companionship for older adults.},

In order to develop next-generation computer-supported collaborative systems that enhance CPS processes and outcomes by monitoring and responding to the unfolding collaboration, we investigate automated detection of three critical CPS process ? construction of shared knowledge, negotiation/coordination, and maintaining team function ? derived from a validated CPS framework. Our data consists of 32 triads who were tasked with collaboratively solving a challenging visual computer programming task for 20 minutes using commercial videoconferencing software. We used automatic speech recognition to generate transcripts of 11,163 utterances, which trained humans coded for evidence of the above three CPS processes using a set of behavioral indicators. We aimed to automate the trained human-raters' codes in a team-independent fashion (current study) in order to provide automatic real-time or offline feedback (future work). We used Random Forest classifiers trained on the words themselves (bag of n-grams) or with word categories (e.g., emotions, thinking styles, social constructs) from the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) tool. Despite imperfect automatic speech recognition, the n-gram models achieved AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) scores of .85, .77, and .77 for construction of shared knowledge, negotiation/coordination, and maintaining team function, respectively; these reflect 70%, 54%, and 54% improvements over chance. The LIWC-category models achieved similar scores of .82, .74, and .73 (64%, 48%, and 46% improvement over chance). Further, the LIWC model-derived scores predicted CPS outcomes more similar to human codes, demonstrating predictive validity. We discuss embedding our models in collaborative interfaces for assessment and dynamic intervention aimed at improving CPS outcomes.},

Traditionally, summarization algorithms have been evaluated only based on how well they match human-written summaries (e.g. as measured by ROUGE scores). In this work, we propose to evaluate summarization algorithms from a completely new perspective that is important when the user-generated data to be summarized comes from different socially salient user groups, e.g. men or women, Caucasians or African-Americans, or different political groups (Republicans or Democrats). In such cases, we check whether the generated summaries fairly represent these different social groups. Specifically, considering that an extractive summarization algorithm selects a subset of the textual units (e.g. microblogs) in the original data for inclusion in the summary, we investigate whether this selection is fair or not. Our experiments over real-world microblog datasets show that existing summarization algorithms often represent the socially salient user-groups very differently compared to their distributions in the original data. More importantly, some groups are frequently under-represented in the generated summaries, and hence get far less exposure than what they would have obtained in the original data. To reduce such adverse impacts, we propose novel fairness-preserving summarization algorithms which produce high-quality summaries while ensuring fairness among various groups. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to produce fair text summarization, and is likely to open up an interesting research direction.},

As a result, caring for pediatric patients with a chronic illness such as cancer is becoming a daunting task for parental caregivers. They are expected to fulfill the caregiving needs of managing the child's health condition and treatment while also meeting the parenting needs of translating knowledge, communicating about the illness, and making numerous decisions on a daily basis for their sick child due to the child's young age. Drawing on 15 semi-structured interviews, we examined parental caregivers' perspectives on raising a child while also managing the child's health. We identified three tensions that participants encountered as they balanced parenting and caregiving responsibilities: (i) tension between ensuring the child's health and safety and attending to the child's social development, (ii) tension between disclosing health-related information and minimizing the psychological burden on the child, and (iii) tension between rewarding the child's cooperation in treatment and maintaining discipline. Together, these tensions reveal an ongoing process through which caregivers assess and interpret their actions and responsibilities relative to anticipated consequences across multiple time scales. These findings reveal opportunities for sociotechnical systems to account for and support this active process of iterative cycles of assessment.},

Most of this literature represents attempts to support assembly-oriented participation, wherein decisions are made through discussion, although referendum-type participation, involving decision-making based on voting, has gained attention too. Primarily, those papers addressing agenda-setting have examined organization-led forms, in which the agenda is controlled by those issuing the call for participation. Accordingly, the authors call for more research into support for representative models and participant-driven agenda-setting. Furthermore, the literature review pinpoints areas wherein further interdisciplinary engagement may be expected to improve research quality: in political science, HCI-informed methods and new ways of using physical input in participation merit more research, while, from the HCI side, cultivating closer relationships with political science concepts such as democratic innovations and calculus of voting could encourage reconsideration of the research foci. These observations speak to the benefits of a new research agenda for human--computer interaction research, involving different forms of participation, most importantly to address lack of engagement under the representative model of participation. Furthermore, in light of these findings, the paper discusses what type of interdisciplinary research is viable in the HCI field today and how political science and HCI scholars could usefully collaborate.},

abstract = {Bystander intervention can reduce the amount of cyberbullying victimization on social media, but bystanders often fail to act. Limited accountability for their behavior and a lack of empathy for the victim are frequently cited as reasons for why bystanders do not act against cyberbullying. We developed design interventions that aimed to increase accountability and empathy among bystanders. In Study 1, participants were experimentally exposed to three social media posts with different types of empathy nudges. Empathy nudges embedded into social media posts displayed the potential to motivate empathy. In Study 2, participants took part in a 3-day experiment that simulated a social media experience. Results suggested that increased social transparency on social media promoted accountability through heightened self-presentation concerns, but empathy nudges did not encourage greater bystander empathy. Both accountability and empathy predicted bystander intervention, but the types of bystander actions promoted by each mechanism differed. We consider how these results contribute to theories of bystander behavior and designing social media to promote prosocial behaviors.},

abstract = {Communication when submitting patches (CSP) is critical in software development, because ineffective communication wastes the time of developers and reviewers, and is even harmful to future product release and maintenance. In distributed software development, CSP is usually in the form of computer-mediated communication (CMC), which is a crucial topic concerned by the CSCW community. However, what to say and how to say in communication including CSP has been rarely studied. To bridge this knowledge gap and provide relevant guidance for developers to conduct CSP, in this study, we conducted an empirical study on the Linux kernel. We found four themes involving 17 expression elements that characterize what to express when submitting patches and three themes of contextual factors that determine how these elements are applied. Considering both expression elements and context, combined with an online survey, we obtained 17 practices for communication. Among them, four practices, such as "provide sufficient reasons" and "provide a trade-off" are the most important but difficult practices, for which we provide specific instructions. We also found that the "individual factors" plays a special role in communication, which may lead to potential problems even in accepted patches. Based on these findings, we discuss the recommendations for different practitioners, including patch submitters, reviewers, and tool designers, and the implications for open source software (OSS) communities and the CSCW researchers.},

We argue that this "added" work is instrumental in "making" payments accessible. We discuss how ride-hailing platforms mediated collaborations between drivers and riders in relation to payments, while still making "moneywork" essential.

abstract = {Birth stories have become increasingly common on the internet, but they have received little attention as a computational dataset. These unsolicited, publicly posted stories provide rich descriptions of decisions, emotions, and relationships during a common but sometimes traumatic medical experience. These personal details can be illuminating for medical practitioners, and due to their shared structures, birth stories are also an ideal testing ground for narrative analysis techniques. We present an analysis of 2,847 birth stories from an online forum and demonstrate the utility of these stories for computational work. We discover clear sentiment, topic and persona-based patterns that both model the expected narrative event sequences of birth stories and highlight diverging pathways and exceptions to narrative norms. The authors' motivation to publicly post these personal stories can be a way to regain power after a surveilled and disempowering experience, and we explore power relationships between the personas in the stories, showing that these dynamics can vary with the type of birth (e.g., medicated vs unmedicated). Finally, birth stories exist in a space that is both public and deeply personal. This liminality poses a challenge for analysis and presentation, and we discuss tradeoffs and ethical practices for this collection.

abstract = {Researchers and the media have become increasingly interested in protest users, or people who change (protest use) or stop (protest non-use) their use of a company's products because of the company's values and/or actions. Past work has extensively engaged with the phenomenon of technology non-use but has not focused on non-use (nor changed use) in the context of protest. With recent research highlighting the potential for protest users to exert leverage against technology companies, it is important for technology stakeholders to understand the prevalence of protest users, their motivations, and the specific tactics they currently use. In this paper, we report the results of two surveys (n = 463 and n = 398) of representative samples of American web users that examine if, how, and why people have engaged in protest use and protest non-use of the products of five major technology companies. We find that protest use and protest non-use are relatively common, with 30% of respondents in 2019 reporting they were protesting at least one major tech company. Furthermore, we identify that protest users' most common motivations were (1) concerns about business models that profit from user data and (2) privacy; and the most common tactics were (1) stopping use and (2) leveraging ad blockers. We also identify common challenges and roadblocks faced by active and potential protest users, which include (1) losing social connections and (2) the lack of alternative products. Our results highlight the growing importance of protest users in the technology ecosystem and the need for further social computing research into this phenomenon. We also provide concrete design implications for existing and future technologies to support or account for protest use and protest non-use.},

Results from a case study with 36 experts and 4,543 adjudicated cases in a sleep stage classification task show that these factors contribute to both initial disagreement and resolvability, each in their own unique way. We provide evidence suggesting that structured adjudication can lead to significant revisions in treatment-relevant clinical parameters.

It presents almost two years of engagement with a community-based organisation in a socio-economically deprived neighbourhood in England with the aim of developing a local food hub. It documents how the collaborative work shifted from setting up an infrastructure to ongoing infrastructuring of an enabling environment to grow and sustain social innovation. While the former focused on a technological platform and a business to deliver inclusivity, customer experience, and marketing, the latter focuses on building lasting relationships on three levels: strengthening ties within the community-based organisation, offering social spaces to connect with the local community, and with other organisations by forming coalitions with mutual benefits. We contribute three design opportunities: First, in order to infrastructure the formation of publics around food initiatives, we need to design for relationship building. Second, we point to design implications for ethical aspirations, participation, and system transformation towards a food democracy. Finally, we reflect on the sustainability of infrastructuring and the role of designers to work towards independent infrastructures.},

Primary keys are essential for linking data spread across database tables, and for looking up and retrieving data from specific records. Yet for an identifier that seems so straightforward and uncontroversial, we find myriad ways that this unassuming bit of infrastructure has an outsized influence in human services work. Through case studies of the organizational networks of two nonprofit human services organizations, we find that different stakeholders use variants of identifiers to support work practices that are far more complex and social than the linking of tables or the lookup of data. Yet we also find that the low-level technical properties of the primary key are often coercive, forcing end-users to work on the infrastructure's terms-influencing the nature and order of the work, creating new forms of work, and influencing the tenor of the relationships among stakeholders. The technical abstractions of the underlying infrastructure, then, start to become the de facto public policy. We conclude by offering design provocations for better supporting identification across a variety of contexts.},

Users call an Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, listen to a brief audio tutorial, and take a multiple-choice quiz to check their understanding. People who pass the quiz receive a mobile top-up (about $0.14) and have the opportunity to earn additional credits by referring others to the system. We describe a pilot deployment of Learn2Earn in rural India that spread via word-of-mouth to over 15,000 people within seven weeks. Usage was concentrated among young men, many of them students. In a mixed-methods study, we draw upon call logs, electronic surveys, qualitative interviews, and other sources of data to suggest that Learn2Earn could be an effective way to build awareness about important topics.},

Our paper highlights the rich family dynamics, including key life events, that transform the roles of both Muslim women and their relatives. Our work is intended to inform scholars, practitioners within development agencies and industry, and other individuals studying technology and development about household dynamics that influence Muslim women's use of technology to encourage them to consider these dynamics during design and implementation processes for technological inclusion.},

That "everyone grieves in their own way'' may be true, but it forecloses important questions about how people evaluate these expressions, their relationship to others who are grieving, and impacts on their own experiences of grief. Drawing from mixed-methods research conducted over five years, we describe how individuals position themselves within and evaluate expressions of networked grief. We start by identifying five orientations -- reinforcing, supporting, transferring, objecting, and isolating -- that describe how individuals evaluate actions of grievers, position themselves relative to the network, and act when they encounter grief. We then describe factors and tensions that influence how individuals arrive at these orientations. Based on our findings, we argue that the design of social media can be sensitized to diverse needs by adopting a situated perspective within a dynamic post-mortem network.},

How do content creators make sense of these algorithms and what does that teach us about the roles that algorithms play in the social world? We take the case of YouTube because of its widespread use and the spaces for collective sense-making and mutual aid that content creators (YouTubers) have built within the last decade. We engaged with YouTubers in one-on-one interviews, performed content analysis on YouTube videos that discuss the algorithm, and conducted a wiki survey on YouTuber online groups. This triangulation of methodologies afforded us a rich understanding of content creators' understandings, priorities, and wishes as they relate to the algorithm. We found that YouTubers assign human characteristics to the algorithm to explain its behavior; what we have termed algorithmic personas. We identify three main algorithmic personas on YouTube: Agent, Gatekeeper, and Drug Dealer. We propose algorithmic personas as a conceptual framework that describes the new roles that algorithmic systems take on in the social world. As we face new challenges around the ethics and politics of algorithmic platforms such as YouTube, algorithmic personas describe roles that are familiar and can help develop our understanding of algorithmic power relations and accountability mechanisms.},

Humans develop bots, argue for their approval, and maintain them, performing tasks such as monitoring activity, merging similar bots, splitting complex bots, and turning off malfunctioning bots. Yet this is not the entire picture. Bots are designed to perform certain functions and can acquire new functionality over time. They play particular roles in the editing process. Understanding these roles is an important step towards understanding the ecosystem, and designing better bots and interfaces between bots and humans. This is important for understanding Wikipedia along with other kinds of work in which autonomous machines affect tasks performed by humans. In this study, we use unsupervised learning to build a nine category taxonomy of bots based on their functions in English Wikipedia. We then build a multi-class classifier to classify 1,601 bots based on labeled data. We discuss different bot activities, including their edit frequency, their working spaces, and their software evolution. We use a model to investigate how bots playing certain roles will have differential effects on human editors. In particular, we build on previous research on newcomers by studying the relationship between the roles bots play, the interactions they have with newcomers, and the ensuing survival rate of the newcomers.},

In this paper, we study the consistency of team fracture: a loss of team viability so severe that the team no longer wants to work together. Understanding whether team fracture is driven by the membership of the team, or by how their collaboration unfolded, motivates the design of interventions that either identify compatible teammates or ensure effective early interactions. We introduce an online experiment that reconvenes the same team without members realizing that they have worked together before, enabling us to temporarily erase previous team dynamics. Participants in our study completed a series of tasks across multiple teams, including one reconvened team, and privately blacklisted any teams that they would not want to work with again. We identify fractured teams as those blacklisted by half the members. We find that reconvened teams are strikingly polarized by task in the consistency of their fracture outcomes. On a creative task, teams might as well have been a completely different set of people: the same teams changed their fracture outcomes at a random chance rate. On a cognitive conflict and on an intellective task, the team instead replayed the same dynamics without realizing it, rarely changing their fracture outcomes. These results indicate that, for some tasks, team fracture can be strongly influenced by interactions in the first moments of a team's collaboration, and that interventions targeting these initial moments may be critical to scaffolding long-lasting teams.},

The rise of large scale labor analytics raises questions about how and whether workers could use such data to advocate for their own goals. Here, we analyze the historical development of workplace technology design methods in CSCW to show how mid-20th century labor responses to scientific management can inform directions in contemporary digital labor advocacy. First, we demonstrate how specific methodological tendencies from industrial scientific management were adapted to work in CSCW, and then subsequently altered in crowd work and social computing research to more closely resemble industrial approaches. Next, we show how three tactics used by labor unions to strategically engage with industrial scientific management in the mid-20th century can inform data-driven worker advocacy in platform-mediated work. Finally, we discuss how this history shapes our understanding of worker participation and the implications of using worker data for contemporary advocacy goals.},

abstract = {In film directing, a bias towards the representation of a particular gender can cause the audience to form a distorted stereotype of the gender role. The Bechdel test has been widely used to objectively judge the existence of such bias in films. However, because its analysis is based solely on the script of a film, the Bechdel test is incapable of considering the broad spectrum of bias that films can have as a visual medium. This study proposes a more comprehensive analysis system that quantifies the degree of bias in the visual representations of female and male characters in commercial films. By analyzing the image frames of a movie using the latest image analysis techniques, a total of 40 films were analyzed based on 8 quantitative indices. The result demonstrates that there exists a statistically significant difference in the visual representation of female and male characters. Specifically, female characters showed lower values in emotional diversity, spatial occupancy, and temporal occupancy compared to male characters in commercial films. Further, female characters were less likely to wear eyeglasses and also appeared more in static scenes, such as indoors.},

We present a qualitative study of existing data practices and perceptions of potential data-driven tools in housing allocation, engaging the perspective of service providers and policymakers in homeless services in a large urban county in the United States. Our findings highlight participants' concerns around centering clients' choices and ensuring integrity in a resource-constrained, high-stakes context. We also highlight differences between the perspectives of policymakers and service providers on standardization and fairness in the decision-making process. We discuss how use of and policies around data in social services need to consider the importance of the relationships that client-facing service providers have with other workers in the organization, with their work, and with clients.},

abstract = {As algorithms increasingly take managerial and governance roles, it is ever more important to build them to be perceived as fair and adopted by people. With this goal, we propose a procedural justice framework in algorithmic decision-making drawing from procedural justice theory, which lays out elements that promote a sense of fairness among users. As a case study, we built an interface that leveraged two key elements of the framework---transparency and outcome control---and evaluated it in the context of goods division. Our interface explained the algorithm's allocative fairness properties (standards clarity) and outcomes through an input-output matrix (outcome explanation), then allowed people to interactively adjust the algorithmic allocations as a group (outcome control). The findings from our within-subjects laboratory study suggest that standards clarity alone did not increase perceived fairness; outcome explanation had mixed effects, increasing or decreasing perceived fairness and reducing algorithmic accountability; and outcome control universally improved perceived fairness by allowing people to realize the inherent limitations of decisions and redistribute the goods to better fit their contexts, and by bringing human elements into final decision-making.},

We conducted a laboratory experiment with 20 triads of 2 NS and 1 NNS. NS in half of the groups were given the speech speedometer. We found that NS with the speech speedometer were significantly more motivated to slow down their speech but they did not actually speak more slowly, although they made other speech adjustments. Furthermore, NNS perceived the speech of NS with the speedometer less clear, and they felt less accommodated. The results highlight the need for tools that create scaffolding to help NS make speech accommodations. We conclude with some design ideas for these scaffolding tools.},

However, such interactions are limited in live online lectures, where instructors no longer have access to important cues such as raised hands or facial expressions at the time of teaching. As a result, instructors cannot fully understand students' learning progresses. This paper presents an explorative study investigating how presenters perceive and react to audience flow prediction when giving live-stream lectures, which has not been examined yet. The study was conducted with an experimental system that can predict audience's psychological states (e.g., anxiety, flow, boredom) through real-time facial expression analysis, and can provide aggregated views illustrating the flow experience of the whole group. Through evaluation with 8 online lectures (N_instructors=8, N_learners=21), we found such real-time flow prediction and visualization can provide value to presenters. This paper contributes a set of useful findings regarding their perception and reaction of such flow prediction, as well as lessons learned in the study, which can be inspirational for building future AI-powered system to assist people in delivering live online presentations.},

This mixed-methods, within-subjects experiment explores the influence of three factors that allow negative comments to be framed as acceptable and appropriate within RoastMe: humour, a mean (but funny) normative tone, and explicit articulation of these norms. 117 participants read, rated and reported their intended responses to humorous and non-humorous comments presented as being from RoastMe (explicitly mean but funny), ToastMe (explicitly positive), and two fictionalised communities where the normative tone was not explicitly defined (the mean but funny RateMe, and the positive DescribeMe). Results indicated clear interaction effects between community tone and norm explicitness, whereby comments from RoastMe were consistently rated and responded to most positively, and separate effects of humour on comment ratings and responses. Individual-level moral disengagement appeared central in allowing participants to excuse negative comments in humorous or permissive contexts. Consistent with benign violation theory, the explicitly negative tone of RoastMe was seen to create a shared understanding that users posting photos would expect and not be harmed by comments, allowing participants to reframe interactions as safe, acceptable and funny.},

Research on automatic gender recognition, the classification of gender by FA technologies, has raised potential concerns around issues of racial and gender bias. In this study, we augment past work with empirical data by conducting a systematic analysis of how gender classification and gender labeling in computer vision services operate when faced with gender diversity. We sought to understand how gender is concretely conceptualized and encoded into commercial facial analysis and image labeling technologies available today. We then conducted a two-phase study: (1) a system analysis of ten commercial FA and image labeling services and (2) an evaluation of five services using a custom dataset of diverse genders using self-labeled Instagram images. Our analysis highlights how gender is codified into both classifiers and data standards. We found that FA services performed consistently worse on transgender individuals and were universally unable to classify non-binary genders. In contrast, image labeling often presented multiple gendered concepts. We also found that user perceptions about gender performance and identity contradict the way gender performance is encoded into the computer vision infrastructure. We discuss our findings from three perspectives of gender identity (self-identity, gender performativity, and demographic identity) and how these perspectives interact across three layers: the classification infrastructure, the third-party applications that make use of that infrastructure, and the individuals who interact with that software. We employ Bowker and Star's concepts of "torque" and "residuality" to further discuss the social implications of gender classification. We conclude by outlining opportunities for creating more inclusive classification infrastructures and datasets, as well as with implications for policy.},

To identify opportunities for design, we conducted semi-structured interviews and participatory design sessions with 14 informal caregivers of family members with AD. Our findings characterize how becoming an AD caregiver profoundly impacts one's ability to be active, perspectives on being active, and the ways that exergames might best support this population.We discuss implications for design and howour findings challenge existing technological approaches to PA promotion.},

Placing fieldwork findings in conversation with the goals of this ongoing civic design project, we propose the analytic sensibility of precarious intervention to unpack the significance of the infrastructural tensions and power relations at play when people seek solutions to complex sociotechnical problems. Precarious intervention calls for CSCW research that attends to 1) the collective labor necessary to create and maintain ecologies of care in the face of infrastructural brokenness; and 2) the high-stakes and varied costs of 'engagement' for different community stakeholders.},

Our main analysis centers on bike touring as a nomadic leisure practice and on how it offers a radical departure from traditional modes of structuring work and life, and thus, complicates the relationship between work and leisure. We complement this with an account of managing the uncertainties of nomadicity by focusing on participants' experiences with arranging overnighting and network hospitality. We offer this study, firstly, as one response to the call for more diversity in the empirical cases drawn upon in theorizing nomadic work and leisure practices, but more productively, as an opportunity to reflect upon the temporal and spatial logics of digital technologies and platforms and how they frame our attitudes towards the interplay between work and leisure.},

Through an interview study of 56 social media users, we found two high-level perspectives towards social media and privacy that affected attitudes towards and usage of privacy features. Some users took a pragmatic approach to using social media and felt comfortable using various privacy features as a tool to manage their social relationships (e.g., avoiding bothersome posts, not feeling compelled to interact). However, there were also users who viewed taking such privacy actions as a relational hindrance and were concerned how using certain features to meet their own needs would harm their relationships with others. Through a subsequent survey (N=320), we reveal how these two perspectives impact user behavior across four social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter). Users who viewed social media as a pragmatic tool indeed used privacy features more. On the other hand, users who focused on how privacy can serve as a relational hindrance avoided using these features and, instead, prioritized social engagement and took a more indirect approach to protecting their privacy. Furthermore, the results show how these perspectives vary by individual rather than by privacy feature. These findings demonstrate the need to consider different perspectives towards social media and privacy when trying to understand and design for user behavior.},

abstract = {In immersive virtual reality (VR) environments, experiences of harassment can be exacerbated by features such as synchronous voice chat, heightened feelings of presence and embodiment, and avatar movements that can feel like violations of personal space (such as simulated touching or grabbing). Simultaneously, efforts to govern these developing spaces are made more complex by the distributed landscape of virtual reality applications and the dynamic nature of local community norms. To better understand this nascent social and psychological environment, we interviewed VR users (n=25) about their experiences with harassment, abuse, and discomfort in social VR. We find that users' definitions of what constitutes online harassment are subjective and highly personal, which poses significant challenges for the enforcement of platform- or application-level policies. We also find that embodiment and presence in VR spaces make harassment feel more intense, while ephemerality and non-standardized application controls make it difficult to escape or report unwanted behavior. Finally, we find that shared norms for appropriate behavior in social VR are still emergent, and that users distinguish between newcomers who unknowingly violate expectations for appropriate behavior and those users who aim to cause intentional harm. We draw from social norms theory to help explain why norm formation is particularly challenging in virtual reality environments, and we discuss the implications of our findings for the top-down governance of online communities by platforms. We conclude by recommending alternative strategies for community governance.},

abstract = {This paper analyzes the processes and challenges of technology repair in remote, low-income areas far from standard ICT repair infrastructure. Our sites of study are the fishing and farming villages of Dibut, Diotorin, and Dikapinisan in Aurora Province, Philippines, located in coastal coves against a mountain range. Residents are geographically isolated from urban areas, with the nearest peri-urban center of Baler a boat trip of several hours away, infeasible in some sea conditions. Unlike prior work in more connected rural areas, there are no local repair shops and device repair is uncommon, despite frequent breakage due to harsh conditions for electronics. The scarcity of local electronics repair limits technology access and leads to accumulation of e-waste. While prior work demonstrates that local electronics repair capability does arise in many rural areas around the world, we must also acknowledge that the successful emergence of this infrastructure depends on the intersection of many structural conditions and cannot be taken for granted. We present the material hardships of achieving local repair in terms of seams between heterogeneous urban and rural infrastructures, which illustrate the cove communities' marginality with respect to many forms of public infrastructure. However, intermittent and informal repair infrastructures based on trust relationships emerge to patch these seams in remote settings. We show how trust affects the way people dynamically construct repair infrastructure and why, based on their remoteness and the resulting value propositions of repair. Networks of trust between repairers, their clients, suppliers, fellow repairers, and certifying or training institutions crucially facilitate the movement of resources and expertise across the Philippines, but also reinforce the marginality of residents and repairers in the coves. Despite these structural challenges, local people are able to maintain a robust ecosystem for rural electrical line repair, from which we generalize the model of training grounds as a strategy for sustaining local communities of repair experts.},

abstract = {The social stigma looming over disclosures of sexual violence discourages many women from publicly sharing their stories, limiting their ability to seek support and obscuring the epidemic of sexual violence against women. By inviting women to share their ordinarily silenced stories, the hashtag #MeToo surfaced a network of survivors to confront this stigma. Through a mixed-methods analysis of over 1.8 million tweets posted during the first two weeks after #MeToo gained widespread popularity in 2017, we map the landscape of disclosures that emerged and disentangle the effects of network-level reciprocal disclosures, or disclosures made in reaction to seeing others disclose. We detail how survivors disclosed a diversity of sexual violence experiences in solidarity with others, composing nearly half of all authored tweets and comprising a disproportionate number of interactions within the #MeToo network. Further, we show that the more disclosures an individual potentially saw prior to disclosing, the more likely they were to share details with their disclosure. We argue that such network-level reciprocal disclosures may have reduced stigma, creating a counterpublic space safe for disclosure which, subsequently, generated more disclosures. Our work illustrates how feminist hashtag activism, like #MeToo, can unify individual and collective narratives to dismantle the stigma surrounding disclosures of sexual violence.

Through an analysis of publicly available content on YouTube, supplemented with semi-structured interviews, we report on the ways in which parents of children with developmental disabilities produce, share, and interact with others through videos of their children's experiences. Our analysis finds that parents disclose child information on YouTube to build authenticity, connect with others, advocate for social change, and justify monetization and child involvement. We discuss tensions between parents' practices and the ethical complexities of sharing and studying parent-generated content featuring children with disabilities.},

This paper compares three different forms of non/use that might otherwise fall under the single umbrella of Facebook "user": (1) those who have a current active account; (2) those who have deactivated their account; and (3) those who have considered deactivating but not actually done so. A subset of respondents (N=256) from a larger, demographically representative sample of internet users completed measures for usage and perceptions of Facebook, Facebook addiction, privacy experiences and behaviors, and demographics. Multinomial logistic regression modeling shows four specific variables as most predictive of a respondent's type: negative effects from "addictive" use, subjective intensity of Facebook usage, number of Facebook friends, and familiarity with or use of Facebook's privacy settings. These findings both fill gaps left by, and help resolve conflicting expectations from, prior work. Furthermore, they demonstrate how valuable insights can be gained by disaggregating "users" based on different forms of engagement with a given technology.},

While the pervasive use of digital technology for communication limits affectionate interaction through nonverbal cues -- a major channel of expression in face-to-face settings, there have been few approaches which scaffold couples' romantic text conversations. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel interactive system Lily which gives users inspirations to enrich their romantic expressions in text messaging. It first listens to users' original input and then recommends romantic lyrics holding the closest meaning in real-time during chats with partners. After a three-day empirical study, participants who are real-life couples reported that they not only received useful cues from Lily in terms of how to polish their affectionate expressions, but also learnt to enrich the conversation with topics enlightened by its recommendations. Based on our findings, we finally provide several design considerations for actual deployment of such an application.},

In this work, we are interested in one particularly salient aspect of wording: brevity. What is the causal effect of brevity on message success? What are the linguistic traits of brevity? When is brevity beneficial, and when is it not? Whereas most prior work has studied the effect of wording on style and success in observational setups, we conduct a controlled experiment, in which crowd workers shorten social media posts to prescribed target lengths and other crowd workers subsequently rate the original and shortened versions. This allows us to isolate the causal effect of brevity on the success of a message. We find that concise messages are on average more successful than the original messages up to a length reduction of 30--40%. The optimal reduction is on average between 10% and 20%. The observed effect is robust across different subpopulations of raters and is the strongest for raters who visit social media on a daily basis. Finally, we discover unique linguistic and content traits of brevity and correlate them with the measured probability of success in order to distinguish effective from ineffective shortening strategies. Overall, our findings are important for developing a better understanding of the effect of brevity on the success of messages in online social media.},

Drawing on two years of ethnographic fieldwork, we consider how democratic caring might be enacted and sustained through collaborative data work. We employ philosopher Joan Tronto's theory of caring democracy to structure our analysis of a resident-led initiative that uses data to organize and address issues of neglect and abandonment in their neighborhood. Adding to the CSCW literature on sociotechnical systems of care, we look particularly at Tronto's concept of caring democracy where caring needs and the ways in which they are met are an ongoing and inclusive process of assigning and reassigning caring responsibilities, characterized by both equality of voice and freedom from domination. This work develops grounded insight into the practice of democratic caring and how collaborative data work is relevant to this caring practice. We discuss opportunities and challenges for a data-supported caring democracy and address how caring democracy technologies are different from other modern civic technology practices. We conclude with a call to researchers to identify and enact democratic caring experiments in the small.},

abstract = {Advisory services are ritualized encounters between an expert and an advisee. Empathetic, high-touch relationship between those two parties was identified as the key aspect of a successful advisory encounter. To facilitate the high-touch interaction, advisors established rituals which stress the unique, individual character of each client and each single encounter. Simultaneously, organizations like banks or insurances rolled out tools and technologies for use in advisory services to offer a uniform experience and consistent quality across branches and advisors. As a consequence, advisors were caught between the high-touch and high-tech aspects of an advisory service. This manuscript presents a system that accommodates for high-touch rituals and practices and combines them with high-tech collaboration. The proposed solution augments pen-and-paper practices with digital content and affords new material performances coherent with the existing rituals. The evaluation in realistic mortgage advisory services unveils the potential of mixed reality approaches for application in professional, institutional settings. The blow-by-blow analysis of the conversations reveals how an advisory service can become equally high-tech and high-touch thanks to a careful ritual-oriented system design. As a consequence, this paper presents a solution to the tension between the high-touch and high-tech tendencies in advisory services.},

Through the lens of intersectionality, we examine how community health workers of diverse backgrounds and contracted status respond to the mandated use of digital payment methods and long payment delays. We highlight how resilience in this context is situated in workers' intersecting socioeconomic and professional identities, which shape the assets and constraints that workers engage with in efforts to be resilient. We leverage our findings to discuss how assets-based approaches to design can be further operationalized and used to sustainably support resilience.},

This paper interrogates how rurality has been treated in previous HCI research conducted in developed and high-income countries. We draw from research outside of HCI to suggest how we can effectively engage with rurality in research. We present results of a scoping review of HCI literature that asks: 1) How do HCI researchers define rurality?; 2) How do the unique characteristics of rural communities enter into study findings?; 3) What methods are used in rural research?; and 4) Where has rural research been conducted? More than twice as many rural HCI articles have been conducted in low-income and/or developing countries than in high-income and/or developed countries. HCI researchers rarely define rurality, and when they do, they primarily define it using descriptive rather than sociocultural or symbolic definitions. Rural research findings have primarily addressed infrastructure and distance/geographic isolation as unique rural characteristics, while qualitative, observational, and cross-sectional methods dominate this research. There are further opportunities for HCI research to more productively advance understanding of what rurality is, and how it matters for sociotechnical systems.},

We conducted a survey of 907 Reddit users, asking them to reflect on their post removal a few hours after it happened. Examining the qualitative and quantitative responses from this survey, we present users' perceptions of the platform's moderation processes. We find that although roughly a fifth (18%) of the participants accepted that their post removal was appropriate, a majority of the participants did not --- over a third (37%) of the participants did not understand why their post was removed, and further, 29% of the participants expressed some level of frustration about the removal. We focus on factors that shape users' attitudes aboutfairness in moderation andposting again in the community. Our results indicate that users who read community guidelines or receive explanations for removal are more likely to perceive the removal as fair and post again in the future. We discuss implications for moderation practices and policies. Our findings suggest that the extra effort required to establish community guidelines and educate users with helpful feedback is worthwhile, leading to better user attitudes about fairness and propensity to post again.},

Our findings show that making in such a setting is shaped by local economic and social factors in a resource-constrained environment and highlight how this community engages in a wide range of making activities. In describing these making activities, we emphasize how making was conducted to purposely enable ongoing and future making by others; promoted the wellbeing and skill development of centre members; and was socially-engaged to address concerns in the local community. We conclude by discussing how such type of making contributes a new understanding of maker culture, one that is appreciative of resource-constraints, integrates different sources of value, and is embedded in local place.},

abstract = {Online videos have shown tremendous increase in Internet traffic. Most video hosting sites implement recommender systems, which connect the videos into a directed network and conceptually act as a source of pathways for users to navigate. At present, little is known about how human attention is allocated over such large-scale networks, and about the impacts of the recommender systems. In this paper, we first construct the Vevo network -- a YouTube video network with 60,740 music videos interconnected by the recommendation links, and we collect their associated viewing dynamics. This results in a total of 310 million views every day over a period of 9 weeks. Next, we present large-scale measurements that connect the structure of the recommendation network and the video attention dynamics. We use the bow-tie structure to characterize the Vevo network and we find that its core component (23.1% of the videos), which occupies most of the attention (82.6% of the views), is made out of videos that are mainly recommended among themselves. This is indicative of the links between video recommendation and the inequality of attention allocation. Finally, we address the task of estimating the attention flow in the video recommendation network. We propose a model that accounts for the network effects for predicting video popularity, and we show it consistently outperforms the baselines. This model also identifies a group of artists gaining attention because of the recommendation network. Altogether, our observations and our models provide a new set of tools to better understand the impacts of recommender systems on collective social attention.},

Most of the studies in this area have focused on various computational means of data protection and their vulnerabilities, and occasionally on social practices situated in the West. However, communities in the Global South often have a rich trove of vernacular arts and crafts of hiding information that might be leveraged to design novel kinds of privacy-preserving technologies. In this paper, we present findings from our three-month long original ethnographic work with various communities in Dhaka, Bangladesh that reveal a wide range of culturally embedded techniques of hiding confidential and sensitive information from their 'others'. Our analysis demonstrates the dynamic nature of these techniques, the learning process associated with them, and their deep relationship with contextual politics that these communities are embedded in. We further connect our findings to the broader interests of CSCW around otherness, ethics, and democracy, and also discuss their implications for design.},

What motivates individuals to engage in DTCGT, and what are the implications for information privacy at both the individual and societal levels? This study uses qualitative interviews with ten customers of the DTCGT service 23andMe to explore why they engaged in DTCGT, the benefits they received, their expectations of privacy, and perceptions of risk. It also introduces the use of social exchange theory as a theoretical framework for examining the social dimensions of information privacy and personal disclosure. The findings demonstrate that the participants' assumptions of anonymity, as well as their their belief that their contributions to online genetic databases aid the public good, were key motivating factors. The participants were generally unaware of the potential risks to their individual genetic privacy as well as the impact of large scale genetic testing databases on networked, collective privacy. The findings demonstrate that framework of social exchange theory aids in understanding how the form of the relationship affected the participants' decisions to disclose their personal information to 23andMe as well as their perceptions of risk in the DTCGT context.},

However, no studies have yet examined how this technology---combining head mounted displays, motion tracking, avatars, and virtual environments---might contribute to older adult wellbeing by facilitating greater social participation (social VR). To address this gap, we conducted three workshops in which 25 older adults aged 70 to 81 explored the utility of social VR as a medium for communicating with other older adults. Participants first created embodied avatars that were controlled through natural gestures, and subsequently used these avatars in two high-fidelity social VR prototypes. Findings from the workshops provide insight into older adults' design motivations when creating embodied avatars for social VR; their acceptance of social VR as a communication tool; and their views on how social VR might play a beneficial role in their lives. Outcomes from the workshops also illustrate the critical importance our participants placed onbehavioural anthropomorphism ---the embodied avatars' ability to speak, move, and act in a human-like manner--- alongsidetranslational factors, which encapsulate issues relating to the way physical movements are mapped to the embodied avatar and the way in which errors in these mappings may invoke ageing stereotypes. Findings demonstrate the critical role that these characteristics might play in the success of future social VR applications targeting older users. We translate our findings into a set of design considerations for developing social VR systems for older adults, and we reflect on how our participants' experiences can inform future research on social virtual reality.},

abstract = {Job roles serve as a boundary between an employee and an organization, and are often considered building blocks in understanding the behavior and functioning of organizational systems. However, a lack of clarity about one's role, that is, one's work responsibilities and degree of authority, can lead to absenteeism, turnover, dissatisfaction, stress, and lower workplace performance. This paper proposes a methodology to quantitatively estimate role ambiguity via unobtrusively gathered data from LinkedIn, shared voluntarily by a cohort of information workers spanning multiple organizations. After successfully validating this LinkedIn based measure of Role Ambiguity, or LibRA against a state-of-the-art gold standard, drawing upon theories in organizational psychology, we examine the efficacy and convergent validity of LibRA in explaining established relationships of role ambiguity with wellbeing and performance measures of individuals. We find that greater LibRA is associated with depleted wellbeing, such as increased heart rate, increased arousal, decreased sleep, and higher stress. In addition, greater LibRA is associated with lower job performance such as decreased organizational citizenship behavior and decreased individual task performance. We discuss how LibRA can help fill gaps in state-of-the-art assessments of role ambiguity, and the potential of this measure in building novel technology-mediated strategies to combat role ambiguity in organizations.},

abstract = {Museums are constantly searching for new ways to increase engagement with their exhibits, from electronic guides to modern digital technologies such as special-purpose tablets, smartphones, and virtual and augmented reality (AR). For AR exhibits in particular, promoting shared experience and group cohesion is not straightforward. In this work, we investigate scenarios in which not everyone is using a head-worn display (HWD), either because there aren't enough available or simply because someone might feel uncomfortable using it. We propose two sharing techniques for AR experiences and evaluate them in a long term in-the-wild study: Over-the-Shoulder AR, which renders a real-time virtual representation of the augmented reality content on a large secondary display; Semantic Linking, which displays contextual information about the virtual content on the same large display. We also introduce a complementary technique: Indicator Rings, which display the locations of the HWD user's objects-of-focus. We observed that participants in the Over-the-Shoulder AR and Semantic Linking conditions stayed together and exhibited more verbal exchanges than participants in a Baseline condition, which could indicate that they were more engaged. Self-reported measures indicated an increase in pair communication and increased comprehension of the virtual content for participants without the HWD. Participants without the HWD also displayed a greater understanding of the location of virtual elements with support from the Indicator Rings, and used them as a tool to guide the HWD user through the virtual content. We discuss design implications for interactive augmented reality exhibits and possible applications outside the cultural heritage scenario.},

While prior work has extensively studied the motivations of open-source contributors in general, relatively little is known about how people choose which project to contribute to, beyond personal interest. This question is especially relevant in transparent social coding environments like GitHub, where visible cues on personal profile and repository pages, known as signals, are known to impact impression formation and decision making. In this paper, we report on a mixed-methods empirical study of the signals that influence the contributors' decision to join a GitHub project. We first interviewed 15 GitHub contributors about their project evaluation processes and identified the important signals they used, including the structure of the README and the amount of recent activity. Then, we proceeded quantitatively to test out the impact of each signal based on the data of 9,977 GitHub projects. We reveal that many important pieces of information lack easily observable signals, and that some signals may be both attractive and unattractive. Our findings have direct implications for open-source maintainers and the design of social coding environments, e.g., features to be added to facilitate better project searching experience.},

We built GroundTruth, an online system that uses three shared representations-a diagram, grid, and heatmap-to allow experts to work with crowds in real time to geolocate images. Our mixed-methods evaluation with 11 experts and 567 crowd workers found that GroundTruth helped experts geolocate images, and revealed challenges and success strategies for expert-crowd interaction. We also discuss designing shared representations for visual search, sensemaking, and beyond.},

To deepen our understanding of (1) how such single-user designs affect people's consensus building processes in CIS and (2) how to devise an alternative design to improve current practices, we conducted two 4-week diary studies and observed how groups seek out places together. Our studies focus on social event coordination as a case where CIS is necessary and important. In Study 1, we examined the major challenges people encounter when performing CIS using their preferred tools. These challenges include difficulties in capturing mutual preferences, high communication cost, and disparity of work depending on a group member's perceived role as an organizer or invitee. We discovered that improving a group's shared understanding of the target information they seek (e.g., places, products) could potentially address the challenges. In Study 2, we designed, deployed, and evaluated ComeTogether, a novel system that supports a group's social event coordination. ComeTogether adopts Collaborative Dynamic Queries (C-DQ), an interface designed to allow a group to share their preferences regarding potential destinations. Study 2 results indicate that using C-DQ increased users' awareness of other group members' preferences in performing CIS, making their coordination more transparent, more inviting, and fairer than what their current practice allows. Meanwhile, ComeTogether improved communication efficiency of groups while presenting opportunities to learn about others and to discover new places. We provide implications for design that explain considerations for adopting C-DQ and identify future research directions.},

We consider an MR configuration in which collocated collaborators work around a tabletop display, while remote collaborators wear an HMD to interact with a connected virtual environment that gives a 3D perspective, and consider the impact of varying degrees of view congruence with their collaborators. In a within-subjects study with 18 groups of 3, groups completed task scenarios involving 3D object manipulation around a physical-virtual mapped tabletop. We compare a synchronized Tabletop display baseline and two MR conditions with different levels of view congruence: Fishtank and Hover. Fishtank has a high degree of congruence as it shares a top-down perspective of the 3D objects with the tabletop collaborators. The Hover condition has less view congruence since 3D content hovers front of the remote collaborator above the table. The MR conditions yielded higher self-reported awareness and co-presence than the Tabletop condition for both collocated and remote participants. Remote collaborators significantly preferred the MR conditions for manipulating shared 3D models and communicating with their collaborators. Our findings illustrate strengths and weaknesses of both MR techniques but show that more participants preferred the less-congruent Hover condition overall. Reasons include that it facilitated interaction and viewing 3D objects.},

While some disruptive events are short-lived, some can be a routine part of everyday life. This leads to the question of how people who experience prolonged disruption in their lives build resilience---that is, how do they manage and overcome such events? To explore this question, this paper utilizes a case study approach to explore the use, creation, and re-appropriation of technology across three prolonged disruptions-the Second Gulf War in Iraq, veteran transitions, and the coming out experiences of LGBTQ-identifying people. Using a conceptual frame that brings together routine dynamics and infrastructuring, we find that engaging in routine infrastructuring practices generated resilience in people's daily lives---a phenomenon we dub 'routine infrastructuring' as 'building everyday resilience with technology.' We then theorize properties of infrastructure and infrastructuring practice that enable resiliency, and conclude with how infrastructuring is a form of care work that is oriented towards individuals, communities, and society.},

abstract = {Online mental health forums facilitate supportive relationships between peers that transcend national and cultural boundaries. While past work in medical anthropology indicates a central role of cultural identity in how individuals frame their mental well-being and distress, little research has been done to investigate the role of culture in seeking and providing mental health support on online forums. Using data from two mental health forums, we analyze cross-cultural differences in mental health expression between people from different countries. We characterize these differences along three dimensions--identity, language use, and support behavior. Through comparing usage of the platform by individuals from three Asian countries with their counterparts from primarily Western countries, we find that individuals from these less-represented countries mention their own country more often when expressing distress, use fewer clinical language terms, and are more likely to provide support to people from the same country as them, as expected from past work on mental health in these countries. Contrary to past work, however, we find that the use of clinical mental health language is not affected over time by interacting with others in an international forum. While these findings are useful for understanding the role of culture in mental health support, they also have practical design implications for online forums. We find that the three dimensions of cultural differences we analyze are correlated with receiving effective support, and make design recommendations that can improve quality of support for the people in the minority on these forums.},

More specifically, a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon-based technology is applied to enable automatic class check-ins. We conducted two field trials with a total of 141 university students. Our findings showed that several social, technological, and psychological factors impacted the use of auto and manual check-ins. Feedback from the student participants suggested that future higher education check-in systems may need to consider the integration of check-ins for a variety of purposes.},

We then discuss the orchestration of the center and the periphery, where streamers and spectators coordinate their respective performances, as well as the interaction between the center and the periphery, where the center-periphery distinction blurs. Based on these findings, we discuss co-performance as a theatrical metaphor for understanding live streaming and audience engagement.},

abstract = {When crowdsourcing the creation of machine learning datasets, statistical distributions that capture diverse answers can represent ambiguous data better than a single best answer. Unfortunately, collecting distributions is expensive because a large number of responses need to be collected to form a stable distribution. Despite this, the efficient collection of answer distributions-that is, ways to use less human effort to collect estimates of the eventual distribution that would be formed by a large group of responses-is an under-studied topic. In this paper, we demonstrate that this type of estimation is possible and characterize different elicitation approaches to guide the development of future systems. We investigate eight elicitation approaches along two dimensions: annotation granularity and estimation perspective. Annotation granularity is varied by annotating i) a single "best" label, ii) all relevant labels, iii) a ranking of all relevant labels, or iv) real-valued weights for all relevant labels. Estimation perspective is varied by prompting workers to either respond with their own answer or an estimate of the answer(s) that they expect other workers would provide. Our study collected ordinal annotations on the emotional valence of facial images from 1,960 crowd workers and found that, surprisingly, the most fine-grained elicitation methods were not the most accurate, despite workers spending more time to provide answers. Instead, the most efficient approach was to ask workers to choose all relevant classes that others would have selected. This resulted in a 21.4% reduction in the human time required to reach the same performance as the baseline (i.e., selecting a single answer with their own perspective). By analyzing cases in which finer-grained annotations degraded performance, we contribute to a better understanding of the trade-offs between answer elicitation approaches. Our work makes it more tractable to use answer distributions in large-scale tasks such as ML training, and aims to spark future work on techniques that can efficiently estimate answer distributions.},

Viewers do not simply donate to support the charity or in response to the technical prowess and ingenuity of speedrunners, but to actively interact with and be part of the couch experience, the ideal social milieu of speedrunning. Building upon previously identified motivations of why viewers donate to online live streamers, our work contributes to understanding how collocated gatherings can reinforce and amplify the cultural and social aspects of online subcultures (even heterogeneous ones) to encourage charitable giving. This opens opportunities for design that evoke a visceral level of engagement with charity events similar to that observed at GDQ.},

Computational notebooks give data scientists a convenient interactive solution for sharing and keeping track of the data exploration process through a combination of code, narrative text, visualizations, and other rich media. In this paper, we report how synchronous editing in computational notebooks changes the way data scientists work together compared to working on individual notebooks. We first conducted a formative survey with 195 data scientists to understand their past experience with collaboration in the context of data science. Next, we carried out an observational study of 24 data scientists working in pairs remotely to solve a typical data science predictive modeling problem, working on either notebooks supported by synchronous groupware or individual notebooks in a collaborative setting. The study showed that working on the synchronous notebooks improves collaboration by creating a shared context, encouraging more exploration, and reducing communication costs. However, the current synchronous editing features may lead to unbalanced participation and activity interference without strategic coordination. The synchronous notebooks may also amplify the tension between quick exploration and clear explanations. Building on these findings, we propose several design implications aimed at better supporting collaborative editing in computational notebooks, and thus improving efficiency in teamwork among data scientists.},

In other words, Bitcoin is a complex sociotechnical system with a complex set of risks and challenges for anyone using it. We investigated how everyday users of Bitcoin develop trust in Bitcoin on one of the largest online communities devoted to Bitcoin: the Reddit.com r/bitcoin forum. Using qualitative content analysis, we examined how trust in Bitcoin develops based on contributions to this community. On r/bitcoin, trust in Bitcoin is driven by a pervasive ideology we call the "True Bitcoiner" ideology. This ideological viewpoint in centered on the interpretation of Bitcoin as functionally "trustless" and risk-free. Despite widespread evidence of emerging individual and system-level risks with using Bitcoin, participants continue to maintain this ideological perspective. This ideology consists of three primary beliefs: viewing Bitcoin's technology as more trustworthy than its people; rejecting 'corrupt' social hierarchies related to money; and the importance of accumulating or 'HODLing' quantities of Bitcoin as a strategy to create an ideal future. We conclude that this "True Bitcoiner" ideology is maintained despite contradictory evidence in the world because it allows participants to more easily interpret Bitcoin and make decisions by reducing perceived risk and uncertainty in the system. The role of this ideology on r/bitcoin demonstrates an expanded conceptualization of how trust is created and socially-mediated in socio-technical contexts.},

Governing these Internet platforms and other digital institutions has posed a challenge for engineers and managers, many of whom have little exposure to the relevant history or theory of institutional design. The dominant guiding practices for the design of digital institutions to date in human-computer interaction, computer-supported cooperative work, and the tech industry at large have been an incentive-focused behavioral engineering paradigm encompassing atheoretical approaches such as emulation, A/B-testing, engagement maximization, and piecemeal issue-driven engineering. One institutional analysis framework that has been useful in the study of traditional institutions comes from scholars of natural resource management, particularly that community of economists, anthropologists, and environmental and political scientists focused around the work of Elinor Ostrom, known collectively as the "Ostrom Workshop." A key finding from this community that has yet to be broadly incorporated into the design of many digital institutions is the importance of including participatory change mechanisms in what is called a "constitutional layer" of institutional design. The institutional rules that compose a constitutional layer facilitate stakeholder participation in the ongoing process of institutional design change. We explore to what extent consideration of constitutional layers is met or could be better met in three varied cases of digital institutions: cryptocurrencies, cannabis informatics, and amateur Minecraft server governance. Examining such highly varied cases allows us to demonstrate the broad relevance of constitutional layers in many different types of digital institutions.},

The global increase in mobile penetration has created opportunities to serve the unbanked using mobile-based Digital Financial Services (DFS) for greater financial inclusion but there have not been any DFS-based interventions around ROSCAs. In this paper, we report a qualitative study involving 80 individuals to understand the dynamics of ROSCAs and opportunities for their digitization in the Pakistani context. We also present a smartphone-based Digital ROSCA platform designed on top of a simulated mobile money system. The platform was designed to be inclusive towards low-literate users. We present qualitative findings of its evaluation with 15 users (3 individual ROSCA groups). We find that digitization has the potential to support and strengthen traditional ROSCAs by mitigating issues like record-keeping, delayed payments, collection, distribution, and safety of money. It also allows the creation of payment history for individuals that can be used to score their financial credibility.},

abstract = {Technological advances, combined with sustained, minimalist consumerism, have raised the popularity of sharing economy platforms like Airbnb and Uber. These platforms are considered to have disrupted traditional industries and revolutionized how consumers interact with their services. The Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) community has researched various aspects of the sharing economy; however, it is unclear how novices grow into experts in its various instantiations. In this paper, we present a qualitative investigation of Airbnb hosts, and Facebook groups in which they participate, for an enriched understanding of their learning mechanisms. Drawing on the theory of Legitimate Peripheral Participation (LPP), our findings highlight the learning mechanisms that enable novice hosts to transition from partaking in peripheral roles to becoming integrated members of their (Facebook) communities of practice. We also present recommendations for sharing economy platforms, micro-entrepreneurs, and the online communities that serve them both.},

Transgender people face a particularly acute challenge in self-disclosure, but we know little about how they experience it on dating platforms. Revealing trans status can result in physical or emotional harm, but is also often considered necessary for a successful relationship and for self-fulfillment. To better understand disclosure of sensitive information, we interviewed 20 transgender dating platform users in the U.S. We find that direct, proactive disclosure of trans status was motivated by desires for safety and certainty, though this could involve tension. Physical separation and one-to-many communication surface as key affordances that facilitated disclosure. These results help us better understand motivations behind disclosure decisions.},

However, to date, most prior HCI research examining such interventions has focused on interventions that target students. In this paper, we expand prior literature by examining an intervention, called Meghshala, that targets teachers in low-income schools as its primary users. Through interviews and observations with 39 participants from 12 government schools in India, we show how the introduction of a teacher-focused technology intervention causes teachers to reconfigure their work practices, including lesson preparation, in-classroom teaching practices, bureaucratic work processes, and post-teaching feedback mechanisms. We use the concept of material agency to analyze our findings with respect to teacher agency and reconfiguration, and use theories of teacher knowledge to highlight the kinds of knowledge production that teachers in our research context tend to focus on (e.g., content knowledge). Finally, we offer design opportunities for future teacher-focused technology interventions.},

We found that drivers relied on methods that were technical, social, and physical, to ensure their safety and engaged in informal collaborative and communicative activities with other drivers inside and outside of the ridesharing system.

abstract = {Interactive intelligent systems, i.e., interactive systems that employ AI technologies, are currently present in many parts of our social, public and political life. An issue reoccurring often in the development of these systems is the question regarding the level of appropriate human and computer contributions. Engineers and designers lack a way of systematically defining and delimiting possible options for designing such systems in terms of levels of automation. In this paper, we propose, apply and reflect on a method for human-computer configuration design. It supports the systematic investigation of the design space for developing an interactive intelligent system. We illustrate our method with a use case in the context of collaborative ideation. Here, we developed a tool for information extraction from idea content. A challenge was to find the right level of algorithmic support, whereby the quality of the information extraction should be as high as possible, but, at the same time, the human effort should be low. Such contradicting goals are often an issue in system development; thus, our method proposed helped us to conceptualize and explore the design space. Based on a critical reflection on our method application, we want to offer a complementary perspective to the value-centered design of interactive intelligent systems. Our overarching goal is to contribute to the design of so-called hybrid systems where humans and computers are partners.},

Beyond speculative instances, it is unclear what technology individuals themselves would choose, if any, to augment their social interactions; what influence it may exert; or how use of heterogeneous devices may affect the value of this augmentation. This is important, as the devices that we use directly affect our behaviour, influencing affordances and how we engage in social interactions. Through a study of 28 participants, we compared head-mounted display, smartphones, and smartwatches to support digital augmentation of self during face-to-face interactions within a group. We identified a preference among participants for head-mounted displays to support privacy, while smartwatches and smartphones better supported conversational events (such as grounding and repair), along with group use through screen-sharing. Accordingly, we present software and hardware design recommendations and user interface guidelines for integrating a digital form of self into face-to-face conversations.},

abstract = {About 20% of the U.S. unemployed population has been out of the labor force for more than 6 months. The rise of the gig economy has changed the landscape of nontraditional employment opportunities for these predominantly low-skilled long-term unemployed workers. This particular type of on-demand work can be used to fill unemployment gaps and offers little to no training costs and flexible hours. Therefore, we explore whether driving as a form of gig work helps to mitigate the negative effects of long-term unemployment for low-skilled job seekers with employment gaps, and how employers evaluate workers who have held non-traditional jobs. Using a correspondence audit study with 1006 job applications, we evaluated whether a set of resumes "enhanced" with experience driving for a real-time ridesharing service received more callbacks than baseline resumes with an employment gap. We found no evidence that driving as a form of gig work increased the callback rates of applicants. In fact, we observed that in comparison to men, the callback rates for women slightly declined. Our study suggests that driving 'gigs' might not be a substitute for traditional employment on resumes for low-skilled workers. We contribute a call to CSCW to investigate methods that help to understand why real-time ridesharing services do not substitute for traditional jobs in bridging employment gaps and solutions on how to overcome it. Finally, we reflect on our use of audit studies in the new digital era and present potential CSCW and HCI contributions using this method.},

Using a sample of 32 million Reddit posts, we characterize the removal explanations that are provided to Redditors, and link them to measures of subsequent user behaviors---including future post submissions and future post removals. Adopting a topic modeling approach, we show that removal explanations often provide information that educate users about the social norms of the community, thereby (theoretically) preparing them to become a productive member. We build regression models that show evidence of removal explanations playing a role in future user activity. Most importantly, we show that offering explanations for content moderation reduces the odds of future post removals. Additionally, explanations provided by human moderators did not have a significant advantage over explanations provided by bots for reducing future post removals. We propose design solutions that can promote the efficient use of explanation mechanisms, reflecting on how automated moderation tools can contribute to this space. Overall, our findings suggest that removal explanations may be under-utilized in moderation practices, and it is potentially worthwhile for community managers to invest time and resources into providing them.},

Much of this scrutiny is experienced online, especially around stigmatized topics such as divorce, custody, postpartum depression, and miscarriage. Prior theory suggests that parents might be able to access greater support online when anonymous, but other evidence suggests that anonymity may increase bad behavior. Drawing from ten years of Reddit parenting boards, we show that parents are more likely to discuss potentially stigmatizing topics using anonymous ("throwaway") accounts. We find that, on average, throwaway comments are more likely to receive a response, receive more responses that are longer, and receive responses that have higher karma scores than topically similar comments posted by non-throwaway accounts. We argue that self-identified throwaway accounts provide a crucial environment for supporting parents with stigmatizing experiences. They also provide a shared platform signal (the throwaway account) which enables other Reddit users to access shared experiences and support. We propose that a hybrid combination of identified and anonymous platforms could provide more supportive online experiences for parents and other users.},

We empirically demonstrate how the concept of privacy differs across cultures and show how the Facebook platform, as it becomes popular worldwide, catalyzes change in norms of information regulation. We discuss how the localization of transnational technology platforms provides a key site in which to investigate changing cultural ideas about privacy, and to discover misalignments between different expectations for information flow. Finally, we explore ways that insufficient localization effort by transnational technology companies puts some of the most marginalized users at disproportionate information disclosure risk when using new Internet tools, and offer some pragmatic suggestions for how such companies could improve privacy tools for users who are far -geographically or culturally - from where the tools are designed.},

Our work highlights how the motivations for the use of technology in this context are often intrinsically linked to the nature of CF itself and the constraints that the condition imposes on care provision. These include the high burden associated with self-management and clinic attendance; the ever-present risk of infection and a subsequent decline in health; and patients who are often very well-informed and actively engaged in their care. In exploring enablers and barriers to technology in this context, we highlight the importance of considering its integration into the chronic care cycles, practices, and structures of CF care.},

abstract = {In content-based online platforms, use of aggregate user feedback (say, the sum of votes) is commonplace as the "gold standard" for measuring content quality. Use of vote aggregates, however, is at odds with the existing empirical literature, which suggests that voters are susceptible to different biases-reputation (e.g., of the poster), social influence (e.g., votes thus far), and position (e.g., answer position). Our goal is to quantify, in an observational setting, the degree of these biases in online platforms. Specifically, what are the causal effects of different impression signals-such as the reputation of the contributing user, aggregate vote thus far, and position of content-on a participant's vote on content? We adopt an instrumental variable (IV) framework to answer this question. We identify a set of candidate instruments, carefully analyze their validity, and then use the valid instruments to reveal the effects of the impression signals on votes. Our empirical study using log data from Stack Exchange websites shows that the bias estimates from our IV approach differ from the bias estimates from the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. In particular, OLS underestimates reputation bias (1.6-2.2x for gold badges) and position bias (up to 1.9x for the initial position) and overestimates social influence bias (1.8-2.3x for initial votes). The implications of our work include: redesigning user interface to avoid voter biases; making changes to platforms' policy to mitigate voter biases; detecting other forms of biases in online platforms.},

Through the triangulation of this data, we explore the role of social media and social technologies in relation to their eating disorder. By utilizing this methodology, we were able to provide a contextually rich and nuanced lens for exploring the impacts of digital self-harm on this group of patients. We found that patients acknowledged that the eating disordered content on social media had a negative impact on their health, often contributing to a worsening of the physical manifestations of their disorder. Conversely, while they actively consumed this content, our participants did not produce online content related to eating disordered activities or behaviors. Finally, we discuss the patterns within their social media data and how platform designers and operators could use these findings in the future through design considerations for future platform-based interventions.},

Using these themes, we contribute a set of design priorities for supporting this population. We also contribute an expansion of the U&amp;G perspective to include: 1) gratifications resisted, to account for the ways in which teachers resist gratifying uses of technology, and 2) differentiation between direct gratifications and indirect gratifications to better describe technology use in collaborative contexts.},

In 2015, the commenting function "replies" was temporarily removed from Tumblr, providing a unique opportunity to study the deprivation of a standard social media feature. We administered a survey to investigate Tumblr users' perceptions and use of replies. Respondents reported that they used replies to simultaneously support others' performance and their own. Respondents compared replies to other digital interaction channels such as paralinguistic interactions, the sharing feature "reblogs", and "direct messages" (DMs), citing social considerations and norms around each. We used Goffman's performance theory to draw insights on the perceived semi-public / semi-private space of replies, which enabled users to perform supportive actions that did not belong in their main blogging identity frontstage but that were not backstage either. We discuss the limitation of performance theory to describe a presentation to a limited but unknown audience, and we describe how replies enabled new frontstages such as the delicate ramp up to the performance of intimacy in DMs. We discuss implications for performing support and identity on social media with audiences that are perceived as limited but are unknown.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate how computational tools to annotate communication can support multilingual sense-making on social media. We conducted a field study of SenseTrans, a browser extension that uses sentiment analysis and named entity extraction techniques to annotate Facebook posts with emotional and contextual information. Interviews with 18 participants who used SenseTrans in their Facebook newsfeed for two weeks suggest that the annotations often supported sensemaking by providing additional information they could use to get a quick gist of the posts or to supplement their own interpretations. Participants varied in the extent to which they were motivated to evaluate the credibility of and form mental models of how the annotations were generated, which shaped how they utilized the annotations for sensemaking. Our findings demonstrate the value of designing to support cross-lingual communication and inform design implications for intelligent tools that support communication and sensemaking.},

We present a qualitative inquiry of one such context, as we examine the outreach practices and everyday challenges of workers at a community-based organization in Gujarat (India) that works with People Living with the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus(PLHIV). Drawing on Yosso's framework of community cultural wealth-apt for such intersectional settings-and the lens of articulation work, we describe how the workers at Vikas build and strengthen varied forms of capital to restore "old normals," or what life was like for their PLHIV clients prior to diagnoses. Finally, we propose that attention to this nature of restoration work, and the workers' engagement with diverse forms of community cultural wealth, allows us to reflect on how technologies might (or might not) be designed to impact social and affective aspects of health.},

The successful navigation of technological change is both more challenging and more critical in online communities that are entirely mediated by technology than it is in traditional organizations. This paper presents an analysis of 14 in-depth interviews with moderators of subcommunities of one technological platform (Reddit) that added communities on a new technological platform (Discord). Moderation teams experienced several problems related to moderating content at scale as well as a disconnect between the affordances of Discord and their assumptions based on their experiences on Reddit. We found that moderation teams used Discord's API to create scripts and bots that augmented Discord to make the platform work more like tools on Reddit. These tools were particularly important in communities struggling with scale. Our findings suggest that increasingly widespread end user programming allow users of social computing systems to innovate and deploy solutions to unanticipated design problems by transforming new technological platforms to align with their past expectations.},

abstract = {Successful knowledge integration, that is, systematic synthesis of unshared information, is key to suc-cess, but at the same time a challenging venture for teams with distributed knowledge collaborating online. For example, teams with heterogeneous knowledge often have only vague or even wrong ideas about who knows what. This situation is further complicated if the collaboration partners do not know each other and merely communicate online. Previous research has found meta-knowledge, that is, knowledge about one's own and the partner's knowledge areas, to be a promising but not yet sufficient-ly investigated approach to promote knowledge integration. With our experimental study we aimed to address this desideratum of research on the role of meta-knowledge in net-based collaborations. We "simulated" a chat-based collaboration between partners with heterogeneous knowledge by assigning specific information to students collaborating in dyads on a Hidden Profile task. To arrive at the correct joint solution for this task, collaborating partners had to pool their shared, but more importantly their unshared information. We compared two conditions: In the experimental condition meta-knowledge was promoted by providing the collaboration partners with self-presentations of each other's roles, which pointed to their unique fields of knowledge, while participants in the control condition did not receive this information. Results suggest a positive impact of the meta-knowledge manipulation on two key factors of collaboration: knowledge integration and construction of a transactive memory system (TMS).},

Simultaneously, speech synthesis technology is rapidly improving, making it possible to generate increasingly varied and realistic computerized voices. Despite the flexibility and richness of expression that technology now affords, today's most common voice assistants often have female-sounding, polite, and playful voices by default. In this paper, we examine the social consequences of voice design, and introduce a simple research framework for understanding how voice affects how we perceive and interact with smart devices. Based on the foundational paradigm of computers as social actors, and informed by research in human-robot interaction, this framework demonstrates how voice design depends on a complex interplay between characteristics of the user, device, and context. Through this framework, we propose a set of guiding questions to inform future research in the space of voice design for smart devices.},

Recent scholarship in HCI and design has analyzed the ways collaborative design engagements, such as PD situated in the design workshop can amplify voices and empower underserved populations. Yet, we argue that PD as instantiated in the design workshop is very much an affluent and privileged activity that often neglects the challenges associated with envisioning equitable design solutions among underserved populations. Based on two series of community-based PD workshops with underserved populations in the U.S., we highlight key areas of tension and considerations for a more equitable PD approach: historical context of the research environment, community access, perceptions of materials and activities, and unintentional harm in collecting full accounts of personal narratives. By reflecting on these tensions as a call-to-action, we hope to deconstruct the privilege of the PD workshop within HCI and re-center the focus of design on individuals who are historically underserved.},

AutoAI systems are capable of autonomously ingesting and pre-processing data, engineering new features, and creating and scoring models based on a target objectives (e.g. accuracy or run-time efficiency). Though not yet widely adopted, we are interested in understanding how AutoAI will impact the practice of data science. We conducted interviews with 20 data scientists who work at a large, multinational technology company and practice data science in various business settings. Our goal is to understand their current work practices and how these practices might change with AutoAI. Reactions were mixed: while informants expressed concerns about the trend of automating their jobs, they also strongly felt it was inevitable. Despite these concerns, they remained optimistic about their future job security due to a view that the future of data science work will be a collaboration between humans and AI systems, in which both automation and human expertise are indispensable.},

abstract = {To what extent user's stance towards a given topic could be inferred? Most of the studies on stance detection have focused on analysing user's posts on a given topic to predict the stance. However, the stance in social media can be inferred from a mixture of signals that might reflect user's beliefs including posts and online interactions. This paper examines various online features of users to detect their stance towards different topics. We compare multiple set of features, including on-topic content, network interactions, user's preferences, and online network connections. Our objective is to understand the online signals that can reveal the users' stance. Experimentation is applied on tweets dataset from the SemEval stance detection task, which covers five topics. Results show that stance of a user can be detected with multiple signals of user's online activity, including their posts on the topic, the network they interact with or follow, the websites they visit, and the content they like. The performance of the stance modelling using different network features are comparable with the state-of-the-art reported model that used textual content only. In addition, combining network and content features leads to the highest reported performance to date on the SemEval dataset with F-measure of 72.49%. We further present an extensive analysis to show how these different set of features can reveal stance. Our findings have distinct privacy implications, where they highlight that stance is strongly embedded in user's online social network that, in principle, individuals can be profiled from their interactions and connections even when they do not post about the topic.},

abstract = {Attracting contingent workers, teleworkers, small start-up teams and the self-employed, co-working spaces have grown from corner coffee shops and internet cafes, to business empires with thousands of members in urban locations. Yet the rise of co-working in the twenty-first century has received only limited attention in CSCW, despite co-workers' copious use of distributed collaborative tools. CSCW has more frequently addressed the challenges of working together, apart - that is, how we might support or otherwise transpose rich collocated interactions into distributed environments. This paper explores the challenges of working alone and apart, yet together, based on observational study and interviews at three large co-working spaces in New York City. Using a sociomaterial approach, we identify and explore core tensions visible in the site between participation in a distributed work team and in a distinct, collocated community, which we label the co-working paradox. This includes local configurations of digital and physical materials that shift locus of participation, that blend work and home, and manage employer visibility. We use these themes to suggest a generative return to certain core concepts in studies of distributed work - namely, common ground, workspaces, and placefulness - to further study and design for the growth of these unique environments.},

In this paper, we explore two short-term projects to understand how they influence participant engagement in the task and discussion elements of VCS. We calculate descriptive statistics to characterise project participants. Additionally, using calculation of correlation coefficients and hypothesis testing, we identify factors influencing volunteer task engagement and the effect this has on project outcomes.

Among these platforms, ride-sharing services such as Uber reshape people's daily mobility experiences. However, these highly-functional platforms do not always provide effective mobility solutions due to social, economic, and technical restrictions. In low resource and rural areas, drivers in these areas often have to build their own ride-sharing systems to satisfy their needs. We present a qualitative study employing both participant observation and semi-structured interview techniques to document the barriers for DiDi, a dominant Chinese ride-sharing platform, to solve the mobility problem between small cities and nearby larger hubs. We further describe a simple, non-algorithmic ride-sharing solution developed by taxi drivers in a small county-level Chinese city (Chiping, Shandong Province). This solution provides low cost, highly-effective mobility services from the small city to the province's capital city (Jinan). Users' perceptions and concerns of such a system are also discussed.

abstract = {Terror attacks have been linked in part to online extremist content. Online conversations are cloaked in religious ambiguity, with deceptive intentions, often twisted from mainstream meaning to serve a malevolent ideology. Although tens of thousands of Islamist extremism supporters consume such content, they are a small fraction relative to peaceful Muslims. The efforts to contain the ever-evolving extremism on social media platforms have remained inadequate and mostly ineffective. Divergent extremist and mainstream contexts challenge machine interpretation, with a particular threat to the precision of classification algorithms. Radicalization is a subtle long-running persuasive process that occurs over time. Our context-aware computational approach to the analysis of extremist content on Twitter breaks down this persuasion process into building blocks that acknowledge inherent ambiguity and sparsity that likely challenge both manual and automated classification. Based on prior empirical and qualitative research in social sciences, particularly political science, we model this process using a combination of three contextual dimensions -- religion, ideology, and hate -- each elucidating a degree of radicalization and highlighting independent features to render them computationally accessible. We utilize domain-specific knowledge resources for each of these contextual dimensions such as Qur'an for religion, the books of extremist ideologues and preachers for political ideology and a social media hate speech corpus for hate. The significant sensitivity of the Islamist extremist ideology and its local and global security implications require reliable algorithms for modelling such communications on Twitter. Our study makes three contributions to reliable analysis: (i) Development of a computational approach rooted in the contextual dimensions of religion, ideology, and hate, which reflects strategies employed by online Islamist extremist groups, (ii) An in-depth analysis of relevant tweet datasets with respect to these dimensions to exclude likely mislabeled users, and (iii) A framework for understanding online radicalization as a process to assist counter-programming. Given the potentially significant social impact, we evaluate the performance of our algorithms to minimize mislabeling, where our context-aware approach outperforms a competitive baseline by 10.2% in precision, thereby enhancing the potential of such tools for use in human review.},

abstract = {As video game press ("experts") and casual gamers ("amateurs") have different motivations when writing video game reviews, discrepancies in their reviews may arise. To study such potential discrepancies, we conduct a large-scale investigation of more than 1 million reviews on the Metacritic review platform. In particular, we assess the existence and nature of discrepancies in video game appraisal by experts and amateurs, and how they manifest in ratings, over time, and in review language. Leveraging these insights, we explore the predictive power of early expert vs. amateur reviews in forecasting video game reputation in the short- and long-term. We find that amateurs, in contrast to experts, give more polarized ratings of video games, rate games surprisingly long after game release, and are positively biased towards older games. On a textual level, we observe that experts write rather complex, less readable texts than amateurs, whose reviews are more emotionally charged. While in the short-term amateur reviews are remarkably predictive of game reputation among other amateurs (achieving 91% ROC AUC in a binary classification), both expert and amateur reviews are equally well suited for long-term predictions. Overall, our work is the first large-scale comparative study of video game reviewing behavior, with practical implications for amateurs when deciding which games to play, and for game developers when planning which games to design, develop, or continuously support. More broadly, our work contributes to the discussion of wisdom of the few vs. wisdom of the crowds, as we uncover the limits of experts in capturing the views of amateurs in the particular context of video game reviews.},

By examining tweets about the "Twitter algorithm" we consider the wide range of concerns and desires Twitter users express. We find a concern with fairness (narrowly construed) is present, particularly in the ways users complain that the platform enacts a political bias against conservatives. However, we find another important category of concern, evident in attempts to exert control over the algorithm. Twitter users who seek control do so for a variety of reasons, many well justified. We argue for the need for better and clearer definitions of what constitutes legitimate and illegitimate control over algorithmic processes and to consider support for users who wish to enact their own collective choices.},

abstract = {In many teams, members play distinct roles, from leader to disrupter to social networker. Understanding the roles that contributors enact in micro-lending platforms is both psychologically and socially important for sustaining members' motivation and coordinating their joint efforts. Knowing what roles exist in these communities or which additional ones might be needed can also help teams function more effectively. In this paper, we identify social roles in Kiva.org, a peer-to-peer micro-funding platform, by utilizing members' lending behaviors, social network behaviors and communication behaviors to model their social roles at three levels. At the individual level, this method discovered active lenders who made many loans, early-bird lenders who made loans well before deadlines, and lurkers who rarely lent. At the topical level, our method differentiated those who had broad interests and lent to many causes from those who made loans only to borrowers in certain geographic regions or industry sectors. At the team level, the method revealed eight team-oriented functional roles such as encouragers, reminders, competitors, followers, and welcomers. To demonstrate the utility of the team roles, we used regression analysis to show how the distribution of social roles within teams influences the amount of money teams lent. Implications for identifying roles and understanding their contributions to teams are discussed.},

abstract = {Concern about algorithmically-curated content and its impact on democracy is reaching a fever pitch worldwide. But relative to the role of social media in electoral processes, the role of search results has received less public attention. We develop a theoretical conceptualization of search results as a form of media-search media-and analyze search media in the context of political partisanship in the six months leading up to the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. Our empirical analyses use a total of over 4 million URLs, scraped daily from Google search queries for all candidates running for federal office in the United States in 2018. In our first set of analyses we characterize the nature of search media from the data collected in terms of the types of URLs present and the stability of search results over time. In our second, we annotate URLs' top-level domains with existing measures of political partisanship, examining trends by incumbency, election outcome, and other election characteristics. Among other findings, we note that partisanship trends in search media are largely similar for content about candidates from the two major political parties, whereas there are substantial differences in search media for incumbent versus challenger candidates. This work suggests that longitudinal, systematic audits of search media can reflect real-world political trends. We conclude with implications for web search designers and consumers of political content online.},

In this paper, we study how to motivate groups of workers by paying them equitably. To this end, we characterize existing collaborative tasks based on the types of information available to crowd workers. Then, we apply concepts from equity theory to show how fair payments relate to worker motivation, and we propose two theoretically grounded classes of fair payments. Finally, we run two experiments using an audio transcription task on Amazon Mechanical Turk to understand how workers perceive these payments. Our results show that workers recognize fair and unfair payment divisions, but are biased toward payments that reward them more. Additionally, our data suggests that fair payments could lead to a small increase in worker effort. These results inform the design of future collaborative crowdsourcing tasks.},

The use of sensor-captured patient-generated data (sPGD) has been gaining greater prominence in the assessment of physical health, but we have little understanding of the role that sPGD can play in mental health. To better understand the use of sPGD in mental health, we interviewed care providers in an intensive treatment program (ITP) for veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder. In this program, patients were given Fitbits for their own voluntary use. Providers identified a number of potential benefits from patients' Fitbit use, such as patient empowerment and opportunities to reinforce therapeutic progress through collaborative data review and interpretation. However, despite the promise of sensor data as offering an "objective" view into patients' health behavior and symptoms, the relationships between sPGD and therapeutic progress are often ambiguous. Given substantial subjectivity involved in interpreting data from commercial wearables in the context of mental health treatment, providers emphasized potential risks to their patients and were uncertain how to adjust their practice to effectively guide collaborative use of the FitBit and its sPGD. We discuss the implications of these findings for designing systems to leverage sPGD in mental health care.?},

abstract = {With computational algorithms making an increasing number of deeply consequential, and often problematic judgments on our behalf, there is a growing interest in slowing down technology to encourage users to reflect on judgments made by algorithms. Prior work in slow technology has established slowness as an agent of reflection and serendipity; however, it has been unclear whether this waiting time actually helps users gain useful insight or any other benefits as they make judgments using an algorithm. To this end, we conducted a series of online and in-person between-subject user studies in which we isolate the impact of an algorithm's speed on how users incorporate the algorithm's advice when making judgments in the context of simple visual recognition tasks. We find that our participants followed good quality algorithms more and bad quality algorithms somewhat less if the response time of the algorithm is slower. Furthermore, qualitative analysis of the in-person study interviews reveals that the waiting was not time wasted, but was often used to reflect on the task and the estimation process of themselves and the algorithm, and to compare and reevaluate the two processes. Based on these findings, we outline design implications of future algorithmic systems.},

Using panel data from a sample of 275 wiki communities that migrated to message walls and a method inspired by regression discontinuity designs, we analyze these transitions and estimate the impact of the system's introduction. Although the adoption of message walls was associated with increased communication among all editors and newcomers, it had little effect on productivity, and was further associated with a decrease in article contributions from new editors. Our results imply that design changes that make communication easier in a social computing system may not translate to increased participation along other dimensions.},

Moreover, the adaptive practices of these broadly dispersed groups are still not well understood. We ask:How do globally distributed teams temporally coordinate to accomplish their work? We examine an extreme case of online temporal coordination: high-tempo information curation about the urgent humanitarian crisis following the 2017 Hurricane Maria landfall in Puerto Rico. Our analysis of synchronous chat transcripts and data artifacts produced by The Standby Task Force reveals how this digital humanitarian group establishes temporal coordination through different shared understandings of time relative to the crisis, the globally distributed work, and the collaborative information technologies. We make four contributions from our analysis: First, we developed a pluritemporal analytical framework that describes different forms of socially constructed time and disambiguates their meaning in talk. Next, we present empirical evidence of how this distributed team establishes shared temporal orders to collectively orient their work in time. Then, we describe how they reconcile multiple and conflicting instances of sociotemporal "disorder'' to enable productive work.

We find that medical makers share strategies to address risks, adopt labor roles, and acquire resources within traditional medical practice. Our findings outline how medical-makers mitigate risks for patient safety, collaborate with local and global stakeholder networks, and overcome constraints of co-location and material practices.

abstract = {Complex machine learning models are deployed in several critical domains including healthcare and autonomous vehicles nowadays, albeit as functional blackboxes. Consequently, there has been a recent surge in interpreting decisions of such complex models in order to explain their actions to humans. Models which correspond to human interpretation of a task are more desirable in certain contexts and can help attribute liability, build trust, expose biases and in turn build better models. It is therefore crucial to understand how and which models conform to human understanding of tasks. In this paper we present a large-scale crowdsourcing study that reveals and quantifies the dissonance between human and machine understanding, through the lens of an image classification task. In particular, we seek to answer the following questions: Which (well performing) complex ML models are closer to humans in their use of features to make accurate predictions? How does task difficulty affect the feature selection capability of machines in comparison to humans? Are humans consistently better at selecting features that make image recognition more accurate? Our findings have important implications on human-machine collaboration, considering that a long term goal in the field of artificial intelligence is to make machines capable of learning and reasoning like humans.},

abstract = {The rise of machine learning has fundamentally altered decision making: rather than being made solely by people, many important decisions are now made through an "algorithm-in-the-loop'' process where machine learning models inform people. Yet insufficient research has considered how the interactions between people and models actually influence human decisions. Society lacks both clear normative principles regarding how people should collaborate with algorithms as well as robust empirical evidence about how people do collaborate with algorithms. Given research suggesting that people struggle to interpret machine learning models and to incorporate them into their decisions---sometimes leading these models to produce unexpected outcomes---it is essential to consider how different ways of presenting models and structuring human-algorithm interactions affect the quality and type of decisions made. This paper contributes to such research in two ways. First, we posited three principles as essential to ethical and responsible algorithm-in-the-loop decision making. Second, through a controlled experimental study on Amazon Mechanical Turk, we evaluated whether people satisfy these principles when making predictions with the aid of a risk assessment. We studied human predictions in two contexts (pretrial release and financial lending) and under several conditions for risk assessment presentation and structure. Although these conditions did influence participant behaviors and in some cases improved performance, only one desideratum was consistently satisfied. Under all conditions, our study participants 1) were unable to effectively evaluate the accuracy of their own or the risk assessment's predictions, 2) did not calibrate their reliance on the risk assessment based on the risk assessment's performance, and 3) exhibited bias in their interactions with the risk assessment. These results highlight the urgent need to expand our analyses of algorithmic decision making aids beyond evaluating the models themselves to investigating the full sociotechnical contexts in which people and algorithms interact.},

VidLyz promotes active thinking about the impact of audience persuasion factors in making an effective campaign video by guiding novice entrepreneurs in planning materials of their videos on their own, with consideration of the product category, the target audience, and audience-product interactions. To evaluate our system, we collected subjective ratings and feedback on persuasion factors for 140 Kickstarter campaign videos from 2100 crowd workers and presented them through our prototype VidLyz tool. A user study with 45 novice users and five previous campaign creators found that our tool was useful for understanding the implication and relative importance of the persuasion factors of the campaign videos. The interactive and active thinking elements of VidLyz promoted novice users to make coherent and persuasive pre-production plan (using storyboards) for their proposed campaign videos. A follow-up user study showed that these storyboards had a higher likelihood of getting funded by crowd workers than those with less persuasive pre-production plan.

We discuss factors influencing participants' sociality including relationship roles and expectations, mood state and communication channels, location and privacy, and culture and society.

However, there exist gaps of empirical knowledge in understanding how this multimodal asynchronous VR collaboration (MAVRC) context impacts social behaviors in mediated-communication, workspace awareness in cooperative work, and user requirements for authoring and consuming multimedia recording. This study aims to address these gaps by conceptualizing MAVRC as a type of CSCW and by understanding the challenges and design considerations of MAVRC systems. To this end, we conducted an exploratory need-finding study where participants (N = 15) used an experimental MAVRC system to complete a representative spatial task in an asynchronously collaborative setting, involving both consumption and production of multimodal recordings. Qualitative analysis of interview and observation data from the study revealed unique, core design challenges of MAVRC in: (1) coordinating proxemic behaviors between asynchronous collaborators, (2) providing traceability and change awareness across different versions of 3D scenes, (3) accommodating viewpoint control to maintain workspace awareness, and (4) supporting navigation and editing of multimodal recordings. We discuss design implications, ideate on potential design solutions, and conclude the paper with a set of design recommendations for MAVRC systems.},

The paper is a methodological reflection on the grounded theory approach to concept development, with a focus on the technical terms: in vivo category, iteration on the code, and sensitizing category. It is also a substantive theoretical contribution, elaborating the concept of a domain in computing, data and information science, and how it has long served as an organizing principle for developing computational systems. Four tricks of the trade for studying the 'logic of domains' are offered as sensitizing concepts to aid future investigations.},

However, understanding factors that may contribute to longer-term, sustainable diversification of such groups remains a challenge. In this paper, we present the results of a mixed-methods study of two microcosms of making: game development, and quilting. Our findings reveal parallel structures within these groups despite being highly skewed towards male or female participation, respectively. Our results shed light on attitudes, behaviours, and experiences indicating that similar desires for wider community support among other factors exist in both groups, but these needs are not satisfied in the STEM context. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings as opportunities for rethinking how we design the environments that are meant to support design itself, considering the role of technology in these spaces, and prioritizing nurturing the development of the maker community beyond the maker space.},

While the scientific understanding of human -omic information is evolving, the interpretation of the data may impact well-being of users and relevant others, and therefore poses challenges and opportunities for CSCW research. We identify the information, interaction, and sense-making needs of microbiomic data users, within the broader context of social omics - the sharing and collaborative engagement with data and interpretation. Analyzing users' discussions on Reddit's r/HumanMicrobiome, we identified seven user needs for microbiome data: reviewing an annotated report, comparing microbiome data, tracking changes, receiving personalized actionable information, curating and securing information, documenting and sharing self experiments, and enhancing the communication between patients and health-care providers. We highlight the ways in which users interact with each other to collaboratively make sense of the data. We conclude with design implications, including tools for better communication with care providers, and for symptom-centered sharing and discussion.},

Telemanipulation systems can be employed to minimize these risks, but may impede effective task performance due to the reduced sensory cues they typically convey. To address this shortcoming, we explore the benefits of augmenting these cues with the addition of audition, vibration, and force feedback, and evaluate them on users' performance in a VR mechanical assembly task employing a simulated impact wrench. Our research focuses on the utility of vibrotactile feedback, rendered as a simplified and attenuated version of the vibrations experienced while operating an actual impact wrench. We investigate whether such feedback can serve to enhance the operator's awareness of the state of the tool, as well as a proxy for the forces experienced during collisions and coupling, while operating the tool an actual impact wrench. Results from our user study comparing feedback modalities confirm that the introduction of vibrotactile, in addition to auditory feedback can significantly improve user performance as assessed by completion time. However, the addition of force feedback to these two modalities did not further improve performance.},

abstract = {Modern User Interfaces (UIs) are increasingly expected to be plastic, in the sense that they retain a constant level of usability, even when subjected to context (platform, user, and environment) changes at runtime. Adaptive UIs have been promoted as a solution for context variability due to their ability to automatically adapt to the context-of-use at runtime. However, evaluating end-user satisfaction of adaptive UIs is a challenging task, because the UI and the context-of-use are both constantly changing. Thus, an acceptance analysis of UI adaptation features should consider the context-of-use when adaptations are triggered. Classical usability evaluation methods like usability tests mostly focus on a posteriori analysis techniques and do not fully exploit the potential of collecting implicit and explicit user feedback at runtime. To address this challenge, we present an on-the-fly usability testing solution that combines continuous context monitoring together with collection of instant user feedback to assess end-user satisfaction of UI adaptation features. The solution was applied to a mobile Android mail application, which served as basis for a usability study with 23 participants. A data-driven end-user satisfaction analysis based on the collected context information and user feedback was conducted. The main results show that most of the triggered UI adaptation features were positively rated.},

SAPIENS introduces dedicated components for user and device tracking, attention detection, priority management for devices, tasks, and notifications, context-awareness inference, user interruptibility prediction, and device interchangeability that can be instantiated at will according to the needs of the application. To implement these components effectively, SAPIENS employs event-based processing by reusing the core engine of a recently introduced software architecture, Euphoria (Schipor et al., 2019), that was specifically designed for engineering interactions in smart environments with heterogeneous I/O devices, and relies entirely on web standards, protocols, and open data-interchange formats, such as JavaScript, WebSockets, HTTP, and JSON. This inheritance makes SAPIENS flexible and adaptable to support implementation of diverse application scenarios for peripheral interaction and for a wide variety of smart environments, devices, platforms, data formats, and contexts of use. We present our design criteria for SAPIENS regarding (1) event handling techniques, (2) quality, (3) contextual, and (4) attention-related properties, and describe its components and dataflows that make SAPIENS a specialized software architecture for peripheral interaction scenarios. We also demonstrate SAPIENS with a practical application, inspired and adapted from Bakker's (2013) classical example for peripheral interaction, for which we provide an online simulation tool that researchers and practitioners can readily use to consult actual JavaScript code implementing the inner logic of selected components of our architecture as well as to observe live JSON messages exchanged by the various components of SAPIENS.},

Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge no existing SWfMSs directly support collaboration. Data is increasing in complexity, dimensionality, and volume, and the efficient analysis of data often goes beyond the realm of an individual and requires collaboration with multiple researchers from varying domains. In this paper, we propose a groupware system architecture for data analysis that in addition to supporting collaboration, also incorporates features from SWfMSs to support modern data analysis processes. As a proof of concept for the proposed architecture we developed SciWorCS - a groupware system for scientific data analysis. We present two real-world use-cases: collaborative software repository analysis and bioinformatics data analysis. The results of the experiments evaluating the proposed system are promising. Our bioinformatics user study demonstrates that SciWorCS can leverage real-world data analysis tasks by supporting real-time collaboration among users.},

Organizations usually train employees to interact with required IT systems. Often, employees, or users in general, develop their own strategies for solving repetitive tasks and processes. However, organizations find it hard to detect whether employees interact efficiently with IT systems or not. Hence, we have developed a method which detects inefficient behavior assuming that at least one optimal HCI strategy is known. This method provides recommendations to gradually adapt users' behavior towards the optimal way of interaction considering satisfaction of users. Based on users' behavior logs tracked by a Java application suitable for multi-application and multi-instance environments, we demonstrate the applicability for a specific task in a common Windows environment utilizing realistic simulated behaviors of users.},

abstract = {Progressive Web App (PWA) is a new approach to the development of mobile applications (apps) which was proposed by Google in 2015. It combines technology resources of both web and native apps. Meta-design is an End-User Development (EUD) approach from which end-users participate actively in a system's design process. Yet, PWAs are a recent technology and the impacts of associating EUD and PWAs has been little exploited. As the traditional PWA approach is limited regarding users acting as co-designers, we propose the PWA-EU approach, an extension of the traditional PWA architecture that includes EUD concepts. PWA-EU provides contributions in two lenses. First, the proposal was designed to be used by developers on the design/development time. Second, the app developed using PWA-EU approach will allow end-users to select design preferences, which makes them participants of the app's design. This active participation of end-users on the design is possible due to the meta-design concepts present on the PWA-EU approach. In this article, we present the PWA-EU approach and its evaluation in the perspective of developers/designers. For the evaluation, we grouped participants according to their professional background. The results also indicate that novice developers had a reasonable performance with only one hour of training.We conclude that even novice developers could achieve better performance in a real-life environment, in which they would have more time.},

abstract = {A gesture elicitation study, as originally defined, consists of gathering a sample of participants in a room, instructing them to produce gestures they would use for a particular set of tasks, materialized through a representation called referent, and asking them to fill in a series of tests, questionnaires, and feedback forms. Until now, this procedure is conducted manually in a single, physical, and synchronous setup. To relax the constraints imposed by this manual procedure and to support stakeholders in defining and conducting such studies in multiple contexts of use, this paper presents Gelicit, a cloud computing platform that supports gesture elicitation studies distributed in time and space structured into six stages: (1) define a study: a designer defines a set of tasks with their referents for eliciting gestures and specifies an experimental protocol by parameterizing its settings; (2) conduct a study: any participant receiving the invitation to join the study conducts the experiment anywhere, anytime, anyhow, by eliciting gestures and filling forms; (3) classify gestures: an experimenter classifies elicited gestures according to selected criteria and a vocabulary; (4) measure gestures: an experimenter computes gesture measures, like agreement, frequency, to understand their configuration; (5) discuss gestures: a designer discusses resulting gestures with the participants to reach a consensus; (6) export gestures: the consensus set of gestures resulting from the discussion is exported to be used with a gesture recognizer. The paper discusses Gelicit advantages and limitations with respect to three main contributions: as a conceptual model for gesture management, as a method for distributed gesture elicitation based on this model, and as a cloud computing platform supporting this distributed elicitation. We illustrate Gelicit through a study for eliciting 2D gestures executing Internet of Things tasks on a smartphone.},

We present GestureCards, a hybrid gesture notation mixing graphical and textual elements we developed to describe multi-touch gestures. To evaluate our approach, we compared how users perceive and are affected by different notations. First, we compared GestureCards with a textual notation and observed advantages in terms of speed, correctness, and confidence. Second, we asked participants to compare GestureCards, a textual, and a graphical notation and rate them. The results indicate that the participants' perception depends on the gesture, but GestureCards received consistently good ratings. Third, we monitored several participants working with GestureCards solving practical development tasks for gesture-based applications and they felt well supported by GestureCards.},

abstract = {Many scientific publications report on computational results based on code and data, but even when code and data are published, the main text is usually provided in a separate, traditional format such as PDF. Since code, data, and text are not linked on a deep level, it is difficult for readers and reviewers to understand and retrace how the authors achieved a specific result that is reported in the main text, e.g. a figure, table, or number. In addition, to make use of new the opportunities afforded by data and code availability, such as re-running analyses with changed parameters, considerable effort is required. In order to overcome this issue and to enable more interactive publications that support scientists in more deeply exploring the reported results, we present the concept, implementation, and initial evaluation of bindings. A binding describes which data subsets, code lines, and parameters produce a specific result that is reported in the main text (e.g. a figure or number). Based on a prototypical implementation of these bindings, we propose a toolkit for authors to easily create interactive figures by connecting specific UI widgets (e.g. a slider) to parameters. In addition to inspecting code and data, readers can then manipulate the parameter and see how the results change. We evaluated the approach by applying it to a set of existing articles. The results provide initial evidence that the concept is feasible and applicable to many papers with moderate effort.},

abstract = {We introduce "Life-Tags," a wearable, smartglasses-based system for abstracting life in the form of clouds of tags and concepts automatically extracted from snapshots of the visual reality recorded by wearable video cameras. Life-Tags summarizes users' life experiences using word clouds, highlighting the "executive summary" of what the visual experience felt like for the smartglasses user during some period of time, such as a specific day, week, month, or the last hour. In this paper, we focus on (i) design criteria and principles of operation for Life-Tags, such as its first-person, eye-level perspective for recording life, passive logging mode, and privacy-oriented operation, as well as on (ii) technical and engineering aspects for implementing Life-Tags, such as the block architecture diagram highlighting devices, software modules, third-party services, and dataflows. We also conduct a technical evaluation of Life-Tags and report results from a controlled experiment that generated 21,600 full HD snapshots from six indoor and outdoor scenarios, representative of everyday life activities, such as walking, eating, traveling, etc., with a total of 180 minutes of recorded life to abstract with tag clouds. Our experimental results and Life-Tags prototype inform design and engineering of future life abstracting systems based on smartglasses and wearable video cameras to ensure effective generation of rich clouds of concepts, reflective of the visual experience of the smartglasses user.},

abstract = {Eye-tracking has a very strong potential in human computer interaction (HCI) as an input modality, particularly in mobile situations. However, it lacks convenient action triggering methods. In our research, we investigate the combination of eye-tracking and fixed-gaze head movement, which allows us to trigger various commands without using our hands or changing gaze direction. In this instance, we have proposed a new algorithm for fixed-gaze head movement detection using only scene images captured by the scene camera equipped in front of the head-mounted eye-tracker, for the purpose of saving computation time. To test the performance of our fixed-gaze head movement detection algorithm and the acceptance of triggering commands by these movements when the user's hands are occupied by another task, we have designed and developed an experimental application known as EyeMusic. The EyeMusic system is a music reading system, which can play the notes of a measure in a music score that the user does not understand. By making a voluntary head movement when fixing his/her gaze on the same point of a music score, the user can obtain the desired audio feedback. The design, development and usability testing of the first prototype for this application are presented in this paper. The usability of our application is confirmed by the experimental results, as 85% of participants were able to use all the head movements we implemented in the prototype. The average success rate of this application is 70%, which is partly influenced by the performance of the eye-tracker we use. The performance of our fixed-gaze head movement detection algorithm is 85%, and there were no significant differences between the performance of each head movement.},

Currently, devices such as keyboards, cell phones, and tablets remain largely unaware of their role within a user's workflow. As a result, transitioning between devices is tedious, often to the degree that users are discouraged from taking full advantage of the devices they have within reach. This work explores the device ecologies used in desk-centric environments and complies the insights observed into SMAC, a simplified model of attention and capture that emphasizes the role of user-device proxemics, as mediated by hand placement, gaze, and relative body orientation, as well as inter-device proxemics. SMAC illustrates the potential of harnessing the rich, proxemic diversity that exists between users and their device ecologies, while also helping to organize and synthesize the growing body of literature on distributed user interfaces. An evaluation study using SMAC demonstrated that users could easily understand the tenants of user- and inter-device proxemics and found them to be valuable within their workflows.},

abstract = {Gesto is a system that enables task automation for Android apps using gestures and voice commands. Using Gesto, a user can record a UI action sequence for an app, choose a gesture or a voice command to activate the UI action sequence, and later trigger the UI action sequence by the corresponding gesture/voice command. Gesto enables this for existing Android apps without requiring their source code or any help from their developers. In order to make such capability possible, Gesto combines bytecode instrumentation and UI action record-and-replay. To show the applicability of Gesto, we develop four use cases using real apps downloaded from Google Play-Bing, Yelp, AVG Cleaner, and Spotify. For each of these apps, we map a gesture or a voice command to a sequence of UI actions. According to our measurement, Gesto incurs modest overhead for these apps in terms of memory usage, energy usage, and code size increase. We evaluate our instrumentation capability and overhead using 1,000 popular apps downloaded from Google Play. Our result shows that Gesto is able to instrument 94.9% of the apps without any significant overhead. In addition, since our prototype currently supports 6 main UI elements of Android, we evaluate our coverage and measure what percentage of UI element uses we can cover. Our result shows that our 6 UI elements can cover 96.4% of all statically-declared UI element uses in the 1,000 Google Play apps.},

If a UI pattern is present, the tool runs the corresponding testing strategy (Test Pattern). During reverse engineering the tool uses a catalog of UI Patterns which describes recurring behavior (UI Patterns) to test and the corresponding test strategies (Test Patterns). This catalog may be extended in the future as needed (e.g., to deal with new interaction trends). This paper describes the implementation details of the iMPAcT tool, the catalog of patterns used, the outputs produced by the tool and the results of experiments performed in order to evaluate the overall testing approach.

abstract = {Mainstream presentation tools such as Microsoft PowerPoint were originally built to mimic physical media like photographic slides and still exhibit the same characteristics. However, the state of the art in presentation tools shows that more recent solutions start to go beyond the classic presentation paradigms. For instance, presentations are becoming increasingly non-linear, content is quickly evolving beyond simple text and images and the way we author our presentations is becoming more collaborative. Nevertheless, existing presentation content models are often based on assumptions that do not apply to the current state of presentations any more, making them incompatible for some use cases and limiting the potential of end-user presentation solutions. In order to support state-of-the-art presentation functionality, we rethink the concept of a presentation and introduce a conceptual framework for presentation content. We then present a new content model for presentation solutions based on the Resource-Selector-Link (RSL) hypermedia metamodel. We further discuss an implementation of our model and show some example use cases. We conclude by outlining how design choices in the model address currently unmet needs with regards to extensibility, content reuse, collaboration, semantics, user access management, non-linearity, and context awareness, resulting in better support for the corresponding end-user functionality in presentation tools.},

abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to this issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction, the second to focus on the contributions from the research community Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW). This journal model allows for rapid publication of papers shortly after acceptance as well as enabling automatic indexing services, such as Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) indexing. The aim is to increase the visibility of the work of authors in this community, and allow for better comparability with fields outside of Computer Science. This issue contains papers accepted over two iterations of the review process. The call for papers for this second issue, with an initial deadline in Spring 2018, attracted 722 submissions, from all around the world. After the first round of reviewing, 326 (45,2%) papers were invited to the Revise and Resubmit phase. The program committee worked hard over August 2018 to arrive at final decisions, with an online editorial committee meeting held to allow for collective deliberation. In the end, 184 papers (25,5%) were accepted. For some of those papers, authors received further shepherding and guidance by a senior committee member. This shows the commitment of the CSCW community to not only ensure high quality contributions, but also to educate and enable authors to write and present their best work for this community. This issue exists because of the dedicated volunteer effort of 132 senior editorial committee members who served as Associate Chairs (ACs), and 837 external expert reviewers to ensure high quality and insightful reviews for all papers in both rounds.},

We found that most often, teens videochat with their closest friends from their bedrooms when they feel lonely or bored. Teens turned to videochat when understimulated but also felt understimulated during videochat. In order to manage this, they multitasked -teens moved from active chatting to co-presence while engaged in separate activities like scrolling social feeds or playing games. We uncovered social norms of reciprocity of attention, where teens match the attention level of the other and give leeway to briefly divert attention. Digital notifications did not feel disruptive to the videochat but family members' interruptions felt disruptive as teens' domestic context intruded into their virtual peer setting. We discuss these findings and their implications for research and design of videochat systems.},

Managing safety was a universal concern for our transgender participants, and they experienced complex manifestations of harm through technology. We found that harmful experiences for trans users could arise as targeted or incidental affronts, as sourced from outsiders or insiders, and as directed against individuals or entire communities.. Notably, some violations implicated technology design, while others tapped broader social dynamics. Reading our findings through the notions of 'space" and 'place," we unpack challenges and opportunities for building safer futures with transfolk, other vulnerable users, and their allies.},

We explore individuals' experiences with the flow of personal data across platforms through interviews about dating apps, often requiring integration with a Facebook account. Inductive analysis revealed complex and, at times, conflicted ideas over what appropriate behaviors around personal data should look like in multiplatform engagements-central to these tensions were the multiple relationships that must be managed through participation in these ecosystems. For example, individuals talked of resignation in relation to specific platforms and the 'cost" of using free services (people:platform), a lack of clarity and agency in defining what personal data might be shared between platforms (people:platform:platform), and, of course, the role of personal data in their efforts to establish and maintain relationships with other users in these 'social discovery" ecosystems (people:people). We explore how these attitudes can be understood as morally charged, drawing attention to the ways in which personal data flows can enact expectations and obligations between various sociotechnical actors in personal data ecosystems and how these compound relationships reveal the complexity and texture of multiplatform participation.},

We found that self-disclosure was frequently used as an effective rhetorical and content-focused strategy to provoke discussions and request assistance with the goal of developing or maintaining professional competence.

These framings result in research detailing characteristics, personal identities, and behaviors of large numbers of connected and interacting individuals, while the social identity concepts that lead to intra- and inter-group dynamics have received less attention. We argue that the emergent properties of self-categorization and social identity, which are particularly fluid and complex in online spaces, provide a complementary perspective with which to re-examine traditional topics in social computing. We discuss the applicability of the Social Identity Perspective to established and new research domains in CSCW, proposing alternative perspectives on self-presentation, social support, collaboration, conflict, and leadership. We note methodological considerations emerging from this theory. Finally, we consider how broad concepts and lessons from the Social Identity Perspective might inspire CSCW work in the future.},

Unlike teams with clearly defined work roles and team structures that were introduced to increase work efficiency and minimize redundancy, the team we studied lacks the role differentiation. To better understand how complex work is accomplished under these conditions, we conducted in-situ observations in the center's control room and interviewed communication specialists. We found that communication specialists self-organized by using a mix of material and immaterial coordination mechanisms, including work schedules, computer systems, and tacit agreements to coordinate tasks. Using these findings, we then identified three features of self-organized, collocated and time-critical teamwork that require technology support: awareness of task ownership, task self-assignment, and informal team hierarchy. We conclude by discussing technology requirements to support these teamwork features.},

In this paper, we propose CrowdNavi, a last mile navigation service in outdoor environments using crowdsourcing based on the guider-follower model. First, we collect trajectories of guiders and images of reference objects along trajectories. To guide followers by reference objects along the route, we design a Semantic Crowd Navigation model to generate fine-grained maps by integrating guiders' data. Second, we design two score functions to fulfill two main requirements and plan hints. Last, we provide context-aware navigation for followers based on the fine-grained map and detect deviation in real-time. Real world experiments conducted in three different areas show that our proposed system in combination with images of reference objects is efficient.},

abstract = {If scientific research can be described as "arm's length'' cooperative work, then the sciences engaged in the creation and maintenance of cooperatively built classification systems might be said to require extremely long arms; workers must reach across great distances of time, space and awareness to independently contribute to the creation and maintenance of a conceptual infrastructure. This is particularly the case for the field of biological taxonomy, in which researchers across the globe have, for more than three hundred years, cooperatively developed a massive knowledge organization system describing all life on earth. As taxonomists move from paper-based workflows to born-digital, data-first modes of publishing, new tools and approaches are needed to support their work. In this paper, we present research conducted as part of the "Transforming Taxonomic Interfaces" project aimed at improving interfaces for taxonomic software. We describe biological taxonomy in the context of CSCW, and identify key strategies taxonomists deploy to facilitate loosely coupled cooperative work. We also contribute a discussion ofsemantic refactoring, a unique kind of "articulation work'' entailed in developing, maintaining, and migrating classification systems. This work has implications for the design and study of knowledge organization systems and infrastructure, classification research, and for the development of general semantic web tools and software as well as those specifically for biological taxonomy.},

Little work thus far in CSCW and HCI has examined the potential of technology to support or enhance such interventions. This paper provides the first steps to unpacking this socio-technical design space, focusing on emotional regulation (ER) as a specific instance of a protective factor. We combine a user-centred approach to understanding lived experiences of families (interviews, design workshops) with an expert-led understanding of what makes interventions psychologically effective. Our findings suggest the potential of technology to enable a shift in how prevention interventions are designed and delivered: empowering children and parents through a new model of 'child-led, situated interventions', where participants learn through actionable support directly within family life, as opposed to didactic in-person workshops and a subsequent 'skills application'. This conceptual model was then instantiated in a technology probe, which was deployed with 14 families. The promising field study findings provide an initial proof-of-concept validation of the proposed approach.},

But the impact of this tagging system has not been quantitatively measured. Does NPOV tagging help articles to converge to the desired style? Do NPOV corrections encourage editors to adopt this style? We study these questions using a corpus of NPOV-tagged articles and a set of lexicons associated with biased language. An interrupted time series analysis shows that after an article is tagged for NPOV, there is a significant decrease in biased language in the article, as measured by several lexicons. However, for individual editors, NPOV corrections and talk page discussions yield no significant change in the usage of words in most of these lexicons, including Wikipedia's own list of "words to watch." This suggests that NPOV tagging and discussion does improve content, but has less success enculturating editors to the site's linguistic norms.},

To address this gap, I use experience sampling with diverse samples of Facebook (N = 362) and Twitter (N = 416) users, assessing the browsing experience across a wide range of emotions. Surprisingly, results provide little evidence of robust positive or negative effects, suggesting instead that the primary effect of browsing social media is a lessening of arousal. That is, contrary to stereotype, people tend to wind down - feel more relaxed, sleepy, bored and so on - not wind up.},

However, communicating about code can be difficult --- particularly in asynchronous settings where an instructor authors an explanation meant to be read and understood by a student later on. Communicating about code is uniquely difficult for two reasons. First, because of the dichotomous nature of the explanation, which consists of fragments of code and natural language descriptions. Second, instructors' explanations of code often involve modifying code throughout their explanation. This paper introduces chat.codes, a new tool for creating guided explanations about code. chat.codes introduces two features that make it easier to communicate about code. First, it adds deictic code references that allows instructors to write messages that reference specific regions of code. Second, it tracks and summarizes code edits in-line with messages, allowing instructors to create explanations in stages. An evaluation showed that these features were beneficial for both instructors and students.},

It also helps to categorize collaborative activities based on yet undocumented hybrid coupling styles between the members of multiple partially distributed or co-located subgroups. Our Domino framework was derived from initial observations of real-world practice and refined by the detailed analysis of participants' behavior and working styles during a simulation of a complex hybrid collaboration task with six partially distributed teams of four users in our lab. The resulting framework allows researchers to view collaboration through a new analytical lens, use new analytical tools, and also derive implications for the design of collaborative tools.},

Evacuation from potentially affected areas stands out among the most critical factors that can reduce mortality and vulnerability to crisis. We know surprisingly little about the factors that drive this important and often life-saving behavior, though recent work has suggested that social capital may play a critical and previously underestimated role in natural disaster preparedness. Moving beyond retrospective self-reporting and vehicle count estimates, we use social media data from a large number of Facebook users to examine connections between levels of social capital and evacuation behavior. This work is the first of its kind, examining these phenomena across three major U.S. disasters-Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma, and Hurricane Maria-with data on over 1.5 million social media users. Our analysis confirms that, holding confounding factors constant, several aspects of social capital are correlated with whether or not an individual evacuates. Higher levels of bridging and linking social ties correlate strongly with evacuation. However, these social capital related factors are not significantly associated with the rate of return after evacuation.},

We examine how the event structure, discussion platform, and participant interactions affected how a community collectively discussed design constraints and proposals. Ninety-two participants took part in the competition's online discussion, hosted on Slack. Applying a mixed-methods analysis, we found that participants shared less as they settled into teams and, due to the discussion system, had difficulty seeing how topics connected across channels; we also learned that certain messages led participants to add depth to existing topics. Based on the findings we provide recommendations for civic competitions aimed at building knowledge around a problem.},

We surveyed 158 people about their existing family support practices and deployed TableChat with 10 families in the field. We found that tangible support was the most common form of support shared in TableChat and also the most appreciated by participants. However, we found that participants valued not only supportive actions taken by their family members, but also those deliberately not taken (e.g., not buying junk food). Finally, families reported that journaling meals eaten apart aided the exchange of support, satisfied curiosity, and provided a "check-in" that everything was alright, whereas journaling meals eaten together felt redundant. We conclude with a framework that illustrates how informatics tools can be designed to complement rather than compete with existing family interactions.},

abstract = { 'Infrastructuring' as a concept draws attention to the way in which a designed artefact or system is not the end of the development process. Rather, technology development takes place up to, and including, its successful establishment in an associated body of practices. This places emphasis upon the role of practitioners as designers of their own practice environments. While the activities of professional technology development have been reasonably well discussed and conceptualized, activities that practitioners perform to make things work for them are less acknowledged as a systematic contribution to the successful establishment of the use of IT. This paper considers in particular the so-called 'point of infrastructuring': the moment at which practitioners become aware of opportunities to (re-)design their infrastructures, usually initiated by breakdowns or the recognition of potential innovations and reconsideration of current infrastructural use. From this point onwards, end users themselves may start configuring, tailoring or developing new conventions until a point has been reached in which a new technology usage has been successfully established. However, points of infrastructuring do not only provoke end-user driven in-situ design (or 'infrastructuring') activities. They also evoke so-called 'resonance activities'. These encompass all of the observations and communications that attend upon a point of infrastructure as it becomes visible within a work environment. Examination of resonance activities can be a starting point for a better understanding of the practitioner's activities beyond single infrastructural changes, providing a way of highlighting the relationship between different points of infrastructuring. How to capture and understand resonance activities and how to design technological support for them is still an open question. Based on previous work outlined in the literature and an empirical study that looked at collaborative appropriation activities (the most important aspect of infrastructuring) during 3D printing processes, we outline the concept of sociable technologies as a technological approach for capturing and supporting resonance activities and thus enabling infrastructuring activities more broadly.},

Through a study of 16 dyads, we found that ReactionBot was able to help communicate participants' affect, reducing the need for participants to self-react with emoji during conversations. However, contrary to our hypothesis, ReactionBot reduced social presence (behavioral interdependence) between dyads. Post study interviews suggest that the emotion feedback through ReactionBot indeed provided valuable nonverbal cues: offered more genuine feedback, and participants were more aware of their own emotions. However, this can come at the cost of increasing anxiety from concerns about negative emotion leakage. Further, the more active role of the system in facilitating the conversation can also result in unwanted distractions and may have attributed to the reduced sense of behavioral interdependence. We discuss implications for utilizing this type of cues in text-based communication.},

Caring for IT security requires continuous, often invisible work that relies upon tinkering and experimentation and addresses perennial oscillations between in-/securities. Caring for IT security, then, engages with established accountabilities and cultivates a moral stance that refrains from blaming insecurities upon single actors.

We report a study that explores the role of data in the complex processes involved in consultation events and the broader collaborative processes surrounding them.

However, if users can contribute without being logged-in (i.e., anonymously) analysis of interaction data omit part of a user's experience. Problematically, anonymous traces are unlikely to be randomly distributed, so their omission can change statistical conclusions, with implications for both research and practice. To understand the impacts on conclusions of leaving out anonymous traces, we conducted an analysis of system logs from two online citizen science projects. Attributing anonymous traces with user IDs, we found that (1) many users contribute anonymously, though with varied patterns; and (2) attributing anonymous traces diminishes empirical evidence used to support theory and change the results of system algorithms. These results suggest anonymous traces have implications for research on user behaviors and the practices associated with using such data to tailor user experiences in online communities.},

abstract = {Designing technical systems to be resistant to bias and discrimination represents vital new terrain for researchers, policymakers, and the anti-discrimination project more broadly. We consider bias and discrimination in the context of popular online dating and hookup platforms in the United States, which we call intimate platforms. Drawing on work in social-justice-oriented and Queer HCI, we review design features of popular intimate platforms and their potential role in exacerbating or mitigating interpersonal bias. We argue that focusing on platform design can reveal opportunities to reshape troubling patterns of intimate contact without overriding users' decisional autonomy. We identify and address the difficult ethical questions that nevertheless come along with such intervention, while urging the social computing community to engage more deeply with issues of bias, discrimination, and exclusion in the study and design of intimate platforms.},

Yet, little is known about how social technologies impact the day-to-day work of entrepreneurs in resource-constrained contexts. We performed a qualitative study involving interviews with 26 micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit and observations of entrepreneurship events. We found that micro-entrepreneurs in Detroit are often pushed into entrepreneurship in response to unexpected life disruptions, barriers to employment, and desire to benefit the community. Their resource-constrained contexts shape how they use social technologies, such as sharing economy tools and social media groups, particularly with respect to privacy, safety, and professional agency. We expand the discussion in CSCW around what it means to be an entrepreneur and provide implications for how social technologies can be designed to better meet the employment needs of people in resource-constrained communities.},

This paper presents two between-subjects experiments investigating the effect of Ingroup/Outgroup membership on effort spent in peer evaluations, and whether the group membership criterion type affects quality and stringency of evaluation. Two peer-review assignments were implemented in two separate classes. In the first study, students were nominally grouped by location they sat in class and non-nominally grouped by current class score; each was asked to review an Ingroup and Outgroup peer assignment. A second study randomly assigned students to one of four group types (random, score, motivation, and location); student reviewed two Ingroup assignments. In both studies, score-grouped students graded their peers more stringently than students grouped by location. These studies illustrate for system designers the impacts of group framing - and the disclosure of that-in peer review tasks.},

abstract = {Most US social media users engage regularly with multiple platforms. For LGBTQ+ people, this means making self-presentation decisions not just on one platform, but many. These choices are made in the face of sometimes-overlapping platform environments, which can have consequentially different norms, audiences, and affordances. Moreover, many LGBTQ+ users face high stakes in online self-presentation, due to the risk of stigmatization of their LGBTQ+ identity, increasing the importance of self-presentation decisions that enable them to achieve their goals and avoid stigmatization. This combination of environmental complexity and high stakes is not adequately accounted for in existing work on self-presentation, but doing so is important to support and understand the experiences of LGBTQ+ and other potentially stigmatized users. We adopt an ecological approach to an interview and cognitive mapping study of 20 LGBTQ+ social media users. We find that participants employ the platforms, audiences, affordances, and norms within what we call their "personal social media ecosystems" to avoid stigmatization while still allowing for expression of their LGBTQ+ identity and the flexibility to adjust their presentation over time.},

However, such code-switching makes others feel excluded and thus not considered appropriate during formal meetings. To offer NNSs more flexibility to code-switch in a group discussion while minimizing the cost of excluding others, we introduced a language support tool that automatically detects a user's spoken language, and then transcribe as well as translate them into another language (common language or NNS's native language). In a within-subject study involving 19 quads (two Japanese and two Chinese) in a collocated setting, participants were asked to perform a series of decision-making tasks with and without the tool. Results showed that the language support tool encouraged diverse use of language during a meeting, resulting in more participation from NNSs - they increased active initiating behaviors from NNSs. Although the perceived quality of collaboration became lower, it also elicited helping behaviors among the NNS pairs.},

Quality guidelines are mostly high-level principles, and many tacit and context-sensitive aspects of the expected quality cannot be easily enforced by a set of explicit rules. Collaborative editing is a reactive mechanism after low-quality posts have been posted. Our study of collaborative editing data on Stack Overflow suggests that tacit and context-sensitive quality-assurance knowledge is manifested in the editing patterns of large numbers of collaborative edits. Inspired by this observation, we develop and evaluate a Convolutional Neural Network based approach to learn editing patterns from historical post edits for predicting the need of editing a post. Our approach provides a proactive policy assurance mechanism that warns users potential quality issues in a post before it is posted.},

In this paper, we study community norms on Reddit in a large-scale, empirical manner. Via 2.8M comments removed by moderators of 100 top subreddits over 10 months, we use both computational and qualitative methods to identify three types of norms: macro norms that are universal to most parts of Reddit; meso norms that are shared across certain groups of subreddits; and micro norms that are specific to individual, relatively unique subreddits. Given the size of Reddit's user base---and the wide range of topics covered by different subreddits---we argue this represents the first large-scale census of the norms in broader internet culture. In other words, these findings shed light on what Reddit values, and how widely-held those values are. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of new and existing online communities.},

Stickers can convey richer meaning than emoji, but their complexity and placement constraint may result in miscommunication. In this paper, we aim to understand how people perceive emotion in stickers, as well as how miscommunication related to sticker occurs in actual chat contexts. Toward this goal, we conducted an online survey (n = 87) and in-depth interviews (n = 28) in South Korea. We found emotional and contextual aspects of sticker misinterpretation. In particular, emotion misinterpretation mostly happened due to stickers' ambiguous (multiple) facial/bodily expressions and different perception of dynamism in gestures. In real chat settings, there were also contextual misinterpretations where senders and receivers differently interpret stickers' visual representation/reference, or/and corresponding textual messages. Based on these findings, we provide several practical design implications such as context awareness support in sticker interaction.},

We conduct experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) testing how workers can propose and validate individual causal relationships and introduce a method for independent crowd workers to explore large networks. The core of the method, Iterative Pathway Refinement, is a theoretically-principled mechanism for efficient exploration via microtasks. We evaluate the method using synthetic networks and apply it on AMT to extract a large-scale causal attribution network. Worker interactions reveal important characteristics of causal perception and the generated network data can help improve our understanding of causality and causal inference.},

Researchers rely on these motivations to attract study participants and often use incentives, like performance comparisons, to encourage participation. Often, these study incentives are advertised using a slogan (e.g., "What is your thinking style?''). Research on framing effects suggests that advertisement slogans attract people with varying demographics and motivations. Could the slogan advertisements for studies risk attracting only specific users? To investigate the existence of potential sample biases, we measured how different slogan frames affected which participants self-selected into studies. We found that slogan frames impact recruitment significantly; changing the slogan frame from a 'supporting science' frame to a 'comparing oneself to others' frame lead to a 9% increase in recruitment for some studies. Additionally, slogans framed as learning more about oneself attract participants significantly more motivated by boredom compared to other slogan frames. We discuss design implications for using frames to improve recruitment and mitigate sources of sample bias in online research with volunteers.},

From our interviews, we identify the community, data, and action practices used by group administrators to collect, curate, and publish information about public safety that would otherwise go unreported. The combination of these practices improves the reputation of the groups on Facebook, increases trust, and encourages sustained participation from citizens. These practices also legitimize data gathered by group members as an important grassroots tool for responding to issues of public safety that would otherwise not be reported or acted upon.

Prior work showed that significant amounts of Foursquare check-ins did not match with the physical mobility patterns of users, and suggested that misrepresented check-ins were incentivized by external rewards provided by the system. In this paper, our goal is to understand the root cause of inaccurate check-in data, by studying the validity of check-in traces in social media platforms without external rewards for check-ins. We conduct a data-driven analysis using an empirical check-in data trace of more than 276,000 users from WeChat Moments, with matching traces of their physical mobility. We develop a set of hypotheses on the underlying motivations behind people's inaccurate check-ins, and validate them using a detailed survey study. Our analysis reveals that there are surprisingly high amount of inaccurate check-ins even in the absence of rewards: 43% of total check-ins are inaccurate and 61% of survey participants report they have misrepresented their check-ins. We also find that inaccurate check-ins are often a result of user interface design as well as for convenience, self-advertisement and self-presentation.},

In our discussion, we highlight how the local farmers' social movement work constitutes loosely organized small groups connecting others to an amorphous idea of a sustainable society--one that sustains an environmental, economic, local, cultural, and physical way of life.

We draw on four contemporary examples of how ICT is changing the way we conceive of and respond to natural hazards to offer a new reading of the concept of informating in the growing field of crisis informatics. We then argue that this concept suggests the adoption of a more critical agenda for crisis informatics research to better respond to contemporary challenges presented by climate change and natural hazards.},

abstract = {Conspiracy theories are omnipresent in online discussions---whether to explain a late-breaking event that still lacks official report or to give voice to political dissent. Conspiracy theories evolve, multiply, and interconnect, further complicating efforts to understand them and to limit their propagation. It is therefore crucial to develop scalable methods to examine the nature of conspiratorial discussions in online communities. What do users talk about when they discuss conspiracy theories online? What are the recurring elements in their discussions? What do these elements tell us about the way users think? This work answers these questions by analyzing over ten years of discussions in r/conspiracy---an online community on Reddit dedicated to conspiratorial discussions. We focus on the key elements of a conspiracy theory: the conspiratorial agents, the actions they perform, and their targets. By computationally detecting agent?action?target triplets in conspiratorial statements, and grouping them into semantically coherent clusters, we develop a notion of narrative-motif to detect recurring patterns of triplets. For example, a narrative-motif such as "governmental agency-controls-communications" represents the various ways in which multiple conspiratorial statements denote how governmental agencies control information. Thus, narrative-motifs expose commonalities between multiple conspiracy theories even when they refer to different events or circumstances. In the process, these representations help us understand how users talk about conspiracy theories and offer us a means to interpret what they talk about. Our approach enables a population-scale study of conspiracy theories in alternative news and social media with implications for understanding their adoption and combating their spread.},

However, in some cases cell folding encouraged collaborators to overlook folded sections or spend longer reviewing a notebook before editing it. These findings extend our understanding of code folding's trade-offs to a new medium and demonstrate its benefits for everyday collaboration.

We employed natural language processing techniques and qualitative methods on a corpus of approximately 30,000 Facebook comments from three politically distinct news publishers. Our findings show that commenting behavior reflects how social movements are framed and understood within a particular political orientation. Surprisingly, these data reveal that the structural patterns of discourse among commenters from the two alternative news sites are similar in terms of their relationship to those from the mainstream - exhibiting polarization, generalization, and othering of perspectives in political conversation. These data have implications for understanding the possibility for civil discourse in online venues and the role of commenting behavior in polarizing media sources in undermining such discourse.},

abstract = {Following successful crowd ideation contests, organizations in search of the "next big thing" are left with hundreds of ideas. Expert-based idea filtering is lengthy and costly; therefore, crowd-based strategies are often employed. Unfortunately, these strategies typically (1) do not separate the mediocre from the excellent, and (2) direct all the attention to certain idea concepts, while others starve. We introduce DBLemons - a crowd-based idea filtering strategy that addresses these issues by (1) asking voters to identify the worst rather than the best ideas using a "bag of lemons'' voting approach, and (2) by exposing voters to a wider idea spectrum, thanks to a dynamic diversity-based ranking system balancing idea quality and coverage. We compare DBLemons against two state-of-the-art idea filtering strategies in a real-world setting. Results show that DBLemons is more accurate, less time-consuming, and reduces the idea space in half while still retaining 94% of the top ideas.},

We studied people's reasons for and against adopting smart speakers, their privacy perceptions and concerns, and their privacy-seeking behaviors around smart speakers. We conducted a diary study and interviews with seventeen smart speaker users and interviews with seventeen non-users. We found that many non-users did not see the utility of smart speakers or did not trust speaker companies. In contrast, users express few privacy concerns, but their rationalizations indicate an incomplete understanding of privacy risks, a complicated trust relationship with speaker companies, and a reliance on the socio-technical context in which smart speakers reside. Users trade privacy for convenience with different levels of deliberation and privacy resignation. Privacy tensions arise between primary, secondary, and incidental users of smart speakers. Finally, current smart speaker privacy controls are rarely used, as they are not well-aligned with users' needs. Our findings can inform future smart speaker designs; in particular we recommend better integrating privacy controls into smart speaker interaction.},

Our goal in this study was to explore the patterns of responses that people invoked when talking about the role of smartphones in their lives and the lives of those around them. Responses suggested that both parents and teens are aware of and potentially influenced by a narrative that smartphones are addictive and can lead to negative, though largely undefined, consequences. We examine potential origins of this narrative, including media coverage, and examine the critical need for a deeper examination in the CSCW community of how this narrative could be influencing well-being, sense of self, and sensemaking around smartphone use.},

We further show how, given a new classification problem and a set of classifiers of unknown accuracy for the problem at hand, we can identify how to manage the cost-accuracy trade off by progressively determining if we should spend budget to obtain test data (to assess the accuracy of the given classifiers), or to train an ensemble of classifiers, or whether we should leverage the existing machine classifiers with the crowd, and in this case how to efficiently combine them based on their estimated characteristics to obtain the classification. We demonstrate that the techniques we propose obtain significant cost/accuracy improvements with respect to the leading classification algorithms.},

While these properties allow for relationships to be maintained with speed and efficiency, they may come at the expense of more effortful messages that are constructed with thought, time and care. This raises the question of how communication technologies might be designed to provoke moments of effortful maintenance from their users. To explore this question, we designed and implemented Message Builder, a text-based communication system that encourages relational partners to send increasingly long messages. We report findings from a field trial in which 14 dyads used Message Builder for everyday relational maintenance. While some of the effort-provoking features of Message Builder were described as problematic, we found that the system had value in guiding users towards authentic and meaningful effort investments that were valuable within their individual relationships.},

We performed semi-structured interviews with thirteen recent immigrants and five long-term immigrants. We found that ICTs and technology-mediated connections: (1) easily addressed immigrants' settlement needs, (2) minimally addressed their financial and cultural needs, and (3) were not used to address their emotional needs. To support recent immigrants' adaptation, we suggest ways for ICTs to (1) reduce uncertainty about meeting local-born populations, (2) foster reciprocity among immigrant communities, and (3) facilitate safe resource exchanges.},

In response, we present eight observations from our eight-year engaged field study about the changing nature of open source projects. We ground these observations through 24 research questions that serve as primers to spark research ideas in this new reality of open source projects.

Recently, there has been a lot of research in capturing and characterizing student discourse and how they regulate each other when they perform learning tasks in pairs or in small groups. In this paper, our goal is to dive a little deeper into how students collaborate, and the learning behaviors they exhibit when working in pairs on a learning by modeling task, while also teaching a virtual agent in the Betty's Brain system. We report the results of a quasi-experimental study, where students were divided into two groups: one group worked in pairs and the other group worked individually. The results illustrate that students in the collaborative group built more correct causal maps than those working individually, and their pre-post test results show significantly higher learning gains in the science content. A differential sequence mining algorithm applied to their action sequences captured in log files showed differences in the learning behaviors between the two groups. The differences imply that the collaborative groups were better at debugging their evolving causal maps than the students who worked individually.},

The home's porous boundary allows minimalists to reinforce their values around objects for others and themselves, but it also necessitates adopting strategies to assert their values when objects---entangled with others' values---move in and out the boundaries of the home. Drawing from our fieldwork, we introduce the concept of the porous boundary. "Porosity" impels us to consider the coupling of objects with values as we do boundary practices for the home. A porous boundary perspective, we argue, can open new design spaces in the development of novel technologies for the home.},

Participants (N=480) received feedback sets with different balances of neutral and negative valence content and revised their essays after performing the assigned activity. We measured participants' affective states, extents of revision, and their perceptions of the feedback and its providers. Our results showed even a small amount of negativity had significant adverse effects on all the measures. For the coping activities, we found that expressive writing encouraged essay revision, distraction improved affective states and feedback provider perception, and self-affirmation had no significant effects on the measures. Our results contribute further empirical knowledge of how negative valence feedback impacts content creators and how the coping activities tested mitigate these effects.

In our user experiment, participants performed a floor plan design task in a designer and engineer pairing on a desktop VR environment. The results showed that the proposed information sharing technique, in which objects are updated based on local users' actions, is more suitable than real-time updates.

abstract = {Over the past decade, Airbnb has emerged as the most popular platform for renting out single rooms or whole apartments. The impact of Airbnb listings on local neighborhoods has been controversially discussed in many cities around the world. The platform's widespread adoption led to changes in urban life, and in particular urban tourism. In this paper, we argue that urban tourism space can no longer be understood as a fixed, spatial entity. Instead, we follow a constructionist approach and argue that urban tourism space is (re-)produced digitally and collaboratively on online platforms such as Airbnb. We relate our work to a research direction in the CSCW community that is concerned with the role of digital technologies in the production and appropriation of urban space and use the concept of representations as a theoretical lens for our empirical study. In that study, we qualitatively analyzed how the two Berlin neighborhoods Kreuzk\"{o}lln and City West are digitally constructed by Airbnb hosts in their listing descriptions. Moreover, we quantitatively investigated to what extend mentioned places differ between Airbnb hosts and visitBerlin, the city's destination management organization (DMO). In our qualitative analysis, we found that hosts primarily focus on facilities and places in close proximity to their apartment. In the traditional urban tourism hotspot City West, hosts referred to many places also mentioned by the DMO. In the neighborhood of Kreuzk\"{o}lln, in contrast, hosts reframed everyday places such as parks or an immigrant food market as the must sees in the area. We discuss how Airbnb hosts contribute to the discursive production of urban neighborhoods and thus co-produce them as tourist destinations. With the emergence of online platforms such as Airbnb, power relations in the construction of tourism space might shift from DMOs towards local residents who are now producing tourism space collaboratively.},

Recognizing toolkits as socially and culturally situated, we surface ways in which toolkits construct security as a value and, in so doing, how they construct people as (in)secure users. We center the notion of differential vulnerabilities, an understanding of security that recognizes safety as socially contingent, adversaries as unstable figures, and risk as differentially applied based on markers of relational position (e.g. class, race, religion, gender, geography, experience). We argue that differential vulnerabilities provides a key design concern in future security resources, and a critical concept for security discourses.},

One possible explanation for such participation differences between countries could be a mismatch between culturally related preferences of some users and the values ingrained in the design of the site. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted a value-sensitive analysis of the design of the StackExchange site Stack Overflow and contrasted our findings with those of participants from societies with varying cultural backgrounds using a series of focus groups and interviews. Our results reveal tensions between collectivist values, such as the openness for social interactions, and the performance-oriented, individualist values embedded in Stack Overflow's design and community guidelines. This finding confirms that socio-technical sites like Stack Overflow reflect the inherent values of their designers, knowledge that can be leveraged to foster participation equity.},

This paper presents the results of interviews with knowledge sharing streamers, their moderators, and viewers to understand current experiences and needs for sharing and learning knowledge through live streaming. Based on those findings, we built StreamWiki, a tool which leverages the viewers during live streams to produce useful archives of the interactive learning experience. On StreamWiki, moderators initiate tasks that viewers complete by conducting microtasks, such as writing a summary, commenting, and voting for informative comments. As a result, a summary document is built in real time. Through the tests of our prototype with streamers and viewers, we found that StreamWiki could help understanding the content and the context of the stream, during the stream and for post hoc learning.},

While cooperatives are a longstanding way of organising, they have received little attention in CSCW. In this paper, through interviews with 26 individuals from 24 different cooperatives, our focus is an exploratory inquiry on how cooperatives could expand thinking into what future economies can look like and the part technologies may play in them. We discuss (1) the work to make the co-op work, that is, the special effort involved in managing an enterprise in a democratic and inclusive way, (2) the multiple purposes that cooperatives can serve for their members, well beyond financial benefit, and (3) ICT usage within cooperatives as a site of tension and dialogue. We conclude by discussing the meaning and measures of success in alternative economies, and lessons learned for CSCW scholarship on civic and societal organisations.},

abstract = {While having a step-by-step breakdown for a task-an action plan-helps people complete tasks, prior work has shown that people prefer not to make action plans for their own tasks. Getting planning support from others could be beneficial, but it is limited by how much domain knowledge people have about the task and how available they are. Our goal is to incorporate the benefits of having action plans in the complex domain of writing, while mitigating the time and effort costs of creating plans. To mitigate these costs, we introduce a vocabulary-a finite set of functions pertaining to writing tasks-as a cognitive scaffold that enables people with necessary context (e.g. collaborators) to generate action plans for others. We develop this vocabulary by analyzing 264 comments, and compare plans created using it with those created without any aid, in an online study with 768 comments (N=145) and a lab study with 96 comments (N=8). We show that using a vocabulary reduces planning time and effort and improves plan quality compared to unstructured planning, and opens the door for automation and task sharing for complex tasks.},

In this paper, we examine how ride-hailing is transforming the transportation practices of one group of passengers - people with visual impairments in metropolitan India. Through a qualitative study consisting of interviews and observations, we examined the use and impact of these services on our target population, who otherwise contend with chaotic, unreliable, and largely inaccessible modes of transportation. We found that ride-hailing services positively affects participants' notions of independence, and we tease out how independence for our participants is not just about 'doing things alone, without help' but is also situated, social and relative. Furthermore, we show how accessibility, in the case of ride-hailing in India, is a socio-technical and collaborative achievement, involving interactions between the passenger, the driver, and the technology.},

Unlike in-lab studies, however, online experiments often fail to inform participants about the research to which they contribute. This paper is the first to investigate barriers that prevent researchers from providing such science communication in online experiments. We found that the main obstacles preventing researchers from including such information are assumptions about participant disinterest, limited time, concerns about losing anonymity, and concerns about experimental bias. Researchers also noted the dearth of tools to help them close the information loop with their study participants. Based on these findings, we formulated design requirements and implemented Digestif, a new web-based tool that supports researchers in providing their participants with science communication pages. Our evaluation shows that Digestif's scaffolding, examples, and nudges to focus on participants make researchers more aware of their participants' curiosity about research and more likely to disclose pertinent research information.},

In particular we suggest humility in knowledge claims with emotional biosensing, prioritizing care and affirmation over self-improvement, and exploring alternative desires.

Our findings demonstrate that anonymization is applied to data far less pervasively than expected. Organizations that do employ anonymization often view their practices as sensitive and resort to anonymity by obscurity alongside technical means. Rather than being a purely technical question of applying the right algorithms, anonymization in practice is a complex socio-technical process that relies on multi-stakeholder collaborations. Organizational decision-making about appropriate approaches and the management of responsibility can result in workarounds necessary to negotiate the technical complexity.},

During life transitions, people present multiple identities simultaneously on different social media sites that together comprise what I call social transition machinery. Social transition machinery describes the ways that, for people facing life transitions, multiple social media sites and networks o"en remain separate, yet work together to facilitate life transitions.},

abstract = {In CSCW and HCI, work examining expression of mental health and illness on social media frequently aims to classify content, quantify visual trends, and predict user states. This approach to analysis is a form of the coded gaze, a type of algorithmic 'way of seeing' coined with respect to artificial intelligence techniques. The coded gaze classifies content through researcher- and machine-labeled categories, relying on a series of theoretical assumptions that influence how values pertaining to mental health and illness become inscribed in data. In this paper, we build upon this research to support alternative methods of data interpretation. We join manual collection of Instagram posts with semi-structured interviews and digital ethnography over six months to understand how Instagram users express their experiences with mental health and illness. We argue that individuals negotiate claims to mental health and illness through visibility and signaling, the boundaries between mental health and illness are porous and blurred, and reposting and remix are a form of participation. We discuss practical and ethical implications for studying the expression of mental health and illness online.},

While researchers have started to tackle this problem, most solutions are dependent on experts or requesters willing to help. However, requesters generally lack the necessary knowledge, and experts are rare and expensive. To further facilitate crowd workers' skill growth, we present Crowd Coach, a system that enables workers to receive peer coaching while on the job. We conduct a field experiment and real world deployment to study Crowd Coach in the wild. Hundreds of workers used Crowd Coach in a variety of tasks, including writing, doing surveys, and labeling images. We find that Crowd Coach enhances workers' speed without sacrificing their work quality, especially in audio transcription tasks. We posit that peer coaching systems hold potential for better supporting crowd workers' skill development while on the job. We finish with design implications from our research.},

It contains tools to address the main concerns of computer-supported cooperative work (CSCW) systems in UMI3D environments. After introducing the contribution of this toolbox to the design of 3D CSCW systems, we present a user evaluation of an environment designed with this toolbox.

Further, to address this issue, we demonstrate an effective automated topic model based on a labeling strategy that leverages a folksonomy developed by subject specific working groups in Wikipedia (WikiProject tags) and a flexible ontology (WikiProjects Directory) to arrive at a hierarchical and uniform label set. We are able to attain very high fitness measures (macro ROC-AUC: 95.2%, macro PR-AUC: 74.5%) and real-time performance using word2vec-based features.

abstract = {Professional sports constitute an important part of people's modern life. People spend substantial amounts of time and money supporting their favorite players and teams, and sometimes even riot after games. However, how team performance affects fan behavior remains understudied at a large scale. As almost every notable professional team has its own online fan community, these communities provide great opportunities for investigating this research question. In this work, we provide the first large-scale characterization of online fan communities of professional sports teams.Since user behavior in these online fan communities is inherently connected to game events and team performance, we construct a unique dataset that combines 1.5M posts and 43M comments in NBA-related communities on Reddit with statistics that document team performance in the NBA. We analyze the impact of team performance on fan behavior both at the game level and the season level. First, we study how team performance in a game relates to user activity during that game. We find that surprise plays an important role: the fans of the top teams are more active when their teams lose and so are the fans of the bottom teams in an unexpected win. Second, we study fan behavior over consecutive seasons and show that strong team performance is associated with fans of low loyalty, likely due to "bandwagon fans." Fans of the bottom teams tend to discuss their team's future such as young talents in the roster, which may help them stay optimistic during adversity. Our results not only contribute to understanding the interplay between online sports communities and offline context but also provide significant insights into sports management.},

However, these approaches can fail, for two notable reasons: (1) they may lack critical engagement with users and other stakeholders; (2) they rely largely on historical human judgments, which do not capture and incorporate human insights into how the world can be improved in the future. We propose and describe a novel method for the design of such algorithms, which we call Value Sensitive Algorithm Design. Value Sensitive Algorithm Design incorporates stakeholders' tacit knowledge and explicit feedback in the early stages of algorithm creation. This increases the chance to avoid biases in design choices or to compromise key stakeholder values. Generally, we believe that algorithms should be designed to balance multiple stakeholders' needs, motivations, and interests, and to help achieve important collective goals. We also describe a specific project "Designing Intelligent Socialization Algorithms for WikiProjects in Wikipedia" to illustrate our method.

We implemented previous design recommendations, namely separate physical territories and activity roles, which had been recommended to decrease these negative collaborative behaviors. We developed a multi-touch "I-Spy" picture searching application with separate territory partitions and activity roles. We conducted a deep qualitative analysis of how six pairs of children, ages 6 to 10, interacted with the application. Our analysis revealed that the collaboration styles differed for each pair, both in regards to the interaction with the task and with each other. Several pairs exhibited negative physical and verbal collaborative behaviors, such as nudging each other out of the way. Based on our analysis, we suggest that it is important for a collaborative task to offer equal opportunities for interaction, but it may not be necessary to strive for complete equity of collaboration. We examine the applicability of prior design guidelines and suggest open questions for future research to inform the design of tabletop applications to support collaboration for children.},

Employers can recruit only expert workers, but this approach does not scale well. Alternatively, employers can decompose complex tasks into simpler micro-tasks, but some domains, such as historical analysis, cannot be easily modularized in this way. A third approach is to train workers to learn the domain expertise. This approach offers clear benefits to workers, but is perceived as costly or infeasible for employers. In this paper, we explore the trade-offs between learning and productivity in training crowd workers to analyze historical documents. We compare CrowdSCIM, a novel approach that teaches historical thinking skills to crowd workers, with two crowd learning techniques from prior work and a baseline. Our evaluation (n=360) shows that CrowdSCIM allows workers to learn domain expertise while producing work of equal or higher quality versus other conditions, but efficiency is slightly lower.},

This shift to digital transactions can create challenges for those without reliable home internet connections or with limited digital literacy by requiring them to submit sensitive information on public computers or on unfamiliar websites. Using interviews with 52 families from high-poverty communities in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S., we explore the compounding privacy and security challenges that economically disadvantaged individuals face when navigating online services. We describe the real, perceived, and unknown risks they face as they navigate online transactions with limited technical skills, as well as the strategies and heuristics they employ to minimize these risks. The findings highlight a complex relationship between participants' negative experiences and their general mistrust of sharing data through online channels. We also describe a range of strategies participants use to try and protect their personal information. Based on these findings, we offer design recommendations to inform the creation of educational resources that we will develop in the next phase of this project.},

In practice, many classification tasks are ambiguous due to various forms of disagreement. Prior work shows that exchanging verbal justifications can significantly improve answer accuracy over aggregation techniques. In this work, we study how worker deliberation affects resolvability and accuracy using case studies with both an objective and a subjective task. Results show that case resolvability depends on various factors, including the level and reasons for the initial disagreement, as well as the amount and quality of deliberation activities. Our work reinforces the finding that deliberation can increase answer accuracy and the importance of verbal discussion in this process. We contribute a new public data set on worker deliberation for text classification tasks, and discuss considerations for the design of deliberation workflows for classification.},

abstract = {Real-time collaboration between a requester and crowd workers expands the scope of tasks that crowdsourcing can be used for by letting requesters and crowd workers interactively create various artifacts (e.g., a sketch prototype, writing, or program code). In such systems, it is increasingly common to allow requesters to verbally describe their requests, receive responses from workers, and provide immediate and continuous feedback to enhance the overall outcome of the two groups' real-time collaboration. This work is motivated by the lack of a deep understanding of the challenges that end users of such systems face in their communication with workers and the need of design implications that can address such challenges for other similar systems. In this paper, we investigate how requesters verbally communicate and collaborate with crowd workers to solve a complex task. Using a crowd-powered UI design tool, we conducted a qualitative user study to explore how requesters with varying expertise communicate and collaborate with crowd workers. Our work also identifies the unique challenges that collaborative crowdsourcing systems pose: potential expertise differences between requesters and crowd workers, the asymmetry of two-way communication (e.g., speech versus text), and the shared artifact's concurrent modification by two disparate groups. Finally, we make design recommendations that can inform the design of future real-time collaboration processes in crowdsourcing systems.},

Though research has examined the experiences of teleoperators delivering care through these systems, we know less about the experiences of older adults receiving this care. We report findings from a three-month study of a tablet-based telehealth home care system that provides support for aging in place. We find that there is a mismatch between the designer's conception of how care should be delivered and the ways that participants were interested in using the system. This mismatch exists in four areas: participants' interest in getting to know the human teleoperators and rejecting the virtual avatar, interrogating the interface to figure out the inner workings of the platform, pushing for a more symmetrical relationship, and negotiating the relation work that they were willing to perform in the "sacred space" of their homes. We draw on the concept of heteromation to understand the political dimensions of telehealth aging in place technologies. We also provide implications and future directions for technologies requiring relation work as well as the design of avatar-based remote companionship.},

Drawing on Iris Marion Young's theory of justice, we demonstrate how the introduction of Uber in Dhaka reinforces existing modes of oppression and introduces new ones, even as it generates room for creative modes of resistance. Finally, we underline algorithms' opacity and veneer of objectivity as a potential source of oppression, call for deepening the postcolonial computing perspective, and make a case for stronger connections between technology interventions and policy.},

In wider society the technology has proposed applications in physical access control, data analytics and advertising. Within academia, it is already used in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to analyse social media usage. Given the long-running critiques of HCI for failing to consider and include transgender (trans) perspectives in research, and the potential implications of AGR for trans people if deployed, I sought to understand how AGR and HCI understand the term "gender", and how HCI describes and deploys gender recognition technology. Using a content analysis of papers from both fields, I show that AGR consistently operationalises gender in a trans-exclusive way, and consequently carries disproportionate risk for trans people subject to it. In addition, I use the dearth of discussion of this in HCI papers that apply AGR to discuss how HCI operationalises gender, and the implications that this has for the field's research. I conclude with recommendations for alternatives to AGR, and some ideas for how HCI can work towards a more effective and trans-inclusive treatment of gender.},

In this paper, we present an automated approach to identify and classify meta-comments. We compare comment classification based on manually extracted features with an end-to-end learning approach. We develop, optimize, and evaluate multiple classifiers on a comment dataset of the large German online newsroom SPIEGEL Online and the "One Million Posts" corpus of DER STANDARD, an Austrian newspaper. Both optimized classification approaches achieved encouraging F0.5 values between 76% and 91%. We report on the most significant classification features with the results of a qualitative analysis and discuss how our work contributes to making participation in online journalism more constructive.},

Over the years, it has emerged as an essential means for providing financial services to the "underbanked" population in developing countries. This paper presents a qualitative study focused on understanding existing cooperative practices associated with microfinance in rural Sri Lanka. Through semi-structured interviews, group discussions and visits to microfinance centres, we found that microfinancing involves much more than financial transactions, rather it is strongly habituated in the sociocultural fabric of communities. Our findings show that three factors affect the cooperative process of microfinancing: trust and credibility, community support, and familial assistance. Using examples from the field, this paper discusses the importance of these factors in microfinance activities and contributes an elaborated account of cooperative practices that support microfinance processes. We also highlight how the local sociocultural structures and practices shape the way microfinance processes are being handled. We contribute towards an in-depth understanding of such practices that can be useful for microfinance institutions (MFIs) and technology designers. Consequently, we advocate for an intermediary path for technology interventions where technology and people work together rather than technology replacing people.},

Understanding the ways in which humans and bots behave in these communities is an important topic, and one that relies on accurate bot recognition. Yet, in many cases, bot activities are not explicitly flagged and could be mistaken for human contributions. We develop a machine classifier to detect previously unidentified bots using implicit behavioral and other informal editing characteristics. We show that this method yields a high level of fitness under both formal evaluation (PR-AUC: 0.845, ROC-AUC: 0.985) and a qualitative analysis of "anonymous" contributor edit sessions. We also show that, in some cases, unflagged bot activities can significantly misrepresent human behavior in analyses. Our model has the potential to support future research and community patrolling activities.},

We find that exposure to injunctive norms has a stronger effect than descriptive norms, that the likelihood of performing a behavior is higher when both injunctive and descriptive norms are congruent, and that conflicting social norms may negatively impact pro-normative behavior. We contextualize these findings through member interviews, and discuss their implications for both future research on normative influence in online groups and the design of systems that support open collaboration.},

We here report results from a crowdsourcing study (N=135) to evaluate the extent to which crowdworkers and MOOC learners behave comparably on lecture viewing and quiz tasks---the most utilized learning activities in MOOCs. This serves to (i) validate the assumption of previous research that crowdworkers are indeed reliable proxies of online learners and (ii) address the potential of employing crowdworkers as a means of online learning environment testing. Overall, we observe mixed results---in certain contexts (quiz performance and video watching behavior) crowdworkers appear to behave comparably to MOOC learners, and in other situations (interactions with in-video quizzes), their behaviors appear to be disparate. We conclude that future research should be cautious if employing crowdworkers to carry out learning tasks, as the two populations do not behave comparably on all learning-related activities.},

We demonstrate that this system finds more analogies than baseline information-retrieval approaches; that annotators and annotations can generalize beyond domain; and that the resulting analogies found are useful to experts. These results demonstrate a novel path towards computationally supported knowledge sharing in research communities.},

Finally, we conduct an interpretive analysis that consolidates observations about the activities of these accounts.

Productivity is measured using the time from creating an empty query to first executing it.Using a sample of 2,001 data analysts at eBay Inc. who have written 79,797 queries from 2014 to 2018, we find that: 1) learning-by-doing is associated with significant productivity improvement when the analyst's prior experience focuses on the focally queried database; 2) only learning-by-viewing queries that are authored by analysts with high output rate (average number of queries written per month) is associated with significant improvement in the viewer's productivity; 3) learning-by-viewing also depends on the "social influence" of the author of the viewed query, which we measure 'locally' based on the number of the author's direct viewers per month or 'globally' based on the how the author's queries propagate to peers in the overall collaboration network. Combining results 2 and 3, when segmenting analysts based on output rate and 'local' social influence, the viewing of queries authored by analysts with high output but low local influence is associated with the largest improvement in the viewer's productivity; whereas when segmenting based on output rate and 'global' social influence, the viewing of queries authored analysts with high output and high global influence is associated with the largest improvement in the viewer's productivity.},

We conducted an observational lab study to examine how preschoolers (age 3-5) and parents (N=74) from three different regions of the world (communities in China, Taiwan, and the United States) engage with two types of tablet games: an instructional game with goals and an exploratory, open-ended game. We found systematic differences among groups and between games. For example, parents from China and Taiwan frequently picked up their child's hand and used it as a tool to engage with the screen, a practice parents in our U.S. sample did not employ. Dyads from all three samples exhibited more warmth when playing an instructional game than an exploratory one. Our results suggest that characteristics of the populations we sampled interact with design features, that is, the same design prompted opposing behaviors in different groups. We conclude that it may be useful to examine goal-free and goal-oriented JME as separate constructs, that design choices influence the roles parents adopt during JME, and that the range of behaviors we observed complicate the prevailing research narrative of what positive and productive JME looks like.},

Compared to the tablet group, we found that when partners communicated through a telepresence robot, the remote partner's personality and presence were expressed through the movements and physicality of the medium. However, the use of the telepresence robot introduced tension between partners regarding responsibility, dependency, and contribution to the act of shopping. These results demonstrate the benefits of a mobile embodiment for remote partners, as well as the need for greater physical capabilities to support both physical connection and remote contribution to leisure activities.},

abstract = {Although accessibility in academic and professional workplaces is a well-known issue, understanding how teams with different abilities communicate and coordinate in technology-rich workspaces is less well understood. When hearing people collaborate around computers, they rely on the ability to simultaneously see and hear as they start a shared document, talk to each other while editing, and gesture towards the screen. This interaction norm breaks down for teams of people with different sensory abilities, such as Deaf and hearing collaborators, who rely on visual communication. Through interviews and observations, we analyze how Deaf-hearing teams collaborate on a variety of naturalistic tasks. Our findings reveal that Deaf-hearing teams create accessibility through their moment-to-moment co-located interaction and emerging team practices over time. We conclude with a discussion of how studying co-located Deaf-hearing interaction extends our understanding of accessibility in mixed-ability teams and provides new insights for groupware systems.},

To understand the conduct and implications of these practices, we examined the official damage assessment implemented by the Government of Nepal following the April 2015 earthquake. In addition, we undertook participatory mapping to examine the consequences of this assessment in the Langtang Valley, a severely-affected area of the country. We argue that the informatics of post-disaster damage assessment in Nepal played a primary role in narrating the events of the 2015 earthquake, legitimating particular paths toward recovery in the aftermath, and limiting opportunities for alternative configurations of social life that emerge during disasters. Our research demonstrates the ways that forms of sense-making afforded by information technologies play central roles in enacting repair-work following crisis and breakdown.},

We have also assessed the older adults' interaction and engagement with this TV-enabled online crowdsourcing task and we are convinced that the design of our setup addresses some key barriers to crowdsourcing by older adults.

The objective of our study is to shed light on the ways in which shared AR challenges existing behavioral expectations. Using a simulated lab experimental design, we performed a study of users' interactions in a shared AR setting. Content analysis of participants' interviews reveals users' concerns over the preservation of their self- and social identity, as well as concerns related to personal space and the sense of psychological ownership over one's body and belongings. Our findings also point to the need for regulation of shared AR spaces and design of the technology's control mechanisms.},

Bound by social norms that restrict their movements and tether them to spotty mobile data, women's Internet usage is limited in comparison to men, whose relatively unconstrained mobility permits them access and use of the free WiFi in the community. Additionally, interviews with a commercial WiFi provider reveals naive assumptions about women's Internet habits and gendered mobilities influencing access. The findings suggest that in certain contexts, women may remain invisible as potential customers despite their desire and ability to pay for WiFi access.},

Designers, developers and researchers are reporting emerging challenges in understanding, supporting and designing for complex collaborative activity in MDEs. We argue that the theoretical perspective of Instrumental Genesis can help unveil the complex, dynamic relationships between design, people, tools, tasks and activities in technology-rich MDEs. In this paper, we use extracts from our research on collaborative work in an MDE to illustrate how ideas from the theory of Instrumental Genesis can help reveal important aspects of change and stability. We show how collaborative design-in-use contributes to the joint evolution of MDEs and the working practices unfolding within them.},

abstract = {GrabYourWallet, #boycottNRA and other online boycott campaigns have attracted substantial public interest in recent months. However, a number of significant challenges are preventing online boycotts from reaching their potential. In particular, complex webs of brands and subsidiaries can make it difficult for participants to conform to the goals of a boycott. Similarly, participants and organizers have limited visibility into a boycott's progress. This affects their ability to use sociotechnical innovations from social computing to incentivize participation. To address these challenges, this paper makes a system contribution: a new boycott tool called Out of Site. Out of Site uses lightweight automation to remove obstacles to successful online boycotts. We describe the design challenges associated with Out of Site and report results from two phases of deployment with the GrabYourWallet and Stop Animal Testing boycott communities. Our findings highlight the potential of boycott-assisting technologies and inform the design of this new class of technologies. Finally, like is the case for many systems in social computing, while we designed Out of Site for pro-social uses, there are a number of easily predictable ways in which the system can be leveraged for anti-social purposes (e.g. exacerbating filter bubble issues, empowering boycotts of businesses owned by racial, ethnic, and religious minorities). As such, we developed for this project a new, very straightforward design approach that treats preventing these anti-social uses as a top-tier design concern. This approach stands in contrast to the status quo of ignoring potential anti-social uses and/or considering them to be a secondary design priority. We discuss how our simple approach may help other research projects reduce their potential negative impacts with minimal burden.},

Our pipeline restructures and partitions information into "context slices" for individual workers. We implemented CrowdIA, a software platform to enable unsupervised crowd sensemaking using our pipeline. With CrowdIA, crowds successfully solved two mysteries, and were one step away from solving the third. The crowd's intermediate results revealed their reasoning process and provided evidence that justifies their conclusions. We suggest broader possibilities to optimize each component, as well as to evaluate and refine previous intermediate analyses to improve the final result.},

abstract = {Behavior change systems help people manage their time online and achieve many other goals. These systems typically consist of a single static intervention, such as a timer or site blocker, to persuade users to behave in ways consistent with their stated goals. However, static interventions decline in effectiveness over time as users begin to ignore them. In this paper, we compare the effectiveness of static interventions to a rotation strategy, where users experience different interventions over time. We built and deployed a browser extension called HabitLab, which features many interventions that the user can enable across social media and other web sites to control their time spent browsing. We ran three in-the-wild field experiments on HabitLab to compare static interventions to rotated interventions. We found that rotating between interventions increased effectiveness as measured by time on site, but also increased attrition: more users uninstalled HabitLab. To minimize attrition, we introduced a just-in-time information design about rotation. This design reduced attrition rates by half. With this research, we suggest that interaction design, paired with rotation of behavior change interventions, can help users gain control of their online habits.},

We find that linguistic signals in user comments vary significantly with the veracity of posts, e.g., we observe more misinformation-awareness signals and extensive emoji and swear word usage with falser posts. We further show that these signals can help to detect misinformation. In addition, we find that while there are signals indicating positive effects after fact-checking, there are also signals indicating potential "backfire" effects.},

abstract = {Popularity systems, like Twitter retweets, Reddit upvotes, and Pinterest pins have the potential to guide people toward posts that others liked. That, however, creates a feedback loop that reduces their informativeness: items marked as more popular get more attention, so that additional upvotes and retweets may simply reflect the increased attention and not independent information about the fraction of people that like the items. How much information remains? For example, how confident can we be that more people prefer item A to item B if item A had hundreds of upvotes on Reddit and item B had only a few? We investigate using an Internet game called GuessTheKarma that collects independent preference judgments (N=20,674) for 400 pairs of images, approximately 50 per pair. Unlike the rating systems that dominate social media services, GuessTheKarma is devoid of social and ranking effects that influence ratings. Overall, Reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true population preferences for items as measured by GuessTheKarma: the image with higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68% of the time. However, when one image had a low score and the other was one of the highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly 90% of the time by the majority of independent raters. Similarly, Imgur view counts for the images were poor predictors except when there were orders of magnitude differences between the pairs. We conclude that popularity systems marked by feedback loops may convey a strong signal about population preferences, but only when comparing items that received vastly different popularity scores.},

abstract = {As digital fabrication technology has become mainstream, the increased demand for 3D printed objects has created a new market for professional outsourcing. Given that most of this work does not require advanced training, and is an appropriate entry-level manufacturing job, there is an exciting opportunity to employ youth already skilled in "making" and interested in technology to do this work as an after-school job. The combination of this new technology and workforce calls for new workflows that streamline client-driven digital manufacturing. However, the limitations of current digital fabrication technology and youth schedules require that this work be spread between multiple shifts, necessitating employees to coordinate and handoff their work. We investigated the collaborative practices between youth employees while working on client jobs in a 3D print shop during one year of field work. In this paper, we describe instances where youth employees successfully, and unsuccessfully, handed off work between shifts and identify techniques utilized by youth to support successful handoffs, including: counting physical artifacts, using asynchronous chat programs, and documenting work. We then discuss the impact of the print shop manager's presence, physical characteristics of 3D prints, and youth perspectives of work on the selection of and effectiveness of these techniques. Finally, we offer lessons learned from successful handoffs in the print shop and recommendations for supporting youth in collaborative work environments.},

abstract = {Indirect disclosure strategies include hinting about an experience or a facet of one's identity or relaying information explicitly but through another person. These strategies lend themselves to sharing stigmatized or sensitive experiences such as a pregnancy loss, mental illness, or abuse. Drawing on interviews with women in the U.S. who use social media and experienced pregnancy loss, we investigated factors guiding indirect disclosure decisions on social media. Our findings include 1) a typology of indirect disclosure strategies based on content explicitness, original content creator, and content sharer, and 2) an examination of indirect disclosure decision factors related to the self, audience, platform affordances, and temporality. We identify how people intentionally adapt social media and indirect disclosures to meet psychological (e.g., keeping a personal record) and social (e.g., feeling out the audience) needs associated with loss. We discuss implications for design and research, including features that support disclosures through proxy, and relevance for algorithmic detection and intervention. CAUTION: This paper includes quotes about pregnancy loss.},

abstract = {Smart home Internet of Things (IoT) devices are rapidly increasing in popularity, with more households including Internet-connected devices that continuously monitor user activities. In this study, we conduct eleven semi-structured interviews with smart home owners, investigating their reasons for purchasing IoT devices, perceptions of smart home privacy risks, and actions taken to protect their privacy from those external to the home who create, manage, track, or regulate IoT devices and/or their data. We note several recurring themes. First, users' desires for convenience and connectedness dictate their privacy-related behaviors for dealing with external entities, such as device manufacturers, Internet Service Providers, governments, and advertisers. Second, user opinions about external entities collecting smart home data depend on perceived benefit from these entities. Third, users trust IoT device manufacturers to protect their privacy but do not verify that these protections are in place. Fourth, users are unaware of privacy risks from inference algorithms operating on data from non-audio/visual devices. These findings motivate several recommendations for device designers, researchers, and industry standards to better match device privacy features to the expectations and preferences of smart home owners.},

Results suggest that collaboration and cooperation among involved parties increased by using the system. Further, the study revealed positive and negative social experiences triggered by the videogame based system.

This paper discusses an emerging class of software applications and services that pose new risks to group privacy by revealing group-level information based on individual information, such as social media postings or fitness app usage. The paper describes the results of two experiments that empirically establish the concept of group privacy and shows that it affects user perceptions of and interactions with information technology.

Learning to use the application in a group setting helped overcome these differences and facilitated collaboration, resulting in a strong buy-in for the application.

The social bonding achieved through a collective fitness goal and the sharing of fitness data between two co-workers has been explored as a motivational factor that can encourage physical activity. The study involved 10 dyads of co-workers in two groups (a distributed vs. a co-located group) based on their proximity at work. The effectiveness of the proposed PCFT was examined by comparing fitness data over a period of three weeks: the baseline week, the PCFT intervention week, and the post-intervention week. The proximity effects on PCFT were investigated by comparing the fitness data, goal commitment, and interview results between the two groups. The quantitative results showed that the physical activity of participants in the co-located group improved significantly after the PCFT intervention. The qualitative results suggested that PCFT may improve the awareness of being physically active, stimulate exchange of knowledge to support active lifestyles and facilitate including fitness breaks in the daily work routine. Based on these findings, we discuss design implications for the future development of the PCFT-based applications and their potential contribution to increased office vitality.},

However, individual geo-located observations from social media are noisy and geographically inconsistent. Existing areas by which exposures are measured, like Zip codes, average over irrelevant administratively-defined boundaries. Hence, in order to enable studies of online social environmental measures like attitudes on social media and their possible relationship to health outcomes, first there is a need for a method to define the collective, underlying degree of social media attitudes by region. To address this, we create the Socio-spatial-Self organizing map, "SS-SOM" pipeline to best identify regions by their latent social attitude from Twitter posts. SS-SOMs use neural embedding for text-classification, and augment traditional SOMs to generate a controlled number of non-overlapping, topologically-constrained and topically-similar clusters. We find that not only are SS-SOMs robust to missing data, the exposure of a cohort of men who are susceptible to multiple racism and homophobia-linked health outcomes, changes by up to 42% using SS-SOM measures as compared to using Zip code-based measures.},

However, conducting proper code review takes time and developers often have limited time for review. In this paper, we aim at investigating the information that reviewers need to conduct a proper code review, to better understand this process and how research and tool support can make developers become more effective and efficient reviewers. Previous work has provided evidence that a successful code review process is one in which reviewers and authors actively participate and collaborate. In these cases, the threads of discussions that are saved by code review tools are a precious source of information that can be later exploited for research and practice. In this paper, we focus on this source of information as a way to gather reliable data on the aforementioned reviewers' needs. We manually analyze 900 code review comments from three large open-source projects and organize them in categories by means of a card sort. Our results highlight the presence of seven high-level information needs, such as knowing the uses of methods and variables declared/modified in the code under review. Based on these results we suggest ways in which future code review tools can better support collaboration and the reviewing task.},

Existing research, however, has mainly focused on the event itself, while potential outcomes of hackathons have received limited attention. Furthermore, most research around hackathons focuses on collegiate or civic events. Research around hackathons internal to tech companies, which are nearly ubiquitous, and present significant organizational, cultural, and managerial challenges, remains scarce. In this paper we address this gap by presenting findings from a case study of five teams which participated in a large scale corporate hackathon. Most team members voiced their intentions to continue the projects their worked on during the hackathon, but those whose projects did get continued were characterized by meticulous preparation, a focus on executing a shared vision during the hackathon, extended dissemination activities afterwards and a fit to existing product lines. Such teams were led by individuals who perceived the hackathon as an opportunity to bring their idea to life and advance their careers, and who recruited teams who had a strong interest in the idea and in learning the skills necessary to contribute efficiently. Our analysis also revealed that individual team members perceived hackathon participation to have positive effects on their career parts, networks and skill development.},

This trend is affecting users mentally and as a result they tend to leave Twitter and other such social networking sites thus depleting the active user base. In this paper, we study factors associated with incivility. We observe that the act of incivility is highly correlated with the opinion differences between the account holder (i.e., the user writing the incivil tweet) and the target (i.e., the user for whom the incivil tweet is meant for or targeted), toward a named entity. We introduce a character level CNN model and incorporate the entity-specific sentiment information for efficient incivility detection which significantly outperforms multiple baseline methods achieving an impressive accuracy of 93.3% (4.9% improvement over the best baseline). In a post-hoc analysis, we also study the behavioral aspects of the targets and account holders and try to understand the reasons behind the incivility incidents. Interestingly, we observe that there are strong signals of repetitions in incivil behavior. In particular, we find that there are a significant fraction of account holders who act as repeat offenders - attacking the targets even more than 10 times. Similarly, there are also targets who get targeted multiple times. In general, the targets are found to have higher reputation scores than the account holders.},

In December 2017, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 19 terminal staff regarding their experiences using the app. Our analysis of the interviews found a wide range of invisible work being identified despite the existence of a similar paper review form.

Based on a computational linguistic analysis of post-mortem social media profiles and content, we report on classifiers developed to detect mortality and show that mortality can be determined after the first few occurrences of post-mortem content. Applying our classifiers to content from two other platforms also provided good results. Finally, we discuss trade-offs between models that emphasize pre- vs. post-mortem precision in this sensitive context. These results mark a first step toward identifying mortality at scale, and show how designers and scientists can attend to mortality in their work.},

We designed MyPath to overcome these information access challenges. The mobile system offers personalized, dynamic, and trusted health information recommendations to help patients learn about and manage their cancer. Through a seven-month deployment study with breast cancer patients, we found that use of the application encouraged proactive health management behaviors, and identified factors that motivated technology adoption and abandonment. We discuss the implications of these results for facilitating use of mHealth tools by a rural patient population and the importance of scaling support to a large range of information needs.

For example, Blue Feed, Red Feed, a news feed created by the Wall Street Journal, use stance labels to separate news articles with opposing political ideologies to help people explore diverse opinions. To combat the spread of fake news, Facebook has experimented with putting credibility labels on news articles to help readers decide whether the content is trustworthy. To systematically understand the effects of stance and credibility labels on online news selection and consumption, we conducted a controlled experiment to study how these labels influence the selection, perceived extremeness, and level of agreement of news articles. Results show that stance labels may intensify selective exposure - a tendency for people to look for agreeable opinions -- and make people more vulnerable to polarized opinions and fake news. We found, however, that the effect of credibility labels on reducing selective exposure and recognizing fake news is limited. Although originally designed to encourage exposure to opposite viewpoints, stance labels can make fake news articles look more trustworthy, and they may lower people's perception of the extremeness of fake news articles. Our results have important implications on the subtle effects of stance and credibility labels on online news consumption.},

abstract = {As increasingly many Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices collect personal data, users face more privacy decisions. Personal privacy assistants can provide social cues and help users make informed decisions by presenting information about how others have decided in similar cases. To better understand which social cues are relevant and whose recommendations users are more likely to follow, we presented 1000 online participants with nine IoT data-collection scenarios. Some participants were told the percentage of experts or friends who allowed data collection in each scenario, while other participants were provided no social cue. At the conclusion of each scenario, participants were asked whether they would allow the described data collection. Our results help explain under what circumstances users are more or less likely to be swayed by the reported behavior of others in similar scenarios. For example, our results indicate that when friends denied data collection, our participants were more influenced than when friends allowed data collection. On the other hand, participants were more influenced by experts when they allowed data collection. We also observed that influence could get stronger or wear off when participants were exposed to a sequence of scenarios. For example, when experts and friends repeatedly allowed data collection in scenarios with clear risk or denied it in scenarios with clear benefits, participants were less likely to be influenced by them in subsequent scenarios.},

abstract = {The richness that characterizes relationships is often absent when they are modeled using computational methods in network science. Typically, relationships are represented simply as links, perhaps with weights. The lack of finer granularity is due in part to the fact that, aside from linkage and strength, no fundamental or immediately obvious dimensions exist along which to categorize relationships. Here we propose a set of dimensions that capture major components of many relationships -- derived both from relevant academic literature and people's everyday descriptions of their relationships. We first review prominent findings in sociology and social psychology, highlighting dimensions that have been widely used to categorize social relationships. Next, we examine the validity of these dimensions empirically in two crowd-sourced experiments. Ultimately, we arrive at a set of ten major dimensions that can be used to categorize relationships: similarity, trust, romance, social support, identity, respect, knowledge exchange, power, fun, and conflict. These ten dimensions, while not dispositive, offer higher resolution than existing models. Indeed, we show that one can more accurately predict missing links in a social graph by using these dimensions than by using a state-of-the-art link embeddedness method. We also describe tinghy.org, an online platform we built to collect data about how social media users perceive their online relationships, allowing us to examine these dimensions at scale. Overall, by proposing a new way of modeling social graphs, our work aims to contribute both to theory in network science and practice in the design of social-networking applications.},

abstract = {Real-Time Collaborative Editing (RTCE) is a popular way of instrumenting cooperative work on documents, in particular on the Web. Little is known in the literature yet about RTCE usage patterns in the real world. In this paper we study how a popular RTCE editor (Etherpad) is used in the wild, digging into the edit histories of a large collection of documents (about 14 000 pads), retrieved from one of the most popular public instances of the platform, hosted by the Wikimedia Foundation. The pad analysis is supported by a novel conceptual model that allows to label edit operations as "collaborative" or not depending on their distance-in edit position (space), edit time, or spacetime (both)-from edits made by other authors. The model is applied to classify all edits from the pad corpus. Classification results are further used to characterize the collaboration behavior of pad authors. Findings show that: 1) about half of the pads have a single author and hence witnessed no collaboration; 2) collaboration on common document parts happens often, but it happens asynchronously with authors taking turns in editing; and 3) simultaneous editing of common document parts happens very rarely. These findings help in revisiting early RTCE design decisions (e.g., the granularity of conflict management in RTCE protocols) and give insights on how to address novel needs (e.g., end-to-end encryption and offline editing).},

We build on this research by testing whether coherence emerges in tag usage on Q&amp;As, a more challenging context, focusing in particular on mismatches in the specificity of tags (basic level disagreement). We found that some users shifted toward more specific tag usage over time slightly increasing conflict, but that moderators were instrumental in helping to resolve some of this conflict.

It is also viewed, especially from the medical side, as something an individual achieves. However, in the lived experience, independence is often a set of collaborative practices. In this paper, we unpack findings from an interview-based study of Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) self-care. We found that independence - both functional and in the form of effecting agency - must be co-constructed by the choices and activities of the care network, including the person with disability, caregivers, and clinicians. This collaboratively shaped independence also affects potential collection and use of data in support of self-care. We describe how collaboratively shaped independence informs requirements and constraints for the design of sensor-based networks for self-care in long-term chronic disability.},

After presenting an algorithm for extracting vocabularies across disasters, we extract type-specific vocabularies for terrorist attacks, earthquakes, and climate-related disasters between 2012 and 2017. Disaster type drives vocabulary similarity: terrorism responses mention an "attack" and law enforcement, earthquake responses mention the quake and its magnitude, and climate-related responses include safety and requests for aid. Across disaster types, tweets regularly mention victims/affected and prayer, consistent with communal coping and social support in crisis aftermath. Using disaster-type vocabularies, we study Twitter as a proxy for severity, correlating casualties to frequencies in Twitter. These vocabularies better correlate with casualties than baseline crisis lexica, especially in western countries. Twitter response and casualties diverge at the maximum, and Twitter response is stronger in Western countries, suggesting perceived severity is driven by additional factors.},

We first model semantic mappings between color themes and keywords in everyday language. Next, we index and organize each filter by the derived semantic information. We conduct three separate studies to investigate the benefit of the semantic features on filter exploration.

Therefore, it is important to allow teams to have the flexibility to customize and tailor their chosen methods. However, in a large-scale agile deployment, there needs to be a degree of process standardization across the organisation; otherwise, different teams will not be able to effectively share knowledge and best practices.

A separate and growing body of research in these same communities is developing ways to understand the design and use of social media from a curating perspective. A curating perspective focuses on how social media is designed and used by people to develop and manage their own digital archives. This paper uses a cultural heritage museum as the empirical basis and setting along with new information visualization methods we have developed to better integrate these bodies of work and introduce the concept of personal curation; a socio-technical practice in which people collect, edit, and share information using personal information devices and social media as they move through physical environments rich with meaning potential. In doing so this paper makes three contributions. First, it illustrates how to combine a spatial focus on people's movement and interaction through the physical environment with an analysis of social media use in order to gain a deeper understanding of practices such as personal curation. Second, it shows in greater detail how visitors to museums and cultural heritage sites use and link digital information with physical information to shape others' understandings of cultural heritage. Third, it suggests how museums and cultural heritage sites may leverage personal curation to support more expansive learning opportunities for visitors.},

Despite its importance, ambiance has been crucially overlooked by urban planners and scientists alike, not least because it is difficult to record and analyze at scale. We explored the possibility of using social media data to reliably map the ambiance of neighborhoods in the entire city of London. To this end, we collected geo-referenced picture tags from Flickr and matched those tags with the words in a newly created ambiance dictionary. In so doing, we made four main contributions: i) map the ambiance of London neighborhoods; ii) ascertain that such a mapping meets residents' expectations, which are derived from a survey we conducted; iii) show that computer vision techniques upon geo-referenced pictures are of predictive power for neighborhood ambiance; and iv) explain each prediction of a neighborhood's ambiance by identifying the picture that best reflects the meaning of that ambiance (e.g., artsy) in that neighborhood (e.g., South Kensington---the richest and most traditional neighborhood---and Shoreditch---among the most progressive and hipster neighborhoods in the city---are both 'artsy' but in very different ways). The combination of the predictive power of mapping ambiance from images and the ability to explain those predictions makes it possible to discover hidden gems across the city at an unprecedented scale.},

This spatial rearrangement has implications for both cognitive and affective dimensions of collaborative surgical work. Cognitive distance is increased, necessitating new efforts to maintain situation awareness and common ground. Moreover, affective distance is introduced, decreasing sensitivity to shared and non-shared affective states and leading to new practices aimed at restoring affective connection within the team. We describe new forms of physical, cognitive, and affective distance associated with teleoperated robotic surgery, and the effects these have on power distribution, practice, and collaborative experience within the surgical team.},

We examined whether content creators follow the FTC's disclosure guidelines, how they word the disclosures, and whether these disclosures help users identify affiliate marketing content as advertisements. To do so, we first measured the prevalence of and identified the types of disclosures in over 500,000 YouTube videos and 2.1 million Pinterest pins. We then conducted a user study with 1,791 participants to test the efficacy of these disclosures. Our findings reveal that only about 10% of affiliate marketing content on both platforms contains any disclosures at all. Further, users fail to understand shorter, non-explanatory disclosures.

However, it is unclear how users adopt and utilize such techniques in daily use and how these techniques may impact social interactions with others over time. In this study, we examine users' experience during everyday use of granular audience control techniques in WeChat, one of the most popular social network applications in China. Through an interview study with 24 WeChat users, we find that users adjust their configurations and develop rationales for these configurations over time. They also perceive mixed impacts of WeChat's privacy settings on their information disclosure and social interactions, which brings new challenges to privacy design. We discuss the implications of these findings and make suggestions for the future design of privacy settings in SNSs.},

abstract = {Our paper provides an enriched understanding of the relationship between research and practice through the study of practitioners variously engaged in field research on technology interventions in the context of global development. By conducting a qualitative inquiry with 33 practitioners from 26 global development organizations, we highlight how these practitioners have different goals, work practices, incentive structures, and expectations than researchers, making it challenging to co-create and coordinate productive and effective partnerships. Despite these challenges, practitioners in global development do appear to value and engage with research as they strive for positive impact across their target communities. Our analysis suggests that the domain of human-computer interaction for development (HCI4D) might benefit from engaging in "informed practice" through alignment with design-based implementation research (DBIR), which unites researchers and practitioners in their shared commitment to both research and practice, even if research and practice respectively remain their primary commitments. Our work provides CSCW and HCI4D researchers with new ways to conceptualize and navigate the above research-practice divide. We also emphasize the contribution such an approach might make to CSCW researchers beyond the context of global development, and more broadly concerned with making a positive societal impact with their work.},

To address this issue, we explore the impact of visual cues designed to convey (1) two facets of social influence-crowd size and social network connectivity-and (2) provide a frame designed to enhance the forum's sense of community. A 3 (Cue type: Crowd, Connectivity, None) x 2 (Framing) factorial experiment (N = 218) showed that cues implying greater crowd size and connectivity lead to more self-disclosure of sensitive information, and higher intentions to revisit the community. Further, user belief in the community-building heuristic positively predicts self-disclosure and intentions, while also moderating the effect of the connectivity cue in a direction which implies that the cue encourages disclosure by triggering the community-building heuristic. Implications for the design of online groups are discussed.},

Our analysis was informed by 10 interviews with frequent RfC closers. We found that a major issue affecting the RfC process is the prevalence of RfCs that could have benefited from formal closure but that linger indefinitely without one, with factors including participants' interest and expertise impacting the likelihood of resolution. From these findings, we developed a model that predicts whether an RfC will go stale with 75.3% accuracy, a level that is approached as early as one week after dispute initiation.},

One strand of research advocates for grouping students into teams with "good" compositions such as skill diversity. Another strand argues for deploying team-building activities to foster interpersonal relations like psychological safety. Our work synthesizes these two strands of research. We describe an experiment (N=249) that compares how team composition vs. team-building activities affect student team outcomes. In two university courses, we composed student teams either randomly or using a criteria-based team formation tool. Teams further performed team-building activities that promoted either team or task outcomes. We collected project scores, and used surveys to measure psychological safety, perceived performance, and team satisfaction. Surprisingly, the criteria-based teams did not statistically differ from the random teams on any of the measures taken, despite having compositions that better satisfied the criteria defined by the instructor. Our findings argue that, for instructors deploying a team formation tool, creating an expectation among team members that their team can perform well is as important as tuning the criteria in the tool. We also found that student teams reported high levels of psychological safety, but these levels appeared to develop organically and were not affected by the activities or compositional strategies tested. We distill these and other findings into implications for the design and deployment of team formation tools for learning environments.},

We explore this question in the context of project teams whose members have to work across multiple teams at the same time. We expected multi-teaming, especially that involving a high variety in team members, would have a negative effect on team performance by impairing a team's transactive memory system (TMS), a critical form of shared cognition allowing members to keep track of who knows what. Further, we expected the use of an information dashboard with member skills could combat the harmful effects of high-variety multi-teaming. To test our hypotheses experimentally, we developed an online game (Knowledge Worker's Dilemma) that simulates the coordination decisions that professionals face in app development teams. Results show multi-teaming hurt team performance by reducing TMS; use of an information dashboard benefited high-variety teams and, surprisingly, hurt the performance of low-variety teams. Potential explanations and implications are discussed.},

In the course of studying trafficking survivors in a protected-living situation created by a non-governmental organization in Nepal, we adapted photo-elicitation to hear the voices of the survivors by making the technique more communal. Bringing sociality to the forefront of the method reduced the pressure on survivors to assert voices as individuals, allowing them to speak. We make three contributions to research. First, we propose a communal form of photo-elicitation as a method to elicit values in sensitive settings. Second, we present the complex circumstances of the survivors as they undergo rehabilitation and move towards life with a "new normal". Third, our work adds to HCI and CSCW literature on understanding specific concerns of trafficking survivors and aims to inform designs that can support reintegration of survivors in society. The values that the survivors hold and their notion of future opportunities suggest possession of limited but important social capital in some domains that could be leveraged to aid reintegration.},

Lately, some studies have discussed the negative consequences of self-tracking, suggesting that people interact with personal data in different ways. We explored how self-tracking activities and the emotional context characterize how people engage with personal health data through the analysis of a complex and emotionally-loaded use case: fertility self-tracking. We qualitatively analyzed patient-generated content in an online health community dedicated to fertility. We found five distinct types of engagement with data: positive, burdened, obsessive, trapped, and abandoning. Each of them is composed of an action and an emotional component that mutually influence each other. We discuss how the interplay of these components characterize a person's engagement with data, how the online forum made these issues visible, and how they are embedded in the self-tracking culture. We also provide insights into the implications of these issues for self-tracking tools. Finally, we hypothesize how people transition through the types of relationships with data, suggesting directions for future research in the area.},

We examine one aspect of long-term content organization through link behavior, also exploring role differences between enterprise community leaders and members in the context of life-cycle community models. We first classify how content is linked within posts, identifying usage patterns that organize information within and outside communities. We next present an exploratory quantitative analysis of 2,010 communities including 428,476 posts and 1,246,570 links. We show paradoxically that although mature communities accumulate substantial content, organizing that content using links decreases over time. Further analyses suggest that this arises from a recency bias, with communities being focused on current content. Our results also challenge descriptive lifecycle community models, which propose that regular community members adopt greater responsibility over time. We explore explanations for our findings and implications including new tools that encourage responsibility for active organization, as well as methods for members to revisit critical content.},

We describe the methods that decide when and how to escalate the analysis of heart sounds to different resources and incorporate their decision into a final classification. Our framework was tested with a combination of machine classifiers and crowd workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The results indicate a hybrid approach achieves greater performance than a baseline classifier alone, utilizing less expert resources while achieving similar performance, compared to a framework without the crowd.},

First, at the level of individual discussions, we use it to predict a discussion's future trajectory, anticipating future antisocial actions (such as participants blocking each other) and forecasting the discussion's growth. Second, we systematically analyze the variation of discussions across thousands of Facebook sub-communities, revealing subtle differences (and unexpected similarities) in how people interact when discussing online content. We further show that this variation is driven more by participant tendencies than by the content triggering these discussions.},

This information could be valuable to emergency responders, but there remain challenges for using it to inform response efforts---including filtering relevant information from the large volumes of noise. Previous research has largely focused on identifying information that can contribute to a generalized concept of situational awareness. Our work explores the value of approaching this problem from a different perspective---one of actionablity---with the idea that information relevance may vary across responder role, domain, and other factors. This approach asks how we can get the right information to the right person at the right time? We interviewed and surveyed diverse responders to understand what "actionable" information is, allowing that actionability might differ from one responder to another. Through the findings, we (a) offer a nuanced understanding of actionability and differentiate it from situational awareness; (b) describe responders' perspective of what distinguishes good information when making rapid judgments; and (c) suggest opportunities for augmenting social media use to highlight information that needs immediate attention. We offer researchers an opportunity to frame different models of actionability to suit the requirements of a responding role.},

Our research explored how telepresence robots might fit into the array of tools that long distance couples use to communicate, given the factors of mobility and physicality that could support acts of interactivity and autonomy between partners. We found that telepresence robot communication facilitated interactions in five areas: participation in mundane everyday routines, feelings of sharing a home, connection with one's partner's family and friends, increased helpfulness, and the enjoyment of quiet companionship. However, telepresence robots also presented challenges related to privacy and asymmetry, as well as continued deficiencies in the level of interactivity.

We find some HIV positive users report keeping their status private to reduce their stigma exposure, whilst others report publicly disclosing their status to avoid being stigmatised by others. Where users keep their status private, we find concerns that social assumptions may develop around these non-disclosures, creating a privacy unraveling effect which restricts disclosure choice. Using Peppet's four proposed limits to privacy unraveling, we develop a set of descriptive conceptual designs to explore the privacy respecting potential of these limits within this context and propose further research to address this privacy challenge.},

Based on the analysis of a human-labeled cyberbullying data-set of Vine "media sessions' (six-second videos, with audio, and corresponding text comments), we report that: 1) multiple audio and visual features are significantly associated with the occurrence of cyberbullying, and 2) audio and video features complement textual features for more accurate and earlier cyberbullying detection. These results pave the way for more effective cyberbullying detection in emerging multimodal (audio, visual, virtual reality) social interaction spaces.},

abstract = {Collectives gather online around challenges they face, but frequently fail to envision shared outcomes to act on together. Prior work has developed systems for improving collective ideation and design by exposing people to each others' ideas and encouraging them to intermix those ideas. However, organizational behavior research has demonstrated that intermixing ideas does not result in meaningful engagement with those ideas. In this paper, we introduce a new class of collective design system that intermixes people instead of ideas: instead of receiving mere exposure to others' ideas, participants engage deeply with other members of the collective who represent those ideas, increasing engagement and influence. We thus present Hive: a system that organizes a collective into small teams, then intermixes people by rotating team membership over time. At a technical level, Hive must balance two competing forces: (1) networks are better at connecting diverse perspectives when network efficiency is high, but (2) moving people diminishes tie strength within teams. Hive balances these two needs through network rotation: an optimization algorithm that computes who should move where, and when. A controlled study compared network rotation to alternative rotation systems which maximize only tie strength or network efficiency, finding that network rotation produced higher-rated proposals. Hive has been deployed by Mozilla for a real-world open design drive to improve Firefox accessibility.},

In this paper, we report the results of a mixed-methods algorithm audit of partisan audience bias and personalization within Google Search. Following Donald Trump's inauguration, we recruited 187 participants to complete a survey and install a browser extension that enabled us to collect Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) from their computers. To quantify partisan audience bias, we developed a domain-level score by leveraging the sharing propensities of registered voters on a large Twitter panel. We found little evidence for the "filter bubble'' hypothesis. Instead, we found that results positioned toward the bottom of Google SERPs were more left-leaning than results positioned toward the top, and that the direction and magnitude of overall lean varied by search query, component type (e.g. "answer boxes"), and other factors. Utilizing rank-weighted metrics that we adapted from prior work, we also found that Google's rankings shifted the average lean of SERPs to the right of their unweighted average.},

Its users are responsible for maintaining the schema that organises this knowledge into classes, properties, and attributes, which together form the Wikidata 'ontology'. In this paper, we study the relationship between different Wikidata user roles and the quality of the Wikidata ontology. To do so we first propose a framework to evaluate the ontology as it evolves. We then cluster editing activities to identify user roles in monthly time frames. Finally, we explore how each role impacts the ontology. Our analysis shows that the Wikidata ontology has uneven breadth and depth. We identified two user roles: contributors and leaders. The second category is positively associated to ontology depth, with no significant effect on other features. Further work should investigate other dimensions to define user profiles and their influence on the knowledge graph.},

We show how organizational actors establish and re-negotiate trust under messy and uncertain analytic conditions through practices of skepticism, assessment, and credibility. Highlighting the collaborative and heterogeneous nature of real-world data science, we show how the management of trust in applied corporate data science settings depends not only on pre-processing and quantification, but also on negotiation and translation.

Through a case study, we describe the utility of our tool, Code Wizard, and how it helped a group of researchers effectively collaborate to code naturalistic observation data. We report the valuable lessons we learned from the development of our tool and method: (1) identifying coders' certainty constitutes an important part of determining the quality of data analysis and facilitates identifying overlapping and ambiguous codes, (2) making the details of coding process visible helps streamline the coding process and leads to a sense of ownership of the research results, and (3) there is valuable information hidden in coding disagreements that can be leveraged for improving the process of data analysis.},

It is unknown how many people are aware that emoji have multiple renderings, or whether they would change their emoji-bearing messages if they could see how these messages render on recipients' devices. We developed software to expose the multi-rendering nature of emoji and explored whether this increased visibility would affect how people communicate with emoji. Through a survey of 710 Twitter users who recently posted an emoji-bearing tweet, we found that at least 25% of respondents were unaware that the emoji they posted could appear differently to their followers. Additionally, after being shown how one of their tweets rendered across platforms, 20% of respondents reported that they would have edited or not sent the tweet. These statistics reflect millions of potentially regretful tweets shared per day because people cannot see emoji rendering differences across platforms. Our results motivate the development of tools that increase the visibility of emoji rendering differences across platforms, and we contribute our cross-platform emoji rendering software to facilitate this effort.},

While one merger led to a single, thriving community, the other led to the dissolution of both pre-merger groups. Analysis of our ethnographic data suggests that differences in managing organizational culture (a concept drawn from organization studies) led the successful and failed cases to diverge. The study contributes to our understanding of why some attempts to integrate members of different communities are more successful than others.

Interviews with experienced forum members also confirm these quantitative findings. These results highlight the varied roles of discussion in the cryptocurrency ecosystem and suggest that discussion of serious coins may be oriented towards earnest, perhaps more accurate, attempts at discovering which coins are likely to succeed.},

The median female worker set hourly bill rates that were 74% of the median man's hourly bill rates, a gap than cannot be entirely explained by online and offline work experience, education level, and job category. However, in some job categories, we found evidence of a more complex relationship between gender and earnings: women earned more overall than men by working more hours, outpacing the effect of lower hourly bill rates. To better support equality in the rapidly growing gig economy, we encourage continual evaluation of the complex gender dynamics on these platforms and discuss whose responsibility it is to address inequalities.},

This paper fills that gap by conducting a qualitative interview- and diary-based study where participants were asked to deactivate their Facebook account. An abductive analysis suggests participants' experiences can be organized under the conceptual umbrella of sense of agency, which refers to an individual's perception that their actions are under their own control. The analysis shows how, across disparate motivations, all participants took actions that increased their own subjective sense of agency, regardless of whether they returned to Facebook or not. The discussion applies this conceptual lens to prior studies of technology use and non-use. Doing so shows how sense of agency may provide an organizing orientation for understanding subjective experiences of use and non-use.},

This diverse research community explores the methods, processes, techniques and tools that support specifying, designing, developing, deploying and verifying interactive systems. Building interactive systems is a multifaceted and challenging activity, involving a plethora of different actors and roles. This is particularly true in the domain of HCI, where we continuously push the edge of what is possible, where there is a crucial need for adequate processes, tools and methods to build reliable, useful and usable systems that help people cope with the ever-increasing complexity of work and life.The contents of this issue on EICS is the sum of four separate rounds of submissions, evenly spaced from July 2017 through May 2018. In total, the rounds attracted a total of 81 submissions from Asia, Canada, Australia, Europe, Africa, and the United States. Promising submissions in a round that were not accepted were invited to resubmit to a subsequent round, and 6 of the papers appearing in this issue were accepted after at least one round of resubmission. In each round, papers were subject to a rigorous reviewing process where they were reviewed by two EICS senior editors, as well as external reviewers. At the conclusion of each round, a Virtual Committee meeting was held to discuss all of the papers and arrive at final decisions. Ultimately, 14 papers were accepted over all rounds.This issue exists because of the dedicated volunteer effort of 20 senior editors who handled two to four papers each round, and 115 expert reviewers to ensure high quality and insightful reviews for all papers in all rounds. Reviewers and committee members were kept constant as much as possible for papers that were submitted to multiple rounds. Senior members of the editorial group also helped shepherd some papers, reflecting the deep commitment of this research community.We are excited by the detailed and insightful work that resulted in this PACMHCI EICS issue and look forward to equally high quality submissions in subsequent submission cycles over the coming year. For those interested in this area, this group holds their next annual conference June 19-22, 2018 in Paris, France. That conference will provide many opportunities to share ideas with other researchers and practitioners from institutions around the world.},

abstract = {Visualization systems such as dashboards are commonly used to analyze data and support users in their decision making, in communities as different as medical care, transport and software engineering. The increasing amount of data produced and continuous development of new visualizations exacerbate the difficulty of designing such dashboards, while the visualization need is broaden to specialist and non-specialist final users. In this context, we offer a multi-user approach, based on Model Driven Engineering (MDE). The idea is for the designer to express the visualization need by characterization, according to a given taxonomy. We provide a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to design the system and a Software Product Line (SPL) to capture the technological variability of visualization widgets. We performed a user study, using a software project management use case, to validate if dashboard users and designers are able to use a taxonomy to express their visualization need.},

abstract = {Manual assembly at production is a mentally demanding task. With rapid prototyping and smaller production lot sizes, this results in frequent changes of assembly instructions that have to be memorized by workers. Assistive systems compensate this increase in mental workload by providing "just-in-time" assembly instructions through in-situ projections. The implementation of such systems and their benefits to reducing mental workload have previously been justified with self-perceived ratings. However, there is no evidence by objective measures if mental workload is reduced by in-situ assistance. In our work, we showcase electroencephalography (EEG) as a complementary evaluation tool to assess cognitive workload placed by two different assistive systems in an assembly task, namely paper instructions and in-situ projections. We identified the individual EEG bandwidth that varied with changes in working memory load. We show, that changes in the EEG bandwidth are found between paper instructions and in-situ projections, indicating that they reduce working memory compared to paper instructions. Our work contributes by demonstrating how design claims of cognitive demand can be validated. Moreover, it directly evaluates the use of assistive systems for delivering context-aware information. We analyze the characteristics of EEG as real-time assessment for cognitive workload to provide insights regarding the mental demand placed by assistive systems.},

For reaching a wider audience, developing VR applications in a web environment requires a flexible adaptation to the different input and output devices that are currently available. This paper examines the required support and explores how to develop VR applications based on web technologies that can adapt to different VR devices. We summarize the main engineering challenges and we describe a flexible framework for integrating and exploiting various VR devices for both input and output. Using such framework, we describe how we re-implemented four manipulation techniques from the literature to enable them within the same application, providing details on how we adapted its parts for different input and output devices such as Kinect and Leap Motion. Finally, we briefly examine the usability of the final application using our framework.},

The Machine Learning community focused mainly on accuracy and robustness to noise, creating classifiers that precisely recognize gestures after their performance. Instead, the User Interface Engineering community developed compositional gesture descriptions that model gestures and their sub-parts. They are suitable for building guidance systems, but they lack a robust and accurate recognition support. In this paper, we establish a compromise between the accuracy and the provided information introducing G-Gene, a method for transforming compositional stroke gesture definitions into profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), able to provide both a good accuracy and information on gesture sub-parts. It supports online recognition without using any global feature, and it updates the information while receiving the input stream, with an accuracy useful for prototyping the interaction. We evaluated the approach in a user interface development task, showing that it requires less time and effort for creating guidance systems with respect to common gesture classification approaches.},

It proposes a visual language for annotating devices, containers, flows of liquids and networking connections in augmented reality. Compared to related work, it provides a more lightweight and flexible approach for building 3D models of industrial systems. The models are further used to automatically infer software configuration of controllable industrial products. This addresses a common problem of error-prone and time-consuming configuration of industrial systems in the current practice. The proposed approach is evaluated in a study with 16 domain experts. The study participants are involved in creating a model of an industrial system for water treatment. Their comments show that the approach can enable a less error-prone configuration for more complex systems. Opportunities for improvement in usability and reflections on the potential of the approach are discussed.},

We present Djnn, a conceptual framework based on the concepts of process and process activation, then we introduce Smala a programming language derived from this framework. We propose a solution for the unification of the concepts of event and data-flow, and for the derivation of complex control structures from a small set of basic ones. We detail the syntax and the semantics of Smala. Finally, we illustrate through a real-size application how it enables building all parts of an interactive software.

This paper presents XD-AR, a cross-device AR application development framework designed to unify input and output across hand-held, head-worn, and projective AR displays. XD-AR's design was informed by challenging scenarios for AR applications, a technical review of existing AR platforms, and a survey of 30 AR designers, developers, and users. Based on the results, we developed a taxonomy of AR system components and identified key challenges and opportunities in making them work together. We discuss how our taxonomy can guide the design of future AR platforms and applications and how cross-device interaction challenges could be addressed. We illustrate this when using XD-AR to implement two challenging AR applications from the literature in a device-agnostic way.},

Therefore, it is important to guarantee usable and ergonomic interfaces for workers. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the use of digital human models (DHMs) by human factors/ergonomics (HFE) experts can complement the user evaluation of gesture interface prototypes. Two case studies were conducted, in which gesture-based systems for remote robot control were evaluated. The results indicate that the use of DHMs supports the findings from self-reported HFE evaluations. However, digital human modeling still has some limitations. For example, in this study, it was not possible to evaluate small muscle groups (e.g. fingers). We argue that adaptation of the DHMs could be a rapid and simple alternative for supporting the HFE design of gestures.},

In addition, by a systematic validation through a system that automatically generates wrong sequences of tasks, we show that our algorithm is able to find behavioral deviations from the expected behavior at different times by considering the extended classification of the possible deviations with good accuracy.},

Recent studies have explored the potential of 360 video to support multi-user collaboration in remote settings. These studies identified several challenges with respect to 360 live streams, such as the lack of gaze awareness, out-of-sync views, and missed gestures. To address these challenges, we created 360Anywhere, a framework for 360 video-based multi-user collaboration that, in addition to allowing collaborators to view and annotate a 360 live stream, also supports projection of annotations in the 360 stream back into the real-world environment in real-time. This enables a range of collaborative augmented reality applications not supported with existing tools. We present the 360Anywhere framework and tools that allow users to generate applications tailored to specific collaboration and augmentation needs with support for remote collaboration. In a series of exploratory design sessions with users, we assess 360Anywhere's power and flexibility for three mobile ad-hoc scenarios. Using 360Anywhere, participants were able to set up and use fairly complex remote collaboration systems involving projective augmented reality in less than 10 minutes.},

While existing solutions often support a restricted set of devices and networking protocols, our unifying and extensible INFEX framework enables information exchange and exploration across arbitrary devices and also supports devices that cannot run custom software or do not offer their own I/O modalities. The plug-in based INFEX architecture allows developers to provide custom but consistent user interfaces for information exchange and exploration across a heterogeneous set of devices.},

This diverse research community explores how different types of social groups affect, and are affected by, information and communication technology. The topics explored by this community can include social media use, crowdsourcing and micro-work, societal effects of computing, and much more. Like many other HCI communities, CSCW approaches these topics with a broad range of scientific techniques, theoretical perspectives and technology platforms.The call for papers for this issue on CSCW attracted 385 submissions, from Asia, Canada, Australia, Europe, Africa, and the United States. After the first round of reviewing, 207 (54%) papers were invited to the Revise and Resubmit phase. The editorial committee worked hard over August 2017 to arrive at final decisions, with a Virtual Committee meeting held to discuss those papers that needed collective deliberation. In the end, 105 papers (27%) were accepted.This issue exists because of the dedicated volunteer effort of 101 senior editors who served as Associate Chairs (ACs), and 885 expert reviewers to ensure high quality and insightful reviews for all papers in both rounds. Reviewers and committee members were kept constant for papers that submitted to both rounds. Senior members of the editorial group also helped shepherd some papers, reflecting the deep commitment of this research community.We are excited by the compelling and thought-provoking work that resulted in this PACMHCI CSCW issue and look forward to equally high quality submissions for the next submission cycle from this research community in the Spring of 2018. For those interested in this area, this group holds their next annual conference November 3-7, 2018 in New York City's Hudson River (Jersey City).

Our study focuses on recurring meetings, both because recurring meetings are an ordinary aspect of organization life, and because their routine nature lends them a casual character that distinguishes them from one-time, issue-focused meetings. This paper analyzes accounts of 19 meetings and examines how various peripheral activities -- side-talk, side-tracking, multi-tasking, pre- and post-meeting talk -- have positive effects, as well as negative ones. We argue that viewing recurring meetings as a confluence of individual and collective aims suggests new approaches for designing technology that supports both meetings and participants.},

In this paper, we present an interview study with people from two sites: the video game League of Legends and Weibo, a microblogging site in China. We found that people were passionate about participation in crowdsourcing, but at the same time, struggled with the system, and acted beyond their designated role within the system. We derive implications for designing online non-hierarchical governance from our research.},

Using Babycenter.com as our research setting, we found that pregnant women sought peer support due to constrained access to healthcare providers, dissatisfaction with healthcare services/medical advice, limited offline social support, and unavailability of information in other venues. While the particular topics of concern typifying each trimester were distinct, pregnant women consistently sought advice, informal and formal knowledge, reassurance, and emotional support from peers during each stage of pregnancy. BabyCenter.com peers provided support by leveraging their own experiential knowledge and passing along clinical expertise acquired during the course of their own healthcare. We discuss design implications for health services and IT systems that meet pregnant women's temporal and multi-faceted needs during prenatal care.},

By interviewing 30 participants from both academia and industry, the paper examines how people write together using today's commercially available systems. The analysis focuses on the new co-editing capabilities (e.g., track changes) that are integrated into commercial tools and thus adopted by users widely in the last decade. These capabilities enable new ways of working together (e.g., directly edit the content at the character level at the same time), but users reported reluctance to fully commit to these new working styles. We thus systematically analyze users' rationales of why they do not want to write together while they are writing together with other. We argue that the development of collaborative writing tools is far from finished and these findings provide insights for the design of technology, and suggest future directions for research.},

Individual social capital is often connected with one's happiness levels, well-being, and propensity to cooperate with others. The dominant approach for quantifying individual social capital remains self-reported surveys and generator-methods, which are costly, attention-consuming, and fraught with biases. Given the important role played by mobile phones in mediating human social lives, this study explores the use of phone metadata (call and SMS logs) to automatically infer an individual's social capital. Based on Williams' Social Capital survey as ground truth and ten-week phone data collection for 55 participants, we report that (1) multiple phone-based social features are intrinsically associated with social capital; and (2) analytics algorithms utilizing phone data can achieve high accuracy at automatically inferring an individual's bridging, bonding, and overall social capital scores. Results pave way for studying social capital and its temporal dynamics at an unprecedented scale.},

Our analysis shows that conspiracy talk emerged as people attempted to make sense of a public health crisis, reflecting their emergent information needs and their pervasive distrust in formal sources of Zika information.

We utilize an integrated networked gatekeeping and framing lens to examine how #BlackLivesMatter frames were produced--and how they were contested--by separate communities of supporters and critics. Among other empirical findings, this work demonstrates hashtags being used in diverse ways--e.g. to mark participation, assert individual identity, promote group identity, and support or challenge a frame. Considered from a networked gatekeeping perspective, we illustrate how hashtags can serve as channeling mechanisms, shaping trajectories of information flow. This analysis also reveals a right-leaning community of BlackLivesMatter critics to have a more well-defined group of crowdsourced elite who largely define their side's counter-frame. },

While studio critique often focuses on depth, distributed critique often revolved around collective sensemaking, through which creative workers engaged in iteratively interpreting, defining, and refining the artifact and their process.

In this paper, we sought to understand how civic data hackathons could generate impactful data analytics for NPOs' data-driven work, and how to support collaborative data analytics during hackathons. We collected various types of data (observations, surveys, and interviews) from two civic data hackathons with 9 NPOs and over 300 data volunteers in a Midwestern city in the U.S. Our results describe the collaboration activities and the types of actionable collaborative analytics outputs generated from these activities. We also identify a unique social group (i.e., client teams), who help with preparing and coordinating the event, perform brokering activities to support the collaborative analytics through the civic data hackathons. This broker role is vital for the success of the collaboration between domain experts and data experts. Our findings contribute to the CSCW research on the collaborative work of interdisciplinary hackathons, and to a broader understanding of civic data collaborations.},

We show how this turn towards innovation and entrepreneurship is central to how technological and political elites tinker with new modes of governance and define the relationship between the future of the nation and its citizenry in economic terms. Drawing from long-term multi-sited ethnographic research in the United States, China, and Africa, we present a subset of findings to show how these shifts in governance are being enacted through interconnections between politicians and technologists, and the products, spaces, and educational ideals they fund and create.

On the one hand is their construction of a pro-PRC message using the tactics of Internet subcultures (memes, trolling, etc.), but toned down to meet standards of civility. On the other hand, by collectively breaching the Great Firewall and establishing Facebook accounts, the group transgressed PRC technical and legal norms, which were designed to prevent unsanctioned collective action. We argue that the Diba Expedition exemplifies the coordinated use of a complex, transnational social media ecology to support and produce a mass-scale event and newsworthy spectacle, loosened if not severed from state control, and a discursively innovative polysemous message targeted at diverse international audiences: civilized trolling.},

Yet, we know very little about how the behavior of these crowds changes over time and how these dynamics impact their performance. In this paper, we take a group development approach that considers how the behavior of crowds change over time in anticipation and as a result of their evaluation and recognition. Towards this goal, this paper studies the collaborative behavior of groups comprised of editors of articles that have been recognized for their outstanding quality and given the Good Articles (GA) status and those that eventually become Featured Articles (FA) on Wikipedia. The results show that the collaborative behavior of GA groups radically changes just prior to their nomination. In particular, the GA groups experience increases in the level of activity, centralization of workload, and level of GA experience and decreases in conflict (i.e., reverts) among editors. After being promoted to GA, they converge back to their typical behavior and composition. This indicates that crowd behavior prior to their evaluation period is dramatically different than behavior before or after. In addition, the collaborative behaviors of crowds during their promotion to GA are predictive of whether they are eventually promoted to FA. Our findings shed new light on the importance of time in understanding the relationship between crowd performance and collaborative measures such as centralization, conflict and experience.},

Following a strength-based approach, we collected data via home visits and semi-structured interviews involving 14 participants, and observed activities at the care center over 8 months. Our participants exhibited three key facets of resilience: (1) resilience as an integral part of their everyday lives, (2) a spirited phenomenon, and (3) a social and care-focused process. We contribute empirical insights into our participants' situated resilience and articulate ways through which design can support their existing social and collaborative practices. We compare and contrast our findings within and outside CSCW literature and advocate for a strength-based approach.},

In most, social functions are performed at a distance, such as posting comments and achievements, or via in-app leaderboards. We present an activity tracking app designed instead to encourage face-to-face encounters. Stickers for Steps seeks to recreate the experience of a physical sticker book, where digital 'stickers' are collected in an album, but where stickers are awarded for reaching activity targets. Users will accrue duplicate stickers, which can be swapped with other co-located users over a Bluetooth connection. We explore the usage of our app, reporting on a trial with 33 participants. We find that our app successfully encouraged groups of users to swap duplicates, review progress and to discuss their levels of activity. We provide design recommendations for future activity tracking systems that could incorporate face-to-face interactions.},

Using employees' organizational social media data and their workplace hierarchical network structure, we studied contagion across a large multinational corporation, focusing on an important workplace behavior - employee engagement. We measured employees' engagement based on their word choice in organizational social media, and we applied a longitudinal statistical technique which controls for homophily, employees' traits and prior expressions of engagement. We found that engagement and disengagement spread from one employee to another with direct peers exerting the strongest influence. While engagement-spread was more powerful laterally among people at the same organizational level, disengagement-spread followed the vertical managerial chain. Further, we found that disengaged co-workers exerted a stronger influence on employee's future engagement compared to the engaged co-workers. Our results suggest the need for organizations to sense and address workplace disengagement promptly. Moreover, our findings offer opportunities for using workplace interventions to promote engagement and mitigate disengagement.},

Yet, little is known about expectations of, the experience with, and the impact of self-monitoring in the workplace. To address this gap, we studied software developers, as one community of knowledge workers. We used an iterative, user-feedback-driven development approach (N=20) and a survey (N=413) to infer design elements for workplace self-monitoring, which we then implemented as a technology probe called WorkAnalytics. We field-tested these design elements during a three-week study with software development professionals (N=43). Based on the results of the field study, we present design recommendations for self-monitoring in the workplace, such as using experience sampling to increase the awareness about work and to create richer insights, the need for a large variety of different metrics to retrospect about work, and that actionable insights, enriched with benchmarking data from co-workers, are likely needed to foster productive behavior change and improve collaboration at work.

In this study, we analyze how journalists manage professional collaborations across myriad tasks and contexts, with a focus on how their security and privacy concerns may shape these behaviors. We find that journalists' relatively open information-sharing practices may reflect the strength of their informal intra-organizational networks, rather than their organizational commitment per se. Moreover, while journalists' like many workers' manage their security and privacy concerns by avoiding sensitive communications via certain channels, the physical shrinking newsrooms of is reducing opportunities for the face-to-face communications journalists rely on for secure, private, professional exchange. Journalists' self-censorship on collaborative platforms therefore warrants particular attention given journalism's essential role in the public sphere.},

In life, pop culture fans can have parasocial (one-sided, mediated) relationships with celebrities. Yet when fans of departed celebrities express their grief in public comment threads, conversations often result in disagreements about how to grieve. These disagreements consistently appear in response to the deaths of public figures, and have been broadly labeled "grief policing." We performed a thematic analysis of public Facebook comments responding to the deaths of Alan Rickman, David Bowie, and Prince. Our findings describe prominent grief policing practices and explain how commenters may be importing norms from other contexts when shared spaces consist of transient interactions that make norm formation difficult. Our findings contribute to a broader understanding of how conflicting norms affect discourse in transient online spaces. Approaching online incivility through a lens of conflicting social norm enforcement may open doors for improvements in public discourse online.},

abstract = {Many social media systems explicitly connect individuals (e.g., Facebook or Twitter); as a result, they are the targets of most research on social networks. However, many systems do not emphasize or support explicit linking between people (e.g., Wikipedia or Reddit), and even fewer explicitly link communities. Instead, network analysis is performed through inference on implicit connections, such as co-authorship or text similarity. Depending on how inference is done and what data drove it, different networks may emerge. While correlated structures often indicate stability, in this work we demonstrate that differences, or misalignment, between inferred networks also capture interesting behavioral patterns. For example, high-text but low-author similarity often reveals communities "at war" with each other over an issue or high-author but low-text similarity can suggest community fragmentation. Because we are able to model edge direction, we also find that asymmetry in degree (in-versus-out) co-occurs with marginalized identities (subreddits related to women, people of color, LGBTQ, etc.). In this work, we provide algorithms that can identify misaligned links, network structures and communities. We then apply these techniques to Reddit to demonstrate how these algorithms can be used to decipher inter-group dynamics in social media.},

Prior research has shown that crowdsourcing can pose privacy risks (e.g., de-anonymization) to crowd workers. However, little is known about the specific privacy issues crowd workers have experienced and how they perceive the state of privacy in crowdsourcing. In this paper, we present results from an online survey of 435 MTurk crowd workers from the US, India, and other countries and areas. Our respondents reported different types of privacy concerns (e.g., data aggregation, profiling, scams), experiences of privacy losses (e.g., phishing, malware, stalking, targeted ads), and privacy expectations on MTurk (e.g., screening tasks). Respondents from multiple countries and areas reported experiences with the same privacy issues, suggesting that these problems may be endemic to the whole MTurk platform. We discuss challenges, high-level principles and concrete suggestions in protecting crowd workers'; privacy on MTurk and in crowdsourcing more broadly.},

Streams of walking about among exhibits or city sights elicited more user interaction than streams of lectures. We observed that voluntary viewers had a wider variation in how long they viewed the event, and switched among streams less and had less interaction through text comments compared to viewers recruited through Mechanical Turk.},

In contrast, false rumours on social media (74%) are perceived as a threat.

abstract = {The dominant crowdsourcing infrastructure today is the workflow, which decomposes goals into small independent tasks. However, complex goals such as design and engineering have remained stubbornly difficult to achieve with crowdsourcing workflows. Is this due to a lack of imagination, or a more fundamental limit? This paper explores this question through in-depth case studies of 22 workers across six workflow-based crowd teams, each pursuing a complex and interdependent web development goal. We used an inductive mixed method approach to analyze behavior trace data, chat logs, survey responses and work artifacts to understand how workers enacted and adapted the crowdsourcing workflows. Our results indicate that workflows served as useful coordination artifacts, but in many cases critically inhibited crowd workers from pursuing real-time adaptations to their work plans. However, the CSCW and organizational behavior literature argues that all sufficiently complex goals require open-ended adaptation. If complex work requires adaptation but traditional static crowdsourcing workflows can't support it, our results suggest that complex work may remain a fundamental limitation of workflow-based crowdsourcing infrastructures.},

Drawing on these insights, we reflect on two specific conceptualizations of disease management behavior (sensemaking and problem-solving) as they relate to data specific activities of patients and providers and provide design suggestions for tools to support collaborative and individual use of PGD.},

We designed and validated a 9-item questionnaire to measure the "Social Disfordance" of Mediated Social Touch, with three scales that focus on Social Discomfort, Communicational Expressiveness, and Need for Additional Consideration. A high degree of "social disfordance" of an MST system signifies that it may not provide the appropriate social affordances for mediating touch in a particular context. The development of the Social Disfordance of Mediated Social Touch (SDMST) instrument included a systematic literature review, expert feedback, and think-out-loud piloting. Its refinement included an exploratory factor analysis with a subsequent reduction of questions and scales. We report its psychometric properties, including metrics of inter-item reliability, convergent validity, test-retest reliability, and concurrent validity, confirming that these properties are sufficient for future use. We conclude with examples of scoring, appropriate use, and a discussion of the limitations.},

We found that overwhelmingly, the interactions previously characterized as problematic instances of conflict are typically better characterized as routine, productive, even collaborative work. These results challenge past work and show the importance of qualitative/quantitative collaboration. In our paper, we present quantitative metrics and qualitative heuristics for operationalizing bot-bot conflict. We give thick descriptions of kinds of events that present as bot-bot reverts, helping distinguish conflict from non-conflict. We computationally classify these kinds of events through patterns in edit summaries. By interpreting found/trace data in the socio-technical contexts in which people give that data meaning, we gain more from quantitative measurements, drawing deeper understandings about the governance of algorithmic systems in Wikipedia.

abstract = {In 2015, Reddit closed several subreddits-foremost among them r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown-due to violations of Reddit's anti-harassment policy. However, the effectiveness of banning as a moderation approach remains unclear: banning might diminish hateful behavior, or it may relocate such behavior to different parts of the site. We study the ban of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown in terms of its effect on both participating users and affected subreddits. Working from over 100M Reddit posts and comments, we generate hate speech lexicons to examine variations in hate speech usage via causal inference methods. We find that the ban worked for Reddit. More accounts than expected discontinued using the site; those that stayed drastically decreased their hate speech usage-by at least 80%. Though many subreddits saw an influx of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown "migrants," those subreddits saw no significant changes in hate speech usage. In other words, other subreddits did not inherit the problem. We conclude by reflecting on the apparent success of the ban, discussing implications for online moderation, Reddit and internet communities more broadly.},

'Projects' involve coordination and cooperation between colocated and distributed actors, and are relevant for CSCW (computer supported cooperative work) research as a particular kind of cooperative work. A survey of CSCW publications only identified 26 papers that explicitly address project management (PM), of which most primarily focus on IT development. We argue that CSCW's conceptual and methodological tools can make significant contributions to PM research, practice and its computational support. We point to four issues of relevance for future CSCW research on projects: continue to sophisticate the empirical and conceptual understanding of projects, broaden research beyond IT projects into other domains, develop agile approaches beyond IT development and focus on computational support for project work and management. In all, we argue that CSCW can advance our understanding of project work and management and the design of adequate computational support.},

abstract = {Online harassment is a pervasive and pernicious problem. Techniques like natural language processing and machine learning are promising approaches for identifying abusive language, but they fail to address structural power imbalances perpetuated by automated labeling and classification. Similarly, platform policies and reporting tools are designed for a seemingly homogenous user base and do not account for individual experiences and systems of social oppression. This paper describes the design and evaluation of HeartMob, a platform built by and for people who are disproportionately affected by the most severe forms of online harassment. We conducted interviews with 18 HeartMob users, both targets and supporters, about their harassment experiences and their use of the site. We examine systems of classification enacted by technical systems, platform policies, and users to demonstrate how 1) labeling serves to validate (or invalidate) harassment experiences; 2) labeling motivates bystanders to provide support; and 3) labeling content as harassment is critical for surfacing community norms around appropriate user behavior. We discuss these results through the lens of Bowker and Star's classification theories and describe implications for labeling and classifying online abuse. Finally, informed by intersectional feminist theory, we argue that fully addressing online harassment requires the ongoing integration of vulnerable users' needs into the design and moderation of online platforms.},

As part of the growing technological support for such collaboration, an opportunity exists to design systems that actively guide and facilitate collaborative problem solving toward the most productive outcomes. A better understanding of the dynamics of open-ended collaboration on complex problems is needed to realize this opportunity. Motivated by this need for better understanding, we investigate the collaborative problem solving ecosystem of the scientific-discovery game Foldit. Our investigation is guided by two primary questions: how do the social aspects of Foldit impact an individual's behavior? and what factors have significant impact on group success? We find that collaboration and competition are associated with increased participation and that collaboration increases individual performance. We also find that measures of group skill, individual skill, and participation correlate with better group performance.},

This research examines the effectiveness of systematic and heuristic cues in persuasive requests in Kiva lending teams intended to convince members to donate. An analysis of 88,596 requests exchanged in 1,610 teams shows that certain heuristic processing cues (e.g., liking between requesters and potential lenders, advocates low authority in their teams and the importance of the team to the lender) strongly predicted whether lenders would contribute to a loan request. In contrast, cues that required systematic processing are less influential. We also found that behavioral cues are more important than verbal ones. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our work.},

Furthermore, Social CheatSheet includes embedded curation features for users to generate their own annotated notes and tutorials that can be kept private or shared with the user community. A weeklong deployment study with 15 users showed that users found Social CheatSheet to be useful and they were able to easily both add their own curated content and locate content generated by other users.

This design is contrary to typical apps where messages can be sent and read asynchronously at an individual's convenience. We have conducted a field trial in which 15 users installed the app on their own devices and used it in the wild. We present a qualitative analysis of interviews with the participants following the trial. The findings address how the app was used, how synchrony affected conversational flows, how synchrony raised issues of attention and intimacy, and what issues users faced in the practical work of conducting synchronous messaging. This work demonstrates how core concepts in the study of cooperative work such as a/synchrony can be drawn upon to reconsider taken-for-granted design features of mobile applications and the lived experience of communication.},

We found that teens experienced more negative emotions the week that they reported cyberbullying and exposure to explicit content, but these effects were gone one week later. In addition, teens reported a slight in crease in positive emotions and mental well-being during weeks they were exposed to other risks. Our results suggest that most of the risks teens in our study experienced online only pose brief negative effects, if any, and initiates a discussion on how our society may overly problematize the negative effects of online risk exposure on teens.},

Interviewees reported that they often did not pay attention to or engage with foreign language posts, due to a lack of relevance and contextual knowledge. When they did actively engage with foreign language posts, interviewees did not rely solely on machine translation output but instead actively collected and combined various cues from within and outside the post in order to understand what it was about. Interviewees further reported different types of goals for trying to make sense of foreign language posts; some focused on simply extracting and understanding the emotional components of a post while others tried to gain a fuller understanding of a post, including its contextual and cultural meanings. Based on these findings, we suggest design possibilities that could better aid multilingual communication in social media.},

Both IPV professionals and survivors feel that they do not possess adequate expertise to be able to identify or cope with technology-enabled IPV, and there are currently insufficient best practices to help them deal with abuse via technology. We also reveal a number of tensions and trade-offs in negotiating technology's role in social support and legal procedures.

To this end, we conduct a measurement study by crawling webpages from Meetup containing 240K groups, 8.9M users, 27M group affiliations and 78M topical interests. By analyzing the dataset, we find that LGBT status of users, which is one of the most sensitive privacy information, can be predicted with 93% accuracy.

Using a controlled experiment, we varied sound visualizations and the complexity of soundscapes presented to human annotators. Results show that more complex audio scenes result in lower annotator agreement, and spectrogram visualizations are superior in producing higher quality annotations at lower cost of time and human labor. We also found recall is more affected than precision by soundscape complexity, and mistakes can be often attributed to certain sound event characteristics. These findings have implications not only for how we should design annotation tasks and interfaces for audio data, but also how we train and evaluate machine-listening systems.},

Through interviews with 14 Venmo users and surveys of 164 peer-to-peer payment app users and 80 Venmo users, we find uses consistent with other SASs and uncover novel uses that reflect the unusual inclusion of an SAS within a utilitarian app for personal finance. For many users, the SAS is a flexible feature that creates an experience that blends their task-driven use with social benefits. People write purely functional transaction descriptions with strangers, while in transactions with friends, they sometimes craft playful descriptions that enhance their experience or perform their social relationships. The SAS provides opportunities for learning about how to use the application and for keeping up with friends. The results of this study extend the CSCW community's knowledge of SASs and offer guidance to designers considering use of SAS in a variety of applications.},

abstract = {Nowadays people have many overlapping relationships across different social network sites. Will the communication frequency of a relationship on a focal SNS increase or decrease after the corresponding parties begin interacting with each other on a new SNS? What kinds of relationships and parties on the focal SNS are more robust to relationship overlapping across different sites? We conducted a case study on two Chinese popular social network sites (Weibo and Douban). Our results indicate that relationships' interactions on a new SNS have negative effect on the parties' communication frequency on the focal SNS. The communication frequency of older relationships on the focal SNS is more susceptible to the influence of the interacting on the new SNS, while relationships with more common groups and more extensive posts are less likely to be influenced. Our findings imply opportunities for SNS designers to strengthen their existing fragile ties and help users to build much more robust relationships.},

However, little research has been conducted to investigate how baby wearable technologies are adopted and used in parenting. This paper presents a two-week in-depth situated study with six mothers in their homes consisting of contextual entry and exit interviews, video recordings of "out-of-box" experiences, and a diary study. Using interpretative phenomenological analysis, participants' use and expectations of the baby wearable technology were examined. Use of the device directly impacted upon parents' knowledge production and anxiety, and influenced the perceived physicality and social factors of parenting. We frame these findings around sociological norms of the vulnerable child and responsible mother, as well as the notion of "lived informatics", where individuals' interaction with the technology influenced the perception, use and impact of the baby wearable on everyday parenting practices and familial relationships.},

To understand how these changes impacted CSCW research, we systematically reviewed 1209 papers and notes published at the ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work between 1990 and 2015. When considered with results from two previous literature reviews, covering 1990 - 1998 and 1998 - 2004 respectively, our analysis provides perspective on 25 years of groupware research. We show that the field has responded to, not anticipated, changes in the computing landscape, long-term trends away from 'systems' and explanatory research, and a lack of bibliographic research that synthesizes findings. Finally, we discuss implications of these trends for CSCW research: how results are synthesized across the field, what kinds of research we value, and how multi-device ecologies are studied.},

At the same time, there are increasing accounts of race and gender bias in evaluations of gig workers, with negative impacts for those workers. We report on a series of four Mechanical Turk-based studies in which participants who rated simulated gig work did not show race- or gender bias, while manipulation checks showed they reliably distinguished between low- and high-quality work. Given prior research, this was a striking result. To explore further, we used a Bayesian approach to verify absence of ratings bias (as opposed to merely not detecting bias). This Bayesian test let us identify an upper- bound: if any bias did exist in our studies, it was below an average of 0.2 stars on a five-star scale. We discuss possible interpretations of our results and outline future work to better understand the results.},

In this paper, leveraging social media as a passive sensor of stress, we propose novel computational techniques to quantify and examine stress responses after gun violence on college campuses. We first present a machine learning classifier for inferring stress expression in Reddit posts, which achieves an accuracy of 82%. Next, focusing on 12 incidents of campus gun violence in the past five years, and social media data gathered from college Reddit communities, our methods reveal amplified stress levels following the violent incidents, which deviate from usual stress patterns on the campuses. Further, distinctive temporal and linguistic changes characterize the campus populations, such as reduced cognition, higher self pre-occupation and death-related conversations. We discuss the implications of our work in improving mental wellbeing and rehabilitation efforts around crisis events in college student populations.},

In this paper, we answer this question through a mixed-methods investigation. Through secondary analysis of interview data from 26 participants and an online questionnaire (N=285) we found three major interpretations of anonymity among AA and NA members: "unidentifiability," "social contract," and "program over individual." While unidentifiability has been the focus of computing investigations, the other interpretations provide a significant and novel lens on anonymity. To understand how and when the unidentifiability interpretation was most likely to be enacted, we conducted a quantitative analysis of traces of activity in a large online recovery community. We observed that members were less likely to enact "unidentifiability" if they were more connected to the particular community and had more time in recovery. We provide implications for future research on context-specific anonymity and implications for design in online recovery spaces and similar sensitive contexts.},

Many disabled respondents also described proactively disclosing as a technique to filter potential connections. Our findings suggest that individuals with disabilities must perform additional labor and navigate complex group norms in pursuit of personal connection. We advocate that the social computing research community consider how these processes are driven by both societal expectation and the constraints of online dating platforms.

Focusing on the latter approach, we introduce privacy-enhancing obfuscations for photos and conduct an online experiment with 271 participants to evaluate their effectiveness against human recognition and how they affect the viewing experience. Results indicate the two most common obfuscations, blurring and pixelating, are ineffective. On the other hand, inpainting, which removes an object or person entirely, and avatar, which replaces content with a graphical representation are effective. From a viewer experience perspective, blurring, pixelating, inpainting, and avatar are preferable. Based on these results, we suggest inpainting and avatar may be useful as privacy-enhancing technologies for photos, because they are both effective at increasing privacy for elements of a photo and provide a good viewer experience.},

Relative decreases are bigger if losses are unexpected, or if losing margins are big. In contrast, unexpected wins do not cause more contributions relative to wins that were not unexpected. Neither do big wins result in more contributions relative to small wins. Additionally, contributions to non-football-related pages are not affected by NFL game results. Our findings add to the literatures on (i) the determinants of individual contributions to peer production communities, (ii) how community dynamics affect user contributions, (iii) the importance of emotions, (iv) the effect of offline events on online behavior, and (v) the applicability of behavioral economics concepts to the HCI literature.},

To fill this gap, we conducted a qualitative study of 18 U.S. families with children ages 5-11. We found that children recognized certain privacy and security components from the contextual integrity framework, but children ages 5-7 had gaps in their knowledge. Children developed some strategies to manage concerns but largely relied on parents for support. Parents primarily used passive strategies to mediate children's device use and largely deferred teaching children about these concerns to the future. We argue that helping children develop strong privacy and security practices at a young age will prepare them to manage their privacy and security as adolescents and adults. We offer recommendations to scaffold children's learning on privacy and security.},

abstract = {A recent series of experiments demonstrated that introducing ranking bias to election-related search engine results can have a strong and undetectable influence on the preferences of undecided voters. This phenomenon, called the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME), exerts influence largely through order effects that are enhanced in a digital context. We present data from three new experiments involving 3,600 subjects in 39 countries in which we replicate SEME and test design interventions for suppressing the effect. In the replication, voting preferences shifted by 39.0%, a number almost identical to the shift found in a previously published experiment (37.1%). Alerting users to the ranking bias reduced the shift to 22.1%, and more detailed alerts reduced it to 13.8%. Users' browsing behaviors were also significantly altered by the alerts, with more clicks and time going to lower-ranked search results. Although bias alerts were effective in suppressing SEME, we found that SEME could be completely eliminated only by alternating search results -- in effect, with an equal-time rule. We propose a browser extension capable of deploying bias alerts in real-time and speculate that SEME might be impacting a wide range of decision-making, not just voting, in which case search engines might need to be strictly regulated.},

We validate it in problem-solving workshops with organisers, and find that a full review is feasible in under 15 minutes, that it provides effective prompts and important guidance, and can successfully support process innovation. Finally, we validate it for use in summative evaluations of online communities.

We formulate the sentence editing task as a machine translation problem, in which an original sentence is "translated" into an edited sentence. Our tool implements a character-level Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) encoder-decoder model, trained with about 6.8 millions original-edited sentence pairs from Stack Overflow post edits. We evaluate our edit assistance tool using a large-scale archival post edits, a field study of assisting a novice post editor, and a survey of trusted contributors.

However, relatively little research has focused on how to form and support teams within online learning platforms, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). A number of challenges arise for team formation in voluntary online classes: students may drop out and leave their team, and even if they do persist with the course, the team may not work together effectively. In this paper, we introduce a team-formation strategy that incorporates a deliberation process, where participants hold discussions in preparation for the collaboration task. First, we present a crowdsourced experiment that compares teams that are formed before or after a community deliberation process. Results demonstrate that teams engaging in a larger community deliberative process prior to team formation exhibit better team performance--as measured by team collaboration product quality--than pre-discussion teams. In a second crowdsourced experiment, we further explore the benefits of community-wide processes by automatically assigning teams based on participants' transactive interaction during deliberation. The results demonstrate advantages in terms of team performance for teams formed based on observed interactions during the community-level deliberation, compared to randomly formed teams. Finally, in a case study, we demonstrate how we successfully adapted the team formation strategy for use in a small MOOC.},

Seven young people struggling with literacy were interviewed about their use of SNS. Our results show that the visual affordances of SNS enable new forms of participation and expression, furthering our understanding of visual literacies. Nonetheless, despite the pervasive use of visual affordances to perform identity work, we also find that young people's learning differences are not always obviated but re-constructed, or even confronted in SNS.},

abstract = {Open innovation contests have been incredibly successful at producing creative designs and solutions. While participants compete for prizes in these contests, over half of contests conducted on online platforms allow participants to share ideas during contests, for benefits such as individual learning, community building, and cumulative innovation. Such sharing, however, is at tension with the competitive nature of crowd contests. To understand this tension, this study investigates community-level sharing of code on Kaggle, a contest platform for predictive modeling. Analyzing data on 25 contests in 2015 and 2016, we find that 10% of users shared code during contests, that participants doing medium well in the contest were the most likely to share code, and that sharing code improved individual, but not collective performance. These findings allow us to contribute insights about the participants, conditions, processes, and outcomes of community-level collaboration to both research on and design of open innovation contests.},

We broaden perspectives on scientific software development using a sociotechnical, software studies lens to examine this work of scientific discovery as a creative and embodied, yet exacting and methodical, activity that requires a 'human in the loop'. We offer a new reading of scientific software practices to convey how creating scientific software is often really the act of doing science itself--an intervention we believe is necessary to more successfully support scientific software sharing and infrastructure production.},

abstract = {Today, social media provide the means by which billions of people experience news and events happening around the world. However, the absence of traditional journalistic gatekeeping allows information to flow unencumbered through these platforms, often raising questions of veracity and credibility of the reported information. Here we ask: How do the dynamics of collective attention directed toward an event reported on social media vary with its perceived credibility? By examining the first large-scale, systematically tracked credibility database of public Twitter messages (47M messages corresponding to 1,138 real-world events over a period of three months), we established a relationship between the temporal dynamics of events reported on social media and their associated level of credibility judgments. Representing collective attention by the aggregate temporal signatures of an event's reportage, we found that the amount of continued attention focused on an event provides information about its associated levels of perceived credibility. Events exhibiting sustained, intermittent bursts of attention were found to be associated with lower levels of perceived credibility. In other words, as more people showed interest during moments of transient collective attention, the associated uncertainty surrounding these events also increased.},

In this paper, I untangle the different forms of imaging system interaction in this highly specialized multi-device environment (MDE). I show how the different forms of imaging systems affect the work practice by creating a need for additional articulation work. This articulation work is coordinated into the surgical practice on the body by either distributing the work across the team or by requiring a momentary pause of the surgical work for the entire team to attend to the articulation work to be done on or with the images. And we see how distributing the work across the team still requires a reintegration of the knowledge gleaned from the new information into the surgery itself. This presents an expansion of our understanding of how collocated teams function in MDEs that consist of purely shared displays.},

The current study examines the effects of culture on affective grounding. We conducted a laboratory experiment in which pairs of participants, half from America (A) and half from China (C), collaborated over instant messaging (IM). We found that affective grounding was harder to achieve for AA and AC pairs, but easier for CC pairs. We propose several design solutions to facilitate affective grounding in remote collaborations.},

Clinicians reported being more aware of their non-verbal communication behaviors and reacted positively to summaries of their conversational metrics, motivating them to want to improve. Using ReflectLive as a probe, we also discuss the benefits and concerns around automatically quantifying the "soft skills" and complexities of clinician-patient communication, the controllability of behaviors, and the design considerations for how to present real-time and summative feedback to clinicians.},

When other computing research areas have experienced similarly rapid growth (e.g. human computation, eco-feedback technology), early stage literature reviews have proved useful and influential by identifying trends and gaps in the literature of interest and by providing key directions for short- and long-term future work. In this paper, we seek to provide the same benefits with respect to computing research on the sharing economy. Specifically, following the suggested approach of prior computing literature reviews, we conducted a systematic review of sharing economy articles published in the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library to investigate the state of sharing economy research in computing. We performed this review with two simultaneous foci: a broad focus toward the computing literature more generally and a narrow focus specifically on HCI literature. We collected a total of 112 sharing economy articles published between 2008 and 2017 and through our analysis of these papers, we make two core contributions: (1) an understanding of the computing community's contributions to our knowledge about the sharing economy, and specifically the role of the HCI community in these contributions (i.e.what has been done) and (2) a discussion of under-explored and unexplored aspects of the sharing economy that can serve as a partial research agenda moving forward (i.e.what is next to do).},

abstract = {Organizations conduct series of face-to-face meetings aiming to improve work practices. In these meetings, participants from different backgrounds collaboratively design artifacts, such as knowledge or process maps. Such meetings are orchestrated and carried out by facilitators and the success of the meetings almost solely depends on the experience of the facilitators. Previous research has mainly focused on approaches that support facilitators and participants in the upfront planning of such events. There is however, little guidance for facilitators and participants once a meeting has started. One critical aspect -- among others -- is that during a meeting, the facilitator and participants need to decide for how long the iterative process of discussion and design should continue. We argue that we can provide support for such decisions based on the evolution of artifacts collaboratively created during such meetings. This paper presents a multi-level, multi-method analysis of artifacts based on experts' observations in combination with network analytics. We study the use of automated analytics to assess the evolution of collaboratively created artifacts and to indicate maturity and established consensus of the collaborative practice. We propose a computational approach to support facilitators and participants in deciding when to stop face-to-face meetings.},

We interviewed 12 visually impaired participants to understand their photo-sharing experiences and designed a photo description feature for the Facebook mobile application. We evaluated this feature with six participants in a seven-day diary study. We found that participants used the descriptions to recall and organize their photos, but they hesitated to upload photos without a sighted person's input. In addition to basic information about photo content, participants wanted to know more details about salient objects and people, and whether the photos reflected their personal aesthetic. We discuss these findings from the lens of self-disclosure and self-presentation theories and propose new computer vision research directions that will better support visual content sharing by visually impaired people.},

We characterized leavers and newcomers by their prior productivity, tenure (in the group or community), and participation in other groups within the larger community. Furthermore, we considered the moderating effect of group size on turnover. We analyzed data from 88,427 editors who participated in 1,054 WikiProjects, finding that (1) the positive effects of newcomers to a group were larger than the negative effects of leavers, (2) prior productivity, tenure, and participation in other groups all played significant roles, and (3) the effects of leavers and newcomers were amplified in larger groups.},

We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by implementing the SqueezeBands system, which augments social gestures over videochat with haptic actuation. We describe an evaluation of the system with 57 pairs of participants, collaborating on tasks either high or low emotional salience. Our results demonstrate that SqueezeBands encourage greater and more diverse demonstrations of touch and that they may be particularly appropriate for easing mental and physical demand in high emotion tasks.

In doing so, we offer an enriched understanding of how various social media channels might support informal, on-the-ground, crisis response, but also where they fall short in the process. Studying the emergence of care where social media fell short allows us to make recommendations for technology design to improve the effectiveness of logisticians in crisis response. By examining the bodily engagement of our participants at crisis sites, their efforts to deal with material convergence, and how they interacted with social media for technology-mediated care, we also contribute an understanding of the sociomateriality of care that emerges amidst efforts towards crisis relief.},

We then perform a user survey over two user populations (N1=469, N2=273) to validate our findings and to quantify the end-to-end impact of such bias on applicant decisions. Our findings show gender-bias has decreased significantly over the last 10 years. More surprisingly, we find that impact of gender bias in listings is dwarfed by our respondents' inherent bias towards specific job types.},

To understand this type of movement, we present a qualitative study of #ILookLikeAnEngineer, a hashtag created to challenge engineering stereotypes. We interviewed 32 people, including participants and non-participants of the movement, about their experiences with the hashtag. We found that personally identifiable participation promoted feelings of empowerment and strengthened connections within the marginalized community. At the same time, the personal and professional identity focus raised ambiguity about the boundaries of the collective and the movement's ability to change stereotypes. We discuss implications for online collective action and the use of social media for addressing stereotypes.},

As a result, students may use different boundary management strategies than working professionals. To explore this issue, we interviewed 29 undergraduates about how they managed boundaries between different areas of their life. Interviewees reported maintaining flexible and permeable boundaries that are not bounded physically or temporally. They used both technological and non-technological strategies to manage different life spheres. Interviewees saw technology as a major source of boundary violations but also as a boundary managing strategy that allowed them to achieve better life balance. Based on these findings, we propose design implications for tools to better support the boundary management processes of undergraduate students.},

They, however, have also brought about emerging issues regarding regulation, tax obligation, and impact on urban environment, and have generated heated debates from various interest groups. Empirical studies regarding these issues are limited, partly due to the unavailability of relevant data. Here we aim to understand service providers of the sharing economy, investigating who joins and who benefits, using the Airbnb market in the United States as a case study. We link more than 211 thousand Airbnb listings owned by 188 thousand hosts with demographic, socio-economic status (SES), housing, and tourism characteristics. We show that income and education are consistently the two most influential factors that are linked to the joining of Airbnb, regardless of the form of participation or year. Areas with lower median household income, or higher fraction of residents who have Bachelor's and higher degrees, tend to have more hosts. However, when considering the performance of listings, as measured by number of newly received reviews, we find that income has a positive effect for entire-home listings; listings located in areas with higher median household income tend to have more new reviews. Our findings demonstrate empirically that the disadvantage of SES-disadvantaged areas and the advantage of SES-advantaged areas may be present in the sharing economy.},

abstract = {Social computing researchers are beginning to apply machine learning tools to classify and analyze social media data. Our interest in understanding politeness in an online community focused our attention on tools that would help automate politeness analysis. This paper highlights one popular classification tool designed to score the politeness of text. Our application of this tool to Wikipedia data yielded some unexpected results. Those unexpected results led us to question how the tool worked and its effectiveness relative to human judgment and classification. We designed a user study to revalidate the tool with crowdworkers labeling samples of content from Wikipedia talk pages, imitating the original efforts to validate the tool. This revalidation points to challenges for automatic labeling. Based on our results, this paper reconsiders politeness in online communities as well as broader trends in the use of machine classifiers in social computing research.},

abstract = {In asynchronous online discussions, users actively reference visual materials (e.g., video, document) to provide supporting evidence and additional context. However, creating and comprehending complex references can be challenging, especially when there are multiple referents to refer, or when a referent is highly specific (e.g., specific sentences in a paper rather than the paper as a whole). To identify users' challenges in making references with multiple and specific referents while using existing discussion tools, we conducted an observational study and a preliminary interview. Based on the design lessons, we built Korero, a discussion interface that aims to facilitate complex referencing actions. For evaluation, we compared Korero against conventional interfaces in two user studies with referencing tasks of different referential difficulty. We found that Korero not only significantly reduces the time and effort in making references with multiple and specific referents, but also shows potential in increasing users' engagement with the discussion and referent materials.},

This may be a result of contributors' level of motivation, as it is deeply intertwined with activity. Existing studies on participation focus on activity dynamics but overlook the accompanied changes in motivation. To fill this gap, this study examines the interplay between contributors' fun motives and activity over time. We combine motivational data from two surveys of Wikipedia newcomers with data of two periods of editing activity. We find that persistence in editing is related to fun, while the amount of editing is not: individuals who persist in editing are characterized by higher fun motives early on (when compared to dropouts), though their motives are not related to the number of edits made. Moreover, we found that newcomers' experience of fun was reinforced by their amount of activity over time: editors who were initially motivated by fun entered a virtuous cycle, whereas those who initially had low fun motives entered a vicious cycle. Our findings shed new light on the importance of early experiences and reveal that the relationship between motivation and participation levels is more complex than previously understood.},

Romantic couples are the most frequently messaged contacts on mobile and communicate about a wide range of topics with each other, need to make joint decisions, and may have several roles in relation to each other (e.g., spouse, co-parent). Through a 3-week field study with ten U.S. diverse couples we studied how couples use a messaging app that allows them to compartmentalize their conversations into multiple "channels" around topics of their choice. We detail how couples managed and used channels in daily life, and channels' strengths and limitations. We found that channels made couples feel more organized, and helped with finding content and keeping track of topics. However, it was sometimes difficult to choose or navigate channels. We discuss perceived impacts of channels on relationships (e.g., topic-switching during conflicts), and outline design opportunities for messaging apps.},

We build a survival analysis model, defining a new set of variables that operationalize expressive writing, and comparing these effects to those of social support, which are well-known to benefit user engagement. Furthermore, we use machine learning methods to estimate that approximately one third of community members who self-identify with a cancer condition cease engagement due to literal death. Finally, we provide quantitative evidence that: (1) receiving support, expressive writing, and giving support, in decreasing magnitude of relative impact, are associated with user engagement on CaringBridge, and (2) that considering deceased sites separately in our analysis significantly shifts our interpretations of user behavior.},

The experiment tested a novel assignment strategy of peer mentorship, where peers were assigned to give feedback to all stages of the same project, and tested showing the context from the preceding design stage when composing feedback. The results showed that displaying the context from the preceding design stage led to feedback with higher perceived quality at the late design stages (but not at earlier stages) and feedback from mentors prompts longer responses from the feedback recipients. Our work contributes deeper empirical understanding of how assignment strategies and showing additional context affects peer feedback and provides practical guidelines for instructors to implement these methods in design courses.},

Social media sites are emerging as promising platforms enabling disclosure around a variety of stigmatized concerns, including mental illness. What kind of behavioral changes precede and follow such disclosures? Do the therapeutic benefits of "opening up" manifest in these changes? In this paper, we address these questions by focusing on disclosures of schizophrenia diagnoses made on Twitter. We adopt a clinically grounded quantitative approach to first identify temporal phases around disclosure during which symptoms of schizophrenia are likely to be significant. Then, to quantify behaviors before and after disclosures, we define linguistic measures drawing from literature on psycholinguistics and the socio-cognitive model of schizophrenia. Along with significant linguistic differences before and after disclosures, we find indications of therapeutic outcomes following disclosures, including improved readability and coherence in language, future orientation, lower self preoccupation, and reduced discussion of symptoms and stigma perceptions. We discuss the implications of social media as a new therapeutic tool in supporting disclosures of stigmatized conditions.},

We studied this naturally occurring experiment to investigate the impact of conversation threading on user retention as mediated by several potential changes in conversation structure and style. Our analysis shows that the design change made new users significantly more likely to comment a second time, and that this increased stickiness is due in part to a higher fraction of comments receiving responses after the design change. In mediation analysis, other anticipated mechanisms such as reciprocal exchanges and comment civility did not help to explain users' decision to return to the commenting system; indeed, civility did not increase after the design change and reciprocity declined. These analyses show that even simple design choices can have a significant impact on news forums' stickiness. Further, they suggest that this influence is more powerfully shaped by affordances---the new system made responding easier---than by changes in users' attention to social norms of reciprocity or civility. This has an array of implications for designers.},

By drawing on longitudinal data from a crowdsourced law reform, we show that people participated because they wanted to improve the law, learn, and solve problems. When crowdsourcing reached a saturation point, the motivation factors weakened and the crowd disengaged. Learning was the only factor that did not weaken. The participants learned while interacting with others, and the more actively the participants commented, the more likely they stayed engaged. Crowdsourced policymaking should thus be designed to support both epistemic and interactive aspects. While the crowd's motives were rooted in self-interest, their knowledge perspective showed common-good orientation, implying that rather than being dichotomous, motivation factors move on a continuum. The design of crowdsourced policymaking should support the dynamic nature of the process and the motivation factors driving it.},

abstract = {The Proceedings of the ACM (PACM) was initiated by ACM in 2015 as overarching framework for publishing high quality computer science research. The goal for these new journals is to provide an alternate journal publication model for rigorous research papers that have traditionally been presented at major ACM conferences. PACM titles cross multiple intellectual communities, and each separate PACM is designed to represent a broad, but consistent, reach area. This is the first issue of the Proceedings of the ACM on Human Computer Interaction (PACMHCI), which represents the varied topics and communities that compose the broader study of Human Computer Interaction (HCI). The rich heterogeneity of this field can be expressed as deep ethnographies of information use in context, to experiments showing the effectiveness of interface designs, to the production of new technologies that push the limits of how we interact with computers, and much more.The production of PACMHCI will focus on content associated with major research communities that are supported by the ACM Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI). Individual issues will be largely associated with separate research communities, who may then also select papers from the issue for presentation at their major conferences. These research communities provide the volunteers and editors necessary to provide the rigorous review and editorial process that will define this journal. Those editors will serve on the overall board for ACMHCI, to help bridge our diverse communities. Leveraging our research communities allows us to provide high-quality reviewing while maintaining the quick processing of work that is important in this quickly moving field.This inaugural issue of PACMHCI represents work from the Engineering Interactive Computing Systems (EICS) community. EICS gathers researchers that aim to improve the ways we build interactive systems. Building interactive systems is a multi-faceted and challenging activity, involving a plethora of different actors and roles. This is particularly true in the domain of HCI, where we continuously push the edge of what is possible, where there is a crucial need for adequate processes, tools and methods to build reliable, useful and usable systems that help people cope with the ever-increasing complexity of work and life. The primary goal of the EICS research community is to create novel and high quality contributions in this direction.Although there are only three articles in this first issue, our pipeline for future issues is promising. In the first submission cycle, 41 papers were submitted and, of those, 22 were asked for major revisions. We expect a good number of those 22 papers to be ultimately accepted over the coming months. We are grateful to our newly-formed Editorial Board consisting of more than 70 experts for lending their support and knowledge to the new journal.More information about PACMHCI can be found at http://pacmhci.acm.org/.},

abstract = {In this paper, an extended version of task models is discussed that allows detailed specifications of cooperative activities. Within the presented specification CoTaL (Cooperative Task Language), there exist two complementary types of task models called role model and team model. One or more instances of each role model describe the specific activities of actors. The team model represents joined activities and reflects progression in cooperation between role instances. For each scenario there exists one instance of the team model. Preconditions and events can be assigned to tasks and refer to one or all running instances of a role model. An event can be a starting or finishing trigger and is activated as result of task executions. Additionally, variables can be defined. They are bound within the specified context during runtime and get the value of the identifier of a certain role instance. In this way, communication and collaboration between different actors can be specified. Tasks of a team model cannot be performed directly but present the result of the execution of other (role) models only. However, a team model can restrict the execution of role model instances.It is shown how such models can be used to specify the activities in a smart meeting room. Snapshots of their simulation in CoTaSE (Cooperative Task Specification Environment) are presented. Additionally to the local implementation there exists an implementation in a cloud. It allows real cooperative executions of tasks.},

abstract = {Ensuring that an interactive application allows users to perform their activities and reach their goals is critical to the overall usability of the interactive application. Indeed, the effectiveness factor of usability directly refers to this capability. Assessing effectiveness is a real challenge for usability testing as usability tests only cover a very limited number of tasks and activities. This paper proposes an approach towards automated testing of effectiveness of interactive applications. To this end we resort to two main elements: an exhaustive description of users' activities and goals using task models, and the generation of scenarios (from the task models) to be tested over the application. However, the number of scenarios can be very high (beyond the computing capabilities of machines) and we might end up testing multiple similar scenarios. In order to overcome these problems, we propose strategies based on task models manipulations (e.g., manipulating task nodes, operator nodes, information...) resulting in a more intelligent test case generation approach. For each strategy, we investigate its relevance (both in terms of test case generation and in terms of validity compared to the original task models) and we illustrate it with a small example. Finally, the proposed strategies are applied on a real-size case study demonstrating their relevance and validity to test interactive applications.},

abstract = {Model-based development of interactive systems provides a number of benefits which can support the creation of robust and correct systems, particularly important when the interactive systems are safety-critical. Many different approaches have been proposed which target the models at different aspects of the development process (for example task analysis, interface layouts, functional behaviours etc.) and which can be used in different ways (verification of correctness, plasticity, usability).One of the aims for any modelling method should be simplicity - we are after all trying to hide complexity via abstraction in order to make reasoning about systems more tractable than working at the programming level. One of the challenges that exists however we do our modelling is ensuring the consistency between the model of the interface and interactivity and model of the functional behaviour of the system. This is primarily due to the different types of models that most naturally describe these different elements. In this paper we propose a method of tightening the integration of models of these different components of the system by generating obligations which explicitly describe the coupling of functional behaviour with interactive elements. We then show how these obligations can be used to support the development process during the programming and testing of the system.},

In this paper, we present COPSE: a novel and unique software framework for instantiating Microworlds as collaborative problem solving activities on tangible tabletop interfaces. The framework provides three types of building blocks: widgets (provide input and localized feedback), equations (define the model), and scenes (visualize feedback), which can be specified in the form of structured text. Aim of COPSE is to simplify processes of creating, adjusting, and reusing custom Microworlds scenarios. We describe the structure of the framework, provide an example of a scenario, and report on a case study where we have used COPSE together with 33 teachers to build new scenarios on the fly.},

When we, for example, enter our daily calorie intake or calculate our ecological footprint, we often have to guess the weight of the food or what distance we have covered with our car. In this paper, we propose a solution to overcome the problem of forcing users to enter a single value when they are unsure about the actual input. On the basis of a slider, we designed four input controls which allow the input of uncertain data in the form of probability distribution functions. To evaluate our input controls, we conducted two studies collecting subjective and objective feedback. Based on the evaluation, we derived implications for their usage. We additionally provide an open-source toolkit with the evaluated input controls that can be included in web applications and customized for different contexts and tasks.},

abstract = {This paper presents a model-based approach for designing Polymodal Menus, a new type of multimodal adaptive menu for small screen graphical user interfaces where item selection and adaptivity are responsive to more than one interaction modality: a menu item can be selected graphically, tactilely, vocally, gesturally, or any combination of them. The prediction window containing the most predicted menu items by assignment, equivalence, or redundancy is made equally adaptive. For this purpose, an adaptive menu model maintains the most predictable menu items according to various prediction methods. This model is exploited throughout various steps defined on a new Adaptivity Design Space based on a Perception-Decision-Action cycle com-ing from cognitive psychology. A user experiment compares four conditions of Polymodal Menus (graphical, vocal, gestural, and mixed) in terms of menu selection time, error rate, user subjective satisfaction and user preference, when item prediction has a low or high level of accuracy. Polymodal Menus offer alternative input/output modalities to select menu items in various contexts of use, especially when graphical modality is constrained.},

abstract = {Visual analytics applications (VAApps) rely heavily on visual representations and notations to communicate information and support user interaction. The visual representations themselves are the main communication form used by designers, reflecting their interpretation of what data aspects should be highlighted and how users can explore the data. Ultimately, the combination of representation and interactivity guides the user's data analysis in VAApp. To keep the VAApp development centered in their users, the design team must pay special attention to the visual representations and their underlying interaction mechanisms. Our team is developing HistoryViewer, a VAApp itself for users to explore log data obtained from interactions with other ("source") VAApps (VAAppsrc). During the development of HistoryViewer and the instrumentation of a VAAppsrc, we noticed unanticipated benefits for the development of the VAAppsrc itself. This paper presents our HistoryViewer system, proposes an architecture for VAApps integrated with our log model, discussing some ancillary benefits of such instrumentation. Finally, it reports two empirical studies conducted to gather potential users' opinions about HistoryViewer, which revealed positive attitudes towards the system and pointed to opportunities for improvement.},

abstract = {The design of user interfaces (UIs), such as World Wide Web pages, usually consists in a human designer mapping one particular problem (e.g., the demands of a customer) to one particular solution (i.e., the UI). In this article, a technology based on Genetic Programming is proposed to automate critical parts of the design process. In this approach, designers are supposed to define basic content elements and ways to combine them, which are then automatically composed and tested with real users by a genetic algorithm in order to find optimized compositions. Such a strategy enables the exploration of large design state-spaces in a systematic manner, hence going beyond traditional A/B testing approaches. In relation to similar techniques also based on genetic algorithms, this system has the advantage of being more general, providing the basis of an overall programmatic UI design workflow, and of calculating the fitness of solutions incrementally. To illustrate and evaluate the approach, an experiment based on the optimization of landing pages is provided. The empirical result obtained, though preliminary, is statistically significant and corroborates the hypothesis that the technique works.},

abstract = {Building multi-touch multi-user applications for Shared Interactive Surfaces is a complex endeavour that requires fundamental knowledge in touch enabling hardware, gesture recognition, graphical representation of digital information and multi-user interaction. While several specialised toolkits help developers in this effort, we identified a variety of challenges with these toolkits, as for example the lack of cross-platform support, the limited number of touch-enabled multi-user widgets, missing documentation, and lacking community support -- all raising the barriers to entry. In this paper, we present TUIOFX, a toolkit for developing multi-touch, multi-user applications for Shared Interactive Surfaces in Java, which tackles all of the identified problems. The sophisticated implementation of TUIOFX adds support for TUIO-enabled hardware and multi-user interaction under the hood of JavaFX, and leaves the well-learned JavaFX API for the developers fully intact -- thus allowing particularly novices a very quick start. In this paper we provide the technical insights, in the concepts and their elegant implementation.},

Unfortunately, detailed insight into users' interaction behaviour still requires a high degree of expertise and domain specific knowledge. We present WevQuery, a scalable system to query user interaction logs in order to allow designers to test their hypotheses about users' behaviour. WevQuery supports this purpose using a graphical notation to define the interaction patterns designers are seeking. WevQuery is scalable as the queries can then be executed against large user interaction datasets by employing the MapReduce paradigm. This way WevQuery provides designers effortless access to harvest users' interaction patterns, removing the burden of low-level interaction data analysis. We present two scenarios to showcase the potential of WevQuery, from the design of the queries to their execution on real interaction data accounting for 5.7m events generated by 2,445 unique users.},

In order to increase user satisfaction and acceptance, these context-aware solutions should be controllable by end users. Over the last few years we have therefore seen an emerging trend towards visual programming tools for context-aware applications based on simple "IF this THEN that" rules. However, existing solutions often do not support the simple reuse of the "this" part in order to define more sophisticated rules. Given that the desired level of control varies among individuals, we propose a unified multi-layered context modelling approach distinguishing between end users, expert users and programmers. Our Context Modelling Toolkit (CMT) consists of the necessary context modelling concepts and offers a rule-based context processing engine. We further illustrate how end users and expert users might interact with the CMT framework. Finally, we highlight some advantages of our Context Modelling Toolkit by discussing a number of use cases.},

We propose an ergonomic hand- mapping model for digital puppetry, based on the human hand anatomy and biomechanics, adapting tradi- tional puppetry methods. A cinematic virtual puppetry application was developed supporting distinct in- teraction styles based on the hand dexterity skills. An experiment using the Leap Motion controller was conducted to evaluate the hand mapping feasibility. The participants considered that the proposed interface provides a good level of directness. Furthermore, a custom interface for smartphones was combined with the application to extend the puppet manipulation and show control operations.},
