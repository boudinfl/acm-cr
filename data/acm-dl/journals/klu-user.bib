abstract = {This paper describes an exploratory investigation into the feasibility of predictive analytics of user behavioral data as a possible aid in developing effective user models for adaptive cybersecurity. Partial least squares structural equation modeling is applied to the domain of cybersecurity by collecting data on users' attitude towards digital security, and analyzing how that influences their adoption and usage of technological security controls. Bayesian-network modeling is then applied to integrate the behavioral variables with simulated sensory data and/or logs from a web browsing session and other empirical data gathered to support personalized adaptive cybersecurity decision-making. Results from the empirical study show that predictive analytics is feasible in the context of behavioral cybersecurity, and can aid in the generation of useful heuristics for the design and development of adaptive cybersecurity mechanisms. Predictive analytics can also aid in encoding digital security behavioral knowledge that can support the adaptation and/or automation of operations in the domain of cybersecurity. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the techniques applied to extract input data for the Bayesian-based models for personalized adaptive cybersecurity assistance.},

abstract = {A user of a recommender system is more likely to be satisfied by one or more of the recommendations if each individual recommendation is relevant to her but additionally if the set of recommendations is diverse. The most common approach to recommendation diversification uses re-ranking: the recommender system scores a set of candidate items for relevance to the user; it then re-ranks the candidates so that the subset that it will recommend achieves a balance between relevance and diversity. Ordinarily, we expect a trade-off between relevance and diversity: the diversity of the set of recommendations increases by including items that have lower relevance scores but which are different from the items already in the set. In early work, the diversity of a set of recommendations was given by the average of their distances from one another, according to some semantic distance metric defined on item features such as movie genres. More recent intent-aware diversification methods formulate diversity in terms of coverage and relevance of aspects. The aspects are most commonly defined in terms of item features. By trying to ensure that the aspects of a set of recommended items cover the aspects of the items in the user's profile, the level of diversity is more personalized. In offline experiments on pre-collected datasets, intent-aware diversification using item features as aspects sometimes defies the relevance/diversity trade-off: there are configurations in which the recommendations exhibits increases in both relevance and diversity. In this paper, we present a new form of intent-aware diversification, which we call SPAD (Subprofile-Aware Diversification), and a variant called RSPAD (Relevance-based SPAD). In SPAD, the aspects are not item features; they are subprofiles of the user's profile. We present and compare a number of different ways to extract subprofiles from a user's profile. None of them is defined in terms of item features. Therefore, SPAD is useful even in domains where item features are not available or are of low quality. On three pre-collected datasets from three different domains (movies, music artists and books), we compare SPAD and RSPAD to intent-aware methods in which aspects are item features. We find on these datasets that SPAD and RSPAD suffer even less from the relevance/diversity trade-off: across all three datasets, they increase both relevance and diversity for even more configurations than other approaches to diversification. Moreover, we find that SPAD and RSPAD are the most accurate systems across all three datasets.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present the development and validation of an instrument for measuring users' gameful experience while using a service. Either intentionally or unintentionally, systems and services are becoming increasingly gamified and having a gameful experience is progressively important for the user's overall experience of a service. Gamification refers to the transformation of technology to become more game-like, with the intention of evoking similar positive experiences and motivations that games do (the gameful experience) and affecting user behavior. In this study, we used a mixed-methods approach to develop an instrument for measuring the gameful experience. In a first qualitative study, we developed a model of the gameful experience using data from a questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions posed to users of Zombies, Run!, Duolingo, and Nike+?Run Club. In a second study, we developed the instrument and evaluated its dimensionality and psychometric properties using data from users of Zombies, Run! (N?=?371). Based on the results of this second study, we further developed the instrument in a third study using data from users of Duolingo (N?=?507), in which we repeated the assessment of dimensionality and psychometric properties, this time including confirmation of the model. As a result of this work, we devised GAMEFULQUEST, an instrument that can be used to model and measure an individual user's gameful experience in systems and services, which can be used for user-adapted gamification and for informing user-modeling research within a gamification context.},

Personalized systems that adapt to end users should take into account the user's personality to perform well. Several methodologies (e.g. User-as-Wizard, indirect studies) that use personality adaptation require first for personality to be conveyed to the participant; this has few validated approaches. Furthermore, measuring personality is often time consuming, prone to response bias (e.g. using questionnaires) or data intensive (e.g. using behaviour or text mining). This paper presents a methodology for creating and validating stories to convey psychological traits and for using such stories with a personality slider scale to measure these traits. We present the validation of the scale and evaluate its reliability. To evidence the validity of the methodology, we outline studies where the stories and scale have been effectively applied (in recommender systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and persuasive systems).},

abstract = {As of today, most movie recommendation services base their recommendations on collaborative filtering (CF) and/or content-based filtering (CBF) models that use metadata (e.g., genre or cast). In most video-on-demand and streaming services, however, new movies and TV series are continuously added. CF models are unable to make predictions in such a scenario, since the newly added videos lack interactions--a problem technically known as new item cold start (CS). Currently, the most common approach to this problem is to switch to a purely CBF method, usually by exploiting textual metadata. This approach is known to have lower accuracy than CF because it ignores useful collaborative information and relies on human-generated textual metadata, which are expensive to collect and often prone to errors. User-generated content, such as tags, can also be rare or absent in CS situations. In this paper, we introduce a new movie recommender system that addresses the new item problem in the movie domain by (i) integrating state-of-the-art audio and visual descriptors, which can be automatically extracted from video content and constitute what we call the movie genome; (ii) exploiting an effective data fusion method named canonical correlation analysis, which was successfully tested in our previous works Deldjoo et al. (in: International Conference on Electronic Commerce and Web Technologies. Springer, Berlin, pp 34---45, 2016b; Proceedings of the Twelfth ACM Conference on Recommender Systems. ACM, 2018b), to better exploit complementary information between different modalities; (iii) proposing a two-step hybrid approach which trains a CF model on warm items (items with interactions) and leverages the learned model on the movie genome to recommend cold items (items without interactions). Experimental validation is carried out using a system-centric study on a large-scale, real-world movie recommendation dataset both in an absolute cold start and in a cold to warm transition; and a user-centric online experiment measuring different subjective aspects, such as satisfaction and diversity. Results show the benefits of this approach compared to existing approaches.},

abstract = {Providing relevant personalized recommendations for new users is one of the major challenges in recommender systems. This problem, known as the user cold start has been approached from different perspectives. In particular, cross-domain recommendation methods exploit data from source domains to address the lack of user preferences in a target domain. Most of the cross-domain approaches proposed so far follow the paradigm of collaborative filtering, and avoid analyzing the contents of the items, which are usually highly heterogeneous in the cross-domain setting. Content-based filtering, however, has been successfully applied in domains where item content and metadata play a key role. Such domains are not limited to scenarios where items do have text contents (e.g., books, news articles, scientific papers, and web pages), and where text mining and information retrieval techniques are often used. Potential application domains include those where items have associated metadata, e.g., genres, directors and actors for movies, and music styles, composers and themes for songs. With the advent of the Semantic Web, and its reference implementation Linked Data, a plethora of structured, interlinked metadata is available on the Web. These metadata represent a potential source of information to be exploited by content-based and hybrid filtering approaches. Motivated by the use of Linked Data for recommendation purposes, in this paper we present and evaluate a number of matrix factorization models for cross-domain collaborative filtering that leverage metadata as a bridge between items liked by users in different domains. We show that in case the underlying knowledge graph connects items from different domains and then in situations that benefit from cross-domain information, our models can provide better recommendations to new users while keeping a good trade-off between recommendation accuracy and diversity.},

abstract = {Music recommender systems have become a key technology to support the interaction of users with the increasingly larger music catalogs of on-line music streaming services, on-line music shops, and personal devices. An important task in music recommender systems is the automated continuation of music playlists, that enables the recommendation of music streams adapting to given (possibly short) listening sessions. Previous works have shown that applying collaborative filtering to collections of curated music playlists reveals underlying playlist-song co-occurrence patterns that are useful to predict playlist continuations. However, most music collections exhibit a pronounced long-tailed distribution. The majority of songs occur only in few playlists and, as a consequence, they are poorly represented by collaborative filtering. We introduce two feature-combination hybrid recommender systems that extend collaborative filtering by integrating the collaborative information encoded in curated music playlists with any type of song feature vector representation. We conduct off-line experiments to assess the performance of the proposed systems to recover withheld playlist continuations, and we compare them to competitive pure and hybrid collaborative filtering baselines. The results of the experiments indicate that the introduced feature-combination hybrid recommender systems can more accurately predict fitting playlist continuations as a result of their improved representation of songs occurring in few playlists.},

abstract = {In popular applications such as e-commerce sites and social media, users provide online reviews giving personal opinions about a wide array of items, such as products, services and people. These reviews are usually in the form of free text, and represent a rich source of information about the users' preferences. Among the information elements that can be extracted from reviews, opinions about particular item aspects (i.e., characteristics, attributes or components) have been shown to be effective for user modeling and personalized recommendation. In this paper, we investigate the aspect-based top-N recommendation problem by separately addressing three tasks, namely identifying references to item aspects in user reviews, classifying the sentiment orientation of the opinions about such aspects in the reviews, and exploiting the extracted aspect opinion information to provide enhanced recommendations. Differently to previous work, we integrate and empirically evaluate several state-of-the-art and novel methods for each of the above tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on standard datasets and several domains, analyzing distinct recommendation quality metrics and characteristics of the datasets, domains and extracted aspects. As a result of our investigation, we not only derive conclusions about which combination of methods is most appropriate according to the above issues, but also provide a number of valuable resources for opinion mining and recommendation purposes, such as domain aspect vocabularies and domain-dependent, aspect-level lexicons.},

Human emotions are widely regarded as important predictors of behavior and preference. They are a crucial factor in decision making, but until recently, relatively little has been known about the effectiveness of using human emotions in personalizing real-world recommender systems. In this paper we introduce the Emotion Aware Recommender System (EARS), a large scale system for recommending news items using user's self-assessed emotional reactions. Our original contribution includes the formulation of a multi-dimensional model of emotions for news item recommendations, introduction of affective item features that can be used to describe recommended items, construction of affective similarity measures, and validation of the EARS on a large corpus of real-world Web traffic. We collect over 13,000,000 page views from 2,700,000 unique users of two news sites and we gather over 160,000 emotional reactions to 85,000 news articles. We discover that incorporating pleasant emotions into collaborative filtering recommendations consistently outperforms all other algorithms. We also find that targeting recommendations by selected emotional reactions presents a promising direction for further research. As an additional contribution we share our experiences in designing and developing a real-world emotion-based recommendation engine, pointing to various challenges posed by the practical aspects of deploying emotion-based recommenders.},

Although there is a large body of research in areas such as movies or music, artwork recommendation has received comparatively little attention, despite the continuous growth of the artwork market. Most previous research has relied on ratings and metadata, and a few recent works have exploited visual features extracted with deep neural networks (DNN) to recommend digital art. In this work, we contribute to the area of content-based artwork recommendation of physical paintings by studying the impact of the aforementioned features (artwork metadata, neural visual features), as well as manually-engineered visual features, such as naturalness, brightness and contrast. We implement and evaluate our method using transactional data from UGallery.com, an online artwork store. Our results show that artwork recommendations based on a hybrid combination of artist preference, curated attributes, deep neural visual features and manually-engineered visual features produce the best performance. Moreover, we discuss the trade-off between automatically obtained DNN features and manually-engineered visual features for the purpose of explainability, as well as the impact of user profile size on predictions. Our research informs the development of next-generation content-based artwork recommenders which rely on different types of data, from text to multimedia.},

The overall architecture is applied on data collected from actual visits to the archaeological sites of Gournia and \c{C}atalh\"{o}y\"{u}k and extensive analysis on visitor movement patterns follows, especially in comparison to the curated paths in the aforementioned sites.

Considering that people differ in the way they perceive, process, and recall information and that their individual cognitive differences influence their experience, performance, and knowledge acquisition when performing cultural-heritage activities, the human-cognition factor should be considered as an important personalization factor within cultural-heritage contexts. To this end, we propose a cognition-centered personalization framework for delivering cultural-heritage activities, tailored to the users' cognitive characteristics. The framework implements rule-based personalization algorithms that are based on cognition-centered user models that are created implicitly, transparently, and in run-time based on classifiers that correlate end-user cognitive characteristics with interaction and visual behavior patterns. For evaluating the proposed framework and improving the external validity of the experimental results, we conducted two eye-tracking between-subjects user-studies ($$N=226$$N=226) covering two different cognitive styles (field dependence---independence and visualizer---verbalizer) and two different types of cultural activity (visual goal-oriented and visual exploratory). The results provide evidence about the applicability, effectiveness, and efficiency of the proposed framework and underpin the added value of adopting cognition-centered personalization frameworks within digitized cultural-heritage interaction contexts.},

abstract = {In this article, we describe a hybrid recommender system (RS) in the artistic and cultural heritage area, which takes into account the activities on social media performed by the target user and her friends, and takes advantage of linked open data (LOD) sources. Concretely, the proposed RS (1) extracts information from Facebook by analyzing content generated by users and their friends; (2) performs disambiguation tasks through LOD tools; (3) profiles the active user as a social graph; (4) provides her with personalized suggestions of artistic and cultural resources in the surroundings of the user's current location. The last point is performed by integrating collaborative filtering algorithms with semantic technologies in order to leverage LOD sources such as DBpedia and Europeana. Based on the recommended points of cultural interest, the proposed system is also able to suggest to the active user itineraries among them, which meet her preferences and needs and are sensitive to her physical and social contexts as well. Experimental results on real users showed the effectiveness of the different modules of the proposed recommender.},

abstract = {This paper presents an authoring environment, which supports cultural heritage professionals in the process of creating and deploying a wide range of different personalised interactive experiences that combine the physical (objects, collection and spaces) and the digital (multimedia content). It is based on a novel flexible formalism that represents the content and the context as independent from one another and allows recombining them in multiple ways thus generating many different interactions from the same elements. The authoring environment was developed in a co-design process with heritage stakeholders and addresses the composition of the content, the definition of the personalisation, and the deployment on a physical configuration of bespoke devices. To simplify the editing while maintaining a powerful representation, the complex creation process is deconstructed into a limited number of elements and phases, including aspects to control personalisation both in content and in interaction. The user interface also includes examples of installations for inspiration and as a means for learning what is possible and how to do it. Throughout the paper, installations in public exhibitions are used to illustrate our points and what our authoring environment can produce. The expressiveness of the formalism and the variety of interactive experiences that could be created was assessed via a range of laboratory tests, while a user-centred evaluation with over 40 cultural heritage professionals assessed whether they feel confident in directly controlling personalisation.},

To this end, objects are linked to semantic structures that represent relations between cultural heritage concepts. The user profile is described in terms of cultural heritage interests.

In Study 1, participants in Finland ($$N=879$$N=879) responded to a 52-item version of GAIN. An exploratory factor analysis was used to identify five latent factors of gameplay activity appreciation: Aggression, Management, Exploration, Coordination, and Caretaking. In Study 2, respondents in Canada ($$N=1322$$N=1322) and Japan ($$N=1178$$N=1178) responded to GAIN, and the factor structure of a 15-item version was examined using a Confirmatory Factor Analysis. The results showed that the short version of GAIN has good construct validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity in Japan and in Canada. We demonstrated the usefulness of GAIN by conducting a cluster analysis to identify player types that differ in both demographics and game choice. GAIN can be used in research as a tool for investigating player profiles. Game companies, publishers and analysts can utilize GAIN in player-centric game development and targeted marketing and in generating personalized game recommendations.},

Specifically, we conducted a survey that elicits users' ratings of devices in isolation and devices in the context of tasks potentially performed by these devices. Our study led to insights about users' attitudes towards devices in isolation and in the context of tasks, and about the influence of demographic factors and factors pertaining to technical expertise and experience with devices on users' attitudes. The insights about users' attitudes provided the basis for two recommendation approaches based on principal components analysis (PCA) that alleviate the new-user and new-item problems: (1) employing latent features identified by PCA to predict ratings given by existing users to new devices, and by new users to existing devices; and (2) identifying a relatively small set of key questions on the basis of PCs, whose answers account to a large extent for new users' ratings of devices in isolation and in the context of tasks. Our results show that taking into account latent features of devices, and asking a relatively small number of key questions about devices in the context of tasks, lead to rating predictions that are significantly more accurate than global and demographic predictions, and substantially reduce prediction error, eventually matching the performance of strong baselines.},

abstract = {Recommender systems help users find relevant items of interest, for example on e-commerce or media streaming sites. Most academic research is concerned with approaches that personalize the recommendations according to long-term user profiles. In many real-world applications, however, such long-term profiles often do not exist and recommendations therefore have to be made solely based on the observed behavior of a user during an ongoing session. Given the high practical relevance of the problem, an increased interest in this problem can be observed in recent years, leading to a number of proposals for session-based recommendation algorithms that typically aim to predict the user's immediate next actions. In this work, we present the results of an in-depth performance comparison of a number of such algorithms, using a variety of datasets and evaluation measures. Our comparison includes the most recent approaches based on recurrent neural networks like gru4rec, factorized Markov model approaches such as fism or fossil, as well as simpler methods based, e.g., on nearest neighbor schemes. Our experiments reveal that algorithms of this latter class, despite their sometimes almost trivial nature, often perform equally well or significantly better than today's more complex approaches based on deep neural networks. Our results therefore suggest that there is substantial room for improvement regarding the development of more sophisticated session-based recommendation algorithms.},

In this survey, we review user modeling strategies with respect to inferring user interests from previous studies. To this end, we focus on four dimensions of inferring user interest profiles: (1) data collection, (2) representation of user interest profiles, (3) construction and enhancement of user interest profiles, and (4) the evaluation of the constructed profiles. Through this survey, we aim to provide an overview of state-of-the-art user modeling strategies for inferring user interest profiles on microblogging social networks with respect to the four dimensions. For each dimension, we review and summarize previous studies based on specified criteria. Finally, we discuss some challenges and opportunities for future work in this research domain.},

abstract = {In recent years, diversity has attracted increasing attention in the field of recommender systems because of its ability of catching users' various interests by providing a set of dissimilar items. There are few endeavors to personalize the recommendation diversity being tailored to individual users' diversity needs. However, they mainly depend on users' behavior history such as ratings to customize diversity, which has two limitations: (1) They neglect taking into account a user's needs that are inherently caused by some personal factors such as personality; (2) they fail to work well for new users who have little behavior history. In order to address these issues, this paper proposes a generalized, dynamic personality-based greedy re-ranking approach to generating the recommendation list. On one hand, personality is used to estimate each user's diversity preference. On the other hand, personality is leveraged to alleviate the cold-start problem of collaborative filtering recommendations. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms related methods (including both non-diversity-oriented and diversity-oriented methods) in terms of metrics measuring recommendation accuracy and personalized diversity degree, especially in the cold-start setting.},

We critically survey work across each category, providing data on the raw data source, feature engineering, statistical model, evaluation method, prediction architecture, and other aspects of these experiments. Such a review is particularly useful given the rapid expansion of predictive modeling research in MOOCs since the emergence of major MOOC platforms in 2012. This survey reveals several key methodological gaps, which include extensive filtering of experimental subpopulations, ineffective student model evaluation, and the use of experimental data which would be unavailable for real-world student success prediction and intervention, which is the ultimate goal of such models. Finally, we highlight opportunities for future research, which include temporal modeling, research bridging predictive and explanatory student models, work which contributes to learning theory, and evaluating long-term learner success in MOOCs.},

abstract = {Recommender Systems have to deal with a wide variety of users and user types that express their preferences in different ways. This difference in user behavior can have a profound impact on the performance of the recommender system. Users receive better (or worse) recommendations depending on the quantity and the quality of the information the system knows about them. Specifically, the inconsistencies in users' preferences impose a lower bound on the error the system may achieve when predicting ratings for one particular user--this is referred to as the magic barrier. In this work, we present a mathematical characterization of the magic barrier based on the assumption that user ratings are afflicted with inconsistencies--noise. Furthermore, we propose a measure of the consistency of user ratings (rating coherence) that predicts the performance of recommendation methods. More specifically, we show that user coherence is correlated with the magic barrier; we exploit this correlation to discriminate between easy users (those with a lower magic barrier) and difficult ones (those with a higher magic barrier). We report experiments where the recommendation error for the more coherent users is lower than that of the less coherent ones. We further validate these results by using two public datasets, where the necessary data to identify the magic barrier is not available, in which we obtain similar performance improvements.},

abstract = {The conflicting evidence in the literature on energy feedback as a driver for energy behaviour change has lead to the realization that it is a complex problem and that interventions must be proposed and evaluated in the context of a tangled web of individual and societal factors. We put forward an integrated agent-based computational model of energy consumption behaviour change interventions based on personal values and energy literacy, informed by research in persuasive technologies, environmental, educational and cognitive psychology, sociology, and energy education. Our objectives are: (i) to build a framework to accommodate a rich variety of models that might impact consumption decisions, (ii) to use the simulation as a means to evaluate persuasive technologies in-silico prior to deployment. The model novelty lies in its capacity to connect the determinants of energy related behaviour (values, energy literacy and social practices) and several generic design strategies proposed in the area of persuasive technologies within one framework. We validate the framework using survey data and personal value and energy consumption data extracted from a 2-year field study in Exeter, UK. The preliminary evaluation results demonstrate that the model can predict energy saving behaviour much better than a random model and can correctly estimate the effect of persuasive technologies. The model can be embedded into an adaptive decision-making system for energy behaviour change.},

The personality characteristics and design preferences of 87 students (37 male, and 50 female) were collected and analysed. The clustering result (using k-means algorithm) revealed two potential personality types, which we call the neuroticism and the extra-conscientiousness groups. Then, an interface was designed for each personality group using the association rules method. An eye-tracking device was used to record changes in participants' eye-pupil diameter and fixation duration, and thus examine their cognitive load and attention. The participants' eye movement data of each group showed that their visual experience was significantly improved when using the interface designed based on their personality characteristics.

abstract = {Systems and services we employ in our daily life have increasingly been augmented with motivational designs which fall under the classes of (1) gamification, (2) quantified-self and (3) social networking features that aim to help users reach their goals via motivational enforcement. However, users differ in terms of their orientation and focus toward goals and in terms of the attributes of their goals. Therefore, different classes of motivational design may have a differential fit for users. Being able to distinguish the goal profiles of users, motivational design could be better tailored. Therefore, in this study we investigate how different goal foci (outcome and focus), goals orientation (mastery, proving, and avoiding), and goal attributes (specificity and difficulty) are associated with perceived importance of gamification, social networking and quantified-self features. We employ survey data ($$mathrm{N}=167$$N=167) from users of HeiaHeia; a popular exercise encouragement app. Results indicate that goal-setting related factors of users and attributes of goals are connected with users' preference over motivational design classes. In particular, the results reveal that being outcome-focused is associated with positive evaluations of gamification and quantified-self design classes. Users with higher proving-orientation perceived gamification and social networking design classes as more important, users with lower goal avoidance-orientation perceived social networking design as more important, whereas users with higher mastery-orientation perceived quantified-self design more important. Users with difficult goals were less likely to perceive gamification and social networking design important, whereas for users with high goal specificity quantified-self features were important. The findings provide insights for the automatic adaptation of motivational designs to users' goals. However, more research is naturally needed to further investigate generalizability of the results.},

abstract = {Moving between devices is omnipresent, but not for people with disabilities or those who require specific accessibility options. Setting up assistive technologies or finding settings to overcome a certain barrier can be a demanding task for people without technical skills. Context-sensitive adaptive user interfaces are advancing, although migrating access features from one device to another is very rarely addressed. In this paper, we describe the knowledge-based component of the Global Public Inclusive Infrastructure that infers how a device shall be best configured at the operating system layer, the application layer and the web layer to meet the requirements of a user including possible special needs or disabilities. In this regard, a mechanism to detect and resolve conflicting accessibility policies as well as recommending preference substitutes is a main requirement, as elaborated in this paper. As the proposed system emulates decision-making of accessibility experts, we validated the automatic deduced configurations against manual configurations of ten accessibility experts. The assessment result shows that the average matching score of the developed system is high. Thus, the proposed system can be considered capable of making precise decisions towards personalizing user interfaces based on user needs and preferences.},

abstract = {With the recent advances in the field of artificial intelligence, an increasing number of decision-making tasks are delegated to software systems. A key requirement for the success and adoption of such systems is that users must trust system choices or even fully automated decisions. To achieve this, explanation facilities have been widely investigated as a means of establishing trust in these systems since the early years of expert systems. With today's increasingly sophisticated machine learning algorithms, new challenges in the context of explanations, accountability, and trust towards such systems constantly arise. In this work, we systematically review the literature on explanations in advice-giving systems. This is a family of systems that includes recommender systems, which is one of the most successful classes of advice-giving software in practice. We investigate the purposes of explanations as well as how they are generated, presented to users, and evaluated. As a result, we derive a novel comprehensive taxonomy of aspects to be considered when designing explanation facilities for current and future decision support systems. The taxonomy includes a variety of different facets, such as explanation objective, responsiveness, content and presentation. Moreover, we identified several challenges that remain unaddressed so far, for example related to fine-grained issues associated with the presentation of explanations and how explanation facilities are evaluated.},

abstract = {Many e-commerce sites present additional item recommendations to their visitors while they navigate the site, and ample evidence exists that such recommendations are valuable for both customers and providers. Academic research often focuses on the capability of recommender systems to help users discover items they presumably do not know yet and which match their long-term preference profiles. In reality, however, recommendations can be helpful for customers also for other reasons, for example, when they remind them of items they were recently interested in or when they point site visitors to items that are currently discounted. In this work, we first adopt a systematic statistical approach to analyze what makes recommendations effective in practice and then propose ways of operationalizing these insights into novel recommendation algorithms. Our data analysis is based on log data of a large e-commerce site. It shows that various factors should be considered in parallel when selecting items for recommendation, including their match with the customer's shopping interests in the previous sessions, the general popularity of the items in the last few days, as well as information about discounts. Based on these analyses we propose a novel algorithm that combines a neighborhood-based scheme with a deep neural network to predict the relevance of items for a given shopping session.},

abstract = {Personalised content adaptation has great potential to increase user engagement in video games. Procedural generation of user-tailored content increases the self-motivation of players as they immerse themselves in the virtual world. An adaptive user model is needed to capture the skills of the player and enable automatic game content altering algorithms to fit the individual user. We propose an adaptive user modelling approach using a combination of unobtrusive physiological data to identify strengths and weaknesses in user performance in car racing games. Our system creates user-tailored tracks to improve driving habits and user experience, and to keep engagement at high levels. The user modelling approach adopts concepts from the Trace Theory framework; it uses machine learning to extract features from the user's physiological data and game-related actions, and cluster them into low level primitives. These primitives are transformed and evaluated into higher level abstractions such as experience, exploration and attention. These abstractions are subsequently used to provide track alteration decisions for the player. Collection of data and feedback from 52 users allowed us to associate key model variables and outcomes to user responses, and to verify that the model provides statistically significant decisions personalised to the individual player. Tailored game content variations between users in our experiments, as well as the correlations with user satisfaction demonstrate that our algorithm is able to automatically incorporate user feedback in subsequent procedural content generation.},

abstract = {Rehabilitative therapy is usually very expensive and confined to specialized rehabilitation centers or hospitals, leading to slower recovery times for corresponding patients. Therefore, there is a high demand for the development of technology-based personalized solutions to guide and encourage patients towards performing online rehabilitation program that can help them live independently at home. This paper introduces an innovative e-health framework that develops adaptive serious games for people with hand disabilities. The aim of this work is to provide a patient-adaptive environment for the gamification of hand therapies in order to facilitate and encourage rehabilitation issues. Theoretical foundations (i.e., therapy and patient models) and algorithms to match therapy-based hand gestures to navigational movements in 3D space within the serious game environment have been developed. A novel game generation module is introduced, which translates those movements into a 3D therapy-driven route on a real-world map and with different levels of difficulty based on the patient profile and capabilities. In order to enrich the user navigation experience, a 3D spatio-temporal validation region is also generated, which tracks and adjusts the patient movements throughout the session. The gaming environment also creates and adds semantics to different types of attractive and repellent objects in space depending on the difficulty level of the game. Relevant benchmarks to assess the patient interaction with the environment along with a usability and performance testing of our framework are introduced to ensure quantitative as well as qualitative improvements. Trial tests in one disability center were conducted with a total number of five subjects, having hand motor controls problems, who used our gamified physiotherapy solution to help us in measuring the usability and users' satisfaction levels. The obtained results and feedback from therapists and patients are very encouraging.},

abstract = {MobiGuide is a ubiquitous, distributed and personalized evidence-based decision-support system (DSS) used by patients and their care providers. Its central DSS applies computer-interpretable clinical guidelines (CIGs) to provide real-time patient-specific and personalized recommendations by matching CIG knowledge with a highly-adaptive patient model, the parameters of which are stored in a personal health record (PHR). The PHR integrates data from hospital medical records, mobile biosensors, data entered by patients, and recommendations and abstractions output by the DSS. CIGs are customized to consider the patients' psycho-social context and their preferences; shared decision making is supported via decision trees instantiated with patient utilities. The central DSS "projects" personalized CIG-knowledge to a mobile DSS operating on the patients' smart phones that applies that knowledge locally. In this paper we explain the knowledge elicitation and specification methodologies that we have developed for making CIGs patient-centered and enabling their personalization. We then demonstrate feasibility, in two very different clinical domains, and two different geographic sites, as part of a multi-national feasibility study, of the full architecture that we have designed and implemented. We analyze usage patterns and opinions collected via questionnaires of the 10 atrial fibrillation (AF) and 20 gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) patients and their care providers. The analysis is guided by three hypotheses concerning the effect of the personal patient model on patients and clinicians' behavior and on patients' satisfaction. The results demonstrate the sustainable usage of the system by patients and their care providers and patients' satisfaction, which stems mostly from their increased sense of safety. The system has affected the behavior of clinicians, which have inspected the patients' models between scheduled visits, resulting in change of diagnosis for two of the ten AF patients and anticipated change in therapy for eleven of the twenty GDM patients.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design and ecologically valid evaluation of a learner model that lies at the heart of an intelligent learning environment called iTalk2Learn. A core objective of the learner model is to adapt formative feedback based on students' affective states. Types of adaptation include what type of formative feedback should be provided and how it should be presented. Two Bayesian networks trained with data gathered in a series of Wizard-of-Oz studies are used for the adaptation process. This paper reports results from a quasi-experimental evaluation, in authentic classroom settings, which compared a version of iTalk2Learn that adapted feedback based on students' affective states as they were talking aloud with the system (the affect condition) with one that provided feedback based only on the students' performance (the non-affect condition). Our results suggest that affect-aware support contributes to reducing boredom and off-task behavior, and may have an effect on learning. We discuss the internal and ecological validity of the study, in light of pedagogical considerations that informed the design of the two conditions. Overall, the results of the study have implications both for the design of educational technology and for classroom approaches to teaching, because they highlight the important role that affect-aware modelling plays in the adaptive delivery of formative feedback to support learning.},

abstract = {Learner modeling has been used in computer-based learning environments to model learners' domain knowledge, cognitive skills, and interests, and customize their experiences in the environment based on this information. In this paper, we develop a learner modeling and adaptive scaffolding framework for Computational Thinking using Simulation and Modeling (CTSiM)--an open ended learning environment that supports synergistic learning of science and Computational Thinking (CT) for middle school students. In CTSiM, students have the freedom to choose and coordinate use of the different tools provided in the environment, as they build and test their models. However, the open-ended nature of the environment makes it hard to interpret the intent of students' actions, and to provide useful feedback and hints that improves student understanding and helps them achieve their learning goals. To address this challenge, we define an extended learner modeling scheme that uses (1) a hierarchical task model for the CTSiM environment, (2) a set of strategies that support effective learning and model building, and (3) effectiveness and coherence measures that help us evaluate student's proficiency in the different tasks and strategies. We use this scheme to dynamically scaffold learners when they are deficient in performing their tasks, or they demonstrate suboptimal use of strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a classroom study where one group of 6th grade students received scaffolding and the other did not. We found that students who received scaffolding built more accurate models, used modeling strategies effectively, adopted more useful modeling behaviors, showed a better understanding of important science and CT concepts, and transferred their modeling skills better to new scenarios.},

abstract = {Open Learner Models (OLMs) have great potential to support students' Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs). Yet few classroom experiments have been conducted to empirically evaluate whether and how an OLM can enhance students' domain level learning outcomes through the scaffolding of SRL processes in an ITS. In two classroom experiments with a total of 302 7th- and 8th-grade students, we investigated the effect of (a) an OLM that supports students' self-assessment of their equation-solving skills and (b) shared control over problem selection, on students' equation-solving abilities, enjoyment of learning with the tutor, self-assessment accuracy, and problem selection decisions. In the first, smaller experiment, the hypothesized main effect of the OLM on students' learning outcomes was confirmed; we found no main effect of shared control of problem selection, nor an interaction. In the second, larger experiment, the hypothesized main effects were not confirmed, but we found an interaction such that the students who had access to the OLM learned significantly better equation-solving skills than their counterparts when shared control over problem selection was offered in the system. Thus, the two experiments support the notion that an OLM can enhance students' domain-level learning outcomes through scaffolding of SRL processes, and are among the first in-vivo classroom experiments to do so. They suggest that an OLM is especially effective if it is designed to support multiple SRL processes.},

abstract = {We present physiological text annotation, which refers to the practice of associating physiological responses to text content in order to infer characteristics of the user information needs and affective responses. Text annotation is a laborious task, and implicit feedback has been studied as a way to collect annotations without requiring any explicit action from the user. Previous work has explored behavioral signals, such as clicks or dwell time to automatically infer annotations, and physiological signals have mostly been explored for image or video content. We report on two experiments in which physiological text annotation is studied first to (1) indicate perceived relevance and then to (2) indicate affective responses of the users. The first experiment tackles the user's perception of relevance of an information item, which is fundamental towards revealing the user's information needs. The second experiment is then aimed at revealing the user's affective responses towards a -relevant- text document. Results show that physiological user signals are associated with relevance and affect. In particular, electrodermal activity was found to be different when users read relevant content than when they read irrelevant content and was found to be lower when reading texts with negative emotional content than when reading texts with neutral content. Together, the experiments show that physiological text annotation can provide valuable implicit inputs for personalized systems. We discuss how our findings help design personalized systems that can annotate digital content using human physiology without the need for any explicit user interaction.},

abstract = {The main learning activity provided by intelligent tutoring systems is problem solving, although several recent projects investigated the effectiveness of combining problem solving with worked examples. Previous research has shown that learning from examples is an effective learning strategy, especially for novice learners. A worked example provides step-by-step explanations of how a problem is solved. Many studies have compared learning from examples to unsupported problem solving, and suggested presenting worked examples to students in the initial stages of learning, followed by problem solving once students have acquired enough knowledge. This paper presents a study in which we compare a fixed sequence of alternating worked examples and tutored problem solving with a strategy that adapts learning tasks to students' needs. The adaptive strategy determines the type of the task (a worked example, a faded example or a problem to be solved) based on how much assistance the student received on the previous problem. The results show that students in the adaptive condition learnt significantly more than their peers who were presented with a fixed sequence of worked examples and problem solving. Novices from the adaptive condition learnt faster than novices from the control group, while the advanced students from the adaptive condition learnt more than their peers from the control group.},

abstract = {Recommender systems rely on personal information about user behavior for the recommendation generation purposes. Thus, they inherently have the potential to hamper user privacy and disclose sensitive information. Several works studied how neighborhood-based recommendation methods can incorporate user privacy protection. However, privacy preserving latent factor models, in particular, those represented by matrix factorization techniques, the state-of-the-art in recommender systems, have received little attention. In this paper, we address the problem of privacy preserving matrix factorization by utilizing differential privacy, a rigorous and provable approach to privacy in statistical databases. We propose a generic framework and evaluate several ways, in which differential privacy can be applied to matrix factorization. By doing so, we specifically address the privacy-accuracy trade-off offered by each of the algorithms. We show that, of all the algorithms considered, input perturbation results in the best recommendation accuracy, while guaranteeing a solid level of privacy protection against attacks that aim to gain knowledge about either specific user ratings or even the existence of these ratings. Our analysis additionally highlights the system aspects that should be addressed when applying differential privacy in practice, and when considering potential privacy preserving solutions.},

abstract = {The development of early literacy skills has been critically linked to a child's later academic success. In particular, repeated studies have shown that reading aloud to children and providing opportunities for them to discuss the stories that they hear is of utmost importance to later academic success. CloudPrimer is a tablet-based interactive reading primer that aims to foster early literacy skills by supporting parents in shared reading with their children through user-targeted discussion topic suggestions. The tablet application records discussions between parents and children as they read a story and, in combination with a common sense knowledge base, leverages this information to produce suggestions. Because of the unique challenges presented by our application, the suggestion generation method relies on a novel topic modeling method that is based on semantic graph topology. We conducted a user study in which we compared how delivering suggestions generated by our approach compares to expert-crafted suggestions. Our results show that our system can successfully improve engagement and parent---child reading practices in the absence of a literacy expert's tutoring.},

To support the development of individual competency in visualization processing, it is important to ascertain if we can track users' progress or difficulties they might have while working with a given visualization. In this paper, we extend previous work on predicting in real time a user's learning curve--a mathematical model that can represent a user's skill acquisition ability--when working with a visualization. First, we investigate whether results we previously obtained in predicting users' learning curves during visualization processing generalize to a different visualization. Second, we study to what extent we can make predictions on a user's learning curve without information on the visualization being used. Our models leverage various data sources, including a user's gaze behavior, pupil dilation, and cognitive abilities. We show that these models outperform a baseline that leverages knowledge on user task performance so far. Our best performing model achieves good accuracies in predicting users' learning curves even after observing users' performance on a few tasks only. These results represent an important step toward understanding how to support users in learning a new visualization.},

abstract = {People like variety and often prefer to choose from large item sets. However, large sets can cause a phenomenon called "choice overload": they are more difficult to choose from, and as a result decision makers are less satisfied with their choices. It has been argued that choice overload occurs because large sets contain more similar items. To overcome this effect, the present paper proposes that increasing the diversity of item sets might make them more attractive and satisfactory, without making them much more difficult to choose from. To this purpose, by using structural equation model methodology, we study diversification based on the latent features of a matrix factorization recommender model. Study 1 diversifies a set of recommended items while controlling for the overall quality of the set, and tests it in two online user experiments with a movie recommender system. Study 1a tests the effectiveness of the latent feature diversification, and shows that diversification increases the perceived diversity and attractiveness of the item set, while at the same time reducing the perceived difficulty of choosing from the set. Study 1b subsequently shows that diversification can increase users' satisfaction with the chosen option, especially when they are choosing from small, diverse item sets. Study 2 extends these results by testing our diversification algorithm against traditional Top-N recommendations, and finds that diverse, small item sets are just as satisfying and less effortful to choose from than Top-N recommendations. Our results suggest that, at least for the movie domain, diverse small sets may be the best thing one could offer a user of a recommender system.},

First, we propose and validate an approach for automatic classification of personality traits based on the ego-networks' structural characteristics. Our classification results show that (i) mobile phones-based behavioral data can be superior to survey ones for the purposes of personality classification from structural network properties and (ii) particular feature set/network type combinations promise to perform better with given personality traits. Then, we investigate the mediating role played by personality in the context of inducing behavioral change, specifically increasing daily physical activity using social strategies (social comparison and peer pressure). Our results confirm the role played by Extraversion and Neuroticism. Extroverts exposed to a social comparison strategy are positively associated with an increase in physical activity level, while they tend to decrease physical activity level if they are exposed to a peer pressure intervention strategy. Regarding Neuroticism dimension, neurotic people tend to increase their physical daily activity level if they are exposed to a social comparison strategy. Our findings may have implications in designing personality-based behavioral change strategies and suggest to incorporate users' personality models in the implementation of persuasive systems.},

In this paper we analyze viable solutions to the new user problem in collaborative filtering (CF) that are based on the exploitation of user personality information: (a) personality-based CF, which directly improves the recommendation prediction model by incorporating user personality information, (b) personality-based active learning, which utilizes personality information for identifying additional useful preference data in the target recommendation domain to be elicited from the user, and (c) personality-based cross-domain recommendation, which exploits personality information to better use user preference data from auxiliary domains which can be used to compensate the lack of user preference data in the target domain. We benchmark the effectiveness of these methods on large datasets that span several domains, namely movies, music and books. Our results show that personality-aware methods achieve performance improvements that range from 6 to 94 % for users completely new to the system, while increasing the novelty of the recommended items by 3---40 % with respect to the non-personalized popularity baseline. We also discuss the limitations of our approach and the situations in which the proposed methods can be better applied, hence providing guidelines for researchers and practitioners in the field.},

abstract = {As player demographics broaden it has become important to understand variation in player types. Improved player models can help game designers create games that accommodate a range of playing styles, and may also facilitate the design of systems that detect the currently-expressed player type and adapt dynamically in real-time. Existing approaches can model players, but most focus on tracking and classifying behaviour based on simple functional metrics such as deaths, specific choices, player avatar attributes, and completion times. We describe a novel approach which seeks to leverage expert domain knowledge using a theoretical framework linking behaviour and game design patterns. The aim is to derive features of play from sequences of actions which are intrinsically informative about behaviour--which, because they are directly interpretable with respect to psychological theory of behaviour, we name `Behavlets'. We present the theoretical underpinning of this approach from research areas including psychology, temperament theory, player modelling, and game composition. The Behavlet creation process is described in detail; illustrated using a clone of the well-known game Pac-Man, with data gathered from 100 participants. A workshop-based evaluation study is also presented, where nine game design expert participants were briefed on the Behavlet concepts and requisite models, and then attempted to apply the method to games of the well-known first/third-person shooter genres, exemplified by `Gears of War', (Microsoft). The participants found 139 Behavlet concepts mapping from behavioural preferences of the temperament types, to design patterns of the shooter genre games. We conclude that the Behavlet approach has significant promise, is complementary to existing methods and can improve theoretical validity of player models.},

Results provide suggestions for adapting pedagogical agents to support learners' (with certain characteristics; e.g., high in neuroticism or agreeableness) experience of adaptive emotions (e.g., enjoyment) and minimize their experience on non-adaptive emotions (e.g., boredom). Such an approach presents a scalable and easily implementable method for creating emotionally-adaptive, agent-based learning environments, and improving learner-pedagogical agent interactions in order to support learning.},

abstract = {Numerous recommendation approaches are in use today. However, comparing their effectiveness is a challenging task because evaluation results are rarely reproducible. In this article, we examine the challenge of reproducibility in recommender-system research. We conduct experiments using Plista's news recommender system, and Docear's research-paper recommender system. The experiments show that there are large discrepancies in the effectiveness of identical recommendation approaches in only slightly different scenarios, as well as large discrepancies for slightly different approaches in identical scenarios. For example, in one news-recommendation scenario, the performance of a content-based filtering approach was twice as high as the second-best approach, while in another scenario the same content-based filtering approach was the worst performing approach. We found several determinants that may contribute to the large discrepancies observed in recommendation effectiveness. Determinants we examined include user characteristics (gender and age), datasets, weighting schemes, the time at which recommendations were shown, and user-model size. Some of the determinants have interdependencies. For instance, the optimal size of an algorithms' user model depended on users' age. Since minor variations in approaches and scenarios can lead to significant changes in a recommendation approach's performance, ensuring reproducibility of experimental results is difficult. We discuss these findings and conclude that to ensure reproducibility, the recommender-system community needs to (1) survey other research fields and learn from them, (2) find a common understanding of reproducibility, (3) identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility, (4) conduct more comprehensive experiments, (5) modernize publication practices, (6) foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks, and (7) establish best-practice guidelines for recommender-systems research.},

abstract = {Mind wandering is a ubiquitous phenomenon where attention involuntarily shifts from task-related thoughts to internal task-unrelated thoughts. Mind wandering can have negative effects on performance; hence, intelligent interfaces that detect mind wandering can improve performance by intervening and restoring attention to the current task. We investigated the use of eye gaze and contextual cues to automatically detect mind wandering during reading with a computer interface. Participants were pseudorandomly probed to report mind wandering while an eye tracker recorded their gaze during the reading task. Supervised machine learning techniques detected positive responses to mind wandering probes from eye gaze and context features in a user-independent fashion. Mind wandering was detected with an accuracy of 72 % (expected accuracy by chance was 60 %) when probed at the end of a page and an accuracy of 67 % (chance was 59 %) when probed in the midst of reading a page. Global gaze features (gaze patterns independent of content, such as fixation durations) were more effective than content-specific local gaze features. An analysis of the features revealed diagnostic patterns of eye gaze behavior during mind wandering: (1) certain types of fixations were longer; (2) reading times were longer than expected; (3) more words were skipped; and (4) there was a larger variability in pupil diameter. Finally, the automatically detected mind wandering rate correlated negatively with measures of learning and transfer even after controlling for prior knowledge, thereby providing evidence of predictive validity. Possible improvements to the detector and applications that utilize the detector are discussed.},

abstract = {Context-aware recommender systems improve context-free recommenders by exploiting the knowledge of the contextual situation under which a user experienced and rated an item. They use data sets of contextually-tagged ratings to predict how the target user would evaluate (rate) an item in a given contextual situation, with the ultimate goal to recommend the items with the best estimated ratings. This paper describes and evaluates a pre-filtering approach to context-aware recommendation, called distributional-semantics pre-filtering (DSPF), which exploits in a novel way the distributional semantics of contextual conditions to build more precise context-aware rating prediction models. In DSPF, given a target contextual situation (of a target user), a matrix-factorization predictive model is built by using the ratings tagged with the contextual situations most similar to the target one. Then, this model is used to compute rating predictions and identify recommendations for that specific target contextual situation. In the proposed approach, the definition of the similarity of contextual situations is based on the distributional semantics of their composing conditions: situations are similar if they influence the user's ratings in a similar way. This notion of similarity has the advantage of being directly derived from the rating data; hence it does not require a context taxonomy. We analyze the effectiveness of DSPF varying the specific method used to compute the situation-to-situation similarity. We also show how DSPF can be further improved by using clustering techniques. Finally, we evaluate DSPF on several contextually-tagged data sets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art context-aware approaches.},

abstract = {Most real-world recommender systems are deployed in a commercial context or designed to represent a value-adding service, e.g., on shopping or Social Web platforms, and typical success indicators for such systems include conversion rates, customer loyalty or sales numbers. In academic research, in contrast, the evaluation and comparison of different recommendation algorithms is mostly based on offline experimental designs and accuracy or rank measures which are used as proxies to assess an algorithm's recommendation quality. In this paper, we show that popular recommendation techniques--despite often being similar when compared with the help of accuracy measures--can be quite different with respect to which items they recommend. We report the results of an in-depth analysis in which we compare several recommendations strategies from different perspectives, including accuracy, catalog coverage and their bias to recommend popular items. Our analyses reveal that some recent techniques that perform well with respect to accuracy measures focus their recommendations on a tiny fraction of the item spectrum or recommend mostly top sellers. We analyze the reasons for some of these biases in terms of algorithmic design and parameterization and show how the characteristics of the recommendations can be altered by hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we propose two novel algorithmic schemes to counter these popularity biases.},

abstract = {This paper presents an in-depth analysis of a nonconventional topic-based personalization approach for adaptive educational systems (AES) that we have explored for a number of years in the context of university programming courses. With this approach both student modeling and adaptation are based on coarse-grained knowledge units that we called topics. Our motivation for the topic-based personalization was to enhance AES transparency for both teachers and students by utilizing typical topic-based course structures as the foundation for designing all aspects of an AES from the domain model to the end-user interface. We illustrate the details of the topic-based personalization technology, with the help of the Web-based educational service QuizGuide--the first system to implement it. QuizGuide applies the topic-based personalization to guide students to the right learning material in the context of an undergraduate C programming course. While having a number of architectural and practical advantages, the suggested coarse-grained personalization approach deviates from the common practices toward knowledge modeling in AES. Therefore, we believe that several aspects of QuizGuide required a detailed evaluation--from modeling accuracy to the effectiveness of adaptation. The paper discusses how this new student modeling approach can be evaluated, and presents our attempts to evaluate it from multiple different prospects. The evaluation of QuizGuide across several consecutive semesters demonstrates that, although topics do not always support precise user modeling, they can provide a basis for successful personalization in AESs.},

We also explain how the individual prediction techniques can be combined into comprehensive revisitation workflows that achieve higher accuracy. We investigate the performance of the most important workflows and provide a statistical analysis of the factors that affect their predictive accuracy. Further, we provide an upper bound for the accuracy of revisitation prediction using an `oracle' that discards non-revisited pages.},

For example, smart energy systems can be used to support energy saving by controlling devices, such as lights or displays, depending on context information, such as the brightness in a room or the presence of users. However, proactive decisions should also match the users' preferences to maintain the users' trust in the system. Wrong decisions could negatively influence the users' acceptance of a system and at worst could make them abandon the system. In this paper, a trust-based model, called User Trust Model (UTM), for automatic decision-making is proposed, which is based on Bayesian networks. The UTM's construction, the initialization with empirical data gathered in an online survey, and its integration in an office setting are described. Furthermore, the results of a live study and a live survey analyzing the users' experience and acceptance are presented.},

abstract = {User models (UMs) allow systems to provide personalized services to their users. Nowadays, UMs are developed ad-hoc, as part of specific applications, thus requiring repetitive development efforts. In this paper, we propose the info-bead user modeling approach, which is based on ideas taken from software engineering in general and component-based software development in particular. The basic standalone unit, the info-bead, represents a single user attribute within time-tagged information-items. An info-bead encapsulates an inference process that uses data received from sensors or other info-beads and yields an information-item value. Having standard interfaces, info-beads can be linked, thus creating info-pendants. Both info-beads and info-pendants can be assembled as needed into complex and abstract user models (UMs) and group models (GMs). The goal of the suggested approach is to ease the modeling process and to allow reuse of info beads developed for one UM in other UMs that need the same information. In order to assess the reusability and collaboration capabilities of the info-bead user modeling approach, we developed a prototype tool that enables UM designers, who are not necessarily software developers, to easily select and integrate info-beads for constructing UMs and GMs. We further demonstrated the use of the approach in a museum environment, for modeling of assistive technology ontology and for user modeling in various specific domains. Finally, we analyzed and assessed the characteristics of the approach with respect to existing generic user modeling criteria.},

abstract = {Context-aware recommender systems have been widely investigated in both academia and industry because they can make recommendations based on a user's current context (e.g., location, time). However, most existing context-aware techniques only use contextual information at the item level when modeling users' preferences, i.e., contextual information that correlates with users' overall evaluations of items such as ratings. Few studies have attempted to detect more fine-grained contextual preferences at the level of item aspects (e.g., a hotel's "location", "food quality", and "service"). In this study, we use contextual weighting strategies to derive users' aspect-level context-dependent preferences from user-generated textual reviews. The inferred context-dependent preferences are then combined with users' context-independent preferences that are also inferred from reviews to reflect their stable requirements over time. To automatically incorporate both types of user preferences into the recommendation process, we propose a linear-regression-based algorithm that uses a stochastic gradient descent learning procedure. We tested the proposed recommendation algorithm with two real-life service datasets (one with hotel review data and the other with restaurant review data) and compared its contribution with three previously suggested approaches: one that does not consider contextual information; one that uses contextual information to pre-filter rating data before applying the recommendation algorithm; and one that generates recommendations according to users' aspect-level contextual preferences. The experiment results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the others in terms of recommendation accuracy.},

To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology to model the player's preferences on virtual camera movements and we employ the resulting models to tailor the viewpoint movements to the player type and her game-play style. Ultimately, the methodology is applied to a 3D platform game and is evaluated through a controlled experiment; the results suggest that the resulting adaptive cinematographic experience is favoured by some player types and it can generate a positive impact on the game performance.},

abstract = {In recent years, a variety of review-based recommender systems have been developed, with the goal of incorporating the valuable information in user-generated textual reviews into the user modeling and recommending process. Advanced text analysis and opinion mining techniques enable the extraction of various types of review elements, such as the discussed topics, the multi-faceted nature of opinions, contextual information, comparative opinions, and reviewers' emotions. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of how the review elements have been exploited to improve standard content-based recommending, collaborative filtering, and preference-based product ranking techniques. The review-based recommender system's ability to alleviate the well-known rating sparsity and cold-start problems is emphasized. This survey classifies state-of-the-art studies into two principal branches: review-based user profile building and review-based product profile building. In the user profile sub-branch, the reviews are not only used to create term-based profiles, but also to infer or enhance ratings. Multi-faceted opinions can further be exploited to derive the weight/value preferences that users place on particular features. In another sub-branch, the product profile can be enriched with feature opinions or comparative opinions to better reflect its assessment quality. The merit of each branch of work is discussed in terms of both algorithm development and the way in which the proposed algorithms are evaluated. In addition, we discuss several future trends based on the survey, which may inspire investigators to pursue additional studies in this area.},

Our goal was to evaluate the effect of this adaptation strategy on the training outcomes of post-stroke patients during a therapeutic session. We hypothesized that a dynamic difficulty adaptation strategy would have a more positive effect on the training outcomes of patients than two control strategies, incremental difficulty adaptation and random difficulty adaptation. To test these strategies, we developed three versions of PRehab, a serious game for upper-limb rehabilitation. Seven stroke patients and three therapists participated in the experiment, and played all three versions of the game on a graphics tablet. The results of the experiment show that our dynamic adaptation technique increases movement amplitude during a therapeutic session. This finding may serve as a basis to improve patient recovery.},

abstract = {A key challenge in recommender systems is how to profile new users. A well-known solution for this problem is to ask new users to rate a few items to reveal their preferences and to use active learning to find optimally informative items. Compared to the application of active learning in classification (regression), active learning in recommender systems presents several differences: although there are no ratings for new users, there is an abundance of available ratings--collectively--from past (existing) users. In this paper, we propose an innovative approach for active learning in recommender systems, which aims at taking advantage of this additional information. The main idea is to consider existing users as (hypothetical) new users and solve an active learning problem for each of them. In the end, we aggregate all solved problems in order to learn how to solve the active learning problem for a real new user. As the ratings of existing users (i.e., labels) are known and are used for active learning purposes, the proposed framework is in fact a supervised active learning framework. Based on this framework, we investigate two different types of models: the first model is based on information about average item ratings and the second on matrix factorization. We present experimental results on the Netflix dataset, which show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

Therefore, it is very important to be able to build efficient and robust personalization techniques to be part of these services. The evaluation step is a crucial stage in their development and improvement, so much more research is needed to overcome this issue. We have proposed an automatic evaluation methodology for personalized information retrieval systems (ASPIRE), which joins the advantages of both system-centred (repeatable, comparable and generalizable results) and user-centred (considers the user) evaluation approaches, and makes the evaluation process easy and fast. Its reliability and robustness have been assessed by means of a user-oriented evaluation. ASPIRE may be considered as an interesting alternative to the costly and difficult user studies, able to discriminate between either different personalization techniques or different parameter configurations of a given personalization method.},

abstract = {Analysing and monitoring users' engaged-behaviours continuously and under ecologically valid conditions can reveal valuable information for designers and practitioners, allowing them to analyse, design and monitor the interactive mediated activity, and then to adapt and personalise it. An interactive mediated activity is a human activity supported by digital interactive technologies. While classical metric methods fall within quantitative approaches, this paper proposes a qualitative approach to identifying users' engagement and qualifying their engaged-behaviours from their traces of interaction. Traces of interaction represent the users' activities with an interactive environment. The basis of our approach is to transform low-level traces of interaction into meaningful information represented in higher-level traces. For this, our approach combines three theoretical frameworks: the Self-Determination Theory, the Activity Theory and the Trace Theory. Our approach has been implemented and tested in the context of the QUEJANT Projet. QUEJANT targets the development of a system allowing the actors of Social Gaming to analyse players' engagement from an analysis of their activity traces. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we implemented the whole process in a prototype and applied it to 12 players' interaction data collected over four months. Based on these interaction data, we were able to identify engaged and non-engaged users and to qualify their types of engaged-behaviours. We also conducted a user study based on a validation of our results by experts. The high prediction rate obtained confirms the performance of our approach. We finally discuss the limitations of our approach, the potential fields of application and the implications for digital behavioural interventions.},

Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of such games, which treat players as a monolithic group by adopting a one-size-fits-all design approach. Studies of gameplay motivation have shown that this is a bad approach because a motivational approach that works for one individual may actually demotivate behavior in others. In an attempt to resolve this weakness, we conducted a large-scale study on 1,108 gamers to examine the persuasiveness of ten PT strategies that are commonly employed in persuasive game design, and the receptiveness of seven gamer personalities (gamer types identified by BrianHex) to the ten PT strategies. We developed models showing the receptiveness of the gamer types to the PT strategies and created persuasive profiles, which are lists of strategies that can be employed to motivate behavior for each gamer type. We then explored the differences between the models and, based on the results, proposed two approaches for data-driven persuasive game design. The first is the one-size-fits-all approach that will motivate a majority of gamers, while not demotivating any player. The second is the personalized approach that will best persuade a particular type of gamer. We also compiled a list of the best and the worst strategies for each gamer type. Finally, to bridge the gap between game design and PT researchers, we map common game mechanics to the persuasive system design strategies.},

abstract = {Mentioning the recipient's name in a persuasive message is one way to personalize messages in an attempt to increase persuasion. However, this type of personalization may lead to a self-threat that activates defensive reactions and to a subsequent decrease in persuasion. A self-affirmation procedure that induces open-mindedness may prevent this drawback. Smokers were exposed to a message advocating smoking cessation in one of three experimental conditions presenting: A standard text, a text with the recipient's name incorporated four times, or a text with the recipient's name incorporated twelve times. The extent to which smokers indicated at pretest to value their health was used as a measure of personal relevance of the message, and tested as a moderator. Half of the smokers was exposed to a self-affirmation procedure before they read the text. The dependent variable was the intention to quit smoking. When health value was moderate, mentioning the recipient's name twelve times induced a defensive reaction, significantly lowering persuasion. This was supported by the observation that self-affirmation prevented this effect. When health value was high, mentioning the recipient's name twelve times significantly increased persuasion. However, when self-affirmation was applied, persuasion was significantly lowered. The effects of mentioning the recipient's name depend on individual differences in personal relevance of the message (health value) before exposure to the message: Name mentioning can increase, but also decrease persuasion, through defensive processes.},

abstract = {Technology mediated healthcare services designed to stimulate patients' self-efficacy are widely regarded as a promising paradigm to reduce the burden on the healthcare system. The promotion of healthy, active living is a topic of growing interest in research and business. Recent advances in wireless sensor technology and the widespread availability of smartphones have made it possible to monitor and coach users continuously during daily life activities. Physical activity monitoring systems are frequently designed for use over long periods of time placing usability, acceptance and effectiveness in terms of compliance high on the list of design priorities to achieve sustainable behavioral change. Tailoring, or the process of adjusting the system's behavior to individuals in a specific context, is an emerging topic of interest within the field. In this article we report a survey of tailoring techniques currently employed in state of the art real time physical activity coaching systems. We present a survey of state of the art activity coaching systems as well as a conceptual framework which identifies seven important tailoring concepts that are currently in use and how they relate to each other. A detailed analysis of current use of tailoring techniques in real time physical activity coaching applications is presented. According to the literature, tailoring is currently used only sparsely in this field. We underline the need to increase adoption of tailoring methods that are based on available theories, and call for innovative evaluation methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of individual tailoring approaches.},

The proposed model identifies human implicit visual search intention as task-free visual browsing or task-oriented visual search. Task-oriented visual search is further identified as task-oriented visual search intent generation, task-oriented visual search intent maintenance, or task-oriented visual search intent disappearance. During a visual search, measurement of the pupillary response is greatly influenced by external factors such the intensity and size of the visual stimulus. To alleviate the effects of external factors, we propose a robust baseline model that can accurately measure the pupillary response. Graphical representation of the measured parameter values shows significant differences among the different intent conditions, which can then be used as features for identification. By using the eye movement patterns and pupillary analysis, we can detect the transitions between different implicit intentions--task-free visual browsing intent to task-oriented visual search intent and task-oriented visual search intent maintenance to task-oriented visual search intent disappearance--using a hierarchical support vector machine. In the proposed model, the hierarchical support vector machine is able to identify the transitions between different intent conditions with greater than 90 % accuracy.},

As a first step in recommending exhibits where a visitor may wish to spend some time, this article investigates predictive user models for personalised prediction of museum visitors' viewing times at exhibits. We consider two content-based models and a nearest-neighbour collaborative filter, and develop a collaborative model based on the theory of spatial processes which relies on a notion of distance between exhibits. We discuss models of exhibit distance derived from viewing-time similarity, semantic similarity and walking distance. The results from our evaluation with a real-world dataset of visitor pathways collected at Melbourne Museum (Melbourne, Australia) suggest that utilising walking and semantic distances between exhibits enables more accurate predictions of a visitor's viewing times of unseen exhibits than using distances derived from observed exhibit viewing times. Our results also show that all models outperform a non-personalised baseline, that content-based viewing time prediction yields better results than nearest-neighbour collaborative prediction, and that our collaborative model based on spatial processes attains the highest predictive accuracy overall.},

Thus, the ability to identify reputable online contacts with whom to interact has become ever more important. In this work we describe a generic approach to modeling user and item reputation in social recommender systems. In particular, we show how the various interactions between producers and consumers of content can be used to create so-called collaboration graphs, from which the reputation of users and items can be derived. We analyze the performance of our reputation models in the context of the HeyStaks social search platform, which is designed to complement mainstream search engines by recommending relevant pages to users based on the past experiences of search communities. By incorporating reputation into the existing HeyStaks recommendation framework, we demonstrate that the relevance of HeyStaks recommendations can be significantly improved based on data recorded during a live-user trial of the system.},

A tabletop display provides adaptive recommendations which highlight objects to select next, functioning as an expert storytelling system. The recommendation engine can be run in three different configurations to examine the effects of different adaptive methods.

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) computes recommendations by leveraging a historical data set of users' ratings for items. CF assumes that the users' recorded ratings can help in predicting their future ratings. This has been validated extensively, but in some domains the user's ratings can be influenced by contextual conditions, such as the time, or the goal of the item consumption. This type of contextual information is not exploited by standard CF models. This paper introduces and analyzes a novel technique for context-aware CF called Item Splitting. In this approach items experienced in two alternative contextual conditions are "split" into two items. This means that the ratings of a split item, e.g., a place to visit, are assigned (split) to two new fictitious items representing for instance the place in summer and the same place in winter. This split is performed only if there is statistical evidence that under these two contextual conditions the items ratings are different; for instance, a place may be rated higher in summer than in winter. These two new fictitious items are then used, together with the unaffected items, in the rating prediction algorithm. When the system must predict the rating for that "split" item in a particular contextual condition (e.g., in summer), it will consider the new fictitious item representing the original one in that particular contextual condition, and will predict its rating. We evaluated this approach on real world, and semi-synthetic data sets using matrix factorization, and nearest neighbor CF algorithms. We show that Item Splitting can be beneficial and its performance depends on the method used to determine which items to split. We also show that the benefit of the method is determined by the relevance of the contextual factors that are used to split.},

abstract = {Exploiting temporal context has been proved to be an effective approach to improve recommendation performance, as shown, e.g. in the Netflix Prize competition. Time-aware recommender systems (TARS) are indeed receiving increasing attention. A wide range of approaches dealing with the time dimension in user modeling and recommendation strategies have been proposed. In the literature, however, reported results and conclusions about how to incorporate and exploit time information within the recommendation processes seem to be contradictory in some cases. Aiming to clarify and address existing discrepancies, in this paper we present a comprehensive survey and analysis of the state of the art on TARS. The analysis show that meaningful divergences appear in the evaluation protocols used--metrics and methodologies. We identify a number of key conditions on offline evaluation of TARS, and based on these conditions, we provide a comprehensive classification of evaluation protocols for TARS. Moreover, we propose a methodological description framework aimed to make the evaluation process fair and reproducible. We also present an empirical study on the impact of different evaluation protocols on measuring relative performances of well-known TARS. The results obtained show that different uses of the above evaluation conditions yield to remarkably distinct performance and relative ranking values of the recommendation approaches. They reveal the need of clearly stating the evaluation conditions used to ensure comparability and reproducibility of reported results. From our analysis and experiments, we finally conclude with methodological issues a robust evaluation of TARS should take into consideration. Furthermore we provide a number of general guidelines to select proper conditions for evaluating particular TARS.},

In this paper, we address this problem and compare several contextual pre-filtering, post-filtering and contextual modeling methods in terms of the accuracy and diversity of their recommendations to determine which methods outperform the others and under which circumstances. To this end, we consider three major factors affecting performance of CARS methods, such as the type of the recommendation task, context granularity and the type of the recommendation data. We show that none of the considered CARS methods uniformly dominates the others across all of these factors and other experimental settings; but that a certain group of contextual modeling methods constitutes a reliable "best bet" when choosing a sound CARS approach since they provide a good balance of accuracy and diversity of contextual recommendations.},

abstract = {This article introduces Hybreed, a software framework for building complex context-aware applications, together with a set of components that are specifically targeted at developing hybrid, context-aware recommender systems. Hybreed is based on a concept for processing context that we call dynamic contextualization. The underlying notion of context is very generic, enabling application developers to exploit sensor-based physical factors as well as factors derived from user models or user interaction. This approach is well aligned with context definitions that emphasize the dynamic and activity-oriented nature of context. As an extension of the generic framework, we describe Hybreed RecViews, a set of components facilitating the development of context-aware and hybrid recommender systems. With Hybreed and RecViews, developers can rapidly develop context-aware applications that generate recommendations for both individual users and groups. The framework provides a range of recommendation algorithms and strategies for producing group recommendations as well as templates for combining different methods into hybrid recommenders. Hybreed also provides means for integrating existing user or product data from external sources such as social networks. It combines aspects known from context processing frameworks with features of state-of-the-art recommender system frameworks, aspects that have been addressed only separately in previous research. To our knowledge, Hybreed is the first framework to cover all these aspects in an integrated manner. To evaluate the framework and its conceptual foundation, we verified its capabilities in three different use cases. The evaluation also comprises a comparative assessment of Hybreed's functional features, a comparison to existing frameworks, and a user study assessing its usability for developers. The results of this study indicate that Hybreed is intuitive to use and extend by developers.},

For instance, the experience of play is a psychological phenomenon, yet common psychological concepts such as the typology of temperaments have not been widely utilised in game design or research. An effective player typology provides a model by which we can analyse player behaviour. We present a real-time classifier of player type, implemented in the test-bed game Pac-Man. Decision Tree algorithms CART and C5.0 were trained on labels from the DGD player typology (Bateman and Boon, 21st century game design, vol. 1, 2005 ). The classifier is then built by selecting rules from the Decision Trees using a rule- performance metric, and experimentally validated. We achieve ~70% accuracy in this validation testing. We further analyse the concept descriptions learned by the Decision Trees. The algorithm output is examined with respect to a set of hypotheses on player behaviour. A set of open questions is then posed against the test data obtained from validation testing, to illustrate the further insights possible from extended analysis.},

abstract = {People-to-people recommenders constitute an important class of recommender systems. Examples include online dating, where people have the common goal of finding a partner, and employment websites where one group of users needs to find a job (employer) and another group needs to find an employee. People-to-people recommenders differ from the traditional items-to-people recommenders as they must satisfy both parties; we call this type of recommender reciprocal. This article is the first to present a comprehensive view of this important recommender class. We first identify the characteristics of reciprocal recommenders and compare them with traditional recommenders, which are widely used in e-commerce websites. We then present a series of studies and evaluations of a content-based reciprocal recommender in the domain of online dating. It uses a large dataset from a major online dating website. We use this case study to illustrate the distinctive requirements of reciprocal recommenders and highlight important challenges, such as the need to avoid bad recommendations since they may make users to feel rejected. Our experiments indicate that, by considering reciprocity, the rate of successful connections can be significantly improved. They also show that, despite the existence of rich explicit profiles, the use of implicit profiles provides more effective recommendations. We conclude with a discussion, linking our work in online dating to the many other domains that require reciprocal recommenders. Our key contributions are the recognition of the reciprocal recommender as an important class of recommender, the identification of its distinctive characteristics and the exploration of how these impact the recommendation process in an extensive case study in the domain of online dating.},

abstract = {Information Retrieval (IR) systems assist users in finding information from the myriad of information resources available on the Web. A traditional characteristic of IR systems is that if different users submit the same query, the system would yield the same list of results, regardless of the user. Personalised Information Retrieval (PIR) systems take a step further to better satisfy the user's specific information needs by providing search results that are not only of relevance to the query but are also of particular relevance to the user who submitted the query. PIR has thereby attracted increasing research and commercial attention as information portals aim at achieving user loyalty by improving their performance in terms of effectiveness and user satisfaction. In order to provide a personalised service, a PIR system maintains information about the users and the history of their interactions with the system. This information is then used to adapt the users' queries or the results so that information that is more relevant to the users is retrieved and presented. This survey paper features a critical review of PIR systems, with a focus on personalised search. The survey provides an insight into the stages involved in building and evaluating PIR systems, namely: information gathering, information representation, personalisation execution, and system evaluation. Moreover, the survey provides an analysis of PIR systems with respect to the scope of personalisation addressed. The survey proposes a classification of PIR systems into three scopes: individualised systems, community-based systems, and aggregate-level systems. Based on the conducted survey, the paper concludes by highlighting challenges and future research directions in the field of PIR.},

abstract = {Individuals participating in technologically mediated forms of organization often have difficulty recognizing when groups emerge, and how the groups they take part in evolve. This paper contributes an analytical framework that improves awareness of these virtual group dynamics through analysis of electronic trace data from tasks and interactions carried out by individuals in systems not explicitly designed for context adaptivity, user modeling or user personalization. We discuss two distinct cases to which we have applied our analytical framework. These two cases provide a useful contrast of two prevalent ways for analyzing social relations starting from electronic trace data: either artifact-mediated or direct person-to-person interactions. Our case study integrates electronic trace data analysis with analysis of other, triangulating data specific to each application. We show how our techniques fit in a general model of group informatics, which can serve to construct group context, and be leveraged by future tool development aimed at augmenting context adaptivity with group context and a social dimension. We describe our methods, data management strategies and technical architecture to support the analysis of individual user task context, increased awareness of group membership, and an integrated view of social, information and coordination contexts.},

abstract = {Reconciling personalization with privacy has been a continuing interest in user modeling research. This aim has computational, legal and behavioral/attitudinal ramifications. We present a dynamic privacy-enhancing user modeling framework that supports compliance with users' individual privacy preferences and with the privacy laws and regulations that apply to each user. The framework is based on a software product line architecture. It dynamically selects personalization methods during runtime that meet the current privacy constraints. Since dynamic architectural reconfiguration is typically resource-intensive, we conducted a performance evaluation with four implementations of our system that vary two factors. The results demonstrate that at least one implementation of our approach is technically feasible with comparatively modest additional resources, even for websites with the highest traffic today. To gauge user reactions to privacy controls that our framework enables, we also conducted a controlled experiment that allowed one group of users to specify privacy preferences and view the resulting effects on employed personalization methods. We found that users in this treatment group utilized this feature, deemed it useful, and had fewer privacy concerns as measured by higher disclosure of their personal data.},

abstract = {We present work toward automatically assessing and estimating science inquiry skills as middle school students engage in inquiry within a physical science microworld. Towards accomplishing this goal, we generated machine-learned models that can detect when students test their articulated hypotheses, design controlled experiments, and engage in planning behaviors using two inquiry support tools. Models were trained using labels generated through a new method of manually hand-coding log files, "text replay tagging". This approach led to detectors that can automatically and accurately identify these inquiry skills under student-level cross-validation. The resulting detectors can be applied at run-time to drive scaffolding intervention. They can also be leveraged to automatically score all practice attempts, rather than hand-classifying them, and build models of latent skill proficiency. As part of this work, we also compared two approaches for doing so, Bayesian Knowledge-Tracing and an averaging approach that assumes static inquiry skill level. These approaches were compared on their efficacy at predicting skill before a student engages in an inquiry activity, predicting performance on a paper-style multiple choice test of inquiry, and predicting performance on a transfer task requiring data collection skills. Overall, we found that both approaches were effective at estimating student skills within the environment. Additionally, the models' skill estimates were significant predictors of the two types of inquiry transfer tests.},

abstract = {Research on recommender systems typically focuses on the accuracy of prediction algorithms. Because accuracy only partially constitutes the user experience of a recommender system, this paper proposes a framework that takes a user-centric approach to recommender system evaluation. The framework links objective system aspects to objective user behavior through a series of perceptual and evaluative constructs (called subjective system aspects and experience, respectively). Furthermore, it incorporates the influence of personal and situational characteristics on the user experience. This paper reviews how current literature maps to the framework and identifies several gaps in existing work. Consequently, the framework is validated with four field trials and two controlled experiments and analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The results of these studies show that subjective system aspects and experience variables are invaluable in explaining why and how the user experience of recommender systems comes about. In all studies we observe that perceptions of recommendation quality and/or variety are important mediators in predicting the effects of objective system aspects on the three components of user experience: process (e.g. perceived effort, difficulty), system (e.g. perceived system effectiveness) and outcome (e.g. choice satisfaction). Furthermore, we find that these subjective aspects have strong and sometimes interesting behavioral correlates (e.g. reduced browsing indicates higher system effectiveness). They also show several tradeoffs between system aspects and personal and situational characteristics (e.g. the amount of preference feedback users provide is a tradeoff between perceived system usefulness and privacy concerns). These results, as well as the validated framework itself, provide a platform for future research on the user-centric evaluation of recommender systems.},

abstract = {When recommender systems present items, these can be accompanied by explanatory information. Such explanations can serve seven aims: effectiveness, satisfaction, transparency, scrutability, trust, persuasiveness, and efficiency. These aims can be incompatible, so any evaluation needs to state which aim is being investigated and use appropriate metrics. This paper focuses particularly on effectiveness (helping users to make good decisions) and its trade-off with satisfaction. It provides an overview of existing work on evaluating effectiveness and the metrics used. It also highlights the limitations of the existing effectiveness metrics, in particular the effects of under- and overestimation and recommendation domain. In addition to this methodological contribution, the paper presents four empirical studies in two domains: movies and cameras. These studies investigate the impact of personalizing simple feature-based explanations on effectiveness and satisfaction. Both approximated and real effectiveness is investigated. Contrary to expectation, personalization was detrimental to effectiveness, though it may improve user satisfaction. The studies also highlighted the importance of considering opt-out rates and the underlying rating distribution when evaluating effectiveness.},

abstract = {Two problems may arise when an intelligent (recommender) system elicits users' preferences. First, there may be a mismatch between the quantitative preference representations in most preference models and the users' mental preference models. Giving exact numbers, e.g., such as "I like 30 days of vacation 2.5 times better than 28 days" is difficult for people. Second, the elicitation process can greatly influence the acquired model (e.g., people may prefer different options based on whether a choice is represented as a loss or gain). We explored these issues in three studies. In the first experiment we presented users with different preference elicitation methods and found that cognitively less demanding methods were perceived low in effort and high in liking. However, for methods enabling users to be more expressive, the perceived effort was not an indicator of how much the methods were liked. We thus hypothesized that users are willing to spend more effort if the feedback mechanism enables them to be more expressive. We examined this hypothesis in two follow-up studies. In the second experiment, we explored the trade-off between giving detailed preference feedback and effort. We found that familiarity with and opinion about an item are important factors mediating this trade-off. Additionally, affective feedback was preferred over a finer grained one-dimensional rating scale for giving additional detail. In the third study, we explored the influence of the interface on the elicitation process in a participatory set-up. People considered it helpful to be able to explore the link between their interests, preferences and the desirability of outcomes. We also confirmed that people do not want to spend additional effort in cases where it seemed unnecessary. Based on the findings, we propose four design guidelines to foster interface design of preference elicitation from a user view.},

abstract = {A recommender system is a Web technology that proactively suggests items of interest to users based on their objective behavior or explicitly stated preferences. Evaluations of recommender systems (RS) have traditionally focused on the performance of algorithms. However, many researchers have recently started investigating system effectiveness and evaluation criteria from users' perspectives. In this paper, we survey the state of the art of user experience research in RS by examining how researchers have evaluated design methods that augment RS's ability to help users find the information or product that they truly prefer, interact with ease with the system, and form trust with RS through system transparency, control and privacy preserving mechanisms finally, we examine how these system design features influence users' adoption of the technology. We summarize existing work concerning three crucial interaction activities between the user and the system: the initial preference elicitation process, the preference refinement process, and the presentation of the system's recommendation results. Additionally, we will also cover recent evaluation frameworks that measure a recommender system's overall perceptive qualities and how these qualities influence users' behavioral intentions. The key results are summarized in a set of design guidelines that can provide useful suggestions to scholars and practitioners concerning the design and development of effective recommender systems. The survey also lays groundwork for researchers to pursue future topics that have not been covered by existing methods.},

In this article, we describe an approach for modeling and recognizing user goals from observed sequences of user actions by using Variable Order Markov models combined with an exponential moving average (EMA) on the prediction probabilities. The validity of our approach has been tested using data collected from real users in the Unix domain. The results obtained show that an interface agent can achieve near 90% average accuracy and over 58% online accuracy in predicting the most probable user goal after each observed action, in a time linear to the number of goals being modeled. We also found that the use of an EMA allows a faster convergence in the actual user goal.},

abstract = {The widespread adoption of online services for performing work, home and leisure tasks enables users to operate in the ubiquitous environment provided by the Internet by managing a possibly high number of parallel (private and shared) activity contexts. The provision of awareness information is a key factor for keeping users up-to-date with what happens around them; e.g., with the operations performed by their collaborators. However, the delivery of notifications describing the occurred events can interrupt the users' activities, with a possible disruptive effect on their emotional and attentional states. As a possible solution to the trade-off between informing and interrupting users, we defined two context-dependent notification management policies which support the selection of the notifications to be delivered on the basis of the user's current activities, at different granularity levels: general collaboration context versus task carried out. These policies are offered by the COntext depeNdent awaReness informAtion Delivery (CONRAD) framework. We tested such policies with users by applying them in a collaboration environment that includes a set of largely used Web 2.0 services. The experiments show that our policies reduce the levels of workload on users while supporting an up-to-the-moment understanding of the interaction with their shared contexts. The present paper presents the CONRAD framework and the techniques underlying the proposed notification policies.},

We show through examples that the embedding of the algorithm in the user experience dramatically affects the value to the user of the recommender. We argue that evaluating the user experience of a recommender requires a broader set of measures than have been commonly used, and suggest additional measures that have proven effective. Based on our analysis of the state of the field, we identify the most important open research problems, and outline key challenges slowing the advance of the state of the art, and in some cases limiting the relevance of research to real-world applications.},

Communities arise in a number of different ways. Social networking tools typically allow users to proactively connect to each other. Alternatively, data mining tools discover communities of connected Web sites or communities of Web users. In this article, we focus on the latter type of community, which is commonly mined from logs of users' activity on the Web. We recall how this process has been used to model the users' interests and personalize Web applications. Collaborative filtering and recommendation are the most widely used forms of community-driven personalization. However, we examine a range of other interesting alternatives that are worth investigating further. This effort leads us naturally to the recent developments on the Web and particularly the advent of the social Web. We explain how this development draws together the different viewpoints on Web communities and introduces new opportunities for community-based personalization. In particular, we propose the concept of active user community and show how this relates to recent efforts on mining social networks and social media.},

For example, systems that personalize advertisements according to the physical location of the user or according to the user's friends' search history, introduce new privacy risks that may discourage wide adoption of personalization technologies. This article analyzes the privacy risks associated with several current and prominent personalization trends, namely social-based personalization, behavioral profiling, and location-based personalization. We survey user attitudes towards privacy and personalization, as well as technologies that can help reduce privacy risks. We conclude with a discussion that frames risks and technical solutions in the intersection between personalization and privacy, as well as areas for further investigation. This frameworks can help designers and researchers to contextualize privacy challenges of solutions when designing personalization systems.},

abstract = {The explosive growth of Web-based social applications over the last 10 years has led people to engage in online communities for various purposes: to work, learn, play, share time and mementos with friends and family and engage in public action. Social Computing Applications (SCA) allow users to discuss various topics in online forums, share their thoughts in blogs, share photos, videos, bookmarks, and connect with friends through social networks. Yet, the design of successful social applications that attract and sustain active contribution by their users still remains more of an art than a science. My research over the last 10 years has been based on the hypothesis that it is possible to incorporate mechanisms and tools in the design of the social application that can motivate users to participate, and more generally, to change their behavior in a desirable way, which is beneficial for the community. Since different people are motivated by different things, it can be expected that personalizing the incentives and the way the rewards are presented to the individual, would be beneficial. Also since communities have different needs in different phases of their existence, it is necessary to model the changing needs of communities and adapt the incentive mechanisms accordingly, to attract the kind of contributions that are beneficial. Therefore User and Group (Community) Modeling is an important area in the design of incentive mechanisms. This paper presents an overview of different approaches to motivate users to participate. These approaches are based on various theories from the area of social psychology and behavioral economics and involve rewards mechanisms, reputation, open group user modeling, and social visualization. Future trends are outlined towards convergence with the areas of persuasive systems design, adaptive/personalized systems, and intelligent social learning environments.},

abstract = {Critiquing-based recommender systems elicit users' feedback, called critiques, which they made on the recommended items. This  conversational  style of interaction is in contract to the standard model where users receive recommendations in a single interaction. Through the use of the critiquing feedback, the recommender systems are able to more accurately learn the users' profiles, and therefore suggest better recommendations in the subsequent rounds. Critiquing-based recommenders have been widely studied in knowledge-, content-, and preference-based recommenders and are beginning to be tried in several online websites, such as MovieLens. This article examines the motivation and development of the subject area, and offers a detailed survey of the state of the art concerning the design of critiquing interfaces and development of algorithms for critiquing generation. With the help of categorization analysis, the survey reveals three principal branches of critiquing based recommender systems, using respectively  natural language based ,  system-suggested , and  user-initiated critiques . Representative example systems will be presented and analyzed for each branch, and their respective pros and cons will be discussed. Subsequently, a hybrid framework is developed to unify the advantages of different methods and overcome their respective limitations. Empirical findings from user studies are further presented, indicating how hybrid critiquing supports could effectively enable end-users to achieve more confident decisions. Finally, the article will point out several future trends to boost the advance of critiquing-based recommenders.},

abstract = {Over the last 20 years, cultural heritage has been a favored domain for personalization research. For years, researchers have experimented with the cutting edge technology of the day; now, with the convergence of internet and wireless technology, and the increasing adoption of the Web as a platform for the publication of information, the visitor is able to exploit cultural heritage material before, during and after the visit, having different goals and requirements in each phase. However, cultural heritage sites have a huge amount of information to present, which must be filtered and personalized in order to enable the individual user to easily access it. Personalization of cultural heritage information requires a system that is able to model the user (e.g., interest, knowledge and other personal characteristics), as well as contextual aspects, select the most appropriate content, and deliver it in the most suitable way. It should be noted that achieving this result is extremely challenging in the case of first-time users, such as tourists who visit a cultural heritage site for the first time (and maybe the only time in their life). In addition, as tourism is a social activity, adapting to the individual is not enough because groups and communities have to be modeled and supported as well, taking into account their mutual interests, previous mutual experience, and requirements. How to model and represent the user(s) and the context of the visit and how to reason with regard to the information that is available are the challenges faced by researchers in personalization of cultural heritage. Notwithstanding the effort invested so far, a definite solution is far from being reached, mainly because new technology and new aspects of personalization are constantly being introduced. This article surveys the research in this area. Starting from the earlier systems, which presented cultural heritage information in kiosks, it summarizes the evolution of personalization techniques in museum web sites, virtual collections and mobile guides, until recent extension of cultural heritage toward the semantic and social web. The paper concludes with current challenges and points out areas where future research is needed.},

abstract = {Being able to promptly and accurately choose a proper course of action in the field is a crucial aspect of emergency response. For this reason, emergency medical services (EMS) rely on well established procedures that apply to the most frequent cases first responders encounter in their practice, but do not include special cases concerning (sensory, motor or cognitive) disabled persons. In these cases, first responders may end up applying suboptimal or possibly wrong procedures or lose precious time trying to adapt on-the-fly to the special case. This paper proposes both (i) a detailed patient model for EMS that can account for peculiar aspects of the many existing disabilities and (ii) an adaptive information system called PRESYDIUM (Personalized Emergency System for Disabled Humans) that provides tailored instructions in the field for helping medical first responders in dealing with disabled persons. More precisely, we will illustrate and discuss: (i) the design and development process of PRESYDIUM, (ii) the patient model, which is partly based on the ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health) standard proposed by the World Health Organization, (iii) the knowledge base used by the system to provide tailored instructions to medical first responders, (iv) the Web-based architecture of the system, (v) the different interfaces--including one for mobile devices--the system provides to enable all the identified stakeholders (disabled persons, their families, clinicians, EMS call center operators, medical first responders) to easily access and possibly provide data to the system, (vi) the evaluation of the validity of the patient model and of the system usability which has been conducted with end users.},

We begin with a model designed for reasoning about interaction in a single-agent single-user setting and then expand to the environment of multiagent systems. In this setting, agents consider both whether to ask other agents to perform decision making and at the same time whether to ask questions of these agents. With this fundamental research as a backdrop, we project the framework into the application of reasoning about which medical experts to interact with, sensitive to possible bother, during hospital decision scenarios, in order to deliver the best care for the patients that arrive. Due to the real-time nature of the application and the knowledge-intensive nature of the decisions, we propose new parameters to include in the reasoning about interaction and sketch their usefulness through a series of examples. We then include a set of experimental results confirming the value of our proposed approach for reasoning about interaction in hospital settings, through simulations of patient care in those environments. We conclude by pointing to future research to continue to extend the model for reasoning about interaction in multiagent environments for the setting of time-critical care in hospital settings.},

This paper describes DMSS-R and the results of a case study in clinical practice where the system was used. The case study included interviews and observations of the clinical investigation process as undertaken in 41 real patient cases with suspected dementia. Two physicians participated, one of whom was considered a novice regarding dementia while the other had a moderate level of skills. Initially, both physicians were unfamiliar with DMSS-R. A group of nurses together with care personnel and relatives were also involved. The most important contribution of DMSS-R at the point of care, apart from the tailored explanatory support related to a patient case, was the educational support it provided. This was partly manifested in a change of routines in the encounter with patients. Aspects regarding the individual health care professional's need for a personalized support system are discussed and put in relation to the team's need for support, and in relation to the diversity of disease manifestations in this group of patients, which reinforces patient-centric assessments.},

abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that obesity is a serious health issue. Despite governments' campaigns and initiatives to raise the level of awareness, the proportion of adults classified as overweight or obese is increasing steadily. As a result, there has been a growing interest in Human Computer Interaction and User Modelling to study how to support health behaviour change. While most of the work to date has focused on individuals, medical research has shown that family engagement plays an important role on health behaviour. To consider the family context, we are developing technology that facilitates health discussions and encourages supportive behaviour within the family. We investigate how to motivate members of a family to reflect upon their lifestyle and think of ways in which they can make it healthier. In particular, we have looked at whether providing explicit goals and tailored feedback can have an impact. During a two week trial with families in which we explored these strategies, we found that setting a collective goal for the family influenced how much the family as a whole contributed, and that feedback increased significantly mothers' participation. Our results also suggest that establishing a family goal encouraged families to work together and, in particular, to help each other find ways to be healthier. Finally, 76% of participants reported discussing the task with someone in their family, and, also discussing it together as a family (57%).},

Fibromyalgia syndrome is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain in muscles, ligaments and tendons, usually associated with sleep disorders and fatigue. Physical exercise is considered as an important component of non-pharmacological treatments of this pathology, and the internet is praised as a powerful resource to promote and improve physical exercise. Yet, while online personalization of health interventions to consumers must be grounded on empirically based guidelines, guidelines for fibromyalgia-targeted exercises are scant. The achievements presented in this paper are twofold. Firstly, we illustrate how we reached definition of the relevant factors for tailoring exercise videos in relation to fibromyalgia. Secondly, we explain the general framework of the application that is composed of an interview module (that investigates the determinant values of a specific user), an adaptation module (presenting the tailored set of exercises) and a logging component (used to monitor users' interactions with the website). The paper concludes with a discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach.},

Commonly, the effort to build user models is repeated across applications and domains, due to the lack of interoperability and synchronization among user-adaptive systems. There is a strong need for the next generation of user models to be interoperable, i.e. to be able to exchange user model portions and to use the information that has been exchanged to enrich the user experience. This paper presents an overview of the well-established literature dealing with user model interoperability, discussing the most representative work which has provided valuable solutions to face interoperability issues. Based on a detailed decomposition and a deep analysis of the selected work, we have isolated a set of dimensions characterizing the user model interoperability process along which the work has been classified.

We describe the use of learning curves for evaluating personalised educational systems and outline some of the potential pitfalls and how they may be overcome. We then describe three studies in which we demonstrate how learning curves can be used to drive changes in the user model. First, we show how using learning curves for subsets of the domain model can yield insight into the appropriateness of the model's structure. In the second study we use this method to experiment with model granularity. Finally, we use learning curves to analyse a large volume of user data to explore the feasibility of using them as a reliable method for fine-tuning a system's model. The results of these experiments demonstrate the successful use of performance curves in formative studies of adaptive educational systems.},

abstract = {Student academic performance at universities is crucial for education management systems. Many actions and decisions are made based on it, specifically the enrollment process. During enrollment, students have to decide which courses to sign up for. This research presents the rationale behind the design of a recommender system to support the enrollment process using the students' academic performance record. To build this system, the CRISP-DM methodology was applied to data from students of the Computer Science Department at University of Lima, Per\'{u}. One of the main contributions of this work is the use of two synthetic attributes to improve the relevance of the recommendations made. The first attribute estimates the inherent difficulty of a given course. The second attribute, named potential, is a measure of the competence of a student for a given course based on the grades obtained in related courses. Data was mined using C4.5, KNN (K-nearest neighbor), Na\"{\i}ve Bayes, Bagging and Boosting, and a set of experiments was developed in order to determine the best algorithm for this application domain. Results indicate that Bagging is the best method regarding predictive accuracy. Based on these results, the "Student Performance Recommender System" (SPRS) was developed, including a learning engine. SPRS was tested with a sample group of 39 students during the enrollment process. Results showed that the system had a very good performance under real-life conditions.},

abstract = {Modeling user behavior (user modeling) via data mining faces a critical unresolved issue: how to build a collaboration model based on frequent analysis of students in order to ascertain whether collaboration has taken place. Numerous human-based and knowledge-based solutions to this problem have been proposed, but they are time-consuming or domain-dependent. The diversity of these solutions and their lack of common characteristics are an indication of how unresolved this issue remains. Bearing this in mind, our research has made progress on several fronts. First, we have found supportive evidence, based on a collaborative learning experience with hundreds of students over three consecutive years, that an approach using domain independent learning that is transferable to current e-learning platforms helps both students and teachers to manage student collaboration better. Second, the approach draws on a domain-independent modeling method of collaborative learning based on data mining that helps clarify which user-modeling issues are to be considered. We propose two data mining methods that were found to be useful for evaluating student collaboration, and discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages. Three data sources to generate and evaluate the collaboration model were identified. Third, the features being modeled were made accessible to students in several meta-cognitive tools. Their usage of these tools showed that the best approach to encourage student collaboration is to show only the most relevant inferred information, simply displayed. Moreover, these tools also provide teachers with valuable modeling information to improve their management of the collaboration. Fourth, an ontology, domain independent features and a process that can be applied to current e-learning platforms make the approach transferable and reusable. Fifth, several open research issues of particular interest were identified. We intend to address these open issues through research in the near future.},

abstract = {With the heterogeneous proliferation of mobile devices, the delivery of learning materials on such devices becomes subject to more and more requirements. Personalized learning content adaptation, therefore, becomes increasingly important to meet the diverse needs imposed by devices, users, usage contexts, and infrastructure. Historical server logs offer a wealth of information on hardware capabilities, learners' preferences, and network conditions, which can be utilized to respond to a new user request with the personalized learning content created from a previous similar request. In this paper, we propose a Personalized Learning Content Adaptation Mechanism (PLCAM), which applies data mining techniques, including clustering and decision tree approaches, to efficiently manage a large number of historical learners' requests. The proposed method will intelligently and directly deliver proper personalized learning content with higher fidelity from the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM)-compliant Learning Object Repository (LOR) by means of the proposed adaptation decision and content synthesis processes. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that it is efficient and is expected to prove beneficial to learners.},

In this project we present a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for inducing effective pedagogical strategies and empirical evaluations of the induced strategies. This paper addresses the technical challenges in applying RL to Cordillera, a Natural Language Tutoring System teaching students introductory college physics. The algorithm chosen for this project is a model-based RL approach, Policy Iteration, and the training corpus for the RL approach is an exploratory corpus, which was collected by letting the system make random decisions when interacting with real students. Overall, our results show that by using a rather small training corpus, the RL-induced strategies indeed measurably improved the effectiveness of Cordillera in that the RL-induced policies improved students' learning gains significantly.},

The approach is applicable at different levels: to detect pre-defined, well-established problem solving styles, to identify problem solving styles by analyzing learner behaviour along known learning dimensions, and to semi-automatically discover learning dimensions and concrete problem solving patterns. This article describes the approach itself, demonstrates the feasibility of applying it on real-world data, and discusses aspects of the approach that can be adjusted for different learning contexts. Finally, we address the incorporation of the proposed approach in the adaptation cycle, from data acquisition to adaptive system interventions in the interaction process.},

abstract = {Students who exploit properties of an instructional system to make progress while avoiding learning are said to be "gaming" the system. In order to investigate what causes gaming and how it impacts students, we analyzed log data from two Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). The primary analyses focused on six college physics classes using the Andes ITS for homework and test preparation, starting with the research question: What is a better predictor of gaming, problem or student? To address this question, we developed a computational gaming detector for automatically labeling the Andes data, and applied several data mining techniques, including machine learning of Bayesian network parameters. Contrary to some prior findings, the analyses indicated that student was a better predictor of gaming than problem. This result was surprising, so we tested and confirmed it with log data from a second ITS (the Algebra Cognitive Tutor) and population (high school students). Given that student was more predictive of gaming than problem, subsequent analyses focused on how students gamed and in turn benefited (or not) from instructional features of the environment, as well as how gaming in general influenced problem solving and learning outcomes.},

abstract = {The evaluation of interactive adaptive systems has long been acknowledged to be a complicated and demanding endeavour. Some promising approaches in the recent past have attempted tackling the problem of evaluating adaptivity by "decomposing" and evaluating it in a "piece-wise" manner. Separating the evaluation of different aspects can help to identify problems in the adaptation process. This paper presents a framework that can be used to guide the "layered" evaluation of adaptive systems, and a set of formative methods that have been tailored or specially developed for the evaluation of adaptivity. The proposed framework unifies previous approaches in the literature and has already been used, in various guises, in recent research work. The presented methods are related to the layers in the framework and the stages in the development lifecycle of interactive systems. The paper also discusses practical issues surrounding the employment of the above, and provides a brief overview of complementary and alternative approaches in the literature.},

abstract = {Tailoring the linguistic content of automatically generated descriptions to the preferences of a target user has been well demonstrated to be an effective way to produce higher-quality output that may even have a greater impact on user behaviour. It is known that the non-verbal behaviour of an embodied agent can have a significant effect on users' responses to content presented by that agent. However, to date no-one has examined the contribution of non-verbal behaviour to the effectiveness of user tailoring in automatically generated embodied output. We describe a series of experiments designed to address this question. We begin by introducing a multimodal dialogue system designed to generate descriptions and comparisons tailored to user preferences, and demonstrate that the user-preference tailoring is detectable to an overhearer when the output is presented as synthesised speech. We then present a multimodal corpus consisting of the annotated facial expressions used by a speaker to accompany the generated tailored descriptions, and verify that the most characteristic positive and negative expressions used by that speaker are identifiable when resynthesised on an artificial talking head. Finally, we combine the corpus-derived facial displays with the tailored descriptions to test whether the addition of the non-verbal channel improves users' ability to detect the intended tailoring, comparing two strategies for selecting the displays: one based on a simple corpus-derived rule, and one making direct use of the full corpus data. The performance of the subjects who saw displays selected by the rule-based strategy was not significantly different than that of the subjects who got only the linguistic content, while the subjects who saw the data-driven displays were significantly worse at detecting the correctly tailored output. We propose a possible explanation for this result, and also make recommendations for developers of future systems that may make use of an embodied agent to present user-tailored content.},

The underlying assumption is that affective parameters are more closely related to the user's experience than generic metadata (e.g. genre) and are thus more suitable for separating the relevant items from the non-relevant. We propose a novel affective modeling approach based on users' emotive responses. We performed a user-interaction session and compared the performance of the recommender system with affective versus generic metadata. The results of the statistical analysis showed that the proposed affective parameters yield a significant improvement in the performance of the recommender system.},

abstract = {Information about interactive virtual environments, such as games, is perceived by users through a virtual camera. While most interactive applications let users control the camera, in complex navigation tasks within 3D environments users often get frustrated with the interaction. In this paper, we propose inclusion of camera control as a vital component of affective adaptive interaction in games. We investigate the impact of camera viewpoints on psychophysiology of players through preference surveys collected from a test game. Data is collected from players of a 3D prey/predator game in which player experience is directly linked to camera settings. Computational models of discrete affective states of fun, challenge, boredom, frustration, excitement, anxiety and relaxation are built on biosignal (heart rate, blood volume pulse and skin conductance) features to predict the pairwise self-reported emotional preferences of the players. For this purpose, automatic feature selection and neuro-evolutionary preference learning are combined providing highly accurate affective models. The performance of the artificial neural network models on unseen data reveals accuracies of above 80% for the majority of discrete affective states examined. The generality of the obtained models is tested in different test-bed game environments and the use of the generated models for creating adaptive affect-driven camera control in games is discussed.},

This paper presents an attempt to assess the value of these two approaches. The results of a controlled experiment indicate that explanatory visualization allows students to substantially increase the understanding of a new programming topic. Furthermore, an educational application that features explanatory visualization and employs a user model to track users' progress allows students to interact with a larger amount of material than an application which does not follow users' activity. However, no support for the difference in short-term knowledge gain between the two applications is found. Nevertheless, students admit that they prefer the version that estimates and visualizes their progress and adapts the learning content to their level of understanding. They also use the application's estimation to pace their work. The differences in eye movement patterns between the applications employing adaptive and non-adaptive explanatory visualizations are investigated as well. Gaze-based measures show that adaptive visualization captivates attention more than its non-personalized counterpart and is more interesting to students. Natural language explanations also accumulate a big portion of students' attention. Furthermore, the results indicate that working memory span can mediate the perception of adaptation. It is possible that user-adaptation in an educational context provides a different service to people with different mental processing capabilities.},

abstract = {Conversation is an essential component of social behavior, one of the primary means by which humans express intentions, beliefs, emotions, attitudes and personality. Thus the development of systems to support natural conversational interaction has been a long term research goal. In natural conversation, humans adapt to one another across many levels of utterance production via processes variously described as linguistic style matching, entrainment, alignment, audience design, and accommodation. A number of recent studies strongly suggest that dialogue systems that adapted to the user in a similar way would be more effective. However, a major research challenge in this area is the ability to dynamically generate user-adaptive utterance variations. As part of a personality-based user adaptation framework, this article describes personage, a highly parameterizable generator which provides a large number of parameters to support adaptation to a user's linguistic style. We show how we can systematically apply results from psycholinguistic studies that document the linguistic reflexes of personality, in order to develop models to control personage's parameters, and produce utterances matching particular personality profiles. When we evaluate these outputs with human judges, the results indicate that humans perceive the personality of system utterances in the way that the system intended.},

The multimodal affect detector uses feature-level fusion to combine the sensory channels and linear discriminant analyses to discriminate between naturally occurring experiences of boredom, engagement/flow, confusion, frustration, delight, and neutral. Training and validation data for the affect detector were collected in a study where 28 learners completed a 32- min. tutorial session with AutoTutor, an intelligent tutoring system with conversational dialogue. Classification results supported a channel judgment type interaction, where the face was the most diagnostic channel for spontaneous affect judgments (i.e., at any time in the tutorial session), while conversational cues were superior for fixed judgments (i.e., every 20 s in the session). The analyses also indicated that the accuracy of the multichannel model (face, dialogue, and posture) was statistically higher than the best single-channel model for the fixed but not spontaneous affect expressions. However, multichannel models reduced the discrepancy (i.e., variance in the precision of the different emotions) of the discriminant models for both judgment types. The results also indicated that the combination of channels yielded superadditive effects for some affective states, but additive, redundant, and inhibitory effects for others. We explore the structure of the multimodal linear discriminant models and discuss the implications of some of our major findings.},

Machine learning algorithms were used to build statistical predictive models of skill.

abstract = {In this paper we propose a query expansion and user profile enrichment approach to improve the performance of recommender systems operating on a folksonomy, storing and classifying the tags used to label a set of available resources. Our approach builds and maintains a profile for each user. When he submits a query (consisting of a set of tags) on this folksonomy to retrieve a set of resources of his interest, it automatically finds further "authoritative" tags to enrich his query and proposes them to him. All "authoritative" tags considered interesting by the user are exploited to refine his query and, along with those tags directly specified by him, are stored in his profile in such a way to enrich it. The expansion of user queries and the enrichment of user profiles allow any content-based recommender system operating on the folksonomy to retrieve and suggest a high number of resources matching with user needs and desires. Moreover, enriched user profiles can guide any collaborative filtering recommender system to proactively discover and suggest to a user many resources relevant to him, even if he has not explicitly searched for them.},

abstract = {With many daily tasks now performed on the Internet, productivity and efficiency in working with web pages have become transversal necessities for all users. Many of these tasks involve the inputting of user information, obligating the user to interact with a webform. Research has demonstrated that productivity depends largely on users' personal characteristics, implying that it will vary from user to user. The webform development process must therefore, include modeling of its intended users to ensure the interface design is appropriate. Taking all potential users into account is difficult, however, primarily because their identity is unknown, and some may be effectively excluded by the final design. Such discrimination can be avoided by incorporating rules that allow webforms to adapt automatically to the individual user's characteristics, the principal one being the person's culture. In this paper we report two studies that validate this option. We begin by determining the relationships between a user's cultural dimension scores and their behavior when faced with a webform. We then validate the notion that rules based on these relationships can be established for the automatic adaptation of a webform in order to reduce the time taken to complete it. We conclude that the automatic webform adaptation to the cultural dimensions of users improves their performance.},

abstract = {Pervasive computing creates possibilities for presenting highly personalised information about the people, places and things in a building. One of the challenges for such personalisation is the creation of the system that can support ontological reasoning for several key tasks: reasoning about location; personalisation of information about location at the right level of detail; and personalisation to match each person's conceptions of the building based on their own use of it and their relationship to other people in the building. From pragmatic perspectives, it should be inexpensive to create the ontology for each new building. It is also critical that users should be able to understand and control pervasive applications. We created the PERSONAF (personalised pervasive scrutable ontological framework) to address these challenges. PERSONAF is a new abstract framework for pervasive ontological reasoning. We report its evaluation at three levels. First, we assessed the power of the ontology for reasoning about noisy and uncertain location information, showing that PERSONAF can improve location modelling. Notably, the best ontological reasoner varies across users. Second, we demonstrate the use of the PERSONAF framework in Adaptive Locator, an application built upon it, using our low cost mechanisms for non-generic layers of the ontology. Finally, we report a user study, which evaluated the PERSONAF approach as seen by users in the Adaptive Locator. We assessed both the personalisation performance and the understandability of explanations of the system reasoning. Together, these three evaluations show that the PERSONAF approach supports building of low cost ontologies, that can achieve flexible ontological reasoning about smart buildings and the people in them, and that this can be used to build applications which give personalised information that can provide understandable explanations of the reasoning underlying the personalisation.},

abstract = {There is evidence suggesting that providing adaptive assistance to collaborative interactions might be a good way of improving the effectiveness of collaborative activities. In this paper, we introduce the Collaborative Tutoring Research Lab (CTRL), a research-oriented framework for adaptive collaborative learning support that enables researchers to combine different types of adaptive support, particularly by using domain-specific models as input to domain-general components in order to create more complex tutoring functionality. Additionally, the framework allows researchers to implement comparison conditions by making it easier to vary single factors of the adaptive intervention. We evaluated CTRL by designing adaptive and fixed support for a peer tutoring setting, and instantiating the framework using those two collaborative scenarios and an individual tutoring scenario. As part of the implementation, we integrated pre-existing components from the Cognitive Tutor Algebra (CTA) with custom-built components. The three conditions were then compared in a controlled classroom study, and the results helped us to contribute to learning sciences research in peer tutoring. CTRL can be generalized to other collaborative scenarios, but the ease of implementation relates to the complexity of the existing components used. CTRL as a framework has yielded a full implementation of an adaptive support system and a controlled evaluation in the classroom.},

This second category includes, in particular, Web 2.0 social annotations and mixed approaches between social annotations and Semantic Web techniques. While the impact of the Semantic Web on adaptive systems has been discussed in several survey papers, the potential of weak semantic technologies has, so far, received little attention. The aim of this analysis is to fill this gap. Therefore, we will discuss contributions and limits of both approaches, but we will focus special attention on weak semantic adaptive systems.},

In the training phase, the user's interest is known, and we learn a mapping from how the user looks at a term to the role of the term in the implicit query. Assuming the mapping is universal, that is, the same for all queries in a given domain, we can use it to construct queries even for new topics for which no learning data is available. We constructed a controlled experimental setting to show that when the system has no prior information as to what the user is searching, the eye movements help significantly in the search. This is the case in a proactive search, for instance, where the system monitors the reading behaviour of the user in a new topic. In contrast, during a search or reading session where the set of inspected documents is biased towards being relevant, a stronger strategy is to search for content-wise similar documents than to use the eye movements.},

abstract = {Most e-Learning systems store data about the learner's actions in log files, which give us detailed information about learner behaviour. Data mining and machine learning techniques can give meaning to these data and provide valuable information for learning improvement. One area that is of particular importance in the design of e-Learning systems is learner motivation as it is a key factor in the quality of learning and in the prevention of attrition. One aspect of motivation is engagement, a necessary condition for effective learning. Using data mining techniques for log file analysis, our research investigates the possibility of predicting users' level of engagement, with a focus on disengaged learners. As demonstrated previously across two different e-Learning systems, HTML-Tutor and iHelp, disengagement can be predicted by monitoring the learners' actions (e.g. reading pages and taking test/quizzes). In this paper we present the findings of three studies that refine this prediction approach. Results from the first study show that two additional reading speed attributes can increase the accuracy of prediction. The second study suggests that distinguishing between two different patterns of disengagement (spending a long time on a page/test and browsing quickly through pages/tests) may improve prediction in some cases. The third study demonstrates the influence of exploratory behaviour on prediction, as most users at the first login familiarize themselves with the system before starting to learn.},

At the same time, critics of US government's No Child Left Behind legislation are calling the bill "No Child Left Untested". Among other things, critics point out that every hour spent assessing students is an hour lost from instruction. But, does it have to be? What if we better integrated assessment into classroom instruction and allowed students to learn during the test? We developed an approach that provides immediate tutoring on practice assessment items that students cannot solve on their own. Our hypothesis is that we can achieve more accurate assessment by not only using data on whether students get test items right or wrong, but by also using data on the effort required for students to solve a test item with instructional assistance. We have integrated assistance and assessment in the ASSISTment system. The system helps teachers make better use of their time by offering instruction to students while providing a more detailed evaluation of student abilities to the teachers, which is impossible under current approaches. Our approach for assessing student math proficiency is to use data that our system collects through its interactions with students to estimate their performance on an end-of-year high stakes state test. Our results show that we can do a reliably better job predicting student end-of-year exam scores by leveraging the interaction data, and the model based on only the interaction information makes better predictions than the traditional assessment model that uses only information about correctness on the test items.},

abstract = {We present a probabilistic model of user affect designed to allow an intelligent agent to recognise multiple user emotions during the interaction with an educational computer game. Our model is based on a probabilistic framework that deals with the high level of uncertainty involved in recognizing a variety of user emotions by combining in a Dynamic Bayesian Network information on both the causes and effects of emotional reactions. The part of the framework that reasons from causes to emotions (diagnostic model) implements a theoretical model of affect, the OCC model, which accounts for how emotions are caused by one's appraisal of the current context in terms of one's goals and preferences. The advantage of using the OCC model is that it provides an affective agent with explicit information not only on which emotions a user feels but also why, thus increasing the agent's capability to effectively respond to the users' emotions. The challenge is that building the model requires having mechanisms to assess user goals and how the environment fits them, a form of plan recognition. In this paper, we illustrate how we built the predictive part of the affective model by combining general theories with empirical studies to adapt the theories to our target application domain. We then present results on the model's accuracy, showing that the model achieves good accuracy on several of the target emotions. We also discuss the model's limitations, to open the ground for the next stage of the work, i.e., complementing the model with diagnostic information.},

abstract = {A critiquing-based recommender system acts like an artificial salesperson. It engages users in a conversational dialog where users can provide feedback in the form of critiques to the sample items that were shown to them. The feedback, in turn, enables the system to refine its understanding of the user's preferences and prediction of what the user truly wants. The system is then able to recommend products that may better stimulate the user's interest in the next interaction cycle. In this paper, we report our extensive investigation of comparing various approaches in devising critiquing opportunities designed in these recommender systems. More specifically, we have investigated two major design elements which are necessary for a critiquing-based recommender system: critiquing coverage--one vs. multiple items that are returned during each recommendation cycle to be critiqued; and critiquing aid--system-suggested critiques (i.e., a set of critique suggestions for users to select) vs. user-initiated critiquing facility (i.e., facilitating users to create critiques on their own). Through a series of three user trials, we have measured how real-users reacted to systems with varied setups of the two elements. In particular, it was found that giving users the choice of critiquing one of multiple items (as opposed to just one) has significantly positive impacts on increasing users' decision accuracy (particularly in the first recommendation cycle) and saving their objective effort (in the later critiquing cycles). As for critiquing aids, the hybrid design with both system-suggested critiques and user-initiated critiquing support exhibits the best performance in inspiring users' decision confidence and increasing their intention to return, in comparison with the uncombined exclusive approaches. Therefore, the results from our studies shed light on the design guidelines for determining the sweetspot balancing user initiative and system support in the development of an effective and user-centric critiquing-based recommender system.},

abstract = {Thousands of users issue keyword queries to the Web search engines to find information on a number of topics. Since the users may have diverse backgrounds and may have different expectations for a given query, some search engines try to personalize their results to better match the overall interests of an individual user. This task involves two great challenges. First the search engines need to be able to effectively identify the user interests and build a profile for every individual user. Second, once such a profile is available, the search engines need to rank the results in a way that matches the interests of a given user. In this article, we present our work towards a personalized Web search engine and we discuss how we addressed each of these challenges. Since users are typically not willing to provide information on their personal preferences, for the first challenge, we attempt to determine such preferences by examining the click history of each user. In particular, we leverage a topical ontology for estimating a user's topic preferences based on her past searches, i.e. previously issued queries and pages visited for those queries. We then explore the semantic similarity between the user's current query and the query-matching pages, in order to identify the user's current topic preference. For the second challenge, we have developed a ranking function that uses the learned past and current topic preferences in order to rank the search results to better match the preferences of a given user. Our experimental evaluation on the Google query-stream of human subjects over a period of 1 month shows that user preferences can be learned accurately through the use of our topical ontology and that our ranking function which takes into account the learned user preferences yields significant improvements in the quality of the search results.},

abstract = {Personalization is considered a powerful methodology for improving the effectiveness of information search and decision making. It has led to the dissemination of systems capable of suggesting relevant and personalized information (or items) to the users, according to their characteristics and preferences, as represented by a User Model (UM). Since the quality of the personalization largely depends on the size and accuracy of the managed UMs, it would be beneficial to enrich the UMs by mediating, i.e., importing and integrating, UMs built by other personalization systems. This work discusses and evaluates a cross-representation mediation of UMs from collaborative filtering to content-based recommender systems. According to this approach, a content-based recommender system, having partial or no UM data, can generate recommendations for users by mediating UM data of the same users, collected by a collaborative filtering system. The mediation process transforms the UMs from the collaborative filtering ratings to the content-based weighted item features. The mediation process exploits the item descriptions that are typically not used by the collaborative filtering recommender systems. An experimental evaluation conducted in the domain of movies shows that for users with small collaborative filtering UMs, i.e., users with few item ratings, the accuracy of the recommendations provided using the mediated content-based UMs is superior to that using the original collaborative filtering UMs. Moreover, it shows that the mediation can be used to improve a content-based recommender system by incrementally mediating collaborative filtering UM data (item ratings) and enriching the available content-based UMs.},

abstract = {Collaborative filtering systems are essentially social systems which base their recommendation on the judgment of a large number of people. However, like other social systems, they are also vulnerable to manipulation by malicious social elements. Lies and Propaganda may be spread by a malicious user who may have an interest in promoting an item, or downplaying the popularity of another one. By doing this systematically, with either multiple identities, or by involving more people, malicious user votes and profiles can be injected into a collaborative recommender system. This can significantly affect the robustness of a system or algorithm, as has been studied in previous work. While current detection algorithms are able to use certain characteristics of shilling profiles to detect them, they suffer from low precision, and require a large amount of training data. In this work, we provide an in-depth analysis of shilling profiles and describe new approaches to detect malicious collaborative filtering profiles. In particular, we exploit the similarity structure in shilling user profiles to separate them from normal user profiles using unsupervised dimensionality reduction. We present two detection algorithms; one based on PCA, while the other uses PLSA. Experimental results show a much improved detection precision over existing methods without the usage of additional training time required for supervised approaches. Finally, we present a novel and highly effective robust collaborative filtering algorithm which uses ideas presented in the detection algorithms using principal component analysis.},

They typically exploit explicit or implicit user feedback such as ratings, buying records or clickstream data and apply statistical methods to derive recommendations. This paper focuses on explicitly formulated customer requirements as the sole type of user feedback. Its contribution lies in comparing different techniques such as knowledge- and utility-based methods, collaborative filtering, association rule mining as well as hybrid variants when user models consist solely of explicit customer requirements. We examine how this type of user feedback can be exploited for personalization in e-commerce scenarios. Furthermore, examples of actual online shops are developed where such contextual user information is available, demonstrating how more efficient RS configurations can be implemented. Results indicate that, especially for new users, explicit customer requirements are a useful source of feedback for personalization and hybrid configurations of collaborative and knowledge-based techniques achieve best results.},

The useful information discovered can be used directly by the teacher or author of the course in order to improve instructional/learning performance. This can, however, imply a lot of work for the teacher who can greatly benefit from the help of educational recommender systems for doing this task. In this paper we propose a system oriented to find, share and suggest the most appropriate modifications to improve the effectiveness of the course. We describe an iterative methodology to develop and carry out the maintenance of web-based courses to which we have added a specific data mining step. We apply association rule mining to discover interesting information through students' usage data in the form of IF-THEN recommendation rules. We have also used a collaborative recommender system to share and score the recommendation rules obtained by teachers with similar profiles along with other experts in education. Finally, we have carried out experiments with several real groups of students using a web-based adaptive course. The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed architecture constitutes a good starting point to future investigations in order to generalize the results over many course contents.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present an application for character-based guided tours on mobile devices. The application is based on the Dramatour methodology for information presentation, which incorporates a dramatic attitude in character-based presentations. The application has been developed for a historical site and is based on a virtual character, "Carletto", a spider with an anthropomorphic aspect, who engages in a dramatized presentation of the site. Content items are delivered in a location-aware fashion, relying on a wireless network infrastructure, with visitors who can stroll freely. The selection of contents keeps track of user location and of the interaction history, in order to deliver the appropriate type and quantity of informative items, and to manage the given/new distinction in discourse. The communicative strategy of the character is designed to keep it believable along the interaction with the user, while enforcing dramatization effects. The design of the communicative strategy relies on the fact that the units of the presentation are tagged with metadata concerning their content and communicative function. The description of the application is accompanied by an evaluation study based on a sample of about 300 visitors, carried out in April 2006, when the installation was open to the public for 1 week.},

abstract = {This paper aims to demonstrate that the principles of adaptation and user modeling, especially social annotation, can be integrated fruitfully with those of the web 2.0 paradigm and thereby enhance in the domain of cultural heritage. We propose a framework for improving recommender systems through exploiting the users tagging activity. We maintain that web 2.0's participative features can be exploited by adaptive web-based systems in order to enrich and extend the user model, improve social navigation and enrich information from a bottom-up perspective. Thus our approach stresses social annotation as a new and powerful kind of feedback and as a way to infer knowledge about users. The prototype implementation of our framework in the domain of cultural heritage is named iCITY. It is serving to demonstrate the validity of our approach and to highlight the benefits of this approach specifically for cultural heritage. iCITY is an adaptive, social, multi-device recommender guide that provides information about the cultural resources and events promoting the cultural heritage in the city of Torino. Our paper first describes this system and then discusses the results of a set of evaluations that were carried out at different stages of the systems development and aimed at validating the framework and implementation of this specific prototype. In particular, we carried out a heuristic evaluation and two sets of usability tests, aimed at checking the usability of the user interface, specifically of the adaptive behavior of the system. Moreover, we conducted evaluations aimed at investigating the role of tags in the definition of the user model and the impact of tags on the accuracy of recommendations. Our results are encouraging.},

abstract = {The increasing availability of (digital) cultural heritage artefacts offers great potential for increased access to art content, but also necessitates tools to help users deal with such abundance of information. User-adaptive art recommender systems aim to present their users with art content tailored to their interests. These systems try to adapt to the user based on feedback from the user on which artworks he or she finds interesting. Users need to be able to depend on the system to competently adapt to their feedback and find the artworks that are most interesting to them. This paper investigates the influence of transparency on user trust in and acceptance of content-based recommender systems. A between-subject experiment (  N  = 60) evaluated interaction with three versions of a content-based art recommender in the cultural heritage domain. This recommender system provides users with artworks that are of interest to them, based on their ratings of other artworks. Version 1 was not transparent, version 2 explained to the user why a recommendation had been made and version 3 showed a rating of how certain the system was that a recommendation would be of interest to the user. Results show that explaining to the user why a recommendation was made increased acceptance of the recommendations. Trust in the system itself was not improved by transparency. Showing how certain the system was of a recommendation did not influence trust and acceptance. A number of guidelines for design of recommender systems in the cultural heritage domain have been derived from the study's results.},

abstract = {Modern personalized information systems have been proven to support the user with information at the appropriate level and in the appropriate form. In specific environments like museums and exhibitions, focusing on the control of such a system is contradictory to establishing a relationship with the artifacts and exhibits. Preferably, the technology becomes invisible to the user and the physical reality becomes the interface to an additional virtual layer: by naturally moving in the space and/or manipulating physical objects in our surroundings the user will access information and operate the virtual layer. The LISTEN project is an attempt to make use of the inherent "everyday" integration of aural and visual perception, developing a tailored, immersive audio-augmented environment for the visitors of art exhibitions. The challenge of the LISTEN project is to provide a personalized immersive augmented environment, an aim which goes beyond the guiding purpose. The visitors of the museum implicitly interact with the system because the audio presentation is adapted to the users' contexts (e.g. interests, preferences, motion, etc.), providing an intelligent audio-based environment. This article describes the realization and user evaluation of the LISTEN system focusing on the personalization component. As this system has been installed at the Kunstmuseum Bonn in the context of an exhibition comprising artworks of the painter August Macke, a detailed evaluation could be conducted.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore human tutors' inferences in relation to learners' affective states and the relationship between those inferences and the actions that tutors take as their consequence. At the core of the investigations presented in this paper lie fundamental questions associated with the role of affective considerations in computer-mediated educational interactions. Theory of linguistic politeness is used as the basis for determining the contextual factors relevant to human tutors's actions, with special attention being dedicated to learner affective states. A study was designed to determine what affective states of the learners are relevant to tutoring mathematics and to identify the mechanisms used by tutors to predict such states. Logs of tutor-student dialogues were recorded along with contextual factors taken into consideration by tutors in relation to their specific tutorial dialogue moves. The logs were annotated in order to determine the types and range of student and tutor actions. Machine learning techniques were then applied to those actions to predict the values of three factors:  student confidence ,  interest  and  effort . Whilst due to limited size and sparsity of data the results are not conclusive, they are very valuable as the basis for empirically derived hypotheses to be tested in further studies. The potential implications of the hypotheses, if they were confirmed by further studies, are discussed in relation to the impact of tutor's ability to diagnose student affect on the nature of computer-mediated tutorial interactions.},

abstract = {Self-efficacy is an individual's belief about her ability to perform well in a given situation. Because self-efficacious students are effective learners, endowing intelligent tutoring systems with the ability to diagnose self-efficacy could lead to improved pedagogy. Self-efficacy is influenced by (and influences) affective state. Thus, physiological data might be used to predict a student's level of self-efficacy. This article investigates an inductive approach to automatically constructing models of self-efficacy that can be used at runtime to inform pedagogical decisions. It reports on two complementary empirical studies. In the first study, two families of self-efficacy models were induced: a static self-efficacy model, learned solely from pre-test (non-intrusively collected) data, and a dynamic self-efficacy model, learned from both pre-test data as well as runtime physiological data collected with a biofeedback apparatus. In the second empirical study, a similar experimental design was applied to an interactive narrative-centered learning environment. Self-efficacy models were induced from combinations of static and dynamic information, including pre-test data, physiological data, and observations of student behavior in the learning environment. The highest performing induced na\"{\i}ve Bayes models correctly classified 85.2% of instances in the first empirical study and 82.1% of instances in the second empirical study. The highest performing decision tree models correctly classified 86.9% of instances in the first study and 87.3% of instances in the second study.},

abstract = {The `traditional' first two dimensions in emotion research are VALENCE and AROUSAL. Normally, they are obtained by using elicited, acted data. In this paper, we use realistic, spontaneous speech data from our `AIBO' corpus (human-robot communication, children interacting with Sony's AIBO robot). The recordings were done in a Wizard-of-Oz scenario: the children believed that AIBO obeys their commands; in fact, AIBO followed a fixed script and often disobeyed. Five labellers annotated each word as belonging to one of eleven emotion-related states; seven of these states which occurred frequently enough are dealt with in this paper. The confusion matrices of these labels were used in a Non-Metrical Multi-dimensional Scaling to display two dimensions; the first we interpret as VALENCE, the second, however, not as AROUSAL but as INTERACTION, i.e., addressing oneself (  angry, joyful ) or the communication partner (  motherese, reprimanding ). We show that it depends on the specifity of the scenario and on the subjects' conceptualizations whether this new dimension can be observed, and discuss impacts on the practice of labelling and processing emotional data. Two-dimensional solutions based on acoustic and linguistic features that were used for automatic classification of these emotional states are interpreted along the same lines.},

We test this hypothesis in the context of our spoken dialogue tutoring system, where student learning is the primary performance metric. We first present our system and corpora, which have been annotated with several student affective states, student correctness and discourse structure. We then discuss unigram and bigram parameters derived from these annotations. The unigram parameters represent each annotation type individually, as well as system-generic features. The bigram parameters represent annotation combinations, including student state sequences and student states in the discourse structure context. We then use these parameters to build learning models. First, we build simple models based on correlations between each of our parameters and learning. Our results suggest that our affect parameters are among our most useful predictors of learning, particularly in specific discourse structure contexts. Next, we use the PARADISE framework (multiple linear regression) to build complex learning models containing only the most useful subset of parameters. Our approach is a value-added one; we perform a number of model-building experiments, both with and without including our affect parameters, and then compare the performance of the models on the training and the test sets. Our results show that when included as inputs, our affect parameters are selected as predictors in most models, and many of these models show high generalizability in testing. Our results also show that overall, the affect-included models significantly outperform the affect-excluded models.},

abstract = {We explored the reliability of detecting a learner's affect from conversational features extracted from interactions with AutoTutor, an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) that helps students learn by holding a conversation in natural language. Training data were collected in a learning session with AutoTutor, after which the affective states of the learner were rated by the learner, a peer, and two trained judges. Inter-rater reliability scores indicated that the classifications of the trained judges were more reliable than the novice judges. Seven data sets that temporally integrated the affective judgments with the dialogue features of each learner were constructed. The first four datasets corresponded to the judgments of the learner, a peer, and two trained judges, while the remaining three data sets combined judgments of two or more raters. Multiple regression analyses confirmed the hypothesis that dialogue features could significantly predict the affective states of boredom, confusion, flow, and frustration. Machine learning experiments indicated that standard classifiers were moderately successful in discriminating the affective states of boredom, confusion, flow, frustration, and neutral, yielding a peak accuracy of 42% with neutral (  chance  = 20%) and 54% without neutral (  chance  = 25%). Individual detections of boredom, confusion, flow, and frustration, when contrasted with neutral affect, had maximum accuracies of 69, 68, 71, and 78%, respectively (  chance  = 50%). The classifiers that operated on the emotion judgments of the trained judges and combined models outperformed those based on judgments of the novices (i.e., the self and peer). Follow-up classification analyses that assessed the degree to which machine-generated affect labels correlated with affect judgments provided by humans revealed that human-machine agreement was on par with novice judges (self and peer) but quantitatively lower than trained judges. We discuss the prospects of extending AutoTutor into an affect-sensing ITS.},

abstract = {An approach for capturing and modeling individual entertainment ("fun") preferences is applied to users of the innovative Playware playground, an interactive physical playground inspired by computer games, in this study. The goal is to construct, using representative statistics computed from children's physiological signals, an estimator of the degree to which games provided by the playground engage the players. For this purpose children's heart rate (HR) signals, and their expressed preferences of how much "fun" particular game variants are, are obtained from experiments using games implemented on the Playware playground. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that children's reported entertainment preferences correlate well with specific features of the HR signal. Neuro-evolution techniques combined with feature set selection methods permit the construction of user models that predict reported entertainment preferences given HR features. These models are expressed as artificial neural networks and are demonstrated and evaluated on two Playware games and two control tasks requiring physical activity. The best network is able to correctly match expressed preferences in 64% of cases on previously unseen data (  p  value 6 · 10  5 ). The generality of the methodology, its limitations, its usability as a real-time feedback mechanism for entertainment augmentation and as a validation tool are discussed.},

To develop this model, we chose the ACT-R cognitive architecture, which uses symbolic and subsymbolic representations.

The results of an empirical study in an online learning course point at benefits of the generated feedback to both instructors and students. Teachers can get a better understanding of their students by knowing what problems they may be facing, when they are behind or ahead of their peers, who can help them and how, and what roles can be assigned in discussion forums. This, in turn, can have a positive effect on students who can receive feedback tailored to their needs and problems.

In this work we present a framework that gives a systematic overview of alternative assumptions. On the basis of the framework we can select a set of assumptions that best matches the navigation behavior of the users in the site's log files. We also present a method for optimizing hierarchical navigation menus on the basis of the selected assumptions. This method can be used interactively under full control of a web master. The system proposes modifications of the structure and explains why these modifications lead to more efficient menus. Evaluation by means of a case study shows that the modifications that are proposed effectively reduce the expected navigation time while preserving the coherence of the menu structure.},

We have defined a novel integrated framework for museum visits and claim that such a framework is essential in such a vast domain that inherently implies complex interactivity. We found that it requires a significant investment in software and hardware infrastructure, design and implementation of intelligent interfaces, and a systematic and iterative evaluation of the design and functionality of user interfaces, involving actual visitors at every stage. We defined and built a suite of interactive and user-adaptive technologies for museum visitors, which was then evaluated at the Buonconsiglio Castle in Trento, Italy: (1) animated agents that help motivate visitors and focus their attention when necessary, (2) automatically generated, adaptive video documentaries on mobile devices, and (3) automatically generated post-visit summaries that reflect the individual interests of visitors as determined by their behavior and choices during their visit. These components are supported by underlying user modeling and inference mechanisms that allow for adaptivity and personalization. Novel software infrastructure allows for agent connectivity and fusion of multiple positioning data streams in the museum space. We conducted several experiments, focusing on various aspects of PEACH. In one, conducted with 110 visitors, we found evidence that even older users are comfortable interacting with a major component of the system.},

Moreover, robust clustering, capable of correcting the bias of individual clustering techniques, is used to obtain a deeper understanding. The robust clustering approach produced results that highlighted the relevance of cognitive style for user behavior, i.e., cognitive style dominates and justifies each of the robust clusters created. We also found that perception was mainly determined by the level of expertise of a user. We conclude that robust clustering is an effective technique to analyze user behavior and perception.},

abstract = {Collaborative and content-based filtering are the recommendation techniques most widely adopted to date. Traditional collaborative approaches compute a similarity value between the current user and each other user by taking into account their rating style, that is the set of ratings given on the  same  items. Based on the ratings of the most similar users, commonly referred to as  neighbors , collaborative algorithms compute recommendations for the current user. The problem with this approach is that the similarity value is only computable if users have common rated items. The main contribution of this work is a possible solution to overcome this limitation. We propose a new content-collaborative hybrid recommender which computes similarities between users relying on their content-based profiles, in which user preferences are stored, instead of comparing their rating styles. In more detail, user profiles are clustered to discover current user neighbors. Content-based user profiles play a key role in the proposed hybrid recommender. Traditional keyword-based approaches to user profiling are unable to capture the semantics of user interests. A distinctive feature of our work is the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning  semantic  user profiles representing user interests in a more effective way, compared to classical keyword-based profiles, due to a sense-based indexing. Semantic profiles are obtained by integrating machine learning algorithms for text categorization, namely a na\"{\i}ve Bayes approach and a relevance feedback method, with a word sense disambiguation strategy based exclusively on the lexical knowledge stored in the WordNet lexical database. Experiments carried out on a content-based extension of the EachMovie dataset show an improvement of the accuracy of sense-based profiles with respect to keyword-based ones, when coping with the task of classifying movies as interesting (or not) for the current user. An experimental session has been also performed in order to evaluate the proposed hybrid recommender system. The results highlight the improvement in the predictive accuracy of collaborative recommendations obtained by selecting like-minded users according to user profiles.},

This paper presents a novel technique for efficient reasoning about sets of such preference statements in a semantically rigorous manner. Specifically, we propose a novel approach for generating an ordinal utility function from a set of qualitative preference statements, drawing upon techniques from knowledge representation and machine learning. We provide theoretical evidence that the new method provides an efficient and expressive tool for reasoning about ordinal user preferences. Empirical results further confirm that the new method is effective on real-world data, making it promising for a wide spectrum of applications that require modeling and reasoning about user preferences.},

abstract = {Command and control (C&amp;C) speech recognition allows users to interact with a system by speaking commands or asking questions restricted to a fixed grammar containing pre-defined phrases. Whereas C&amp;C interaction has been commonplace in telephony and accessibility systems for many years, only recently have mobile devices had the memory and processing capacity to support client-side speech recognition. Given the personal nature of mobile devices, statistical models that can predict commands based in part on past user behavior hold promise for improving C&amp;C recognition accuracy. For example, if a user calls a spouse at the end of every workday, the language model could be adapted to weight the spouse more than other contacts during that time. In this paper, we describe and assess statistical models learned from a large population of users for predicting the next user command of a commercial C&amp;C application. We explain how these models were used for language modeling, and evaluate their performance in terms of task completion. The best performing model achieved a 26% relative reduction in error rate compared to the base system. Finally, we investigate the effects of personalization on performance at different learning rates via online updating of model parameters based on individual user data. Personalization significantly increased relative reduction in error rate by an additional 5%.},

abstract = {Recommender systems represent a class of personalized systems that aim at predicting a user's interest on information items available in the application domain, operating upon user-driven ratings on items and/or item features. One of the most widely used recommendation methods is collaborative filtering that exploits the assumption that users who have agreed in the past in their ratings on observed items will eventually agree in the future. Despite the success of recommendation methods and collaborative filtering in particular, in real-world applications they suffer from the insufficient number of available ratings, which significantly affects the accuracy of prediction. In this paper, we propose recommendation approaches that follow the collaborative filtering reasoning and utilize the notion of lifestyle as an effective user characteristic that can group consumers in terms of their behavior as indicated in consumer behavior and marketing theory. Emanating from a basic lifestyle-based recommendation algorithm we incrementally proceed to the development of hybrid recommendation approaches that address certain dimensions of the sparsity problem and empirically evaluate them providing further evidence of their effectiveness.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to student modeling in which knowledge is represented by means of probability distributions associated to a tree of concepts. A diagnosis procedure which uses adaptive testing is part of this approach. Adaptive tests provide well-founded and accurate diagnosis thanks to the underlying probabilistic theory, i.e., the  Item Response Theory . Most adaptive testing proposals are based on dichotomous models, where he student answer can only be considered either correct or incorrect. In the work described here, a polytomous model has been used, i.e., answers can be given partial credits. Thus, models are more informative and diagnosis is more efficient. This paper also presents an algorithm for estimating question characteristic curves, which are necessary in order to apply the Item Response Theory to a given domain and hence must be inferred before testing begins. Most prior estimation procedures need huge sets of data. We have modified preexisting procedures in such a way that data requirements are significantly reduced. Finally, this paper presents the results of some controlled evaluations that have been carried out in order to analyze the feasibility and advantages of this approach.},

abstract = {Users of web sites often do not know exactly which information they are looking for nor what the site has to offer. The purpose of their interaction is not only to fulfill but also to articulate their information needs. In these cases users need to pass through a series of pages before they can use the information that will eventually answer their questions. Current systems that support navigation predict which pages are interesting for the users on the basis of commonalities in the contents or the usage of the pages. They do not take into account the order in which the pages must be visited. In this paper we propose a method to automatically divide the pages of a web site on the basis of user logs into sets of pages that correspond to navigation stages. The method searches for an optimal number of stages and assigns each page to a stage. The stages can be used in combination with the pages' topics to give better recommendations or to structure or adapt the site. The resulting navigation structures guide the users step by step through the site providing pages that do not only match the topic of the user's search, but also the current stage of the navigation process.},

abstract = {Probabilistic and learned approaches to student modeling are attractive because of the uncertainty surrounding the student skills assessment and because of the need to automatize the process. Item to item structures readily lend themselves to probabilistic and fully learned models because they are solely composed of observable nodes, like answers to test questions. Their structure is also well grounded in the cognitive theory of  knowledge spaces . We study the effectiveness of two Bayesian frameworks to learn item to item structures and to use the induced structures to predict item outcome from a subset of evidence. One approach, Partial Order Knowledge Structures (POKS), relies on a naive Bayes framework whereas the other is based on the Bayesian network (BN) learning and inference framework. Both approaches are assessed over their predictive ability and their computational efficiency in different experimental simulations. The results from simulations over three data sets show that they both can effectively perform accurate predictions, but POKS generally displays higher predictive power than the BN. Moreover, the simplicity of POKS translates to a time efficiency between one to three orders of magnitude greater than the BN runs. We further explore the use of the item to item approach for handling concepts mastery assessment. The approach investigated consist in augmenting an initial set of observations, based on inferences with the item to item structure, and feed the augmented set to a BN containing a number of concepts. The results show that augmented set can effectively improve predictive power of a BN for item outcome, but that improvement does not transfer to the concept assessment in this particular experiment. We discuss different explanations for the results and outline future research avenues.},

abstract = {A user that navigates on the Web using different devices should be characterized by a global profile, which represents his behaviour when using all these devices. Then, the user's profile could be usefully exploited when interacting with a site agent that is able to provide useful recommendations on the basis of the user's interests, on one hand, and to adapt the site presentation to the device currently exploited by the user, on the other hand. However, it is not suitable to construct such a global profile by a software running on the exploited device since this device (e.g., a mobile phone or a palmtop) may have limited resources. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a multi-agent architecture, called MASHA, handling user and device adaptivity of Web sites, in which each device is provided with a client agent that autonomously collects information about the user's behaviour associated to just that device. However, the user profile contained in this client is continuously updated with information coming from a unique server agent, associated with the user. Such information is collected by the server agent from the different devices exploited by the user, and represents a global user profile. The third component of this architecture, called  adapter agent , is capable to generate a personalized representation of the Web site, containing some useful recommendations derived by both an analysis of the user profile and the suggestions coming from other users exploiting the same device.},

abstract = {A linguistic, pedagogic and technological framework for an ICALL system called COPPER is presented here, where individual and collaborative learning are combined within a constructivist approach to facilitate second language learning. Based upon the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, the ability to use language is viewed as one of several cognitive competences that are mobilised and modified when individuals communicate. To combine the different types of learning underlying the European Framework, a student model has been developed for COPPER that represents linguistic competences in a detailed way, combining high granularity expert-centric Bayesian networks with multidimensional stereotypes, and is updated following student activities semi-automatically. Instances of this model are used by an adaptive group formation algorithm that dynamically generates communicative groups based upon the linguistic capabilities of available students, and a collection of collaborative activity templates. As well as the student model, which is a representation of individual linguistic knowledge, preferences, etc., there is a group model, which is a representation of how a set of students works together. The results of a student's activity within a group are evaluated by a student monitor, with more advanced linguistic competences, thereby sidestepping the difficulties present when using NLP techniques to automatically analyse non-restricted linguistic production. The monitor role empowers students and further consolidates what has been previously learnt. Students therefore initially work individually in this framework on certain linguistic concepts, and subsequently participate in authentic collaborative communicative activities, where their linguistic competences can develop approximately as they would in `real foreign language immersion experiences'.},

abstract = {Most online communities, such as discussion forums, file-sharing communities, e-learning communities, and others, suffer from insufficient user participation in their initial phase of development. Therefore, it is important to provide incentives to encourage participation, until the community reaches a critical mass and "takes off". However, too much participation, especially of low-quality can also be detrimental for the community, since it leads to information overload, which makes users leave the community. Therefore, to regulate the quality and the quantity of user contributions and ensure a sustainable level of user participation in the online community, it is important to adapt the rewards for particular forms of participation for individual users depending on their reputation and the current needs of the community. An incentive mechanism with these properties is proposed. The main idea is to measure and reward the desirable user activities and compute a user participation measure, then cluster the users based on their participation measure into different classes, which have different status in the community and enjoy special privileges. For each user, the reward for each type of activity is computed dynamically based on a model of community needs and an individual user model. The model of the community needs predicts what types of contributions (e.g. more new papers or more ratings) are most valuable at the current moment for the community. The individual model predicts the style of contributions of the user based on her past performance (whether the user tends to make high-quality contributions or not, whether she fairly rates the contributions of others). The adaptive rewards are displayed to the user at the beginning of each session and the user can decide what form of contribution to make considering the rewards that she will earn. The mechanism was evaluated in an online class resource-sharing system, Comtella. The results indicate that the mechanism successfully encourages stable and active user participation; it lowers the level of information overload and therefore enhances the sustainability of the community.},

abstract = {Today a great many medical schools have turned to a problem-based learning (PBL) approach to teaching as an alternative to traditional didactic medical education to teach clinical-reasoning skills at the early stages of medical education. While PBL has many strengths, effective PBL tutoring is time-intensive and requires the tutor to provide a high degree of personal attention to the students, which is difficult in the current academic environment of increasing demands on faculty time. This paper describes the student modeling approach used in the COMET intelligent tutoring system for collaborative medical PBL. To generate appropriate tutorial actions, COMET uses a model of each student's clinical reasoning for the problem domain. In addition, since problem solving in group PBL is a collaborative process, COMET uses a group model that enables it to do things like focus the group discussion, promote collaboration, and suggest peer helpers. Bayesian networks are used to model individual student knowledge and activity, as well as that of the group. The validity of the modeling approach has been tested with student models in the areas of head injury, stroke, and heart attack. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis shows that the models are highly accurate in predicting individual student actions. Comparison with human tutors shows that the focus of group activity determined by the model agrees with that suggested by the majority of the human tutors with a high degree of statistical agreement (McNemar test,  p  = 0.774, Kappa = 0.823).},

abstract = {In groupware, users must communicate about their intentions and aintain common knowledge via communication channels that are explicitly designed into the system. Depending upon the task, generic communication tools like chat or a shared whiteboard may not be sufficient to support effective coordination. We have previously reported on a methodology that helps the designer develop task specific communication tools, called coordinating representations, for groupware systems. Coordinating representations lend structure and persistence to coordinating information. We have shown that coordinating representations are readily adopted by a user population, reduce coordination errors, and improve performance in a domain task. As we show in this article, coordinating representations present a unique opportunity to acquire user information in collaborative, user-adapted systems. Because coordinating representations support the exchange of coordinating information, they offer a window onto task and coordination-specific knowledge that is shared by users. Because they add structure to communication, the information that passes through them can be easily exploited by adaptive technology. This approach provides a simple technique for acquiring user knowledge in collaborative, user-adapted systems. We document our application of this approach to an existing groupware system. Several empirical results are provided. First, we show how information that is made available by a coordinating representation can be used to infer user intentions. We also show how this information can be used to mine free text chat for intent information, and show that this information further enhances intent inference. Empirical data shows that an automatic plan generation component, which is driven by information from a coordinating representation, reduces coordination errors and cognitive effort for its users. Finally, our methodology is summarized, and we present a framework for comparing our approach to other strategies for user knowledge acquisition in adaptive systems.},

abstract = {This paper deals in depth with some of the emotions that play a role in a group recommender system, which recommends sequences of items to a group of users. First, it describes algorithms to model and predict the satisfaction experienced by individuals. Satisfaction is treated as an affective state. In particular, we model the decay of emotion over time and assimilation effects, where the affective state produced by previous items influences the impact on satisfaction of the next item. We compare the algorithms with each other, and investigate the effect of parameter values by comparing the algorithms' predictions with the results of an earlier empirical study. We discuss the difficulty of evaluating affective models, and present an experiment in a learning domain to show how some empirical evaluation can be done. Secondly, this paper proposes modifications to the algorithms to deal with the effect on an individual's satisfaction of that of others in the group. In particular, we model emotional contagion and conformity, and consider the impact of different relationship types. Thirdly, this paper explores the issue of privacy (feeling safe, not accidentally disclosing private tastes to others in the group) which is related to the emotion of embarrassment. It investigates the effect on privacy of different group aggregation strategies and proposes to add a virtual member to the group to further improve privacy.},

abstract = {Our long-term research goal is to provide cognitive tutoring of collaboration within a collaborative software environment. This is a challenging goal, as intelligent tutors have traditionally focused on cognitive skills, rather than on the skills necessary to collaborate successfully. In this paper, we describe progress we have made toward this goal. Our first step was to devise a process known as  bootstrapping novice data  (BND), in which student problem-solving actions are collected and used to begin the development of a tutor. Next, we implemented BND by integrating a collaborative software tool, Cool Modes, with software designed to develop cognitive tutors (i.e., the cognitive tutor authoring tools). Our initial implementation of BND provides a means to directly capture data as a foundation for a collaboration tutor but does not yet fully support tutoring. Our next step was to perform two exploratory studies in which dyads of students used our integrated BND software to collaborate in solving modeling tasks. The data collected from these studies led us to identify five dimensions of collaborative and problem-solving behavior that point to the need for abstraction of student actions to better recognize, analyze, and provide feedback on collaboration. We also interviewed a domain expert who provided evidence for the advantage of bootstrapping over manual creation of a collaboration tutor. We discuss plans to use these analyses to inform and extend our tools so that we can eventually reach our goal of tutoring collaboration.},

abstract = {Representation components of user modeling servers have been traditionally based on simple file structures and database systems. We propose directory systems as an alternative, which offer numerous advantages over the more traditional approaches: international vendor-independent standardization, demonstrated performance and scalability, dynamic and transparent management of distributed information, built-in replication and synchronization, a rich number of pre-defined types of user information, and extensibility of the core representation language for new information types and for data types with associated semantics. Directories also allow for the virtual centralization of distributed user models and their selective centralized replication if better performance is needed. We present UMS, a user modeling server that is based on the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). UMS allows for the representation of different models (such as user and usage profiles, and system and service models), and for the attachment of arbitrary components that perform user modeling tasks upon these models. External clients such as user-adaptive applications can submit and retrieve information about users. We describe a simulation experiment to test the runtime performance of this server, and present a theory of how the parameters of such an experiment can be derived from empirical web usage research. The results show that the performance of UMS meets the requirements of current small and medium websites already on very modest hardware platforms, and those of very large websites in an entry-level business server configuration.},

abstract = {Despite a plethora of recommendations for personalization techniques, such approaches often lack empirical justification and their benefits to users remain obscure. The study described in this paper takes a step towards filling this gap by introducing an evidence-based approach for deriving adaptive interaction techniques. In a dialogue experiment with 36 dyads of computer experts and laypersons, we observed how experts tailored their written explanations to laypersons' communicational needs. To support adaptation, the experts in the experimental condition were provided with information about the layperson's knowledge level. In the control condition, the experts had no available information. During the composition of their answers, the experts in both conditions articulated their planning activities. Compared with the control condition, the experts in the experimental condition made a greater attempt to form a mental model about the layperson's knowledge. As a result, they varied the type and proportion of the information they provided depending on the layperson's individual knowledge level. Accordingly, such adaptive explanations helped laypersons reduce comprehension breakdowns and acquire new knowledge. These results provide evidence for theoretical assumptions regarding cognitive processes in text production and conversation. They empirically ground and advance techniques for adaptation of content in adaptive hypermedia systems. They are suggestive of ways in which explanations in recommender and decision support systems could be effectively adapted to the user's knowledge background and goals.},

This paper first introduces three alternative strategies to achieve program recommendation for multiple television viewers, discusses, and analyzes their advantages and disadvantages respectively, and then chooses the strategy based on user profile merging as our solution. The selected strategy first merges all user profiles to construct a common user profile, and then uses a recommendation approach to generate a common program recommendation list for the group according to the merged user profile. This paper then describes in detail the user profile merging scheme, the key technology of the strategy, which is based on total distance minimization. The evaluation results proved that the merging result can appropriately reflect the preferences of the majority of members within the group, and the proposed recommendation strategy is effective for multiple viewers watching TV together.},

The paper outlines the role of our model of relative perceptual task effort in recognizing the intended message of an information graphic.

In this paper, we present a new approach to modeling cognitive abilities that relies on basic mental functionalities. We describe the Cognitive User Modeling for Adaptive Presentation of Hyper-Documents (CUMAPH) environment, which mainly provides an authoring tool and an adaptation engine. The aim of this environment is to adapt a hyper-document presentation by selecting the elements that best fit the user cognitive profile. Its architecture is based on four main components: a cognitive user model, a hyper-document builder, an adaptation engine and a generic style sheet. To validate our approach, we designed an innovative protocol and conducted an experimental study involving 39 students. The first results show that an adaptive presentation can significantly increase the efficiency of hypermedia presentations.},

abstract = {A user-centred design approach involves end-users from the very beginning. Considering users at the early stages compels designers to think in terms of utility and usability and helps develop a system based on what is actually needed. This paper discusses the case of HyperAudio, a context-sensitive adaptive and mobile museum guide developed in the late 1990s. User requirements were collected via a survey to understand visitors' profiles and visit styles in natural science museums. The knowledge acquired supported the specification of system requirements, helping define the user model, data structure and adaptive behaviour of the system. User requirements guided the design decisions on what could be implemented by using simple adaptable triggers, and what instead needed more sophisticated adaptive techniques. This is a fundamental choice when all the computation must be done on a PDA. Graphical and interactive environments for developing and testing complex adaptive systems are discussed as a further step in an iterative design process that considers the user interaction to be the central point. This paper discusses how such an environment allows designers and developers to experiment with different system behaviours and to widely test it under realistic conditions by simulating the actual context evolving over time. The understanding gained in HyperAudio is then considered from the perspective of later developments: our findings still appers to be valid despite the time that had passed.},

Among the challenges is the general problem of capturing the larger context in interaction from the perspective of user modeling and human---computer interaction (HCI). The imperative to address this issue is great considering the emergence of ubiquitous and mobile computing environments. This paper provides an account of our addressing the specific problem of supporting functionality as well as the experience design issues related to museum visits through user modeling in combination with an audio augmented reality and tangible user interface system. This paper details our deployment and evaluation of ec(h)o --- an augmented audio reality system for museums. We explore the possibility of supporting a context-aware adaptive system by linking environment, interaction objects and users at an abstract semantic level instead of at the content level. From the user modeling perspective ec(h)o is a knowledge-based recommender system. In this paper we present our findings from user testing and how our approach works well with an audio and tangible user interface within a ubiquitous computing system. We conclude by showing where further research is needed.},

Consequently, it is desirable for such systems to be both personalised and designed in such a way as to enable the user to scrutinise her user model (part of which should hold the rules describing the behaviour of the system). This article describes on-going work to investigate the design of a prototype system that can learn a given user's behaviour in an office environment in order to use the inferred rules to populate a user model and support appropriate proactive behaviour (e.g. turning on the user's fan under appropriate conditions). We explore the tension between user control and proactive services and consider issues related to the design of appropriate transparency with a view to supporting user comprehensibility of system behaviour. To this end, our system enables the user to scrutinise and possibly over-ride the `IF-THEN' rules held in her user model. The system infers these rules from the context history (effectively a data set generated using a variety of sensors) associated with the user by using a fuzzy-decision-tree-based algorithm that can provide a confidence level for each rule in the user model. The evolution of the system has been guided by feedback from a number of real-life users in a university department. A questionnaire study has yielded supplementary results concerning the extent to which the approach taken meets users' expectations and requirements.},

Personal or group user models make it possible to represent and use information about preferences, knowledge, abilities, emotional states, and many other characteristics of a user to adapt the user experience and support. Nowadays, the disappearing computer enables the user to access her information from a variety of personal and public displays and devices. To support a new generation of contextualized and personalized information and services, this paper addresses the problem of  context management . Context management is a new approach to the design of context-aware systems in ubiquitous computing that combines personalization and contextualization. The presented framework for context management integrates user modeling and context modeling, which can benefit from each other and give rise to more valid models for personalized and contextualized information delivery. The paper will introduce a base framework and tools for designing context-aware applications and decompose the underlying framework into its foundational components.

abstract = {We describe a probabilistic approach for the interpretation of user arguments, and investigate the incorporation of different models of a user's beliefs and inferences into this mechanism. Our approach is based on the tenet that the interpretation intended by the user is that with the highest posterior probability. This approach is implemented in a computer-based detective game, where the user explores a virtual scenario, and constructs an argument for a suspect's guilt or innocence. Our system receives as input an argument entered through a web interface, and produces an interpretation in terms of its underlying knowledge representation -- a Bayesian network. This interpretation may differ from the user's argument in its structure and in its beliefs in the argument propositions. We conducted a synthetic evaluation of the basic interpretation mechanism, and a user-based evaluation which assesses the impact of the different user models. The results of both evaluations were encouraging, with the system generally producing argument interpretations our users found acceptable.},

Moreover, the models are automatically derived by decision tree learning using actual dialogue data collected by the system. We obtained reasonable accuracy in classification for all dimensions. Dialogue strategies based on user modeling were implemented on the Kyoto City Bus Information System that was developed at our laboratory. Experimental evaluations revealed that the cooperative responses adapted to each subject type served as good guides for novices without increasing the duration dialogue lasted for skilled users.},

The user modelling component is used by the language generation modules to adapt the hypertext content and links to user beliefs and preferences and to the previous interaction. Unlike previous adaptive NLG systems, which have their own, application-specific user models,  HYLITE  has re-used a generic agent modelling framework (V  IEW G  EN ) instead. Apart from avoiding the development costs of a new model, this also enabled a more extendable system architecture. Another distinct feature of our approach is making NLG techniques adaptable by the user, i.e., providing users with control over the user model and the hypertext adaptivity.},

The agent would follow the discussion and interact with the participants when it detects learning trouble of some sort, such as confusion about the problem they are working on or a participant who is dominating the discussion or not interacting with the other participants. In order to recognize problems in the dialogue, we investigated conversational elements that can be utilized as predictors for effective and ineffective interaction between human students. These elements can serve as the basis for student and group models. In this paper, we discuss group interaction during collaborative learning, our representation of participant dialogue, and the statistical models we are using to determine the role being played by a participant at any point in the dialogue and the effectiveness of the group. We also describe student and group models that can be built using conversational elements and discuss one set that we built to illustrate their potential value in collaborative learning.},

abstract = {Search engines continue to struggle with the challenges presented by Web search: vague queries, impatient users and an enormous and rapidly expanding collection of unmoderated, heterogeneous documents all make for an extremely hostile search environment. In this paper we argue that conventional approaches to Web search -- those that adopt a traditional, document-centric, information retrieval perspective -- are limited by their refusal to consider the past search behaviour of users during future search sessions. In particular, we argue that in many circumstances the search behaviour of users is repetitive and regular; the same sort of queries tend to recur and the same type of results are often selected. We describe how this observation can lead to a novel approach to a more adaptive form of search, one that leverages past search behaviours as a means to re-rank future search results in a way that recognises the implicit preferences of communities of searchers. We describe and evaluate the I-SPY search engine, which implements this approach to collaborative, community-based search. We show that it offers potential improvements in search performance, especially in certain situations where communities of searchers share similar information needs and use similar queries to express these needs. We also show that I-SPY benefits from important advantages when it comes to user privacy. In short, we argue that I-SPY strikes a useful balance between search personalization and user privacy, by offering a unique form of anonymous personalization, and in doing so may very well provide privacy-conscious Web users with an acceptable approach to personalized search.},

abstract = {Initializing a student model for individualized tutoring in educational applications is a difficult task, since very little is known about a new student. On the other hand, fast and efficient initialization of the student model is necessary. Otherwise the tutoring system may lose its credibility in the first interactions with the student. In this paper we describe a framework for the initialization of student models in Web-based educational applications. The framework is called ISM. The basic idea of ISM is to set initial values for all aspects of student models using an innovative combination of stereotypes and the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm. In particular, a student is first assigned to a stereotype category concerning her/his knowledge level of the domain being taught. Then, the model of the new student is initialized by applying the distance weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm among the students that belong to the same stereotype category with the new student. ISM has been applied in a language learning system, which has been used as a test-bed. The quality of the student models created using ISM has been evaluated in an experiment involving classroom students and their teachers. The results from this experiment showed that the initialization of student models was improved using the ISM framework.},

In adaptive information filtering, this profile partially or completely acquired by automatic means. This paper investigates if profile generation can be partially acquired by automatic methods and partially by direct user involvement. The issue is explored through an empirical study of a simulated filtering system that mixes automatic and manual profile generation. The study covers several issues involved in mixed control. The first issue concerns if a machine-learned profile can provide better filtering performance if generated from an initial explicit user profile. The second issue concerns if user involvement can improve on a system-generated or adapted profile. Finally, the relationship between filtering performance and user ratings is investigated. In this particular study the initial setup of a personal profile was effective and yielded performance improvements that persisted after substantiate training. However, the study showed no correlation between users' ratings of profiles and profile filtering performance, and only weak indications that users could improve profiles that already had been trained on feedback.},

abstract = {A case study in adaptive information filtering systems for the Web is presented. The described system comprises two main modules, named HUMOS and WIFS. HUMOS is a user modeling system based on stereotypes. It builds and maintains long term models of individual Internet users, representing their information needs. The user model is structured as a frame containing informative words, enhanced with semantic networks. The proposed machine learning approach for the user modeling process is based on the use of an artificial neural network for stereotype assignments. WIFS is a content-based information filtering module, capable of selecting html/text documents on computer science collected from the Web according to the interests of the user. It has been created for the very purpose of the structure of the user model utilized by HUMOS. Currently, this system acts as an adaptive interface to the Web search engine ALTA VISTA  TM . An empirical evaluation of the system has been made in experimental settings. The experiments focused on the evaluation, by means of a non-parametric statistics approach, of the added value in terms of system performance given by the user modeling component; it also focused on the evaluation of the usability and user acceptance of the system. The results of the experiments are satisfactory and support the choice of a user model-based approach to information filtering on the Web.},

Documents passed over are processed and relevant senses (disambiguated over WordNet) are extracted and then combined to form a semantic network. A filtering procedure dynamically predicts new documents on the basis of the semantic network.There are two main advantages of a sense-based approach: first, the model predictions, being based on senses rather than words, are more accurate; second, the model is language independent, allowing navigation in multilingual sites. We report the results of a comparative experiment that has been carried out to give a quantitative estimation of these improvements.},

abstract = {A web-based search engine responds to a user's query with a list of documents. This list can be viewed as the engine's model of the user's idea of relevance--the engine `believes' that the first document is the most likely to be relevant, the second is slightly less likely, and so on. We extend this idea to an interactive setting where the system accepts the user's feedback and adjusts its relevance model. We develop three specific models that are integrated as part of a system we call Lighthouse. The models incorporate document clustering and a spring-embedding visualization of inter-document similarity. We show that if a searcher were to use Lighthouse in ways consistent with the model, the expected effectiveness improves--i.e., the relevant documents are found more quickly in comparison to existing methods.},

abstract = {Broadcast news sources and newspapers provide society with the vast majority of real-time information. Unfortunately, cost efficiencies and real-time pressures demand that producers, editors, and writers select and organize content for stereotypical audiences. In this article we illustrate how content understanding, user modeling, and tailored presentation generation promise personalcasts on demand. Specifically, we report on the design and implementation of a personalized version of a broadcast news understanding system, MITRE's Broadcast News Navigator (BNN), that tracks and infers user content interests and media preferences. We report on the incorporation of Local Context Analysis to both expand the user's original query to the most related terms in the corpus, as well as to allow the user to provide interactive feedback to enhance the relevance of selected newsstories. We describe an empirical study of the search for stories on ten topics from a video corpus. By personalizing both the selection of stories and the form in which they are delivered, we provide users with tailored broadcast news. This individual news personalization provides more fine-grained content tailoring than current personalized television program level recommenders and does not rely on externally provided program metadata.},

abstract = {Although programpreferences can be characterized on the basis of demographic attributes like sex, age or occupation or by taking the cultural studies approach focused on ethnic or social traits, preferences for programs often differ among people of the same sex, age, occupation and social class. We think that nothing can describe subjects' viewing preferences more accurately than what programs they had watched in the past. To verify our hypothesis, we surveyed the viewing behavior of more than 1,600 randomly chosen individuals, and utilized this data to analyze people's program choices. We categorized the respondents by the similarity of the programs they had watched and examined the groupings that emerged and the features of these groups.From our analysis, it became clear that a `more/less serious' and `more/less fictional' axes are involved in program selection.Our results show that eight groups (stereotypes) explain viewers' contact with television, their motivation for choosing programs to watch, and their interest in matters other than television. Applying these stereotypes to the process of program selection or recommendation will be useful for the future design of personalized adaptive systems.},

abstract = {Watching television tends to be a social activity. So, adaptive television needs to adapt to  groups  of users rather than to  individual  users. In this paper, we discuss different strategies for combining individual user models to adapt to groups, some of which are inspired by Social Choice Theory. In a first experiment, we explore how  humans  select a sequence of items for a group to watch, based on data about the individuals' preferences. The results show that humans use some of the strategies such as the Average Strategy (a.k.a. Additive Utilitarian), the Average Without Misery Strategy and the Least Misery Strategy, and care about fairness and avoiding individual misery. In a second experiment, we investigate how satisfied people believe they would be with sequences chosen by different strategies, and how their satisfaction corresponds with that predicted by a number of satisfaction functions. The results show that subjects use normalization, deduct misery, and use the ratings in a non-linear way. One of the satisfaction functions produced reasonable, though not completely correct predictions. According to our subjects, the sequences produced by five strategies give satisfaction to all individuals in the group. The results also show that subjects put more emphasis than expected on showing the best rated item to each individual (at a cost of misery for another individual), and that the ratings of the first and last items in the sequence are especially important. In a final experiment, we explore the influence viewing an item can have on the ratings of other items. This is important for deciding the order in which to present items. The results show an effect of both mood and topical relatedness.},

abstract = {As Digital TV subscribers are offered more and more channels, it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to locate the right programme information at the right time. The personalized Electronic Programme Guide (pEPG) is one solution to this problem; it leverages artificial intelligence and user profiling techniques to learn about the viewing preferences of individual users in order to compile personalized viewing guides that fit their individual preferences. Very often the limited availability of profiling information is a key limiting factor in such personalized recommender systems. For example, it is well known that collaborative filtering approaches suffer significantly from the sparsity problem, which exists because the expected item-overlap between profiles is usually very low. In this article we address the sparsity problem in the Digital TV domain. We propose the use of data mining techniques as a way of supplementing meagre ratings-based profile knowledge with additional item-similarity knowledge that can be automatically discovered by mining user profiles. We argue that this new similarity knowledge can significantly enhance the performance of a recommender system in even the sparsest of profile spaces. Moreover, we provide an extensive evaluation of our approach using two large-scale, state-of-the-art online systems--PTVPlus, a personalized TV listings portal and F\'{\i}schl\'{a}r, an online digital video library system.},

This article views Web personalization through the prism of personalization policies adopted by Web sites and implementing a variety of functions. In this context, the area of Web usage mining is a valuable source of ideas and methods for the implementation of personalization functionality. We therefore present a survey of the most recent work in the field of Web usage mining, focusing on the problemsthat have been identified and the solutions that have been proposed.},

Our study results have implications for the design of user-adaptive applications. Interesting findings include unenthusiastic user attitudes toward system attempts to infer user needs, goals, or interests and to thereby provide user-specific adaptive content. Users also expressed equivocal opinions of collaborative filtering for the specific eCommerce scenarios we studied; thus personalization features popular in one eCommerce environment may not be effective or useful for other eCommerce domains. Users expressed their strong desire to have full and explicit control of data and interaction. Lastly, users want readily to be able to make sense of site behavior, that is, to understand a site's rationale for displaying particular content.},

abstract = {In this paper we present an Adaptive Educational Hypermedia prototype, named INSPIRE. The approach employed in INSPIRE emphasizes the fact that learners perceive and process information in very different ways, and integrates ideas from theories of instructional design and learning styles. Our aim is to make a shift towards a more 'learning-focused' paradigm of instruction by providing a sequence of authentic and meaningful tasks that matches learner' preferred way of studying. INSPIRE, throughout its interaction with the learner, dynamically generates learner-tailored lessons that gradually lead to the accomplishment of learner's learning goals. It supports several levels of adaptation: from full system-control to full learner-control, and offers learners the option to decide on the level of adaptation of the system by intervening in different stages of the lesson generation process and formulating the lesson contents and presentation. Both the adaptive and adaptable behavior of INSPIRE are guided by the learner model which provides information about the learner, such as knowledge level on the domain concepts and learning style. The learner model is exploited in multiple ways: curriculum sequencing, adaptive navigation support, adaptive presentation, and supports system's adaptable behavior. An empirical study has been performed to evaluate the adaptation framework and assess learners' attitudes towards the proposed instructional design.},

abstract = {Building a collaborative trusting relationship with users is crucial in a wide range of applications, such as advice-giving or financial transactions, and some minimal degree of cooperativeness is required in all applications to even initiate and maintain an interaction with a user. Despite the importance of this aspect of human--human relationships, few intelligent systems have tried to build user models of trust, credibility, or other similar interpersonal variables, or to influence these variables during interaction with users. Humans use a variety of kinds of social language, including small talk, to establish collaborative trusting interpersonal relationships. We argue that such strategies can also be used by intelligent agents, and that embodied conversational agents are ideally suited for this task given the myriad multimodal cues available to them for managing conversation. In this article we describe a model of the relationship between social language and interpersonal relationships, a new kind of discourse planner that is capable of generating social language to achieve interpersonal goals, and an actual implementation in an embodied conversational agent. We discuss an evaluation of our system in which the use of social language was demonstrated to have a significant effect on users' perceptions of the agent's knowledgableness and ability to engage users, and on their trust, credibility, and how well they felt the system knew them, for users manifesting particular personality traits.},

Personal assistant agents embody a clearly beneficial application of intelligent agent technology. A particular kind of assistant agents, recommender systems, can be used to recommend items of interest to users. To be successful, such systems should be able to model and reason with user preferences for items in the application domain. Our primary concern is to develop a reasoning procedure that can meaningfully and systematically tradeoff between user preferences. We have adapted mechanisms from voting theory that have desirable guarantees regarding the recommendations generated from stored preferences. To demonstrate the applicability of our technique, we have developed a movie recommender system that caters to the interests of users. We present issues and initial results based on experimental data of our research that employs voting theory for user modeling, focusing on issues that are especially important in the context of user modeling. We provide multiple query modalities by which the user can pose unconstrained, constrained, or instance-based queries. Our interactive agent learns a user model by gaining feedback aboutits recommended movies from the user. We also provide pro-active information gathering to make user interaction more rewarding. In the paper, we outline the current status of our implementation with particular emphasis on the mechanisms used to provide robust and effective recommendations.},

abstract = {We present a system for rapidly and easily building instructable and self-adaptive software agents that retrieve and extract information. Our  Wisconsin Adaptive Web Assistant  (WAWA) constructs intelligent agents by accepting user preferences in the form of instructions. These user-provided instructions are compiled into neural networks that are responsible for the adaptive capabilities of an intelligent agent. The agent's neural networks are modified via user-provided and system-constructed training examples. Users can create training examples by rating Web pages (or documents), but more importantly WAWA's agents uses techniques from reinforcement learning to internally create their own examples. Users can also provide additional instruction throughout the life of an agent. Our experimental evaluations on a `home-page finder' agent and a `seminar-announcement extractor' agent illustrate the value of using instructable and adaptive agents for retrieving and extracting information.},

abstract = {When a tutoring system aims to provide students with interactive help, it needs to know what knowledge the student has and what goals the student is currently trying to achieve. That is, it must do both assessment and plan recognition. These modeling tasks involve a high level of uncertainty when students are allowed to follow various lines of reasoning and are not required to show all their reasoning explicitly. We use Bayesian networks as a comprehensive, sound formalism to handle this uncertainty. Using Bayesian networks, we have devised the probabilistic student models for Andes, a tutoring system for Newtonian physics whose philosophy is to maximize student initiative and freedom during the pedagogical interaction. Andes' models provide long-term knowledge assessment, plan recognition, and prediction of students' actions during problem solving, as well as assessment of students' knowledge and understanding as students read and explain worked out examples. In this paper, we describe the basic mechanisms that allow Andes' student models to soundly perform assessment and plan recognition, as well as the Bayesian network solutions to issues that arose in scaling up the model to a full-scale, field evaluated application. We also summarize the results of several evaluations of Andes which provide evidence on the accuracy of its student models.},

abstract = {Recommender systems represent user preferences for the purpose of suggesting items to purchase or examine. They have become fundamental applications in electronic commerce and information access, providing suggestions that effectively prune large information spaces so that users are directed toward those items that best meet their needs and preferences. A variety of techniques have been proposed for performing recommendation, including content-based, collaborative, knowledge-based and other techniques. To improve performance, these methods have sometimes been combined in hybrid recommenders. This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants. Further, we show that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge-based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.},

abstract = {Current interface design practices are based on user models and descriptions derived almost exclusively from studies of able-bodied users (Keates et al., 1999). However, such users are only one point on a wide and varied scale of physical capabilities.Users with a number of different physical impairment conditions have the same desire to use computers as able-bodied people (Busby, 1997), but cannot cope with most current computer access systems (Edwards, 1995).It is important to identify the differences in interaction for users of differing physical capability, because the border between the labels ‘able-bodied’ and ‘motion-impaired’ users is becoming increasingly blurred as the generation of computer users inexorably becomes older and physically less capable. If user models are to retain their relevance, then they have to be able to reflect users' physical capabilities (Stary, 1997).Through empirical studies, this paper will show that there are very important differences between those with motion-impairments, whether elderly or disabled, and able-bodied users when they interact with computers. It attempts to quantify where those differences occur in the interaction cycle with the use of a very straightforward user model, the Model Human Processor (MHP) (Card, Moran and Newell, 1983), which describes interaction purely in terms of perception, cognition and motor component times. Although this model is simplistic compared to the more recent sophisticated models, it affords a simple and valuable insight into interaction cycles and offers a building block on which to base more comprehensive models. This work is predicated on the idea that the use of this model in detailed analysis of the basic interaction cycle will provide a means for studying motion impairment at both an individual and general level.},

We have evaluated the system in the context of genuine courses, and used the results to further refine the system. The main goal of our research has been the exploration and extension of Constraint-Based Modeling (CBM), a student modeling approach proposed by Ohlsson (1994). SQL-Tutor provided us with experiences of using CBM, and we used it to extend the approach in several important ways. The main goal of all three evaluation studies was to determine how well CBM supported student learning. We have obtained positive results. The students who learnt with SQL-Tutor in the first study performed significantly better than those who did not when assessed by a subsequent classroom examination. Furthermore, the analysis of students' learning shows that CBM has a sound psychological foundation.Besides the evaluation of CBM, we also evaluated the improvements in terms of student assessments of the usefulness of the system and evaluated various techniques used in SQL-Tutor. In the second study, we evaluated the effectiveness of feedback provided to the students. This study showed that high-level advice is most beneficial to students' learning. The focus of the third study was different. We extended CBM to support long-term modeling of student knowledge, and used this extension to develop an adaptive problem-selection strategy. The study revealed the benefits of this strategy in comparison with a simple heuristic strategy. We also reflect on our experiences in evaluating SQL-Tutor.},

This paper reports the design, implementation and evaluation of an individually configurable multimedia learning application, based upon such a model.A multimedia learning application was developed that presented information differentially based upon the individual characteristics of learners, held in the student model. The characteristics employed in the model were language level, cognitive style, task and question levels, and help level. Small groups of learners followed the multimedia course in learning centres located in colleges in the UK. A Grounded Theory study was carried out in order to understand the many and complex interactions that took place between learners, tutors and the learning environment.Stages in the Grounded Theory method are described and some qualitative data is presented. It was possible to conclude from these, that the quality of learning for individuals was improved by the use of the co-operative student model. Quantitative data is presented to support this view and where possible, to relate performance on the multimedia learning application to the student model configuration.},

Information that includes affective and subjective content plays a major role not only in an individual's cognitive processes but also in an individual's interaction with others. We identify three key points to be considered when developing systems that capture affective information: embodiment (experiencing physical reality), dynamics (mapping experience and emotional state with its label) and adaptive interaction (conveying emotive response, responding to a recognized emotional state). We present two computational systems that implement those principles: MOUE (Model Of User Emotions) is an emotion recognition system that recognizes the user's emotion from his/her facial expressions, and from it, adaptively builds semantic definitions of emotion concepts using the user's feedback; MIKE (Multimedia Interactive Environment for Kansei communication) is an interactive adaptive system that, along with the user, co-evolves a language for communicating over subjective impressions.},

ABAIS provides a generic adaptive framework for integrating a variety of user assessment methods (e.g. knowledge-based, self-reports, diagnostic tasks, physiological sensing), and GUI adaptation strategies (e.g. content- and format-based). The ABAIS performance bias prediction is based on empirical findings from emotion research combined with detailed knowledge of the task context. The initial ABAIS prototype was demonstrated in the context of an Air Force combat task, used a knowledge-based approach to assess the pilot's anxiety level, and adapted to the pilot's anxiety and belief states by modifying selected cockpit instrument displays in response to detected changes in these states.},

This paper presents a literature review on affective expressions through speech, music and body language. It summarizes the quality and quantity of their parameters and successful examples of synthesis. Moreover, a model for the convincingness of affective expressions, based on Fogg and Hsiang Tseng (1999), was developed and tested. The empirical data did not support the original model and therefore this paper proposes a new model, which is based on appropriateness and intensity of the expressions. Furthermore, the experiment investigated if the type of emotion (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear and disgust), knowledge about the source (human or machine), the level of abstraction (natural face, computer rendered face and matrix face) and medium of presentation (visual, audio/visual, audio) of an affective expression influences its convincingness and distinctness. Only the type of emotion and multimedia presentations had an effect on convincingness. The distinctness of an expression depends on the abstraction and the media through which it is presented.},

abstract = {This study focuses on the perception of emotion and attitude in speech. The ability to identify vocal expressions of emotion and/or attitude in speech material was investigated. Systematic perception experiments were carried out to determine optimal values for the acoustic parameters: pitch level, pitch range and speech rate. Speech was manipulated by varying these parameters around the values found in a selected subset of the speech material which consisted of two sentences spoken by a male speaker expressing seven emotions or attitudes: neutrality, joy, boredom, anger, sadness, fear, and indignation. Listening tests were carried out with this speech material, and optimal values for pitch level, pitch range, and speech rate were derived for the generation of speech expressing emotion or attitude, from a neutral utterance. These values were perceptually tested in re-synthesized speech and in synthetic speech generated from LPC-coded diphones.},

abstract = {An abundant amount of information is created and delivered over electronic media. Users risk becoming overwhelmed by the flow of information, and they lack adequate tools to help them manage the situation. Information filtering (IF) is one of the methods that is rapidly evolving to manage large information flows. The aim of IF is to expose users to only information that is relevant to them. Many IF systems have been developed in recent years for various application domains. Some examples of filtering applications are: filters for search results on the internet that are employed in the Internet software, personal e-mail filters based on personal profiles, listservers or newsgroups filters for groups or individuals, browser filters that block non-valuable information, filters designed to give children access them only to suitable pages, filters for e-commerce applications that address products and promotions to potential customers only, and many more. The different systems use various methods, concepts, and techniques from diverse research areas like: Information Retrieval, Artificial Intelligence, or Behavioral Science. Various systems cover different scope, have divergent functionality, and various platforms. There are many systems of widely varying philosophies, but all share the goal of automatically directing the most valuable information to users in accordance with their User Model, and of helping them use their limited reading time most optimally. This paper clarifies the difference between IF systems and related systems, such as information retrieval (IR) systems, or Extraction systems. The paper defines a framework to classify IF systems according to several parameters, and illustrates the approach with commercial and academic systems. The paper describes the underlying concepts of IF systems and the techniques that are used to implement them. It discusses methods and measurements that are used for evaluation of IF systems and limitations of the current systems. In the conclusion we present research issues in the Information Filtering research arena, such as user modeling, evaluation standardization and integration with digital libraries and Web repositories.},

abstract = {This paper describes major trends in learner-adapted teaching systems towards greater learner control over the learning process. In the early teaching systems, the goal was to build a clever teacher able to communicate knowledge to the individual student. Recent and emerging work focuses on the learner exploring, designing, constructing, making sense and using adaptive systems as tools. Correspondingly, systems are being built to give the learner greater responsibility and control over all aspects of the learning, and especially over the learner model which is at the core of user-adaptation. A parallel trend is the growing acknowledgement of the importance of the learner's social context. Systems are increasingly being designed for learners working in groups of real or simulated peers. This paper discusses several elements of the shift to greater learner control, with a focus on the implications for learner modelling. The computer may offer the learner a choice of learning tools and companion learners, on-demand learning of various types, control over the elements of the systems and the possibility of controlling the amount of control. Learner control offers promising possibilities for improved learning. At the same time, there are pragmatic issues for achieving the benefits. The paper discusses three of these: the need to evaluate the effectiveness of the emergent learner-controlled systems; problems with learner control; and the need for interoperable and reusable components.},

abstract = {A fundamental objective of human–computer interaction research is to make systems more usable, more useful, and to provide users with experiences fitting their specific background knowledge and objectives. The challenge in an information-rich world is not only to make information available to people at any time, at any place, and in any form, but specifically to say the “right” thing at the “right” time in the “right” way. Designers of collaborative human–computer systems face the formidable task of writing software for millions of users (at design time) while making it work as if it were designed for each individual user (only known at use time). User modeling research has attempted to address these issues. In this article, I will first review the objectives, progress, and unfulfilled hopes that have occurred over the last ten years, and illustrate them with some interesting computational environments and their underlying conceptual frameworks. A special emphasis is given to high-functionality applications and the impact of user modeling to make them more usable, useful, and learnable. Finally, an assessment of the current state of the art followed by some future challenges is given.},

To this effect, the paper revisits the concept of Universal Access, briefly reviews relevant work on adaptive techniques, and follows their application in efforts to provide accessibility of interactive systems, from the early, product- and environment-level adaptation-based approaches, to more generic solutions oriented towards Universal Access. Finally, the paper highlights some of the research challenges ahead. The normative perspective of the paper is that adaptive techniques in the context of Universal Access have the potential to facilitate both accessibility and high quality interaction, for the broadest possible end-user population. This implies the design of systems that undertake context-sensitive processing so as to manifest their functional core in alternative interactive embodiments suitable for different users, usage patterns and contexts of use. Such a capability needs to be built into the system from the early phases of conception and design, and subsequently validated throughout its life cycle.},

The user model is based on observing the individual's behavior in a natural environment, while the expert model is based on pooling the knowledge of numerous individuals. Individualized instructional topics are selected by comparing an individual's knowledge to the pooled knowledge of her peers.},

Cognitive tutorsTM are problem solving environments constructed around cognitive models of the knowledge students are acquiring. Over the past decade we in the Pittsburgh Advanced Cognitive Tutor (PACT) Center at Carnegie Mellon have been employing a cognitive programming tutor in university-based teaching and research, while simultaneously developing cognitive mathematics tutors that are currently in use in about 150 schools in 14 states. This paper examines adaptive student modeling issues in these two contexts. We examine the role of student modeling in making the transition from the research lab to widespread classroom use, describe our university-based efforts to empirically validate student modeling in the ACT Programming Tutor, and conclude with a description of the key role that student modeling plays in formative evaluations of the Cognitive Algebra II Tutor.},

abstract = {We present a framework for adaptive news access, based on machine learning techniques specifically designed for this task. First, we focus on the system's general functionality and system architecture. We then describe the interface and design of two deployed news agents that are part of the described architecture. While the first agent provides personalized news through a web-based interface, the second system is geared towards wireless information devices such as PDAs (personal digital assistants) and cell phones. Based on implicit and explicit user feedback, our agents use a machine learning algorithm to induce individual user models. Motivated by general shortcomings of other user modeling systems for Information Retrieval applications, as well as the specific requirements of news classification, we propose the induction of hybrid user models that consist of separate models for short-term and long-term interests. Furthermore, we illustrate how the described algorithm can be used to address an important issue that has thus far received little attention in the Information Retrieval community: a user's information need changes as a direct result of interaction with information. We empirically evaluate the system's performance based on data collected from regular system users. The goal of the evaluation is not only to understand the performance contributions of the algorithm's individual components, but also to assess the overall utility of the proposed user modeling techniques from a user perspective. Our results provide empirical evidence for the utility of the hybrid user model, and suggest that effective personalization can be achieved without requiring any extra effort from the user.},

Computational models of each of the 25 individual pilots were constructed, and the individual models simulated execution of the same flight maneuvers performed by the human pilots. The time-synched eye fixations and control movements of individual pilots and their respective models were compared, and rigorous tests of ADAPT's predictive validity were performed. The model explains and predicts a significant portion of pilot visual attention and control movements during flight as a function of piloting expertise.

opportunity to contribute more information than was his obligation in

stimulus conditions as a computational mechanism for taking the

Yes–No questions, as part of a system for generating answers to 
Yes–No questions. Stimulus conditions represent types of 
discourse contexts in which a speaker is motivated to add unrequested 
information to his answer. Stimulus conditions may be triggered not 
only by the discourse context at the time when the question was 
asked, but also by the anticipated context resulting from providing 
part of the response. We define a set of stimulus conditions based 
upon previous linguistic studies and a corpus analysis, and describe 
how evaluation of these stimulus conditions makes use of information 
from a User Model. Also, we show how the stimulus conditions are used 
by the generation component of the system. An evaluation was 
conducted of the implemented system. The results indicate that the 
responses generated by our system containing extra information 
provided on the basis of this initiative mechanism are viewed more 
favorably by users than responses without the extra information.},

abstract = { Mixed-initiative problem solving lies at the heart of knowledge-
based learning environments. While learners are actively engaged in 
problem-solving activities, learning environments should monitor 
their progress and provide them with feedback in a manner that 
contributes to achieving the twin goals of learning effectiveness and 
learning efficiency. Mixed-initiative interactions are particularly 
critical for constructivist learning environments in which 
learners participate in active problem solving. We have recently 
begun to see the emergence of believable agents with lifelike 
qualities. Featured prominently in constructivist learning 
environments, lifelike pedagogical agents could couple key 
feedback functionalities with a strong visual presence by observing 
learners‘ progress and providing them with visually contextualized 
advice during mixed-initiative problem solving. For the past three 
years, we have been engaged in a large-scale research program on 
lifelike pedagogical agents and their role in constructivist learning 
environments. In the resulting computational framework, lifelike 
pedagogical agents are specified by (1) a  behavior space containing animated and vocal 
behaviors,(2) a  design-centered context model that maintains constructivist problem representations, multimodal advisory contexts, and evolving problem-solving tasks, and(3) a behavior sequencing engine that in realtime dynamically selects and assembles agents‘ actions to 
create pedagogically effective, lifelike behaviors. To empirically investigate this framework, it has been 
instantiated in a full-scale implementation of a lifelike pedagogical 
agent for Design-A-Plant, a learning environment developed 
for the domain of botanical anatomy and physiology for middle school 
students. Experience with focus group studies conducted with middle 
school students interacting with the implemented agent suggests that 
lifelike pedagogical agents hold much promise for mixed-initiative 
learning.},

abstract = { Intelligent dialogue systems usually concentrate on user support 
at the level of the domain of discourse, following a plan-based 
approach. Whereas this is appropriate for collaborative planning 
tasks, the situation in interactive information retrieval systems is 
quite different: there is no inherent plan-goal hierarchy, and users 
are known to often opportunistically change their goals and 
strategies during and through interaction. We need to allow for 
mixed-initiative retrieval dialogues, where the system evaluates the 
user‘s individual dialogue behavior and performs situation-dependent 
interpretation of user goals, to determine when to take the 
initiative and to change the control of the dialogue, e.g., to 
propose (new) problem-solving strategies to the user. In this 
article, we present the dialogue planning component of a concept-
oriented, logic-based retrieval system (MIRACLE). Users are guided 
through the global stages of the retrieval interaction but may 
depart, at any time, from this guidance and change the direction of 
the dialogue. When users submit ambiguous queries or enter 
unexpected dialogue control acts, abductive reasoning is 
used to generate interpretations of these user inputs in light of the 
dialogue history and other internal knowledge sources. Based on these 
interpretations, the system initiates a short dialogue offering the 
user suitable options and strategies for proceeding with the 
retrieval dialogue. Depending on the user‘s choice and constraints 
resulting from the history, the system adapts its strategy 
accordingly.},

abstract = {Core services of user modeling shell systems include the provision of representations for user model contents and for other relevant knowledge, and of reasoning mechanisms. These representation and reasoning facilities should be powerful and flexible, in order to satisfy both complex and specialized needs that developers of user modeling systems may have. This article first identifies these needs through a comprehensive overview of logic-based representation and reasoning in user modeling system. Then, the AsTRa (Assumption Type Representation) framework for logic-based user model representation and reasoning is presented. This framework obtains its power and flexibility through an integration of the two main scientific approaches that were pursued to date, namely the partition approach and the modal logic approach. The central notion of the framework is the `assumption type', a partition-like partial knowledge base for storing all assumptions about the user that are of the same type. Within assumption types, logic-based representation formalisms can be employed. The semantics of assumption types and content formalisms can be characterized in terms of modal logic, so that an extension to full modal logic is possible. Moreover, special mechanisms for handling so-called `negative assumptions' are developed, which are also firmly grounded in modal logic semantics. The paper concludes with a description of the user modeling shell BGP-MS as a prototypical implementation of AsTRa, and a discussion of the approach in the light of other user modeling shells.},

abstract = {A modeling system may be required to
predict an agent‘s future actions under constraints of
inadequate or contradictory relevant historical
evidence. This can result in low prediction
accuracy, or otherwise, low prediction rates, leaving
a set of cases for which no predictions are made. A
previous study that explored techniques for improving
prediction rates in the context of modeling students‘
subtraction skills using Feature Based Modeling showed
a tradeoff between prediction rate and predication
accuracy. This paper presents research that aims to
improve prediction rates without affecting prediction
accuracy. The FBM-C4.5 agent modeling system was used
in this research. However, the techniques explored
are applicable to any Feature Based Modeling system,
and the most effective technique developed is
applicable to most agent modeling systems. The
default FBM-C4.5 system models agents‘ competencies
with a set of decision trees, trained on all
historical data. Each tree predicts one particular
aspect of the agent‘s action. Predictions from
multiple trees are compared for consensus. FBM-C4.5
makes no prediction when predictions from different
trees contradict one another. This strategy trades
off reduced prediction rates for increased accuracy. 
To make predictions in the absence of consensus, three
techniques have been evaluated. They include using
voting, using a tree quality measure and using a leaf
quality measure. An alternative technique that merges
multiple decision trees into a single tree provides an
advantage of producing models that are more
comprehensible. However, all of these techniques
demonstrated the previous encountered trade-off
between rate of prediction and accuracy of prediction,
albeit less pronounced. It was hypothesized that
models built on more current observations would
outperform models built on earlier observations. 
Experimental results support this hypothesis. A
Dual-model system, which takes this temporal factor
into account, has been evaluated. This fifth approach
achieved a significant improvement in prediction rate
without significantly affecting prediction accuracy.},

models the agent may think the other agent has of the original agent,
the models the other agent may think the agent has, and so on. The
beliefs about which model is the correct one are incrementally updated
based on the observed behavior of the modeled agent and, as the
result, the probability of the model that best predicted the observed
behavior is increased. Analogously, the models on deeper levels of
modeling can be updated; the models that the agent thinks another
agent uses to model the original agent are revised based on how the
other agent is expected to observe the original agent‘s behavior, and
so on. We have implemented and tested our method in two domains, and
the results show a marked improvement in the quality of interactions
with the belief update in both domains.},

belief (Bayesian) network to represent features of the domain that are
needed to identify users‘ plans and goals. The application domain is a
Multi-User Dungeon adventure game with thousands of possible actions and
locations. We propose several network structures which represent the
relations in the domain to varying extents, and compare their predictive
power for predicting a user‘s current goal, next action and next location.
The conditional probability distributions for each network are learned
during a training phase, which dynamically builds these probabilities from
observations of user behaviour. This approach allows the use of incomplete,
sparse and noisy data during both training and testing. We then apply simple
abstraction and learning techniques in order to speed up the performance of
the most promising dynamic belief networks without a significant change in
the accuracy of goal predictions. Our experimental results in the
application domain show a high degree of predictive accuracy. This indicates
that dynamic belief networks in general show promise for predicting a
variety of behaviours in domains which have similar features to those of our
domain, while reduced models, obtained by means of learning and abstraction,
show promise for efficient goal prediction in such domains.},

abstract = {The text recommendation task involves delivering sets of documents to
users on the basis of user models. These models are improved over
time, given feedback on the delivered documents. When selecting
documents to recommend, a system faces an instance of the
exploration/exploitation tradeoff: whether to deliver documents about
which there is little certainty, or those which are known to match the
user model learned so far. In this paper, a simulation is constructed
to investigate the effects of this tradeoff on the rate of learning
user models, and the resulting compositions of the sets of recommended
documents, in particular World-Wide Web pages. Document selection
strategies are developed which correspond to different points along
the tradeoff. Using an exploitative strategy, our results show that
simple preference functions can successfully be learned using a
vector-space representation of a user model in conjunction with a
gradient descent algorithm, but that increasingly complex preference
functions lead to a slowing down of the learning process. Exploratory
strategies are shown to increase the rate of user model acquisition at
the expense of presenting users with suboptimal recommendations; in
addition they adapt to user preference changes more rapidly than
exploitative strategies. These simulated tests suggest an
implementation for a simple control that is exposed to users, allowing
them to vary a system‘s document selection behavior depending on
individual circumstances.},

proficiency-adapted information browsing and filtering

information is acquired by browsing through highly
interconnected sets of information nodes. In order to
find specific information, users follow links to nodes

users find relevant information and new learning
material that match their levels of domain knowledge,
we present a framework for adapting the information

user‘s proficiency in the subject matter. Such
a proficiency-adapted, user-centered educational
environment is intended to enhance learning.
We believe that learning in educational
hypertext-based applications cannot be reduced to
traversing a static information space. Navigating
through any space, be it a physical or an information
space, normally requires that users have a prior
degree of proficiency in the domain knowledge.
Learning is an evolving dynamic process through which
users progress from a situation of unfamiliarity to
one of mastery of a knowledge corpus. Therefore, we
propose a model of proficiency-adapted learning and
information browsing in which the presented choices
(links and the textual context of links) are selected
based on the user‘s knowledge state. Ultimately, such
an adaptive course not only guides the learning
process of the student, but it gradually transforms
itself into a reference guide.},

This diversity and choice may present navigation difficulties to users

user‘s long-term preferences (user profile), and then
show how the acquired profile may be used to recommend selections
that may be of interest to the user. The profile is acquired on
the basis of a user‘s habits using a Heuristic-Statistical
approach, and is used to create selection indices which are
then used during on-line interactions to recommend selections. Our mechanism
has been incorporated into an experimental Video On Demand
(VOD) service that is implemented using a client-server
architecture. The profile acquisition component is
incorporated into a VOD server on a multi-tasking
machine, while the VOD user interface resides on a
personal computer. Our mechanism for acquiring profiles and making

is an information seeking process in which documents are selected from 
a dynamic text stream to satisfy a relatively stable and specific 
information need. A model of the information seeking process is 
introduced and specialized to define text filtering. The historical 
development of text filtering is then reviewed and case studies of 
recent work are used to highlight important design characteristics of 
modern text filtering systems. User modeling techniques drawn from 
information retrieval, recommender systems, machine learning and other 
fields are described. The paper concludes with observations on the 
present state of the art and implications for future research on text 
filtering.},

abstract = {This paper demonstrates the feasibility of
modeling concurrent diagnostic reasoning (CDR) by
means of the computational model of actors. Actors
have a value added on top of objects, because they
include the properties of abstraction, modularity and
reuse of objects but allow really concurrent and
distributed architectures, in the sense that memory
(the environment) is assumed not to be shared among
actors. Whether concurrency really implies efficiency
is still debated. We are more concerned here with the
actor-based design of the diagnostic reasoning model.
As a testimony of the feasibility of our proposal, a
concrete, actor-based diagnostic program is presented
as a module for an Intelligent Tutoring System in the
domain of school algebra. CDR is obtained from the
coordinated behaviour of actors which possess limited
local knowledge and accomplish the global goal of
diagnostic reasoning by interacting with each other.
We examine how the ’traditional‘ approaches to student
modeling, such as overlay and bug models, can be
re-visited in a distributed perspective of
computational actors and how the latter view
outperforms the previous ones.},

abstract = {The Traum-AID system is a tool for assisting physicians during the
management of patients with severe injuries. Originally, Traum-AID was
conceived as a rule-based expert system combined with a planner.
After this architecture had been implemented, we began to face the
issue of how Traum-AID could communicate its plans to physicians in
order to influence their behavior and have a positive effect on
patient outcome. This paper describes Trauma-TIQ – the critiquing
interface for Traum-AID – which examines the actions the
physician intends to carry out and produces a critique in response to
those intentions. Trauma-TIQ‘s two main components are a plan
recognizer that uses the context of the case to disambiguate plans,
and a plan evaluator that identifies errors and calculates their
significance in order to determine an appropriate response. Unlike
previously developed reminder systems, Trauma-TIQ evaluates the
physician‘s proposed plan and attempts to intervene before
problems occur. And unlike previous critiquing systems, it is able to
provide ongoing decision support during the planning and
delivery of care. In the context of time-critical patient management
it is, therefore, a more appropriate means of interaction.},

abstract = {In order to generate natural, high quality textual
presentations in technical domains, good explanations
must not only be adapted to the knowledge attributed
to the intended audience, but they must also take into
account the inferential capabilities of the
addressees. In this paper, we present a model for
anticipating contextually-motivated inferences
addressees are likely to draw. This model is used to
motivate choices in presenting or omitting individual
pieces of information; it takes into account the
addressees‘ domain expertise and expectations about
logical consequences of purposefully presented
information. Several kinds of empirical evidence are
incorporated into a text planning process that aims at
exploiting conversational implicature, so that a most
suitable portion of the plan can be selected for being
uttered explicitly. This way, our method adds to
discourse planners based on Rhetorical Structure
Theory (RST) the ability to omit easily inferable
information. Thus, it overcomes one of the main
shortcomings of RST. In the course of this process,
rules anticipating user inferences are invoked to
determine contextually justified derivability of
information. In this manner, text variants can be
composed on the basis of a text plan entailing
annotations about the inferability of pieces of
information. Moreover, pragmatically-motivated
preference criteria can be used to choose among
several plausible variants. The model is formulated in
a reasonably domain-independent way, so that the rules
expressing aspects of conversational implicature can
be incorporated into typical RST-based text planners.},
