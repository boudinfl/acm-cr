		  transfer knowledge quickly and efficiently from experts to
		  novices, who are different in terms of the structural
		  properties of domain knowledge or knowledge structure. This
		  study applies experts' semantic networks to hypertext

		  knowledge structure acquisition and problem solving.
		  Moreover, we argue that the level of sophistication of the
		  knowledge structure acquired by learners is an important
		  mediator influencing the learning outcomes (in this case,
		  problem solving). The research model was empirically tested
		  with a situated experiment involving 80 business
		  professionals. The results of the empirical study provided
		  strong support for the effectiveness of semantic hypertext
		  in transferring knowledge structure and reported a
		  significant full mediating effect of knowledge structure
		  sophistication. Both theoretical and practical implications

		  avoid many of the restrictions imposed by the WoS, and they

		  a story depends on the credibility of its narrators. To
		  insure reliability verification, the narrators' names are
		  explicitly cited at the head of the story, which constitute
		  its chain of narrators. Stories were reported from a
		  generation to another to insure the reliable transmission
		  of historical knowledge. We present a set of tools based on
		  the Arabic storytelling methodology. We start by presenting
		  this methodology as a set of principles for
		  information-reliability assessment. Then, we detail an
		  architecture designed to support the study of the

		  identity recognizer links names found in chains of

		  We model this step as a possibilistic information retrieval

		  available in biographies to help the user identify sources
		  of unreliability. We propose to identify the class of
		  reliability of a story with a possibilistic classifier. The

  abstract	= {Context is a determining factor in language and plays a
		  decisive role in polysemic words. Several
		  psycholinguistically motivated algorithms have been
		  proposed to emulate human management of context, under the
		  assumption that the value of a word is evanescent and takes
		  on meaning only in interaction with other structures. The
		  predication algorithm (Kintsch, [2001]), for example, uses
		  a vector representation of the words produced by LSA
		  (Latent Semantic Analysis) to dynamically simulate the
		  comprehension of predications and even of predicative
		  metaphors. The objective of this study was to predict some
		  unwanted effects that could be present in vector-space
		  models when extracting different meanings of a polysemic
		  word (predominant meaning inundation, lack of precision,
		  and low-level definition), and propose ideas based on the

		  to visualize such unwanted phenomena and also the effect of
		  solutions. We use different methods to extract the meanings
		  for a polysemic word (without context, vector sum, and
		  predication algorithm). Our second step was to conduct an
		  analysis of variance to compare such methods and measure
		  the impact of potential solutions. Results support the idea
		  that a human-based computational algorithm like the
		  predication algorithm can take into account features that
		  ensure more accurate representations of the structures we

		  probability distributions of the measures in the
		  mathematical categories to the probability distribution of
		  a scientific model of impact factor distribution. The
		  scientific model distribution is highly skewed, conforming
		  to the negative binomial type, with much of the variance
		  due to the important role of review articles in science. In
		  contrast, the three article mean citation rate measures'
		  distributions in the mathematical categories conformed to
		  either the binomial or Poisson, indicating a high degree of
		  randomness. Seeking reasons for this, the paper analyzes
		  the bibliometric structure of Mathematics, finding it a
		  disjointed discipline of isolated subfields with a weak
		  central core of journals, reduced review function, and long
		  cited half-life placing most citations beyond the measures'

		  important mathematics journals than the measures indicate,
		  positing that much of the apparent randomness may be due to
		  the measures' inapplicability to mathematical disciplines.
		  Moreover, tests of the stability of impact factor ranks

		  yet widely used in practice probably because of its high
		  computational complexity. This article explores techniques
		  of high-speed rough clustering of documents, assuming that
		  it is sometimes necessary to obtain a clustering result in
		  a shorter time, although the result is just an approximate
		  outline of document clusters. A promising approach for such
		  clustering is to reduce the number of documents to be
		  checked for generating cluster vectors in the

		  Also, a two-stage grouping technique, in which the first
		  stage attempts to decrease the number of documents to be

		  technique, is developed. An experiment using a part of the

		  offers a novel method of approaching the system-ranking

		  By skimming the top k (where k is small) documents
		  retrieved by a single system for multiple query aspects, we
		  collect a set of documents that are likely to be relevant
		  to a given test topic. Labeling these skimmed documents as
		  putatively relevant lets us build pseudorelevance judgments

		  gaming yields new opportunities for developing novel
		  applications on mobile devices. Yet, studies on users'
		  attitudes and behaviors related to mobile gaming,
		  content-sharing, and retrieval activities (referred to
		  simply as content sharing and gaming) have been lacking.
		  For this reason, the objectives of this article are
		  three-fold. One, it introduces Indagator, an application
		  that incorporates multiplayer, pervasive gaming elements
		  into mobile content-sharing activities. Two, it seeks to
		  uncover the motivations for content sharing within a
		  game-based environment. Three, it aims to identify types of
		  users who are motivated to use Indagator for content
		  sharing. Informed by the uses and gratifications paradigm,
		  a survey was designed and administered to 203 undergraduate
		  and graduate students from two large universities. The
		  findings revealed that perceived gratification factors,
		  such as information discovery, entertainment, information
		  quality, socialization, and relationship maintenance,
		  demographic variables, such as basic familiarity with
		  features of mobile communication devices, and IT-related
		  backgrounds were significant in predicting intention to use

  abstract	= {The authors address the problem of unsupervised ensemble
		  ranking. Traditional approaches either combine multiple
		  ranking criteria into a unified representation to obtain an
		  overall ranking score or to utilize certain rank fusion or
		  aggregation techniques to combine the ranking results.
		  Beyond the aforementioned “combine-then-rank” and
		  “rank-then-combine” approaches, the authors propose a
		  novel “rank-learn-combine” ranking framework, called
		  Interactive Ranking (iRANK), which allows two base rankers
		  to “teach” each other before combination during the
		  ranking process by providing their own ranking results as
		  feedback to the others to boost the ranking performance.
		  This mutual ranking refinement process continues until the
		  two base rankers cannot learn from each other any more. The
		  overall performance is improved by the enhancement of the
		  base rankers through the mutual learning mechanism. The
		  authors further design two ranking refinement strategies to
		  efficiently and effectively use the feedback based on
		  reasonable assumptions and rational analysis. Although
		  iRANK is applicable to many applications, as a case study,
		  they apply this framework to the sentence ranking problem
		  in query-focused summarization and evaluate its
		  effectiveness on the DUC 2005 and 2006 data sets. The

		  they propose a novel ranking approach that incorporates
		  intertopic information mining. Intertopic information, in
		  contrast to intratopic information, is able to reveal
		  pairwise topic relationships and thus can be considered as
		  the bridge across different topics. In this article, the

		  under a learning-based summarization framework. To mine
		  this information, the authors model the topic relationship
		  by clustering all the words in both known and unknown

		  labels, which indicate the roles of the words in the topic.
		  Based on the mined relationships, we develop a

  abstract	= {Discovering relationships among concepts and categories is
		  crucial in various information systems. The authors'
		  objective was to discover such relationships among document
		  categories. Traditionally, such relationships are
		  represented in the form of a concept hierarchy, grouping
		  some categories under the same parent category. Although
		  the nature of hierarchy supports the identification of
		  categories that may share the same parent, not all of these
		  categories have a relationship with each other—other than
		  sharing the same parent. However, some “non-sibling”
		  relationships exist that although are related to each other
		  are not identified as such. The authors identify and build
		  a relationship network (relationship-net) with categories
		  as the vertices and relationships as the edges of this
		  network. They demonstrate that using a relationship-net,
		  some nonobvious category relationships are detected. Their
		  approach capitalizes on the misclassification information
		  generated during the process of text classification to
		  identify potential relationships among categories and
		  automatically generate relationship-nets. Their results
		  demonstrate a statistically significant improvement over
		  the current approach by up to 73% on 20 News groups 20NG,

		  information stemming from passage classification as opposed
		  to document classification statistically significantly
		  improves the results on 20NG (8%), ODP17 (5%), ODP46 (73%),
		  and SIGIR (117%) with respect to F1 measure. By assigning

		  strategies. Furthermore, our data illustrate a robust
		  relationship between increased prominence and increased

		  from a system-centered perspective. The main focus has been
		  on developing content-based algorithms similar to document
		  search. These algorithms identify matching experts
		  primarily on the basis of the textual content of documents
		  with which experts are associated. Other factors, such as
		  the ones identified by expertise-seeking models, are rarely
		  taken into account. In this article, we extend
		  content-based expert-finding approaches with contextual
		  factors that have been found to influence human expert
		  finding. We focus on a task of science communicators in a
		  knowledge-intensive environment, the task of finding
		  similar experts, given an example expert. Our approach
		  combines expertise-seeking and retrieval research. First,
		  we conduct a user study to identify contextual factors that
		  may play a role in the studied task and environment. Then,
		  we design expert retrieval models to capture these factors.
		  We combine these with content-based retrieval models and
		  evaluate them in a retrieval experiment. Our main finding
		  is that while content-based features are the most
		  important, human participants also take contextual factors
		  into account, such as media experience and organizational
		  structure. We develop two principled ways of modeling the
		  identified factors and integrate them with content-based
		  retrieval models. Our experiments show that models
		  combining content-based and contextual factors can
		  significantly outperform existing content-based models. ©

  abstract	= {With the emergence of Web 2.0, sharing personal content,
		  communicating ideas, and interacting with other online
		  users in Web 2.0 communities have become daily routines for
		  online users. User-generated data from Web 2.0 sites
		  provide rich personal information (e.g., personal
		  preferences and interests) and can be utilized to obtain
		  insight about cyber communities and their social networks.
		  Many studies have focused on leveraging user-generated
		  information to analyze blogs and forums, but few studies
		  have applied this approach to video-sharing Web sites. In
		  this study, we propose a text-based framework for video
		  content classification of online-video sharing Web sites.
		  Different types of user-generated data (e.g., titles,
		  descriptions, and comments) were used as proxies for online
		  videos, and three types of text features (lexical,
		  syntactic, and content-specific features) were extracted.
		  Three feature-based classification techniques (C4.5,
		  Na\"{\i}ve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine) were used to
		  classify videos. To evaluate the proposed framework,
		  user-generated data from candidate videos, which were
		  identified by searching user-given keywords on YouTube,
		  were first collected. Then, a subset of the collected data
		  was randomly selected and manually tagged by users as our
		  experiment data. The experimental results showed that the
		  proposed approach was able to classify online videos based
		  on users' interests with accuracy rates up to 87.2%, and
		  all three types of text features contributed to
		  discriminating videos. Support Vector Machine outperformed
		  C4.5 and Na\"{\i}ve Bayes techniques in our experiments. In
		  addition, our case study further demonstrated that accurate
		  video-classification results are very useful for
		  identifying implicit cyber communities on video-sharing Web
		  sites. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract	= {The authors describe a flexible model and a system for
		  content-based image retrieval of objects' shapes.
		  Flexibility is intended as the possibility of customizing
		  the system behavior to the user's needs and perceptions.
		  This is achieved by allowing users to modify the retrieval
		  function. The system implementing this model uses multiple
		  representations to characterize some macroscopic
		  characteristics of the objects shapes. Specifically, the
		  shape indexes describe the global features of the object's
		  contour (represented by the Fourier coefficients), the
		  contour's irregularities (represented by the multifractal
		  spectrum), and the presence of concavities and convexities
		  (represented by the contour scale space distribution).
		  During a query formulation, the user can specify both the
		  preference for the macroscopic shape aspects that he or she
		  considers meaningful for the retrieval, and the desired
		  level of accuracy of the matching, which means that the
		  visual query shape must be considered with a given
		  tolerance in representing the desired shapes. The
		  evaluation experiments showed that this system can be
		  suited to different retrieval behaviors, and that,
		  generally, the combination of the multiple shape
		  representations increases both recall and precision with
		  respect to the application of any single representation. ©

		  development during the past decade presents an excellent
		  opportunity for a scientometric study because it can
		  provide insights into the dynamic growth of the
		  fast-evolving social networks associated with this field.
		  In this article, we describe a case study conducted on
		  nanotechnology to discover the dynamics that govern the
		  growth process of rapidly advancing
		  scientific-collaboration networks. This article starts with
		  the definition of temporal social networks and demonstrates
		  that the nanotechnology collaboration network, similar to
		  other real-world social networks, exhibits a set of
		  intriguing static and dynamic topological properties.
		  Inspired by the observations that in collaboration networks
		  new connections tend to be augmented between nodes in
		  proximity, we explore the locality elements and the
		  attachedness factor in growing networks. In particular, we
		  develop two distance-based computational network growth
		  schemes, namely the distance-based growth model (DG) and
		  the hybrid degree and distance-based growth model (DDG).
		  The DG model considers only locality element while the DDG
		  is a hybrid model that factors into both locality and
		  attachedness elements. The simulation results from these
		  models indicate that both clustering coefficient rates and
		  the average shortest distance are closely related to the
		  edge densification rates. In addition, the hybrid DDG model
		  exhibits higher clustering coefficient values and
		  decreasing average shortest distance when the edge
		  densification rate is fixed, which implies that combining
		  locality and attachedness can better characterize the
		  growing process of the nanotechnology community. Based on
		  the simulation results, we conclude that social network
		  evolution is related to both attachedness and locality
		  factors. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  oriented approach to the analysis and representation of the
		  social and intellectual structure of scientific fields. A
		  sociological perspective is introduced as the theoretical
		  basis to analyze scientific fields, and the social network
		  framework is adopted to develop a multidisciplinary
		  approach to analyze the organization of science. This
		  approach is then applied to study the Spanish Library and
		  Information Science community from 1999 to 2007. The
		  underlying notion is that science is organized work, in
		  which the pursuit of impact shapes the specific scientific
		  organization. This generates mutual dependence and control
		  among researchers, which may restrict access when formally
		  communicating with other scientific communities. On the
		  other hand, scholarly journals facilitate the coordination
		  of new knowledge and serve as platforms for interaction
		  among scientists. Consequently, the interaction of
		  well-defined groups of homogenous researchers, concentrated
		  around particular sets of journals, leads to the formation
		  of cohesive (sub)groups tied together by the degree of
		  similarity of the researchers' competence. An empirical

		  from and dismantled their group when the funding period
		  ended and the project was winding down. Qualitative
		  interviews with group members were analyzed using a model
		  of disengaging that was developed in an earlier study. The
		  model comprises 12 interwoven parts of a disengaging
		  process that begins well before the group ends and extends
		  beyond the official termination of the group. The model
		  frames the analysis and is revised as a result of the

  abstract	= {The purpose of this study is to examine whether the
		  understandings of subject-indexing processes conducted by
		  human indexers have a positive impact on the effectiveness
		  of automatic subject term assignment through text
		  categorization (TC). More specifically, human indexers'
		  subject-indexing approaches, or conceptions, in conjunction
		  with semantic sources were explored in the context of a
		  typical scientific journal article dataset. Based on the
		  premise that subject indexing approaches or conceptions
		  with semantic sources are important for automatic subject
		  term assignment through TC, this study proposed an indexing
		  conception-based framework. For the purpose of this study,
		  two research questions were explored: To what extent are
		  semantic sources effective? To what extent are indexing
		  conceptions effective? The experiments were conducted using
		  a Support Vector Machine implementation in WEKA (I.H.
		  Witten &amp; E. Frank, [2000]). Using F-measure, the
		  experiment results showed that cited works, source title,
		  and title were as effective as the full text while a
		  keyword was found more effective than the full text. In
		  addition, the findings showed that an indexing
		  conception-based framework was more effective than the full
		  text. The content-oriented and the document-oriented
		  indexing approaches especially were found more effective
		  than the full text. Among three indexing conception-based
		  approaches, the content-oriented approach and the
		  document-oriented approach were more effective than the
		  domain-oriented approach. In other words, in the context of
		  a typical scientific journal article dataset, the objective
		  contents and authors' intentions were more desirable for
		  automatic subject term assignment via TC than the possible
		  users' needs. The findings of this study support that
		  incorporation of human indexers' indexing approaches or
		  conception in conjunction with semantic sources has a
		  positive impact on the effectiveness of automatic subject

		  measure, the w-index, as a particularly simple and more
		  useful way to assess the substantial impact of a
		  researcher's work, especially regarding excellent papers.
		  The w-index can be defined as follows: If w of a
		  researcher's papers have at least 10w citations each and
		  the other papers have fewer than 10(w+1) citations, that
		  researcher's w-index is w. The results demonstrate that
		  there are noticeable differences between the w-index and
		  the h-index, because the w-index plays close attention to
		  the more widely cited papers. These discrepancies can be
		  measured by comparing the ranks of 20 astrophysicists, a
		  few famous physical scientists, and 16 Price medalists.
		  Furthermore, I put forward the w(q)-index to improve the
		  discriminatory power of the w-index and to rank scientists
		  with the same w. The factor q is the least number of
		  citations a researcher with w needed to reach w+1. In terms
		  of both simplicity and accuracy, the w-index or w(q)-index
		  can be widely used for evaluation of scientists, journals,

		  decades. With the advent of the Web and the rapid increases
		  in the amount of data and the number of Web documents and
		  users, researchers have focused on enhancing the
		  interoperability of data through the development of
		  metadata schemes. Other researchers have looked to the
		  wealth of metadata generated by bookmarking sites on the
		  Social Web. While several existing ontologies have
		  capitalized on the semantics of metadata created by tagging
		  activities, the Upper Tag Ontology (UTO) emphasizes the
		  structure of tagging activities to facilitate modeling of
		  tagging data and the integration of data from different
		  bookmarking sites as well as the alignment of tagging
		  ontologies. UTO is described and its utility in modeling,
		  harvesting, integrating, searching, and analyzing data is
		  demonstrated with metadata harvested from three major
		  social tagging systems (Delicious, Flickr, and YouTube). ©

  abstract	= {The method of latent semantic indexing (LSI) is well-known
		  for tackling the synonymy and polysemy problems in
		  information retrieval; however, its performance can be very
		  different for various datasets, and the questions of what
		  characteristics of a dataset and why these characteristics
		  contribute to this difference have not been fully
		  understood. In this article, we propose that the
		  mathematical structure of simplexes can be attached to a
		  term-document matrix in the vector space model (VSM) for
		  information retrieval. The Q-analysis devised by R.H. Atkin
		  ([1974]) may then be applied to effect an analysis of the
		  topological structure of the simplexes and their
		  corresponding dataset. Experimental results of this
		  analysis reveal that there is a correlation between the
		  effectiveness of LSI and the topological structure of the
		  dataset. By using the information obtained from the
		  topological analysis, we develop a new method to explore
		  the semantic information in a dataset. Experimental results
		  show that our method can enhance the performance of VSM for
		  datasets over which LSI is not effective. © 2010 Wiley

		  in search result interfaces of hierarchical query-driven
		  information retrieval systems in a manner that can support
		  understanding and exploration of the context of the
		  retrieved information (e.g., by highlighting its position
		  in the granular hierarchy and exposing its relationship
		  with relatives in the hierarchy). Little research, however,
		  has been conducted on the effects of granularity of search
		  results on the relevance judgment behavior of engineers.
		  Engineers are highly motivated information users who are
		  particularly interested in understanding the context of the
		  retrieved information. Therefore, it is hypothesized that
		  the design of systems with careful regard for granularity
		  would improve engineers' relevance judgment behavior. To
		  test this hypothesis, a prototype system was developed and
		  evaluated in terms of the time needed for users to find
		  relevant information, the accuracy of their relevance
		  judgment, and their subjective satisfaction. To evaluate
		  the prototype, a user study was conducted where
		  participants were asked to complete tasks, complete a
		  satisfaction questionnaire, and be interviewed. The
		  findings showed that participants performed better and were
		  more satisfied when the prototype system presented only
		  relevant information in context. Although this study
		  presents some novel findings about the effects of
		  granularity and context on user relevance judgment
		  behavior, the results should be interpreted with caution.

		  examine how information judgments employed by doctors to
		  mitigate risk impact their cognitive search. Diaries
		  encompassing 444 real clinical information search

		  “the user's view” and offers a reinterpretation of
		  these views. The paper finds that what was regarded as the

		  been considered (with very few exceptions). Other views,
		  which are based on less fruitful assumptions, have
		  dominated the discourse on relevance in information

		  theoretical assumptions seem not to have been properly
		  addressed. It is as urgent now as it was in 1975 seriously
		  to consider “the subject knowledge view” of relevance
		  (which may also be termed “the epistemological view”).
		  The concept of relevance, like other basic concepts, is
		  influenced by overall approaches to information science,
		  such as the cognitive view and the domain-analytic view.

		  widely with respect to quality and repute. Independently of
		  their informational content, certain podcasts provide
		  satisfying listening material while other podcasts have

		  framework for analyzing listener appeal, and we demonstrate
		  its application to the task of automatically predicting the
		  listening preferences of users. First, we describe the
		  PodCred framework, which consists of an inventory of
		  factors contributing to user perceptions of the credibility
		  and quality of podcasts. The framework is designed to
		  support automatic prediction of whether or not a particular
		  podcast will enjoy listener preference. It consists of four
		  categories of indicators related to the Podcast Content,
		  the Podcaster, the Podcast Context, and the Technical
		  Execution of the podcast. Three studies contributed to the

		  the accessed information is not within the typical
		  interests of that group and similar to the terrorist

		  as many citations as their identical counterparts published
		  in journals with lower impact factors. The intrinsic value

		  by the information visualization community to reorganize
		  and depict document archives that are not inherently

		  metaphor is that everyone intuitively understands
		  landscapes. We critically examine the information
		  visualization designer's ontologies for implementing
		  spatialized landscapes with ontologies of the geographic
		  domain held by lay people. In the second half of the
		  article, we report on a qualitative study where we
		  empirically assessed whether the landscape metaphor has
		  explanatory power for users trying to make sense of
		  spatialized views, and if so, in what ways. Specifically,
		  we are interested in uncovering how lay people interpret
		  hills and valleys in an information landscape, and whether
		  their interpretation is congruent with the current
		  scientific understanding of geomorphologic processes. Our
		  empirical results suggest that neither developers' nor lay
		  users' understanding of terrain visualizations is based on
		  universal understanding of the true process that has shaped
		  a natural landscape into hills and valleys, mountains, and
		  canyons. Our findings also suggest that the information
		  landscape metaphor for sense making of a document
		  collection is not self-evident to lay users, as claimed by
		  information landscape designers. While a deep understanding
		  of geomorphology will probably not be required to
		  successfully use an information landscape, we do suggest
		  that a coherent theory on how people use space will be

		  need for the evaluation of results from public-sector
		  research activity, particularly to permit the efficient
		  allocation of ever scarcer resources. Many of the studies
		  and evaluation exercises that have been conducted at the
		  national and international levels emphasize the quality
		  dimension of research output, while neglecting that of
		  productivity. This work is intended to test for the
		  possible existence of correlation between quantity and
		  quality of scientific production and determine whether the
		  most productive researchers are also those that achieve
		  results that are qualitatively better than those of their
		  colleagues. The analysis proposed refers to the entire
		  Italian university system and is based on the observation
		  of production in the hard sciences by more than 26,000
		  researchers in the period 2001–2005. The results show
		  that the output of more-productive researchers is superior
		  in quality than that of less-productive researchers. The
		  relation between productivity and quality results is
		  largely insensitive to the types of indicators or the test
		  methods applied and also seems to differ little among the

  abstract	= {Domain ontologies play an important role in supporting
		  knowledge-based applications in the Semantic Web. To
		  facilitate the building of ontologies, text mining
		  techniques have been used to perform ontology learning from
		  texts. However, traditional systems employ shallow natural
		  language processing techniques and focus only on concept
		  and taxonomic relation extraction. In this paper we present
		  a system, known as Concept-Relation-Concept Tuple-based
		  Ontology Learning (CRCTOL), for mining ontologies
		  automatically from domain-specific documents. Specifically,
		  CRCTOL adopts a full text parsing technique and employs a
		  combination of statistical and lexico-syntactic methods,
		  including a statistical algorithm that extracts key
		  concepts from a document collection, a word sense
		  disambiguation algorithm that disambiguates words in the
		  key concepts, a rule-based algorithm that extracts
		  relations between the key concepts, and a modified
		  generalized association rule mining algorithm that prunes
		  unimportant relations for ontology learning. As a result,
		  the ontologies learned by CRCTOL are more concise and
		  contain a richer semantics in terms of the range and number
		  of semantic relations compared with alternative systems. We
		  present two case studies where CRCTOL is used to build a
		  terrorism domain ontology and a sport event domain
		  ontology. At the component level, quantitative evaluation
		  by comparing with Text-To-Onto and its successor Text2Onto
		  has shown that CRCTOL is able to extract concepts and
		  semantic relations with a significantly higher level of
		  accuracy. At the ontology level, the quality of the learned
		  ontologies is evaluated by either employing a set of
		  quantitative and qualitative methods including analyzing
		  the graph structural property, comparison to WordNet, and
		  expert rating, or directly comparing with a human-edited
		  benchmark ontology, demonstrating the high quality of the
		  ontologies learned. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  percentage of its cited references made to journals of
		  other disciplines. We show that although for all
		  disciplines combined there is no clear correlation between
		  the level of interdisciplinarity of articles and their
		  citation rates, there are nonetheless some disciplines in
		  which a higher level of interdisciplinarity is related to a
		  higher citation rates. For other disciplines, citations

		  This suggests that there might be an optimum of

		  delimiter-based method is much more stable and domain
		  independent than the previous approaches. In the second
		  step on term verification, an algorithm using link analysis
		  is applied to calculate the relevance between term

		  The approach is not targeted at any specific domain and
		  there is no need for extensive training when applying it to
		  new domains. In other words, the method is not domain
		  dependent and it is especially useful for resource-limited
		  domains. Evaluations of Chinese text in two different
		  domains show quite significant improvements over existing
		  techniques and also verify its efficiency and its
		  relatively domain-independent nature. The proposed method

  abstract	= {The Basic Vector Space Model (BVSM) is well known in
		  information retrieval. Unfortunately, its retrieval
		  effectiveness is limited because it is based on literal
		  term matching. The Generalized Vector Space Model (GVSM)
		  and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) are two prominent
		  semantic retrieval methods, both of which assume there is
		  some underlying latent semantic structure in a dataset that
		  can be used to improve retrieval performance. However,
		  while this structure may be derived from both the term
		  space and the document space, GVSM exploits only the former
		  and LSI the latter. In this article, the latent semantic
		  structure of a dataset is examined from a dual perspective;
		  namely, we consider the term space and the document space
		  simultaneously. This new viewpoint has a natural connection
		  to the notion of kernels. Specifically, a unified kernel
		  function can be derived for a class of vector space models.
		  The dual perspective provides a deeper understanding of the
		  semantic space and makes transparent the geometrical
		  meaning of the unified kernel function. New semantic
		  analysis methods based on the unified kernel function are
		  developed, which combine the advantages of LSI and GVSM. We
		  also prove that the new methods are stable because although
		  the selected rank of the truncated Singular Value
		  Decomposition (SVD) is far from the optimum, the retrieval
		  performance will not be degraded significantly. Experiments
		  performed on standard test collections show that our

		  difficulties in formulating effective search strategies. It
		  focused on examining the relationship between types of

		  study was conducted to capture, examine, and elucidate the
		  analytical processes and work practices of human analysts
		  when they simulated the role of an implicit feedback system
		  by trying to infer searchers' interests from behavioral
		  traces. Findings provided rare insight into the

		  important for continuation of question-and-answer (Q&amp;A)
		  activity online and that it also leads to monetary rewards.
		  The present research focuses on the link between social
		  interaction and the value of information. Expressions of
		  self-presentation in the interaction between askers and
		  answerers online are studied as antecedents for answer
		  feedback which represents the value of the answer to the
		  asker. This relationship is examined in a Q&amp;A site,
		  specifically, in Google Answers (GA). The results of
		  content analysis performed on sets of questions and answers
		  show that both explicit and implicit social cues are used
		  by the site's participants; however, only implicit
		  expressions of self-presentation are related to the
		  provision of social and monetary feedback, ratings, and
		  tips. This finding highlights the importance of implicit
		  cues in textual communication and lends support to the
		  notion of social capital where both monetary and social
		  forms of feedback are the result of interaction online. ©

		  which flow from person to person by copying or imitation.
		  More than any previous medium, the Internet has the
		  technical capabilities for global meme diffusion. Yet, to
		  spread globally, memes need to negotiate their way through
		  cultural and linguistic borders. This article introduces a
		  new broad method, Web memetics, comprising extensive Web
		  searches and combined quantitative and qualitative
		  analyses, to identify and assess: (a) the different
		  versions of a meme, (b) its evolution online, and (c) its
		  Web presence and translation into common Internet
		  languages. This method is demonstrated through one
		  extensively circulated joke about men, women, and
		  computers. The results show that the joke has mutated into
		  several different versions and is widely translated, and
		  that translations incorporate small, local adaptations
		  while retaining the English versions' fundamental
		  components. In conclusion, Web memetics has demonstrated
		  its ability to identify and track the evolution and spread
		  of memes online, with interesting results, albeit for only

		  usage when the information is relevant, and helpful

		  students. It describes how they found and used information,
		  and explores their motivation and decision making. We
		  employed a use-in-context approach where students were
		  observed conducting, and were interviewed about,
		  information-seeking tasks carried out during their academic
		  work. We found that participants were reluctant to engage
		  with a complex range of information sources, preferring to
		  use the Internet. The main driver for progress in
		  information seeking was the immediate demands of their work
		  (e.g., assignments). Students used their growing expertise
		  to justify a conservative information strategy, retaining
		  established strategies as far as possible and completing
		  tasks with minimum information-seeking effort. The time
		  cost of using library material limited the uptake of such
		  resources. New methods for discovering and selecting
		  information were adopted only when immediately relevant to
		  the task at hand, and tasks were generally chosen or
		  interpreted in ways that minimized the need to develop new
		  strategies. Students were driven by the demands of the task
		  to use different types of information resources, but
		  remained reluctant to move beyond keyword searches, even
		  when they proved ineffective. They also lacked confidence
		  in evaluating the relative usefulness of resources. Whereas
		  existing literature on satisficing has focused on stopping
		  conditions, this work has highlighted a richer repertoire

		  paper focuses on automatic categorization of documents from

		  contrasted: CISMeF, which uses rules based on human
		  indexing of the documents by the Medical Subject Headings
		  (MeSH) controlled vocabulary in order to assign metaterms
		  (MTs), and Journal Descriptor Indexing (JDI), based on
		  human categorization of about 4,000 journals and

		  and textwords in the documents. We evaluate and compare the
		  performance of these systems against a gold standard of
		  humanly assigned categories for 100 MEDLINE documents,
		  using six measures selected from trec_eval. The results
		  show that for five of the measures performance is
		  comparable, and for one measure JDI is superior. We
		  conclude that these results favor JDI, given the
		  significantly greater intellectual overhead involved in
		  human indexing and maintaining a rule base for mapping MeSH
		  terms to MTs. We also note a JDI method that associates JDs
		  with MeSH indexing rather than textwords, and it may be
		  worthwhile to investigate whether this JDI method
		  (statistical) and CISMeF (rule-based) might be combined and

		  techniques that were applied to Arabic text. The techniques
		  include stemming, light stemming, and word clusters. The
		  effects of the aforementioned techniques were studied and
		  analyzed on the K-nearest-neighbor classifier. Stemming
		  reduces words to their stems. Light stemming, by
		  comparison, removes common affixes from words without
		  reducing them to their stems. Word clusters group
		  synonymous words into clusters and each cluster is
		  represented by a single word. The purpose of employing the
		  previous methods is to reduce the size of document vectors
		  without affecting the accuracy of the classifiers. The
		  comparison metric includes size of document vectors,
		  classification time, and accuracy (in terms of precision
		  and recall). Several experiments were carried out using
		  four different representations of the same corpus: the
		  first version uses stem-vectors, the second uses light
		  stem-vectors, the third uses word clusters, and the fourth
		  uses the original words (without any transformation) as
		  representatives of documents. The corpus consists of 15,000
		  documents that fall into three categories: sports,
		  economics, and politics. In terms of vector sizes and
		  classification time, the stemmed vectors consumed the
		  smallest size and the least time necessary to classify a
		  testing dataset that consists of 6,000 documents. The light
		  stemmed vectors superseded the other three representations

  abstract	= {When applying for patents, companies should consider
		  performing patent portfolios as a means of integrating
		  their patent strategy to shape their overall business
		  strategy. This is an important issue for any company in
		  pursuit of enhanced operational performance because the
		  whole raison d'\^{e}tre behind the application of patents
		  is the anticipation of achieving maximum competitive
		  advantage. A prerequisite for such a company is a decision
		  analysis model of patent portfolios because this has the
		  added advantage of being readily applicable to the
		  evaluation of the quality of its competitors' portfolios;
		  thus, by understanding both itself and its competitors, a
		  company can attain a superior position. To demonstrate
		  this, we examine patent priority networks (PPNs) formed
		  through patent family members and claimed priority patents,
		  performing a model of patent portfolio analysis and then
		  going on to determine the algorithms. We suggest that
		  information retrieved from this network can provide a
		  useful reference tool for decision-making by company CEOs,
		  CTOs, R&amp;D managers, and intellectual property managers.

		  this article, we examine the potential for using Wikipedia
		  to fill in the gaps in one's own knowledge that may be

		  frequently while reading, then this may detract from the
		  reader's final understanding of the given document. Our
		  goal is to increase access to explanatory text for readers
		  by retrieving a single Wikipedia article that is related to
		  a text passage that has been highlighted. This approach
		  differs from traditional search methods where the users
		  formulate search queries and review lists of possibly
		  relevant results. This explicit search activity can be
		  disruptive to reading. Our approach is to minimize the user
		  interaction involved in finding related information by
		  removing explicit query formulation and providing a single
		  relevant result. To evaluate the feasibility of this
		  approach, we first examined the effectiveness of three
		  contextual algorithms for retrieval. To evaluate the
		  effectiveness for readers, we then developed a functional
		  prototype that uses the text of the abstract being read as
		  context and retrieves a single relevant Wikipedia article
		  in response to a passage the user has highlighted. We
		  conducted a small user study where participants were
		  allowed to use the prototype while reading abstracts. The

		  personal relationships for HIV-AIDS information, they
		  explain little about how this happens as a social process.
		  To investigate how PHAs and their friends-family members
		  acquire and share network-mediated HIV-AIDS information,
		  semistructured, in-depth interviews were conducted in three
		  rural regions of Canada. Interviews were carried out with
		  114 PHAs, their friends-family members, and health care and

		  Haythornthwaite's ([1996]) concepts of network-mediated
		  information processes and Talja and Hansen's ([2006])
		  collaborative information behavior framework. Findings
		  revealed that participants obtained HIV-AIDS information

		  suggest that health information practice might benefit from
		  a focus on program strategies such as building information

		  resources to support homeless young people. We collected
		  250 information resources and analyzed how these materials
		  were organized and presented at four service agencies. In
		  general, the agencies used ad hoc organizational schemes
		  and presentations that were not in keeping with the key
		  values of the alliance, which include human welfare,
		  respect, trust, autonomy, and sustainability. To improve
		  information delivery and the projection of common values,
		  we followed a two-step design process. First, based on a

		  scheme. Second, we developed four interrelated prototypes
		  for presenting information resources: Rolling Case,

		  past experience with Wikipedia, their positive emotional
		  state, their disposition to believe information in
		  Wikipedia, and information utility were positively related
		  to their outcome expectations of Wikipedia. However, among
		  the factors affecting outcome expectations, only
		  information utility and respondents' positive emotions
		  toward Wikipedia were related to their use of it. Further,
		  when all of the independent variables, including the
		  mediator, outcome expectations, were considered, only the
		  variable information utility was related to Wikipedia use,
		  which may imply a limited applicability of SCT to
		  understanding Wikipedia use. However, more empirical
		  evidence is needed to determine the applicability of this
		  theory to Wikipedia use. Finally, this study supports the
		  knowledge value of Wikipedia (Fallis, [2008]), despite
		  students' cautious attitudes toward Wikipedia. The study
		  suggests that educators and librarians need to provide
		  better guidelines for using Wikipedia, rather than
		  prohibiting Wikipedia use altogether. © 2009 Wiley

		  summarization today. While traditional feature-based
		  approaches evaluate sentence significance and rank the
		  sentences relying on the features that are particularly
		  designed to characterize the different aspects of the
		  individual sentences, the newly emerging graph-based
		  ranking algorithms (such as the PageRank-like algorithms)
		  recursively compute sentence significance using the global
		  information in a text graph that links sentences together.
		  In general, the existing PageRank-like algorithms can model
		  well the phenomena that a sentence is important if it is
		  linked by many other important sentences. Or they are
		  capable of modeling the mutual reinforcement among the
		  sentences in the text graph. However, when dealing with

		  exercises for evaluation of national research systems,
		  generally based on peer review. They respond to two main
		  needs: stimulating higher efficiency in research activities
		  by public laboratories, and realizing better allocative
		  efficiency in government funding of such institutions.
		  However, the peer review approach is typified by several
		  limitations that raise doubts for the achievement of the
		  ultimate objectives. In particular, subjectivity of
		  judgment, which occurs during the step of selecting
		  research outputs to be submitted for the evaluations, risks
		  heavily distorting both the final ratings of the
		  organizations evaluated and the ultimate funding they
		  receive. These distortions become ever more relevant if the

		  the current study is to propose a quantitative methodology
		  based on bibliometric data that would provide a reliable
		  support for the process of selecting the best products of a

		  twofold: single research institutions can maximize the

		  the real quality of their research. At the same time,
		  broader adoptions of this approach could also provide
		  strong advantages at the macroeconomic level, since it
		  guarantees financial allocations based on the real value of

  abstract	= {A new method for mapping the semantic structure of science
		  is described. We assume that different researchers, working
		  on the same set of research problems, will use the same
		  words for concepts central to their research problems.
		  Therefore, different research fields and disciplines should
		  be identifiable by different words and the pattern of
		  co-occurring words. In natural language, however, there is
		  quite some diversity because many words have multiple
		  meaning. In addition, the same meaning can be expressed by
		  using different words. We argue that traditional factor
		  analytic and cluster analytic techniques are inadequate for
		  mapping the semantic structure if such polysemous and
		  synonymous words are present. Instead, an alternative
		  model, the mixtures of factor analyzers (MFA) model, is
		  utilized. This model extends the traditional factor
		  analytic model by allowing multiple centroids of the
		  dataset. We argue that this model is structurally better
		  suited to map the semantic structure of science. The model
		  is illustrated by a case study of the uncertainty
		  literature sampled from data from the ISI Web of Science.
		  The MFA model is applied with the goal of discovering
		  multiple, potentially incommensurate, conceptualizations of
		  uncertainty in the literature. In this way, the MFA model
		  can help in creating understanding of the use of language
		  in science, which can benefit multidisciplinary research
		  and interdisciplinary understanding, and assist in the
		  development of multidisciplinary taxonomies of science. ©

		  STOXX® TMI Banks [8300] Index. Regarding the factors for
		  the implementation of WA, we considered two feasible
		  reasons. First, WA adoption can be motivated by operational
		  factors, as WA can contribute to increase the efficiency of
		  the operations. Second, WA can also be understood as a part
		  of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy, so
		  banks that are more committed with CSR should be more prone
		  to implement WA. However, our results indicate that neither

		  these findings is the advisability of orientating
		  governmental policies to firm awareness of the fact that WA
		  should be a part of the CSR activities of banks. Regarding
		  the effects of the implementation of WA, our results
		  indicate that the effort pays dividends in terms of

		  Index—can be decomposed by indexers or algorithmically.
		  In this study, we test the results of two recently
		  available algorithms for the decomposition of large
		  matrices against two content-based classifications of
		  journals: the ISI Subject Categories and the field-subfield
		  classification of Gl\"{a}nzel and Schubert (2003). The
		  content-based schemes allow for the attribution of more
		  than a single category to a journal, whereas the algorithms
		  maximize the ratio of within-category citations over
		  between-category citations in the aggregated
		  category-category citation matrix. By adding categories,
		  indexers generate between-category citations, which may
		  enrich the database, for example, in the case of
		  inter-disciplinary developments. Algorithmic
		  decompositions, on the other hand, are more heavily skewed
		  towards a relatively small number of categories, while this
		  is deliberately counter-acted upon in the case of

		  effects, science policy studies and the sociology of

		  classifications, which are made for bibliographic
		  disclosure, and not for the purpose of analyzing latent
		  structures in scientific communications. Despite the large

  abstract	= {Name identification has been worked on quite intensively
		  for the past few years, and has been incorporated into
		  several products revolving around natural language
		  processing tasks. Many researchers have attacked the name
		  identification problem in a variety of languages, but only
		  a few limited research efforts have focused on named entity
		  recognition for Arabic script. This is due to the lack of
		  resources for Arabic named entities and the limited amount
		  of progress made in Arabic natural language processing in
		  general. In this article, we present the results of our
		  attempt at the recognition and extraction of the 10 most
		  important categories of named entities in Arabic script:
		  the person name, location, company, date, time, price,
		  measurement, phone number, ISBN, and file name. We
		  developed the system Named Entity Recognition for Arabic
		  (NERA) using a rule-based approach. The resources created
		  are: a Whitelist representing a dictionary of names, and a
		  grammar, in the form of regular expressions, which are
		  responsible for recognizing the named entities. A
		  filtration mechanism is used that serves two different
		  purposes: (a) revision of the results from a named entity
		  extractor by using metadata, in terms of a Blacklist or
		  rejecter, about ill-formed named entities and (b)
		  disambiguation of identical or overlapping textual matches
		  returned by different name entity extractors to get the
		  correct choice. In NERA, we addressed major challenges
		  posed by NER in the Arabic language arising due to the
		  complexity of the language, peculiarities in the Arabic
		  orthographic system, nonstandardization of the written
		  text, ambiguity, and lack of resources. NERA has been
		  effectively evaluated using our own tagged corpus; it
		  achieved satisfactory results in terms of precision,
		  recall, and F-measure. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  but attempts to include citations from or to books in the

		  science, and humanities disciplines. Book citations were
		  31% to 212% of ISI citations and, hence, numerous enough to
		  supplement ISI citations in the social sciences and

		  citations, indicating a significant relationship between

		  exceptions that point to the additional information
		  provided by book citations. In summary, GBS is clearly a

		  library catalog records, to obtain relevant results. These
		  improperly formulated queries often yield irrelevant
		  results or no results at all. This negative experience in

		  network formed by the Web pages of Japanese public
		  libraries and its relationship with the network formed by
		  Inter-Library Loans (ILLs), the traditional system of
		  cooperation among public libraries. Our results indicate
		  that (a) the hyperlink network is effectively connected in
		  the sense that each library is reachable from other
		  libraries by clicking a few links and (b) the network has
		  many groups of libraries that cooperate with each other.
		  Most of the cliques consist of prefectural libraries or
		  libraries in the same prefecture. The hyperlink network
		  shows two of the same tendencies as the ILL network: (a)
		  The connection among libraries that are geographically
		  close to each other or in the same administrative unit is
		  strong, and (b) prefectural libraries occupy the central
		  position. There are differences between them, however, in
		  terms of the amount of ILLs and cliques. We conclude that
		  Japanese public libraries have formed a network on the Web
		  that is strongly affected by traditional cooperation, but
		  also incorporates some new types of cooperation from the
		  perspective of cliques. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract	= {Instrument validation is a critical step that researchers
		  should employ in order to ensure the generation of
		  scientifically valid knowledge. Without it, the basis of
		  research findings and the generalization of such are
		  threatened. This is especially true in the social sciences,
		  a discipline in which the majority of published articles
		  utilize subjective instruments in the collection of data.
		  Consequently, instrument validation has increasingly become
		  common practice in the social sciences, yet implementation
		  of this practice differs greatly among the social-science
		  disciplines. The assessment of instrument validation
		  undertaken in this study attempts to provide guidance for
		  reviewers, editors, authors, and readers, by offering
		  various techniques of validity and analyzing the quality of
		  a set of psychometric journal articles. In this research,
		  six attributes of instrument validation areas are
		  identified as validation protocol. The Journal of the
		  American Society for Information Science and Technology
		  (JASIST), which is widely recognized as a leading journal
		  in the field of information science, was selected for
		  examination to determine how well a set of research
		  articles ranked in meeting instrument-validation protocol.
		  Findings show that while researchers are becoming
		  increasingly attentive to certain validation issues,
		  standards on validation processes and reporting might prove
		  helpful. This paper identifies areas for improvement in the
		  reporting of validity measures and offers ways for
		  researchers to implement them. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals,

		  workshops, etc.) as an elite-group member such as an
		  organizing committee chair or member, program committee
		  chair or member, session chair, invited speaker, or award
		  winner is beneficial to a researcher's career development.
		  The objective of this study is to investigate whether
		  elite-group membership for scholarly events is
		  representative of scholars' prominence, and which elite
		  group is the most prestigious. We collected data about 15
		  global (excluding regional) bioinformatics scholarly events
		  held in 2007. We sampled (via stratified random sampling)
		  participants from elite groups in each event. Then,
		  bibliometric indicators (total citations and h index) of
		  seven elite groups and a non-elite group, consisting of
		  authors who submitted at least one paper to an event but
		  were not included in any elite group, were observed using
		  the Scopus Citation Tracker. The Kruskal–Wallis test was
		  performed to examine the differences among the eight
		  groups. Multiple comparison tests (Dwass, Steel,
		  Critchlow–Fligner) were conducted as follow-up
		  procedures. The experimental results reveal that scholars
		  in an elite group have better performance in bibliometric
		  indicators than do others. Among the elite groups, the
		  invited speaker group has statistically significantly the
		  best performance while the other elite-group types are not
		  significantly distinguishable. From this analysis, we
		  confirm that elite-group membership in scholarly events, at
		  least in the field of bioinformatics, can be utilized as an
		  alternative marker for a scholar's prominence, with invited
		  speaker being the most important prominence indicator among
		  the elite groups. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  method does not rely on patterns encoding specific
		  delimiters used in a particular citation style. This
		  feature yields a high degree of automation and flexibility,
		  and allows FLUX-CiM to extract from citations in any given
		  format. Differently from previous methods that are based on
		  models learned from user-driven training, our method relies
		  on a knowledge base automatically constructed from an
		  existing set of sample metadata records from a given field
		  (e.g., computer science, health sciences, social sciences,
		  etc.). These records are usually available on the Web or
		  other public data repositories. To demonstrate the
		  effectiveness and applicability of our proposed method, we
		  present a series of experiments in which we apply it to
		  extract bibliographic data from citations in articles of
		  different fields. Results of these experiments exhibit

		  perfect extraction for the large majority of citations

		  process with FLUX-CiM to automatically update and expand
		  the knowledge base of a given domain. We show that this

  abstract	= {Bibliometric measures for evaluating research units in the
		  book-oriented humanities and social sciences are
		  underdeveloped relative to those available for
		  journal-oriented science and technology. We therefore
		  present a new measure designed for book-oriented fields:
		  the “libcitation count.” This is a count of the
		  libraries holding a given book, as reported in a national
		  or international union catalog. As librarians decide what
		  to acquire for the audiences they serve, they jointly
		  constitute an instrument for gauging the cultural impact of
		  books. Their decisions are informed by knowledge not only
		  of audiences but also of the book world (e.g., the
		  reputations of authors and the prestige of publishers).
		  From libcitation counts, measures can be derived for
		  comparing research units. Here, we imagine a match-up
		  between the departments of history, philosophy, and
		  political science at the University of New South Wales and
		  the University of Sydney in Australia. We chose the 12
		  books from each department that had the highest libcitation
		  counts in the Libraries Australia union catalog during 2000
		  to 2006. We present each book's raw libcitation count, its
		  rank within its Library of Congress (LC) class, and its
		  LC-class normalized libcitation score. The latter is
		  patterned on the item-oriented field normalized citation
		  score used in evaluative bibliometrics. Summary statistics
		  based on these measures allow the departments to be
		  compared for cultural impact. Our work has implications for
		  programs such as Excellence in Research for Australia and
		  the Research Assessment Exercise in the United Kingdom. It
		  also has implications for data mining in OCLC's WorldCat.

		  that are interrelated, influencing others in a causal way.
		  It is very important to identify those factors and their
		  causal relationships to reduce the project risk. In the
		  past, most IT companies evaluate project risk by roughly
		  measuring the related factors, but ignoring the important
		  fact that there are complicated causal relationships among
		  them. There is a strong need to develop more effective
		  mechanisms to systematically judge all factors related to
		  project risk and identify the causal relationships among
		  those factors. To accomplish this research objective, our
		  study adopts a cognitive map (CM)-based mechanism called
		  the MACOM (Multi-Agents COgnitive Map), where CM is
		  represented by a set of multi-agents, each embedded with
		  basic intelligence to determine its causal relationships
		  with other agents. CM has proven especially useful in
		  solving unstructured problems with many variables and
		  causal relationships; however, simply applying CM to
		  project risk management is not enough because most causal
		  relationships are hard to identify and measure exactly. To
		  overcome this problem, we have borrowed a multi-agent
		  metaphor in which CM is represented by a set of
		  multi-agents, and project risk is explained through the
		  interaction of the multi-agents. Such an approach presents
		  a new computational capability for resolving complicated
		  decision problems. Using the MACOM framework, we have
		  proved that the task of resolving the IS project risk
		  management could be systematically and intelligently
		  solved, and in this way, IS project managers can be given

		  bibliometric measures (SBMs). Results from our recent study
		  (L. Bornmann, R. Mutz, &amp; H.-D. Daniel, 2008) have
		  indicated that there are two types of indices: One type of
		  indices (e.g., h index) describes the most productive core
		  of a scientist's output and informs about the number of
		  papers in the core. The other type of indices (e.g., a
		  index) depicts the impact of the papers in the core. In
		  evaluative bibliometric studies, the two dimensions
		  quantity and quality of output are usually assessed using
		  the SBMs “number of publications” (for the quantity
		  dimension) and “total citation counts” (for the impact
		  dimension). We additionally included the SBMs into the
		  factor analysis. The results of the newly calculated
		  analysis indicate that there is a high intercorrelation
		  between “number of publications” and the indices that

		  Core as well as between “total citation counts” and the
		  indices that load substantially on the factor Impact of the
		  Productive Core. The high-loading indices and SBMs within
		  one performance dimension could be called redundant in
		  empirical application, as high intercorrelations between
		  different indicators are a sign for measuring something
		  similar (or the same). Based on our findings, we propose
		  the use of any pair of indicators (one relating to the
		  number of papers in a researcher's productive core and one
		  relating to the impact of these core papers) as a
		  meaningful approach for comparing scientists. © 2009 Wiley

		  applying scroll bars and (linguistic) tags. Using SPSS, we

		  For more than half of the images, the test persons have

		  tagging using a scroll bar is, for some images, very high.
		  Most of the (most commonly used) linguistic tags are on the

		  information affects the effectiveness of early warning
		  systems. By effectiveness, we refer to the capacity of the
		  system to detect and decide on the existence of a threat.
		  There are two aspects to effectiveness: (a) being able to
		  see the evidence that is indicative of a threat and (b)
		  making the decision, based on the weight of the evidence,
		  to warn that the threat exists. In early warning,
		  information use is encumbered by cues that are fallible and
		  equivocal. Cues that are true indicators of a threat are
		  obscured in a cloud of events generated by chance.
		  Moreover, policy makers face the difficult decision of
		  whether to issue a warning based on the information
		  received. Because the information is rarely complete or
		  conclusive, such decisions have to consider the
		  consequences of failing to warn or giving a false warning.
		  We draw on sociocognitive theories of perception and
		  judgment to analyze these two aspects of early warning:
		  detection accuracy (How well does perception correspond to
		  reality?) and decision sensitivity (How much evidence is
		  needed to activate warning?) Using cognitive continuum
		  theory, we examine how detection accuracy depends on the
		  fit between the information needs profile of the threat and
		  the information use environment of the warning system.
		  Applying signal detection theory, we investigate how
		  decision sensitivity depends on the assessment and
		  balancing of the risks of misses and false alarms inherent
		  in all early warning decision making. © 2009 Wiley

		  sessions on popular topics, and sustained sessions using
		  obscure terms with greater query modification. The findings
		  also revealed shifts in session characteristics over time

		  sessions toward more popular search topics. A better
		  understanding of session characteristics can help system
		  designers to develop more responsive systems to support

		  compared to the performance of the four individual models
		  and their intermediate fusions when following the principle
		  of polyrepresentation. This principle is based on cognitive
		  IR perspective (Ingwersen &amp; J\"{a}rvelin, 2005) and
		  implies that each retrieval model is regarded as a
		  representation of a unique interpretation of information
		  retrieval (IR). It predicts that only fusions of very
		  different, but equally good, IR models may outperform each
		  constituent as well as their intermediate fusions. Two
		  kinds of experiments were carried out. One tested
		  restricted fusions, which entails that only the inner
		  disjoint overlap documents between fused models are ranked.
		  The second set of experiments was based on traditional data
		  fusion methods. The experiments involved the 30 TREC 5
		  topics that contain more than 44 relevant documents. In all
		  tests, the Borda and CombSUM scoring methods were used.
		  Performance was measured by precision and recall, with

		  of performance at both DCV levels and verifies the

		  however, that passage detection is not. Passage retrieval
		  is the determination of the degree of relevance of blocks
		  of text, namely passages, comprising a document. Rather
		  than determining the relevance of a document in its
		  entirety, passage retrieval determines the relevance of the
		  individual passages. As such, modified traditional
		  information-retrieval techniques compare terms found in
		  user queries with the individual passages to determine a
		  similarity score for passages of interest. In passage
		  detection, passages are classified into predetermined
		  categories. More often than not, passage detection
		  techniques are deployed to detect hidden paragraphs in
		  documents. That is, to hide information, documents are
		  injected with hidden text into passages. Rather than
		  matching query terms against passages to determine their
		  relevance, using text-mining techniques, the passages are
		  classified. Those documents with hidden passages are
		  defined as infected. Thus, simply stated, passage retrieval
		  is the search for passages relevant to a user query, while
		  passage detection is the classification of passages. That
		  is, in passage detection, passages are labeled with one or

  abstract	= {Why authors choose some references in preference to others
		  is a question that is still not wholly answered despite its
		  being of interest to scientists. The relevance of
		  references is twofold: They are a mechanism for tracing the
		  evolution of science, and because they enhance the image of
		  the cited authors, citations are a widely known and used
		  indicator of scientific endeavor. Following an extensive
		  review of the literature, we selected all papers that seek
		  to answer the central question and demonstrate that the
		  existing theories are not sufficient: Neither citation nor
		  indicator theory provides a complete and convincing answer.
		  Some perspectives in this arena remain, which are isolated
		  from the core literature. The purpose of this article is to
		  offer a fresh perspective on a 30-year-old problem by
		  extending the context of the discussion. We suggest
		  reviving the discussion about citation theories with a new
		  perspective, that of the readers, by layers or phases, in
		  the final choice of references, allowing for a new
		  classification in which any paper, to date, could be

		  recently attracted lots of attention from both research and
		  industry communities. Given a search topic, a prominent
		  existing approach is to apply some information retrieval
		  (IR) system to retrieve top ranking documents, which will
		  then be used to derive associations between experts and the
		  search topic based on cooccurrences. However, we argue that
		  expert finding is more sensitive to multiple levels of
		  associations and document features that current expert
		  finding systems insufficiently address, including (a)
		  multiple levels of associations between experts and search
		  topics, (b) document internal structure, and (c) document
		  authority. We propose a novel approach that integrates the
		  above-mentioned three aspects as well as a query expansion
		  technique in a two-stage model for expert finding. A
		  systematic evaluation is conducted on TREC collections to
		  test the performance of our approach as well as the effects
		  of multiple windows, document features, and query
		  expansion. These experimental results show that query
		  expansion can dramatically improve expert finding
		  performance with statistical significance. For three
		  well-known IR models with or without query expansion,
		  document internal structures help improve a single
		  window-based approach but without statistical significance,
		  while our novel multiple window-based approach can
		  significantly improve the performance of a single
		  window-based approach both with and without document
		  internal structures. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  increasingly popular as a knowledge-sharing tool in

		  researchers and practitioners. Trust has been widely
		  recognized in many studies as an important enabling factor
		  for seeking knowledge; however, the role of trust in
		  promoting knowledge-seeking behavior using KMS has not been
		  adequately addressed. Drawing upon the extant literature on
		  trust and information technology adoption, this article
		  examines the relationships between the knowledge seekers'

		  indirectly through a mediated effect of perceived
		  usefulness of the KMS. Furthermore, we find that trust
		  seems to be a stronger determinant of perceived usefulness
		  than of perceived seeking efforts. Our study thus
		  demonstrates the indirect, but still crucial, role of trust
		  in knowledge-seeking behavior in the context of corporate

		  task of factoid question answering (QA) is studied in this
		  paper. In particular, we consider different techniques for
		  answer processing with frame semantics: the level of
		  semantic class identification and role assignment to texts,
		  and the fusion of frame semantic-based answer-processing
		  approaches with other methods used in the Text REtrieval
		  Conference (TREC). The impact of each of these aspects on
		  the overall performance of a QA system is analyzed in this
		  paper. The TREC 2004 and TREC 2006 factoid question sets
		  were used for the experiments. These demonstrate that the
		  exploitation of encapsulated frame semantics in FrameNet in
		  a shallow semantic parsing process can enhance
		  answer-processing performance in factoid QA systems. This
		  improvement is dependent on the level of semantic
		  annotation, the frame semantic alignment method, and the
		  method of fusing frame semantic-based answer-processing
		  models with other existing models. A more comprehensively
		  annotated environment with all different part-of-speech
		  target predicates provides a higher chance of correct
		  factoid answer retrieval where semantic alignment is based
		  on both semantic classes and a relaxed set of semantic
		  roles for answer span identification. Our experiments on
		  fusion techniques of frame semantic-based and entity-based
		  answer-processing models show that merging answer lists
		  with respect to their scores and redundancy by exploiting a
		  fusion function leads to a more effective overall factoid

		  This algorithm has distinct advantages over most previous

		  avoids the use of similarity measures, relies entirely on
		  the topology of the weighted network, and can be applied to
		  relatively large networks. Most importantly, it requires no
		  subjective interpretation of the cocitation data or of the

		  resulting specialties are the smallest coherent
		  “groups” of researchers (within a hierarchy of cluster
		  sizes) and can thus be identified unambiguously.
		  Furthermore, we confirm that these communities are indeed
		  representative of what we know about the structure of a
		  given scientific discipline and that as specialties, they
		  can be accurately characterized by a few keywords (from the

  abstract	= {In most disciplines of scholarly endeavor, there are many
		  efforts at ranking research journals. There are two common
		  methods for such efforts. One of these is based on
		  tabulations of opinions offered by persons having some kind
		  of relationship with the discipline. The other is based on
		  analyses of the extent to which a journal's articles have
		  been cited by papers appearing in some selected set of
		  publications. In either case, construction of a journal
		  ranking for a discipline makes no effort to distinguish
		  between private and public universities. That is, data are
		  aggregated from both private and public faculty
		  researchers. It is thus assumed that the resultant ranking
		  is applicable for both kinds of institutions. But, is this
		  assumption reasonable? The answer is very important because
		  these rankings are applied in the evaluation of promotion,
		  tenure, and merit cases of faculty members working in a
		  discipline. Here, we examine this widespread bibliometric
		  assumption through the use of a ranking methodology that is
		  based on the actual publishing behaviors of tenured
		  researchers in a discipline. The method is used to study
		  the behaviors of researchers at leading private
		  universities versus those at leading public universities.
		  Illustrating this approach within the information systems
		  discipline, we find that there are indeed different
		  publication patterns for the private versus public
		  institutions. This finding suggests that journal-ranking
		  exercises should not ignore private–public distinctions
		  and that care should be taken to avoid evaluation standards
		  that confound private and public rankings of journals. ©

		  utilize capital-intensive facilities, technology-intensive

		  from leading medical journals in each country. The
		  frequency and length of ACKs, the number of named and
		  unnamed acknowledgees, the reasons why they were
		  acknowledged, the number of grants received, and the
		  sources of funding were recorded. The motivations that
		  underpinned each ACK were classified according to B.
		  Cronin's (1995) and C.L. Giles &amp; I.G. Councill's (2004)
		  typology. Results were analyzed by means of chi-square
		  tests. Our results show that ACKs from the English-language
		  corpus are significantly more frequent and longer than
		  those from both the Spanish and Venezuelan samples. The
		  number of persons acknowledged and the number of grants

		  than they were in the two Spanish-language corpora.
		  Differences were found in the number and types of funding

  abstract	= {E-mail messages are unquestionably one of the most popular
		  communication media these days. Not only are they fast and
		  reliable but also free in general. Unfortunately, a
		  significant number of e-mail messages received by e-mail
		  users on a daily basis are spam. This fact is annoying
		  since spam messages translate into a waste of the user's
		  time in reviewing and deleting them. In addition, spam
		  messages consume resources such as storage, bandwidth, and
		  computer-processing time. Many attempts have been made in
		  the past to eradicate spam; however, none has proven highly
		  effective. In this article, we propose a spam e-mail
		  detection approach, called SpamED, which uses the
		  similarity of phrases in messages to detect spam. Conducted
		  experiments not only verify that SpamED using trigrams in
		  e-mail messages is capable of minimizing false positives
		  and false negatives in spam detection but it also
		  outperforms a number of existing e-mail filtering
		  approaches with a 96% accuracy rate. © 2009 Wiley

		  and empirically tested a model with both service and
		  technology characteristics as the main drivers of service
		  quality and subsequent continuance intention of eTax, an
		  electronic government (eGovernment) service that enables
		  citizens to file their taxes online. Our data were
		  collected via a two-stage longitudinal online survey of 518
		  participants before and after they made use of the eTax
		  service in Hong Kong. The results showed that both service
		  characteristics (i.e., security and convenience) and one of
		  the technology characteristics (i.e., perceived usefulness,
		  but not perceived ease of use) were the key determinants of
		  service quality. Another interesting and important finding
		  that runs counter to the vast body of empirical evidence on
		  predicting intention is that perceived usefulness was not
		  the strongest predictor of continuance intention but rather
		  service quality was. To provide a richer picture of these
		  relationships, we also conducted a post-hoc analysis of the

		  culminating in the use of modern machine learning
		  classification methods. Nevertheless, most of this work
		  suffers from the limitation of assuming a small closed set
		  of candidate authors and essentially unlimited training
		  text for each. Real-life authorship attribution problems,
		  however, typically fall short of this ideal. Thus,
		  following detailed discussion of previous work, three
		  scenarios are considered here for which solutions to the
		  basic attribution problem are inadequate. In the first
		  variant, the profiling problem, there is no candidate set
		  at all; in this case, the challenge is to provide as much
		  demographic or psychological information as possible about
		  the author. In the second variant, the needle-in-a-haystack
		  problem, there are many thousands of candidates for each of
		  whom we might have a very limited writing sample. In the
		  third variant, the verification problem, there is no closed
		  candidate set but there is one suspect; in this case, the
		  challenge is to determine if the suspect is or is not the

  abstract	= {The Journal Impact Factor (JIF) published by Thomson
		  Reuters is often used to evaluate the significance and
		  performance of scientific journals. Besides methodological
		  problems with the JIF, the critical issue is whether a
		  single measure is sufficient for characterizing the impact
		  of journals, particularly the impact of multidisciplinary
		  and wide-scope journals that publish articles in a broad
		  range of research fields. Taking Angewandte Chemie
		  International Edition and the Journal of the American
		  Chemical Society as examples, we examined the two journals'
		  publication and impact profiles across the sections of
		  Chemical Abstracts and compared the results with the JIF.
		  The analysis was based primarily on Communications
		  published in Angewandte Chemie International Edition and
		  the Journal of the American Chemical Society during 2001 to
		  2005. The findings show that the information available in
		  the Science Citation Index is a rather unreliable
		  indication of the document type and is therefore
		  inappropriate for comparative analysis. The findings
		  further suggest that the composition of the journal in
		  terms of contribution types, the length of the citation
		  window, and the thematic focus of the journal in terms of
		  the sections of Chemical Abstracts has a significant
		  influence on the overall journal citation impact.
		  Therefore, a single measure of journal citation impact such
		  as the JIF is insufficient for characterizing the
		  significance and performance of wide-scope journals. For
		  the comparison of journals, more sophisticated methods such
		  as publication and impact profiles across subject headings
		  of bibliographic databases (e.g., the sections of Chemical
		  Abstracts) are valuable. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  misestimating the impact of independent variables on user
		  satisfaction. Building upon previous work, we empirically
		  tested the asymmetric and nonlinear IS user satisfaction
		  model in the context of Internet-based portals. Results
		  show that negative perceived performance on three of the

		  the incentive structure in a mixed economic and social
		  market for information. Prior research suggests that
		  tangible incentives will crowd out intangible incentives;
		  however, information markets invite special examination of
		  this finding. Data representing four years of activity by
		  523 researchers who gave about 52,000 answers on the Google
		  Answers Web site were collected. Analysis revealed that the
		  main predictor for researchers' participation was the
		  anticipation of tip (gratuity). Analysis of two researcher
		  subgroups showed that in the case of the frequent
		  researchers, the tip was followed by social incentives:
		  interaction (comments) and ratings. For occasional
		  researchers, the tip was followed by the price paid for
		  answers and then by comments. The results suggest that a
		  pure economic incentive serves as enticement; however,
		  social incentives induce persistent participation by
		  researchers and eventually lead to higher average economic
		  gains. The market is catalyzed by social activity, not
		  cannibalized by it, as may have been predicted by theory.
		  This finding provides empirical evidence for “social
		  capital” since social incentives were connected to higher
		  economic gains. The practical implication is that a mixed
		  incentive design is likely to generate lively

		  fuzzy ontology, is discussed. These correlations, first
		  assigned by experts, are updated after querying or when a

		  order to define a dynamic knowledge of a domain adapting

		  Information retrieval (IR) algorithm, using an object-fuzzy

		  algorithm allows us to derive a unique path among the

		  discourse; accordingly, the phenomenon of linguistic
		  politeness is prevalent in daily social interaction. Such
		  linguistic behavior underscores the fact that linguistic
		  politeness is a critical component of human communication.
		  Speech participants utilize linguistic politeness to avoid
		  and reduce social friction and enhance each other's face,
		  or public self-image, during social interaction. It is
		  face-work that underlies the interpersonal function of
		  language use and encompasses all verbal and nonverbal
		  realizations that bring forth one's positive social value,
		  namely, face. Face-work is founded in and built into
		  dynamic social relations; these social and cultural
		  relations and context directly affect the enactment of
		  face-work. Analysis and a subsequent understanding of
		  sociointerpersonal communication are critical to the
		  fostering of successful interaction and collaboration.
		  Linguistic politeness theory is well positioned to provide
		  a framework for an analysis of social interaction and
		  interpersonal variables among discourse participants

  abstract	= {This study explored undergraduate students' mental models
		  of the Web as an information retrieval system. Mental
		  models play an important role in people's interaction with
		  information systems. Better understanding of people's
		  mental models could inspire better interface design and
		  user instruction. Multiple data-collection methods,
		  including questionnaire, semistructured interview, drawing,
		  and participant observation, were used to elicit students'
		  mental models of the Web from different perspectives,
		  though only data from interviews and drawing descriptions
		  are reported in this article. Content analysis of the
		  transcripts showed that students had utilitarian rather
		  than structural mental models of the Web. The majority of
		  participants saw the Web as a huge information resource
		  where everything can be found rather than an infrastructure
		  consisting of hardware and computer applications. Students
		  had different mental models of how information is organized
		  on the Web, and the models varied in correctness and
		  complexity. Students' mental models of search on the Web
		  were illustrated from three points of view: avenues of
		  getting information, understanding of search engines'
		  working mechanisms, and search tactics. The research
		  results suggest that there are mainly three sources
		  contributing to the construction of mental models: personal
		  observation, communication with others, and class
		  instruction. In addition to structural and functional
		  aspects, mental models have an emotional dimension. © 2008

		  applied over the last two decades for mapping the
		  intellectual structure of a research field as represented
		  by its authors. However, what is mapped in ACA is actually
		  the structure of intellectual influences on a research
		  field as perceived by its active authors. In this
		  exploratory paper, by contrast, we introduce author
		  bibliographic-coupling analysis (ABCA) as a method to map
		  the research activities of active authors themselves for a
		  more realistic picture of the current state of research in
		  a field. We choose the information science (IS) field and
		  study its intellectual structure both in terms of current
		  research activities as seen from ABCA and in terms of
		  intellectual influences on its research as shown from ACA.
		  We examine how these two aspects of the intellectual
		  structure of the IS field are related, and how they both
		  developed during the “first decade of the Web,”
		  1996–2005. We find that these two citation-based
		  author-mapping methods complement each other, and that, in
		  combination, they provide a more comprehensive view of the
		  intellectual structure of the IS field than either of them
		  can provide on its own. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  cited than research published in journals classified in a
		  single subject. For each subject, the study divides the

		  (a) For social science subject categories in both the Web
		  of Science and Scopus, the average citation levels of
		  articles in Mono and Multi are very similar; and (b) for
		  Scopus subject categories within life sciences, health
		  sciences, and physical sciences, the average citation level
		  of Mono articles is roughly twice that of Multi articles.

		  PFNET(∞, n - 1) in just O(n2 · log n) time. The
		  underlying idea comes from the fact that the union

		  economicswere selected to assess whether there is a
		  citation advantage between journal articles that have an
		  open-access (OA) version on the Internet compared to those
		  articles that are exclusively toll access (TA). Citations
		  were counted using the Web of Science, and the OA status of
		  articles was determined by searching OAIster, OpenDOAR,
		  Google, and Google Scholar. Of a sample of 4,633 articles
		  examined, 2,280 (49%) were OA and had a mean citation count
		  of 9.04 whereas the mean for TA articles was 5.76. There
		  appears to be a clear citation advantage for those articles
		  that are OA as opposed to those that are TA. This
		  advantage, however, varies between disciplines, with
		  sociology having the highest citation advantage, but the
		  lowest number of OA articles, from the sample taken, and
		  ecology having the highest individual citation count for OA
		  articles, but the smallest citation advantage. Tests of
		  correlation or association between OA status and a number

		  little has been written about how these variables relate to

		  this question that the difficulty of closing the divide
		  ultimately depends. In this article, I have sought to
		  challenge the (implicit) prevailing assumption in most of
		  the digital-preparedness literature that variables can be
		  perfectly substituted for one another and, hence, added
		  together. In particular, and drawing on available evidence,
		  I view the relationship between, say computers and computer
		  skills, as being nearer the opposite extreme, of totally
		  limited substitutability. On this basis, I suggest that the
		  components of digital-preparedness indexes be multiplied
		  rather than added. Using multiplication rather than
		  addition in most current indexes of digital preparedness
		  reveals a substantial understatement of the real difficulty
		  in closing the digital divide and a different set of
		  policies to deal with this larger problem. Such policies
		  should include sharing arrangements and the use of

		  semantic information about biomedical concepts and topics,
		  and introduce a passage retrieval model for using these
		  semantics in context to improve genomics literature search.
		  Our contributions include a new passage retrieval model
		  based on an undirected graphical model (Markov Random
		  Fields), and new methods for modeling passage-concepts,
		  document-topics, and passage-terms as potential functions
		  within the model. Each potential function includes
		  distributional evidence to disambiguate topics, concepts,
		  and terms in context. The joint distribution across
		  potential functions in the graph represents the probability
		  of a passage being relevant to a biologist's information
		  need. Relevance ranking within each potential function
		  simplifies normalization across potential functions and
		  eliminates the need for tuning of passage retrieval model
		  parameters. Our dimensional indexing model facilitates
		  efficient aggregation of topic, concept, and term
		  distributions. The proposed passage-retrieval model
		  improves search results in the presence of varying levels
		  of semantic evidence, outperforming models of query terms,
		  concepts, or document topics alone. Our results exceed the
		  state-of-the-art for automatic document retrieval by 14.46%

		  between users'motivation for using (i.e., trying out and
		  continuing to use) a search engine and the engine's
		  functional features. Based on Herzberg's two-factor theory
		  (F. Herzberg, 2003; F. Herzberg, M. Bernard, &amp; B.
		  Snyderman, 1959), the features can be categorized as
		  hygiene factors and motivation factors. Hygiene factors
		  support the query process and provide a basic “task
		  context” for information seeking that allows users to
		  access relevant information. Motivation factors, on the
		  other hand, help users navigate (i.e., browse) and
		  comprehend the retrieved information, related to the
		  “task-content” aspect of information seeking. Given the
		  consistent findings that hygiene factors induce work
		  motivation for a shorter period of time, it is hypothesized
		  that hygiene factors are more effective in attracting
		  users; while motivation factors are more effective in
		  retaining than in attracting users. A survey, with 758
		  valid participants, was conducted to test the hypotheses.
		  The empirical results provide substantial support for the
		  proposed hypotheses and suggest that the two-factor theory
		  can account for the motivation for using a search engine.

		  (Trace, 2004) that looked at a particular aspect of human
		  information behavior: children's information creation in a

		  here, naturalism and ethnomethodology are used as
		  theoretical frameworks to investigate informal documents as
		  an information genre. Although previous studies have
		  considered the role of informal documents within the
		  classroom, little sustained attention has been paid to
		  pre-adolescents, particularly in terms of how they create
		  unofficial or vernacular literacies both to navigate their
		  growing awareness of the formal (albeit sometimes
		  “hidden”) curriculum and, on occasion, to subvert it,
		  positing an alternative economy that itself can be
		  “hidden” via surreptitious use of informal documents.
		  Making explicit the ties that exist between these objects
		  and the worlds in which they are embedded demonstrates that
		  informal documents hold a particular relevance for children
		  within this social context (Garfinkel &amp; Bittner, 1999).
		  Furthermore, this article demonstrates that an

		  creation brings a level of dignity and determination to an

		  appreciate the human ability to recontextualize or

		  epistemologists and information scientists to ask whether
		  people are likely to acquire knowledge as a result of
		  having access to this information source. In other words,
		  is Wikipedia having good epistemic consequences? After
		  surveying the various concerns that have been raised about
		  the reliability of Wikipedia, this article argues that the
		  epistemic consequences of people using Wikipedia as a
		  source of information are likely to be quite good.
		  According to several empirical studies, the reliability of
		  Wikipedia compares favorably to the reliability of
		  traditional encyclopedias. Furthermore, the reliability of
		  Wikipedia compares even more favorably to the reliability
		  of those information sources that people would be likely to
		  use if Wikipedia did not exist (viz., Web sites that are as
		  freely and easily accessible as Wikipedia). In addition,
		  Wikipedia has a number of other epistemic virtues (e.g.,
		  power, speed, and fecundity) that arguably outweigh any
		  deficiency in terms of reliability. Even so,
		  epistemologists and information scientists should certainly
		  be trying to identify changes (or alternatives) to
		  Wikipedia that will bring about even better epistemic
		  consequences. This article suggests that to improve
		  Wikipedia, we need to clarify what our epistemic values are
		  and to better understand why Wikipedia works as well as it
		  does.Somebody who reads Wikipedia is “rather in the
		  position of a visitor to a public restroom,” says Mr.
		  McHenry, Britannica's former editor. “It may be obviously
		  dirty, so that he knows to exercise great care, or it may
		  seem fairly clean, so that he may be lulled into a false
		  sense of security. What he certainly does not know is who
		  has used the facilities before him.” One wonders whether
		  people like Mr. McHenry would prefer there to be no public
		  lavatories at all.The Economist (Vol. 379, April 22, 2006,

		  groups have a larger size-dependent cumulative advantage
		  for receiving citations than do top-performance groups.
		  Furthermore, regardless of performance, larger groups have
		  less not-cited publications. Particularly for the lower
		  performance groups, the fraction of not-cited publications
		  decreases considerably with size. These phenomena can be
		  explained with a model in which self-citation acts as a
		  promotion mechanism for external citations. In this
		  article, we show that for self-citations, similar
		  size-dependent scaling rules apply as for citations, but
		  generally the power law exponents are higher for
		  self-citations as compared to citations. We also find that
		  the fraction of self-citations is smaller for the higher
		  performance groups, and this fraction decreases more
		  rapidly with increasing journal impact than that for lower
		  performance groups. An interesting novel finding is that
		  the variance in the correlation of the number of
		  self-citations with size is considerably less than the
		  variance for external citations. This is a clear indication
		  that size is a stronger determinant for self-citations than
		  it is for external citations. Both higher and particularly
		  lower performance groups have a size-dependent cumulative
		  advantage for self-citations, but for the higher
		  performance groups only in the lower impact journals and in

  abstract	= {Research evaluation is increasingly popular and important
		  among research funding bodies and science policy makers.
		  Various indicators have been proposed to evaluate the
		  standing of individual scientists, institutions, journals,
		  or countries. A simple and popular one among the indicators
		  is the h-index, the Hirsch index (Hirsch 2005), which is an
		  indicator for lifetime achievement of a scholar. Several
		  other indicators have been proposed to complement or
		  balance the h-index. However, these indicators have no
		  conception of aging. The AR-index (Jin et al. 2007)
		  incorporates aging but divides the received citation counts
		  by the raw age of the publication. Consequently, the decay
		  of a publication is very steep and insensitive to
		  disciplinary differences. In addition, we believe that a
		  publication becomes outdated only when it is no longer
		  cited, not because of its age. Finally, all indicators
		  treat citations as equally material when one might
		  reasonably think that a citation from a heavily cited
		  publication should weigh more than a citation froma
		  non-cited or little-cited publication.We propose a new
		  indicator, the Discounted Cumulated Impact (DCI) index,
		  which devalues old citations in a smooth way. It rewards an
		  author for receiving new citations even if the publication
		  is old. Further, it allows weighting of the citations by
		  the citation weight of the citing publication. DCI can be
		  used to calculate research performance on the basis of the
		  h-core of a scholar or any other publication data set.
		  Finally, it supports comparing research performance to the
		  average performance in the domain and across domains as
		  well. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  overthrew Google as the most visited Web site for U.S. Web
		  users. If this heralds a new era of widespread online
		  social networking, then it is important to investigate user
		  behaviour and attributes. Although there has been some
		  research into social networking already, basic demographic
		  data is essential to set previous results in a wider

		  developers. In this article, the demographics of MySpace
		  members are explored through data extracted from two

		  declared age of users was surprisingly high at 21, with a
		  small majority of females. The analysis confirmed some

		  networking, for example, that female members tend to be

		  that both stock and growth of the stock are important

		  There is a basic difference, however, in the effect of
		  books on the demand for other media as compared with the

		  Building upon prior research, this study aims at a better

		  acceptance factors. Two affect variables that are different
		  in nature were examined: computer playfulness (CP) and

		  literature review reveals a conceptual framework for
		  institutional repository (IR) evaluation with four
		  categories and 19 items. In developing the initial
		  framework, equal amounts of emphasis are put on the
		  assessments of procedural achievement and actual
		  performance to pinpoint the procedural weaknesses of each
		  IR and to determine its customized solution. A Delphi
		  method of three rounds with the help of IR librarians
		  reveals a converging tendency pertaining to the measures of
		  importance ascribed to the categories and items. Through a
		  focus-group interview with middle- to top-level managers,
		  39 indicators derived from 19 items are identified as
		  possessing relevancy, measurability, data availability, and
		  differentiability. Validation of evaluation indicators
		  employs actual evaluation data from 32 university IRs.
		  Factor analysis shows a simpler structural pattern

		  of the conceptual framework that contains 19 items.

		  Rate. The results from regression analyses suggest that two

		  Rate factor. In the content-oriented approach, the
		  Registration Rate factor is crucial while in the
		  policy-oriented approach the Archiving factor assumes this
		  role; however, the System Performance factor plays a
		  mediating role for the key factors, thus forming a

		  article, we report a study that investigates the gap
		  between intention and usage by observing an Internet-based
		  knowledge management system, SCTNet, from the perspective
		  of volitional control. Relying on the theory of planned
		  behavior and the theory of action control, we investigate
		  four types of volitional control mechanisms that may impact
		  people's knowledge-sharing practices. Our results show that
		  in knowledge-management-based knowledge sharing, people do
		  not always perform in a manner consistent with their
		  espoused beliefs. This intention–action inconsistency can
		  be explained by perceived self-efficacy, but not by
		  intention and controllability. In addition, a person's
		  action-state orientation moderates his or her enactment of
		  intention toward knowledge sharing into behaviors. The main
		  theoretical implication of this study is that the study of
		  knowledge-management-based knowledge sharing has to go
		  beyond intention to include the investigation of both the
		  actual behaviors of knowledge sharing and the volitional
		  control constructs that predict these behaviors.
		  Furthermore, previous research has shown that the
		  environment interacts reciprocally with individuals'
		  psychological control mechanisms in regulating their
		  behaviors. Thus, the management must focus on the social
		  and cultural attributes of organizational settings that may
		  strengthen people's volitional control in practicing

  abstract	= {This article introduces a normative principle for the
		  behavior of contemporary computing and communication
		  systems and considers some of its consequences. The
		  principle, named the principle of distribution, says that
		  in a distributed multi-agent system, control resides as
		  much as possible with the individuals constituting the
		  system rather than in centralized agents; and when that is
		  unfeasible or becomes inappropriate due to environmental
		  changes, control evolves upwards from the individuals to an
		  appropriate intermediate level rather than being imposed
		  from above. The setting for the work is the dynamically
		  changing global space resulting from ubiquitous
		  communication. Accordingly, the article begins by
		  determining the characteristics of the distributed
		  multi-agent space it spans. It then fleshes out the
		  principle of distribution, with examples from daily life as
		  well as from Computer Science. The case is made for the
		  principle of distribution to work at various levels of
		  abstraction of system behavior: to inform the high-level
		  discussion that ought to precede the more low-level
		  concerns of technology, protocols, and standardization, but
		  also to facilitate those lower levels. Of the more
		  substantial applications given here of the principle of
		  distribution, a technical example concerns the design of
		  secure ad hoc networks of mobile devices, achievable
		  without any form of centralized authentication or
		  identification but in a solely distributed manner. Here,
		  the context is how the principle can be used to provide new
		  and provably secure protocols for genuinely ubiquitous
		  communication. A second, more managerial example concerns
		  the distributed production and management of open-source
		  software, and a third investigates some pertinent questions
		  involving the dynamic restructuring of control in
		  distributed systems, important in times of disaster or
		  malevolence. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  issues. Three core principles of justice are furthermore

		  descriptor in order to improve the effectiveness of Web

		  identification of what document categories should be used
		  as genres. As genre is a kind of folk typology, document
		  categories must enjoy widespread recognition by their
		  intended user groups in order to qualify as genres. Three
		  user studies were conducted to develop a genre palette and
		  show that it is recognizable to users. (Palette is a term
		  used to denote a classification, attributable to Karlgren,
		  Bretan, Dewe, Hallberg, and Wolkert, 1998.) To simplify the
		  users' classification task, it was decided to focus on Web
		  pages from the edu domain. The first study was a survey of
		  user terminology for Web pages. Three participants
		  separated 100 Web page printouts into stacks according to
		  genre, assigning names and definitions to each genre. The
		  second study aimed to refine the resulting set of 48 (often
		  conceptually and lexically similar) genre names and
		  definitions into a smaller palette of user-preferred
		  terminology. Ten participants classified the same 100 Web
		  pages. A set of five principles for creating a genre
		  palette from individuals' sortings was developed, and the
		  list of 48 was trimmed to 18 genres. The third study aimed
		  to show that users would agree on the genres of Web pages
		  when choosing from the genre palette. In an online
		  experiment in which 257 participants categorized a new set
		  of 55 pages using the 18 genres, on average, over 70%
		  agreed on the genre of each page. Suggestions for improving
		  the genre palette and future directions for the work are

		  developed in the last decades. Related research in
		  information science has shown that human abstractors
		  extract sentences for summaries based on the hierarchical
		  structure of documents; however, the existing automatic
		  summarization models do not take into account the human
		  abstractor's behavior of sentence extraction and only
		  consider the document as a sequence of sentences during the
		  process of extraction of sentences as a summary. In
		  general, a document exhibits a well-defined hierarchical
		  structure that can be described as fractals—mathematical
		  objects with a high degree of redundancy. In this article,
		  we introduce the fractal summarization model based on the
		  fractal theory. The important information is captured from
		  the source document by exploring the hierarchical structure
		  and salient features of the document. A condensed version
		  of the document that is informatively close to the source
		  document is produced iteratively using the contractive
		  transformation in the fractal theory. The fractal
		  summarization model is the first attempt to apply fractal
		  theory to document summarization. It significantly improves
		  the divergence of information coverage of summary and the
		  precision of summary. User evaluations have been conducted.
		  Results have indicated that fractal summarization is
		  promising and outperforms current summarization techniques

  abstract	= {A dialogue-based interface for information systems is
		  considered a potentially very useful approach to
		  information access. A key step in computer processing of
		  natural-language dialogues is dialogue-act (DA)
		  recognition. In this paper, we apply a feature-based
		  classification approach for DA recognition, by using the
		  maximum entropy (ME) method to build a classifier for
		  labeling utterances with DA tags. The ME method has the
		  advantage that a large number of heterogeneous features can
		  be flexibly combined in one classifier, which can
		  facilitate feature selection. A unique characteristic of
		  our approach is that it does not need to model the prior
		  probability of DAs directly, and thus avoids the use of a
		  discourse grammar. This simplifies the implementation of
		  the classifier and improves the efficiency of DA
		  recognition, without sacrificing the classification
		  accuracy. We evaluate the classifier using a large data set
		  based on the Switchboard corpus. Encouraging performance is
		  observed; the highest classification accuracy achieved is
		  75.03%. We also propose a heuristic to address the problem
		  of sparseness of the data set. This problem has resulted in
		  poor classification accuracies of some DA types that have
		  very low occurrence frequencies in the data set.
		  Preliminary evaluation shows that the method is effective
		  in improving the macroaverage classification accuracy of
		  the ME classifier. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  knowledge in order to improve organizational performance
		  and increase competitive capacity. However, serious

		  the increased scope of description processes, is revealed.
		  Decision variation and decision considerations are

		  individuals participated in a field experiment during seven
		  bioinformatics workshops. Pre- and post-intervention tests

		  design and microarray analysis—a simple versus a complex

		  both significant predictors of intended use of
		  bioinformatics tools. After hands-on experience, intention
		  to use both tools decreased. The perceived ease of use of

		  strings for checking authenticity and the degree of

		  conjectured to be a prevalent property of the science
		  system. The lower performance universities have a larger
		  size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations
		  than top performance universities. For the lower
		  performance universities, the fraction of noncited
		  publications decreases considerably with size. Generally,
		  the higher the average journal impact of the publications

		  publications. The average research performance was found
		  not to dilute with size. Evidently, large universities,
		  particularly top performance universities are characterized
		  by being “big and beautiful.” They succeed in keeping a
		  high performance over a broad range of activities. This

		  many despite criticism that it is unreliable and
		  inaccurate. A number of recommendations have been made to
		  sort the chaff from the wheat in Wikipedia, among which is
		  the idea of color-coding article segment edits according to
		  age (Cross, 2006). Using data collected as part of a wider
		  study published in Nature, this article examines the

		  Surprisingly, we find that roughly 20% of errors can be

		  confirmed the existence of a first-mover effect (Viegas,
		  Wattenberg, &amp; Kushal, 2004) whereby material added by
		  early edits are less likely to be removed. We suggest that
		  the sizable number of errors added by early edits is simply
		  a result of more material being added near the beginning of
		  the life of the article. Overall, the results do not
		  provide support for the idea of trusting surviving segments

  abstract	= {In “A Brief History of Information Ethics,” Thomas
		  Froehlich (2004) quickly surveyed under several broad
		  categories some of the many issues that constitute
		  information ethics: under the category of
		  librarianship—censorship, privacy, access, balance in
		  collections, copyright, fair use, and codes of ethics;
		  under information science, which Froehlich sees as closely
		  related to librarianship—confidentiality, bias, and
		  quality of information; under computer
		  ethics—intellectual property, privacy, fair
		  representation, nonmaleficence, computer crime, software
		  reliability, artificial intelligence, and e-commerce; under
		  cyberethics (issues related to the Internet, or
		  “cyberspace”)—expert systems, artificial intelligence
		  (again), and robotics; under media ethics—news,
		  impartiality, journalistic ethics, deceit, lies, sexuality,
		  censorship (again), and violence in the press; and under
		  intercultural information ethics—digital divide, and the
		  ethical role of the Internet for social, political,
		  cultural, and economic development. Many of the debates in
		  information ethics, on these and other issues, have to do
		  with specific kinds of relationships between subjects. The
		  most important subject and a familiar figure in information
		  ethics is the ethical subject engaged in moral
		  deliberation, whether appearing as the bearer of moral
		  rights and obligations to other subjects, or as an agent
		  whose actions are judged, whether by others or by oneself,
		  according to the standards of various moral codes and
		  ethical principles. Many debates in information ethics
		  revolve around conflicts between those acting according to
		  principles of unfettered access to information and those
		  finding some information offensive or harmful. Subjectivity
		  is at the heart of information ethics. But how is
		  subjectivity understood? Can it be understood in ways that
		  broaden ethical reflection to include problems that remain
		  invisible when subjectivity is taken for granted and when
		  how it is created remains unquestioned? This article
		  proposes some answers by investigating the meaning and role
		  of subjectivity in information ethics. (In an article on
		  cyberethics (2000), I asserted that there was no
		  information ethics in any special sense beyond the
		  application of general ethical principles to information
		  services. Here, I take a more expansive view.)This article
		  originated as a presentation given on September 16, 2005,
		  to the Nordic Research School in Library and Information
		  Science Workshop “Structures of Power: Information,
		  Knowledge, and Property,” held at the Department of
		  Archival Science, Library and Information Science,

		  dynamic environment, by splitting two chronologically
		  ordered datasets into time-ordered segments and assessing
		  how the technique performs under two different scenarios.
		  The first is when new documents are added incrementally
		  without reclustering [incremental CDC (iCDC)], and the
		  second is when reclustering is performed [nonincremental
		  CDC (nCDC)]. The datasets are very large, are independent

		  show that CDC itself is effective at clustering very large

		  to a very simple, efficient incremental document addition
		  process that is seen to be very stable over time despite
		  the size of the corpus growing considerably. It was seen to
		  be effective at incrementally clustering new documents even
		  when the corpus grew to six times its original size. This
		  is in contrast to what other researchers have found when
		  applying similar simple incremental approaches to document
		  clustering. The stability of iCDC is accounted for by the

		  which an individual stores personal information items to

		  user-subjective approach, a theoretical approach proposing
		  design principles with which PIM systems can systematically
		  use subjective attributes of information items. In this
		  consecutive article, we report on a study that tested the
		  approach by exploring the use of subjective attributes
		  (i.e., project, importance, and context) in current PIM
		  systems, and its dependence on design characteristics.
		  Participants were 84 personal computer users. Tools

		  that participants tended to use subjective attributes when

		  discouraged such use, they either found their own
		  alternative ways to use them or refrained from using them
		  altogether. This constitutes evidence in support of the

		  systems do not allow for sufficient use of subjective
		  attributes. The article also introduces seven novel system

		  considers conventional customer lead-time (from when the
		  customer places an order) in addition to five other
		  customer indices. This is the first study to consider the

		  models and produces several dimensions of customer
		  satisfaction. Finally, the integrated approach allows the

		  addition, by integrated modeling of this study the hidden

  abstract	= {The information science research community is
		  characterized by a paradigm split, with a system-centered
		  cluster working on information retrieval (IR) algorithms
		  and a user-centered cluster working on user behavior. The
		  two clusters rarely leverage each other's insight and
		  strength. One major suggestion from user-centered studies
		  is to treat the relevance judgment of documents as a
		  subjective, multidimensional, and dynamic concept rather
		  than treating it as objective and based on topicality only.
		  This study explores the possibility to enhance users'
		  topicality-based relevance judgment with subjective novelty
		  judgment in interactive IR. A set of systems is developed
		  which differs in the way the novelty judgment is
		  incorporated. In particular, this study compares systems
		  which assume that users' novelty judgment is directed to a
		  certain subtopic area and those which assume that users'
		  novelty judgment is undirected. This study also compares
		  systems which assume that users judge a document based on
		  topicality first and then novelty in a stepwise,
		  noncompensatory fashion and those which assume that users
		  consider topicality and novelty simultaneously and as
		  compensatory to each other. The user study shows that

		  e-learning systems. Envisioning intelligent e-learning
		  systems, this article addresses the challenge of
		  information seeking in lecture videos by retrieving
		  relevant video segments based on user queries, through
		  dynamic segmentation of lecture speech text. In the
		  proposed approach, shallow parsing such as part of-speech
		  tagging and noun phrase chunking are used to parse both
		  questions and Automated Speech Recognition (ASR)
		  transcripts. A sliding-window algorithm is proposed to
		  identify the start and ending boundaries of returned
		  segments. Phonetic and partial matching is utilized to
		  correct the errors from automated speech recognition and
		  noun phrase chunking. Furthermore, extra knowledge such as
		  lecture slides is used to facilitate the ASR transcript
		  error correction. The approach also makes use of proximity
		  to approximate the deep parsing and structure match between
		  question and sentences in ASR transcripts. The experimental
		  results showed that both phonetic and partial matching
		  improved the segmentation performance, slides-based ASR
		  transcript correction improves information coverage, and

  abstract	= {Stressing that some universities have adopted unrealistic
		  requirements for tenure of information systems (IS) faculty
		  members, a recent editorial in MIS Quarterly contends that
		  the group of premier IS journals needs to be generally
		  recognized as having more than just two members. This
		  article introduces the publication power approach to
		  identifying the premier IS journals, and it does indeed
		  find that there are more than two. A journal's publication
		  power is calculated from the actual publishing behaviors of
		  full-time, tenured IS faculty members at a sizable set of
		  leading research universities. The underlying premise is
		  that these researchers produce excellent work, collectively
		  spanning the IS field's subject matter, and that the
		  greatest concentrations of their collective work appear in
		  highest visibility, most important journals suitable for
		  its subject matter. The new empirically based approach to
		  identifying premier IS journals (and, more broadly,
		  identifying journals that figure most prominently in
		  publishing activity of tenured IS researchers) offers an
		  attractive alternative to promulgations by individuals or
		  cliques (possibly based on outdated tradition or vested
		  interests), to opinion surveys (subjective, possibly
		  ill-informed, vague about rating criteria, and/or biased in
		  various ways), and to citation analyses (which ignore
		  semantics of references and, in the case of ISI impact
		  factors, have additional problems that cast considerable
		  doubt on their meaningfulness within the IS field and its
		  subdisciplines). Results of the publication power approach
		  can be applied and supplemented according to needs of a
		  particular university in setting its evaluation standards
		  for IS tenure, promotion, and merit decisions. © 2008

		  Factor can be derived from usage data; however, so far,
		  usage can practically be recorded only at the level of
		  distinct information services. This leads to
		  community-specific assessments of scholarly impact that are
		  difficult to generalize to the global scholarly community.
		  In contrast, the ISI Impact Factor is based on citation
		  data and thereby represents the global community of
		  scholarly authors. The objective of this study is to
		  examine the effects of community characteristics on
		  assessments of scholarly impact from usage. We define a
		  journal Usage Impact Factor that mimics the definition of
		  the Thomson Scientific ISI Impact Factor. Usage Impact
		  Factor rankings are calculated on the basis of a
		  large-scale usage dataset recorded by the linking servers
		  of the California State University system from 2003 to
		  2005. The resulting journal rankings are then compared to

		  that the particular scientific and demographic

  abstract	= {We propose an approach to content-based Distributed
		  Information Retrieval based on the periodic and incremental
		  centralization of full-content indices of widely dispersed
		  and autonomously managed document sources. Inspired by the
		  success of the Open Archive Initiative's (OAI) Protocol for
		  metadata harvesting, the approach occupies middle ground
		  between content crawling and distributed retrieval. As in
		  crawling, some data move toward the retrieval process, but
		  it is statistics about the content rather than content
		  itself; this grants more efficient use of network resources
		  and wider scope of application. As in distributed
		  retrieval, some processing is distributed along with the
		  data, but it is indexing rather than retrieval; this
		  reduces the costs of content provision while promoting the
		  simplicity, effectiveness, and responsiveness of retrieval.
		  Overall, we argue that the approach retains the good
		  properties of centralized retrieval without renouncing to
		  cost-effective, large-scale resource pooling. We discuss
		  the requirements associated with the approach and identify
		  two strategies to deploy it on top of the OAI
		  infrastructure. In particular, we define a minimal
		  extension of the OAI protocol which supports the
		  coordinated harvesting of full-content indices and
		  descriptive metadata for content resources. Finally, we

  abstract	= {Previous research assessing the effectiveness of
		  structured abstracts has been limited in two respects.
		  First, when comparing structured abstracts with traditional
		  ones, investigators usually have rewritten the original
		  abstracts, and thus confounded changes in the layout with
		  changes in both the wording and the content of the text.
		  Second, investigators have not always included the title of
		  the article together with the abstract when asking
		  participants to judge the quality of the abstracts, yet
		  titles alert readers to the meaning of the materials that
		  follow. The aim of this research was to redress these
		  limitations. Three studies were carried out. Four versions
		  of each of four abstracts were prepared. These versions
		  consisted of structured/traditional abstracts matched in
		  content, with and without titles. In Study 1, 64
		  undergraduates each rated one of these abstracts on six
		  separate rating scales. In Study 2, 225 academics and
		  research workers rated the abstracts electronically, and in
		  Study 3, 252 information scientists did likewise. In
		  Studies 1 and 3, the respondents rated the structured
		  abstracts significantly more favorably than they did the
		  traditional ones, but the presence or absence of titles had
		  no effect on their judgments. In Study 2, no main effects
		  were observed for structure or for titles. The layout of
		  the text, together with the subheadings, contributed to the
		  higher ratings of effectiveness for structured abstracts,
		  but the presence or absence of titles had no clear effects
		  in these experimental studies. It is likely that this
		  spatial organization, together with the greater amount of
		  information normally provided in structured abstracts,
		  explains why structured abstracts are generally judged to
		  be superior to traditional ones. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

		  update of a similar review that appeared in 1975 under the
		  same title, considered here as being Part I. The present
		  review is organized in two parts: Part II addresses the
		  questions related to nature and manifestations of
		  relevance, and Part III addresses questions related to
		  relevance behavior and effects. In Part II, the nature of
		  relevance is discussed in terms of meaning ascribed to
		  relevance, theories used or proposed, and models that have
		  been developed. The manifestations of relevance are
		  classified as to several kinds of relevance that form an
		  interdependent system of relevancies. In Part III,
		  relevance behavior and effects are synthesized using
		  experimental and observational works that incorporated
		  data. In both parts, each section concludes with a summary
		  that in effect provides an interpretation and synthesis of
		  contemporary thinking on the topic treated or suggests
		  hypotheses for future research. Analyses of some of the
		  major trends that shape relevance work are offered in
		  conclusions. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  domain knowledge plays in users' interactions with
		  information systems. Two groups of users with two different
		  areas of expertise were recruited for 34 experimental
		  sessions to answer two research questions: (a) Does one
		  group's domain knowledge (Geography majors) affect their
		  performance on an information system more than another
		  group's domain knowledge (Computer Science majors)? (b) Are
		  there any differences and/or similarities in the
		  performance of the two groups in terms of the information
		  problem-solving processes? Task completion time, task
		  completeness, and mouse movements were collected while
		  users performed six tasks during the experimental sessions.
		  Data were analyzed through repeated measures. An ANOVA was
		  used for task completion time and task completeness. GOMS
		  (Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection rules) was also
		  used for mouse movements to identify some of the
		  similarities and differences between the two groups'
		  information problem-solving processes. The GOMS analysis
		  found the two groups' processing activities to be
		  remarkably similar. The ANOVA results indicate that
		  expertise type was not a major factor influencing user
		  performance, but task and task combined with the type of
		  expertise played a significant role in the users'
		  interactions with the interface. External operators, goal
		  decompositions, and methods related to the problem solving

		  a concrete example from the High Accuracy Retrieval from

		  (TREC), the author suggests that the “bag of words”
		  approach to information retrieval (IR) and techniques such
		  as relevance feedback have significant limitations in
		  expressing and resolving complex user information needs. He
		  argues that a comprehensive analysis of information needs
		  involves explicating often-implicit assumptions made by the
		  authors of scholarly documents, as well as everyday texts
		  such as news articles. He also argues that progress in IS
		  can be furthered by developing general theories that are
		  applicable to multiple domains. The concrete example of
		  application of the domain-analytic approach to subject
		  analysis in IS to the aesthetic evaluation of works of
		  information arts is used to support this argument. © 2007

		  statistics used for the evaluation of scientists' work. A
		  number of approximate string matching techniques have been
		  developed to validate variant forms, based on similarity

		  either a history or psychology course essay when they were
		  in an early, exploration stage of researching their essay.
		  This group is presently at a disadvantage when using
		  thesaurus-type schemes in indexes and online search engines
		  because there is a disconnect between how domain novice
		  users of IR systems represent a topic space and how this
		  space is represented in the standard IR system thesaurus.
		  The study attempted to (a) ascertain the coding language
		  used by the 80 undergraduates in the study to mentally
		  represent their topic and then (b) align the mental models
		  with the hierarchical structure found in many thesauri. The
		  intervention focused the undergraduates' thinking about
		  their topic from a topic statement to a thesis statement.
		  The undergraduates were asked to produce three mental model
		  diagrams for their real-life course essay at the beginning,
		  middle, and end of the interview, for a total of 240 mental
		  model diagrams, from which we created a 12-category mental
		  model classification scheme. Findings indicate that at the
		  end of the intervention, (a) the percentage of vertical
		  mental models increased from 24 to 35% of all mental
		  models; but that (b) 3rd-year students had fewer vertical
		  mental models than did 1st-year undergraduates in the
		  study, which is counterintuitive. The results indicate that
		  there is justification for pursuing our research based on
		  the hypothesis that rotating a domain novice's mental model
		  into a vertical position would make it easier for him or
		  her to cognitively connect with the thesaurus's
		  hierarchical representation of the topic area. © 2007

		  of other fields but with their own unique foci and
		  concerns. That is, core components from other fundamental
		  fields interact and integrate with each other to form
		  dynamic and interesting information related fields that all
		  have to do with information, technology, people, and
		  organization/society. The conceptual framework can have a
		  number of uses. Besides providing a unified view of these

		  However, little research has been focused on

		  retrieval target pages and ordinary ones based on more than
		  30 million Web pages obtained from both the Text Retrieval
		  Conference (TREC) and a widely used Chinese search engine,

		  the task of making personalized recommendations to assist
		  the user's navigation has become increasingly important.
		  Considering there might be millions of users with different
		  backgrounds accessing a Web site everyday, it is infeasible
		  to build a separate recommendation system for each user. To
		  address this problem, clustering techniques can first be
		  employed to discover user groups. Then, user navigation
		  patterns for each group can be discovered, to allow the
		  adaptation of a Web site to the interest of each individual

		  capture the sequential relationships inherent in user

		  constructing the Markov models are also addressed. The

		  models. To improve the efficiency of building/maintaining
		  the mixture of Markov models, we develop a lightweight

		  documents. As Chinese is an ideographic character-based
		  language, the words in the texts are not delimited by white
		  spaces. Indexing of Chinese documents is impossible without
		  a proper segmentation algorithm. Many Chinese segmentation
		  algorithms have been proposed in the past. Traditional
		  segmentation algorithms cannot operate without a large

		  the Web has become the largest corpus that is ideal for
		  Chinese segmentation. Although most search engines have
		  problems in segmenting texts into proper words, they
		  maintain huge databases of documents and frequencies of
		  character sequences in the documents. Their databases are
		  important potential resources for segmentation. In this
		  paper, we propose a segmentation algorithm by mining Web

		  the Romanized pinyin of Chinese language indicates
		  boundaries of words in the text. Our algorithm is the first
		  to utilize the Romanized pinyin to segmentation. It is the
		  first unified segmentation algorithm for the Chinese
		  language from different geographical areas, and it is also
		  domain independent because of the nature of the Web.
		  Experiments have been conducted on the datasets of a recent

		  The model was stimulated by our finding that a majority of
		  scientific citations are copied from the lists of
		  references used in other papers. It accounted
		  quantitatively for several properties of empirically
		  observed distribution of citations; however, important
		  features such as power-law distributions of citations to
		  papers published during the same year and the fact that the
		  average rate of citing decreases with aging of a paper were
		  not accounted for by that model. Here, we propose a
		  modified model: When a scientist writes a manuscript, he
		  picks up several random recent papers, cites them, and also
		  copies some of their references. The difference with the
		  original model is the word recent. We solve the model using
		  methods of the theory of branching processes, and find that

		  distribution, which our original model could not account
		  for. The model also can explain “sleeping beauties in
		  science;” that is, papers that are little cited for a

		  Therefore, it is important to design searching and browsing
		  tools that support them. However, many interfaces for
		  children do not consider their skills and preferences.
		  Children are capable of creating Boolean queries using
		  category browsers, but have difficulty with the hierarchies
		  used in many category-browsing interfaces because different
		  branches of the hierarchy must be navigated sequentially
		  and top-level categories are often too abstract for them to

		  might better support children. However, this design

		  evaluate these tradeoffs, the authors conducted two studies
		  with children searching and browsing using two types of

		  as a formal means of evaluation in informetric studies such
		  as cocitation analysis. In this first part, the motivation
		  behind introducing matrix comparison to informetric
		  studies, as well as two important issues influencing such
		  comparisons, are introduced and discussed. The motivation
		  is spurred by the recent debate on choice of proximity
		  measures and their potential influence upon clustering and
		  ordination results. The two important issues discussed here
		  are matrix generation and the composition of proximity
		  measures. The approach to matrix generation is demonstrated
		  for the same data set, i.e., how data is represented and
		  transformed in a matrix, evidently determines the behavior
		  of proximity measures. Two different matrix generation
		  approaches, in all probability, will lead to different
		  proximity rankings of objects, which further lead to
		  different ordination and clustering results for the same
		  set of objects. Further, a resemblance in the composition
		  of formulas indicates whether two proximity measures may
		  produce similar ordination and clustering results. However,
		  as shown in the case of the angular correlation and cosine
		  measures, a small deviation in otherwise similar formulas
		  can lead to different rankings depending on the contour of
		  the data matrix transformed. Eventually, the behavior of
		  proximity measures, that is whether they produce similar
		  rankings of objects, is more or less data-specific.
		  Consequently, the authors recommend the use of empirical
		  matrix comparison techniques for individual studies to
		  investigate the degree of resemblance between proximity
		  measures or their ordination results. In part two of the
		  article, the authors introduce and demonstrate two related
		  statistical matrix comparison techniques the Mantel test
		  and Procrustes analysis, respectively. These techniques can
		  compare and evaluate the degree of monotonicity between
		  different proximity measures or their ordination results.
		  As such, the Mantel test and Procrustes analysis can be
		  used as statistical validation tools in informetric studies
		  and thus help choosing suitable proximity measures. © 2007

		  techniques is the application of permutation procedures to
		  test hypotheses about matrix resemblances. The choice of
		  technique is related to the validation at hand. In the case
		  of the Mantel test, the degree of resemblance between two
		  measures forecast their potentially different affect upon
		  ordination and clustering results. In principle, two
		  proximity measures with a very strong resemblance most
		  likely produce identical results, thus, choice of measure
		  between the two becomes less important. Alternatively, or
		  as a supplement, Procrustes analysis compares the actual
		  ordination results without investigating the underlying
		  proximity measures, by matching two configurations of the
		  same objects in a multidimensional space. An advantage of
		  the Procrustes analysis though, is the graphical solution
		  provided by the superimposition plot and the resulting
		  decomposition of variance components. Accordingly, the
		  Procrustes analysis provides not only a measure of general

		  objects enabling more elaborate validations. As such, the

		  and 2002 at the Florida State University School of
		  Information Studies. The researchers developed a facet
		  analysis system that meets S. R. Ranganathan's (1967)
		  requirements for articulation on three planes (idea,
		  verbal, and notational). This system includes a codebook
		  (verbal), coding procedures, and formulae (notational) for
		  quantitative analysis of logs of chat sessions and postings
		  to discussion boards for eight master's level courses
		  taught online during the fall 2000 semester. Focus group
		  interviews were subsequently held with student participants
		  to confirm that results of the facet analysis reflected
		  their experiences with the courses. The system was
		  developed through a process of emergent coding. The
		  researchers have been unable to identify any prior use of
		  facet analysis for the analysis of research data as in this
		  study. Identifying the facet analysis system was a major

		  Citation Index (SCI; Thomson Scientific Philadelphia, PA)
		  against four validity criteria including a free, immediate,
		  full and constant access policy for at least 5 years. Few
		  journals are found to be wrongly identified as OAJ or to

		  meet three of the criteria as they provide free and

		  are found to follow a constant policy, a large number has
		  an OA lifetime shorter than 5 years, due to the high
		  frequency of newly launched or newly converted journals.
		  That is the major factor affecting the validity of the

  abstract	= {In contemporary query languages, the user is responsible
		  for navigation among semantically related data. Because of
		  the huge amount of data and the complex structural
		  relationships among data in modern applications, it is
		  unrealistic to suppose that the user could know completely
		  the content and structure of the available information.
		  There are several query languages whose purpose is to
		  facilitate navigation in unknown structures of databases.
		  However, the background assumption of these languages is
		  that the user knows how data are related to each other
		  semantically in the structure at hand. So far only little
		  attention has been paid to how unknown semantic
		  associations among available data can be discovered. We
		  address this problem in this article. A semantic
		  association between two entities can be constructed if a
		  sequence of relationships expressed explicitly in a
		  database can be found that connects these entities to each
		  other. This sequence may contain several other entities
		  through which the original entities are connected to each
		  other indirectly. We introduce an expressive and
		  declarative query language for discovering semantic
		  associations. Our query language is able, for example, to
		  discover semantic associations between entities for which
		  only some of the characteristics are known. Further, it
		  integrates the manipulation of semantic associations with
		  the manipulation of documents that may contain information
		  on entities in semantic associations. © 2007 Wiley

		  capable of ignoring the animation when performing online
		  tasks. Research on non-banner-ads animation (e.g.,
		  animation applied to the main content of an e-commerce Web
		  site), however, is relatively scarce with inconclusive
		  results. We propose that the effects of non-banner-ads
		  animation are moderated by task type and the Web user's
		  experience with the animation. Drawing upon divided
		  attention theories, especially the central capacity theory,
		  this research investigates the effects of non-banner-ads
		  animation on Web users' clicking behavior, task
		  performance, and perceptions through an online shopping
		  experiment. The results show that non-banner-ads animation
		  does attract Web users' attention, with the animated item
		  more likely to be clicked first and also more likely to be
		  purchased when users are performing browsing tasks.
		  Meanwhile, Web users' task performance and perceptions are
		  negatively affected in the presence of animation. Moreover,
		  the negative effects of animation on task performance are
		  greater in browsing tasks than in searching tasks. Finally,
		  experience can help Web users to reduce the distraction
		  from animation and is more effective when users are engaged

		  the inner product similarity measure is used. The upper
		  bound on the learning complexity for searching for
		  documents represented by a monotone linear classifier
		  $left( {overrightarrow q ,0} right)$ over {0,…, n - 1}d
		  can be improved to, at most, 1 + 2k (n - 1) (log d - log(n
		  - 1)), where k is the number of nonzero components in q.
		  Several lower bounds on the learning complexity are also
		  obtained for Rocchio's algorithm. For example, the authors
		  prove that Rocchio's algorithm has a lower bound $Omega
		  left( {left( {_2^d } right){rm{log}},n} right)$ on its
		  learning complexity over the Boolean vector space {0, 1}d.

  abstract	= {The rapid growth of the numbers of images and their users
		  as a result of the reduction in cost and increase in
		  efficiency of the creation, storage, manipulation, and
		  transmission of images poses challenges to those who
		  organize and provide access to images. One of these
		  challenges is similarity matching, a key component of
		  current content-based image retrieval systems. Similarity
		  matching often is implemented through similarity measures
		  based on geometric models of similarity whose metric axioms
		  are not satisfied by human similarity judgment data. This
		  study is significant in that it is among the first known to
		  test Tversky's contrast model, which equates the degree of
		  similarity of two stimuli to a linear combination of their
		  common and distinctive features, in the context of image
		  representation and retrieval. Data were collected from 150
		  participants who performed an image description and a
		  similarity judgment task. Structural equation modeling,
		  correlation, and regression analyses confirmed the
		  relationships between perceived features and similarity of
		  objects hypothesized by Tversky. The results hold
		  implications for future research that will attempt to
		  further test the contrast model and assist designers of

		  collectively represent different evolutionary stages of the
		  field, with journals lagging a few years behind the Web on

		  stems from comparing the respective intellectual structures

		  periods: (a) from the field's beginnings in 1996 to 2001,

		  catalog of the world's moving images, as well as a portal
		  to information on the care, management, and use of moving

		  schema that is designed to map readily to any metadata
		  schema used to describe moving images. The MIC development
		  team was particularly interested in supporting MPEG-7 for
		  future nontextual digital video indexing applications. An
		  MPEG-7 application profile and Microsoft Access cataloging
		  utility were developed in order to test MPEG-7 within the
		  MIC Union Catalog; 400 science digital videos in the
		  Research Channel collection were cataloged in MPEG-7. The
		  MPEG-7 records were mapped to MIC and ingested. Draft
		  MPEG-7 to MIC and MIC to MPEG-7 maps were developed and are
		  available at the MIC Web site. MPEG-7 records are available
		  for viewing for any record in the MIC database via a
		  collections explore search within the Archivists' portal.

		  study was also a search for bibliometric measures of

  abstract	= {The vector space model of information retrieval is one of
		  the classical and widely applied retrieval models.
		  Paradoxically, it has been characterized by a discrepancy
		  between its formal framework and implementable form. The
		  underlying concepts of the vector space model are
		  mathematical terms: linear space, vector, and inner
		  product. However, in the vector space model, the
		  mathematical meaning of these concepts is not preserved.
		  They are used as mere computational constructs or
		  metaphors. Thus, the vector space model actually does not
		  follow formally from the mathematical concepts on which it
		  has been claimed to rest. This problem has been recognized
		  for more than two decades, but no proper solution has
		  emerged so far. The present article proposes a solution to
		  this problem. First, the concept of retrieval is defined
		  based on the mathematical measure theory. Then, retrieval
		  is particularized using fuzzy set theory. As a result, the
		  retrieval function is conceived as the cardinality of the
		  intersection of two fuzzy sets. This view makes it possible
		  to build a connection to linear spaces. It is shown that
		  the classical and the generalized vector space models, as
		  well as the latent semantic indexing model, gain a correct
		  formal background with which they are consistent. At the
		  same time it becomes clear that the inner product is not a
		  necessary ingredient of the vector space model, and hence
		  of Information Retrieval (IR). The Principle of Object
		  Invariance is introduced to handle this situation.
		  Moreover, this view makes it possible to consistently
		  formulate new retrieval methods: in linear space with
		  general basis, entropy-based, and probability-based. It is
		  also shown that Information Retrieval may be viewed as
		  integral calculus, and thus it gains a very compact and
		  elegant mathematical way of writing. Also, Information
		  Retrieval may thus be conceived as an application of
		  mathematical measure theory. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

  abstract	= {The article discusses lower and higher contexts for
		  information phenomena, and argues that there is clearly a
		  need for a more concerted research effort in the latter
		  sphere. The discipline of information science has
		  traditionally favored lower contexts—like everyday life
		  and problem solving—that are neutral or even negative by
		  nature. In contrast, the neglected higher things in life
		  are pleasurable or profound phenomena, experiences, or
		  activities that transcend the daily grind. A literature
		  sample of the scarce information research related to higher
		  things indicates that beyond the spotlight of mainstream
		  research, information processes often seem different and
		  there may be significant dimensions of information
		  phenomena that have been overlooked. Therefore, the article
		  outlines a contextual research area in information studies
		  to address higher things from the perspective of
		  information. It is concluded that optimal functioning
		  requires bringing the lower and higher sides to balance in
		  information science. This would offer a rare chance to
		  promote holism and interdisciplinarity in the field, and to

		  Our data set consists of 96 applicants for a research

		  articles that they had published within the framework of

  abstract	= {Based on articles published in 1990–2004 in 21 library
		  and information science (LIS) journals, a set of cocitation
		  analyses was performed to study changes in research fronts
		  over the last 15 years, where LIS is at now, and to discuss
		  where it is heading. To study research fronts, here defined
		  as current and influential cocited articles, a citations
		  among documents methodology was applied; and to study
		  changes, the analyses were time-sliced into three 5-year
		  periods. The results show a stable structure of two
		  distinct research fields: informetrics and information
		  seeking and retrieval (ISR). However, experimental
		  retrieval research and user oriented research have merged
		  into one ISR field; and IR and informetrics also show signs
		  of coming closer together, sharing research interests and
		  methodologies, making informetrics research more visible in
		  mainstream LIS research. Furthermore, the focus on the
		  Internet, both in ISR research and in informetrics—where
		  webometrics quickly has become a dominating research
		  area—is an important change. The future is discussed in
		  terms of LIS dependency on technology, how integration of
		  research areas as well as technical systems can be expected
		  to continue to characterize LIS research, and how
		  webometrics will continue to develop and find applications.

  abstract	= {Detecting query reformulations within a session by a Web
		  searcher is an important area of research for designing
		  more helpful searching systems and targeting content to
		  particular users. Methods explored by other researchers
		  include both qualitative (i.e., the use of human judges to
		  manually analyze query patterns on usually small samples)
		  and nondeterministic algorithms, typically using large
		  amounts of training data to predict query modification
		  during sessions. In this article, we explore three
		  alternative methods for detection of session boundaries.
		  All three methods are computationally straightforward and
		  therefore easily implemented for detection of session
		  changes. We examine 2,465,145 interactions from 534,507
		  users of on May 6, 2005. We compare session analysis using
		  (a) Internet Protocol address and cookie; (b) Internet
		  Protocol address, cookie, and a temporal limit on
		  intrasession interactions; and (c) Internet Protocol
		  address, cookie, and query reformulation patterns. Overall,
		  our analysis shows that defining sessions by query
		  reformulation along with Internet Protocol address and
		  cookie provides the best measure, resulting in an 82%
		  increase in the count of sessions. Regardless of the method
		  used, the mean session length was fewer than three queries,
		  and the mean session duration was less than 30 min.
		  Searchers most often modified their query by changing query
		  terms (nearly 23% of all query modifications) rather than
		  adding or deleting terms. Implications are that for
		  measuring searching traffic, unique sessions may be a
		  better indicator than the common metric of unique visitors.
		  This research also sheds light on the more complex aspects
		  of Web searching involving query modifications and may lead
		  to advances in searching tools. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

		  The basic idea is that articles that will have many

		  the past. To validate this hypothesis, we investigated the
		  correlation between future times cited and three measures
		  of centrality: clustering centrality, closeness centrality,

		  studies were performed in the two following recent

		  factor in explaining the near future times cited, and
		  betweenness centrality is correlated with the distant
		  future times cited. The effect of topological position on

		  study, we investigate the usage of Dogpile.com, a major Web
		  metasearch engine, with the aim of discovering how Web
		  searchers interact with metasearch engines. We report
		  results examining 2,465,145 interactions from 534,507 users
		  of Dogpile.com on May 6, 2005 and compare these results
		  with findings from other Web searching studies. We collect
		  data on geographical location of searchers, use of system
		  feedback, content selection, sessions, queries, and term
		  usage. Findings show that Dogpile.com searchers are mainly
		  from the USA (84% of searchers), use about 3 terms per
		  query (mean 5 2.85), implement system feedback moderately
		  (8.4% of users), and generally (56% of users) spend less

		  Overall, metasearchers seem to have higher degrees of

		  their sessions are for a shorter period of time. These

		  The linear sequence and narrative structure of storyboards

		  “entity” and “action” of the video's central theme,
		  the second layer consists of “entity” and “action”
		  keyframes with regard to background or supporting

		  deployed, social, cultural, and community-focused issues
		  are often neglected. Indeed much research has focused on
		  the “effects” these systems hold rather than viewing
		  systems as tools to be designed given an understanding of

		  and belief systems of a set of users may allow systems to

		  to create content for their own information systems, (2) to
		  design the database architectures, and (3) to integrate
		  systems within community infrastructures. In this article,
		  I allude to several cultural criticisms that accompany the
		  global proliferation of information technologies. These
		  criticisms can be answered by research that focuses on
		  developing systems based on ethnographic insights.
		  Specifically, I present the research example of Tribal
		  Peace, a cultural information system designed for and by
		  community members of the 19 Native American reservations of
		  San Diego County (California, United States). This case has
		  demonstrated the potential for a community to create an

		  retrieval are different formulations of the same
		  phenomenon. Stated briefly and in linguistic terms they
		  state that vocabularies' sizes are concave increasing power
		  laws of texts' sizes. This study investigates these laws
		  from a purely mathematical and informetric point of view. A
		  general informetric argument shows that the problem of
		  proving these laws is, in fact, ill-posed. Using the more
		  general terminology of sources and items, the author shows
		  by presenting exact formulas from Lotkaian informetrics
		  that the total number T of sources is not only a function
		  of the total number A of items, but is also a function of
		  several parameters (e.g., the parameters occurring in
		  Lotka's law). Consequently, it is shown that a fixed T (or
		  A ) value can lead to different possible A (respectively, T
		  ) values. Limiting the T ( A )-variability to increasing
		  samples (e.g., in a text as done in linguistics) the author
		  then shows, in a purely mathematical way, that for large
		  sample sizes T \'{y} L A &amp;thetas;, where &amp;thetas;
		  is a constant, &amp;thetas;6&lt;1 but close to 1, hence
		  roughly, Heaps' or Herdan's law can be proved without using
		  any linguistic or informetric argument. The author also
		  shows that for smaller samples, u is not a constant but
		  essentially decreases as confirmed by practical examples.
		  Finally, an exact informetric argument on random sampling
		  in the items shows that, in most cases, T = T ( A ) is a
		  concavely increasing function, in accordance with practical
		  examples. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract	= {In Sperber and Wilson's relevance theory (RT), the ratio
		  Cognitive Effects-Processing Effort defines the relevance
		  of a communication. The tf*idf formula from information
		  retrieval is used to operationalize this ratio for any item
		  co-occurring with a user-supplied seed term in bibliometric
		  distributions. The tf weight of the item predicts its
		  effect on the user in the context of the seed term, and its
		  idf weight predicts the user's processing effort in
		  relating the item to the seed term. The idf measure, also
		  known as statistical specificity, is shown to have
		  unsuspected applications in quantifying interrelated
		  concepts such as topical and nontopical relevance, levels
		  of user expertise, and levels of authority. A new kind of
		  visualization, the pennant diagram, illustrates these
		  claims. The bibliometric distributions visualized are the
		  works cocited with a seed work (Moby Dick), the authors
		  cocited with a seed author (White HD, for maximum
		  interpretability), and the books and articles cocited with
		  a seed article (S.A. Harter's Psychological Relevance and
		  Information Science, which introduced RT to information
		  scientists in 1992). Pennant diagrams use bibliometric data
		  and information retrieval techniques on the system side to
		  mimic a relevance-theoretic model of cognition on the user
		  side. Relevance theory may thus influence the design of new
		  visual information retrieval interfaces. Generally, when
		  information retrieval and bibliometrics are interpreted in
		  light of RT, the implications are rich: A single
		  sociocognitive theory may serve to integrate research on
		  literature-based systems with research on their users,
		  areas now largely separate. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals,

  abstract	= {When bibliometric data are converted to term frequency
		  (tf) and inverse document frequency (idf) values, plotted
		  as pennant diagrams, and interpreted according to Sperber
		  and Wilson's relevance theory (RT), the results evoke major
		  variables of information science (IS). These include
		  topicality, in the sense of intercohesion and
		  intercoherence among texts; cognitive effects of texts in
		  response to people's questions; people's levels of
		  expertise as a precondition for cognitive effects;
		  processing effort as textual or other messages are
		  received; specificity of terms as it affects processing
		  effort; relevance, defined in RT as the effects/effort
		  ratio; and authority of texts and their authors. While such
		  concerns figure automatically in dialogues between people,
		  they become problematic when people create or use or judge
		  literature-based information systems. The difficulty of
		  achieving worthwhile cognitive effects and acceptable
		  processing effort in human-system dialogues explains why
		  relevance is the central concern of IS. Moreover, since
		  relevant communication with both systems and unfamiliar
		  people is uncertain, speakers tend to seek cognitive
		  effects that cost them the least effort. Yet hearers need
		  greater effort, often greater specificity, from speakers if
		  their responses are to be highly relevant in their turn.
		  This theme of mismatch manifests itself in vague reference
		  questions, underdeveloped online searches, uncreative
		  judging in retrieval evaluation trials, and perfunctory
		  indexing. Another effect of least effort is a bias toward
		  topical relevance over other kinds. RT can explain these
		  outcomes as well as more adaptive ones. Pennant diagrams,
		  applied here to a literature search and a Bradford-style
		  journal analysis, can model them. Given RT and the right
		  context, bibliometrics may predict psychometrics. © 2007

  abstract	= {This article explores the status of research in
		  hydrogeology using data mining techniques. First we try to
		  explain what citation analysis is and review some of the
		  previous work on citation analysis. The main idea in this
		  article is to address some common issues about citation
		  numbers and the use of these data. To validate the use of
		  citation numbers, we compare the citation patterns for
		  Water Resources Research papers in the 1980s with those in
		  the 1990s. The citation growths for highly cited authors
		  from the 1980s are used to examine whether it is possible
		  to predict the citation patterns for highly-cited authors
		  in the 1990s. If the citation data prove to be steady and
		  stable, these numbers then can be used to explore the
		  evolution of science in hydrogeology. The famous quotation,
		  “If you are not the lead dog, the scenery never
		  changes,” attributed to Lee Iacocca, points to the
		  importance of an entrepreneurial spirit in all forms of
		  endeavor. In the case of hydrogeological research, impact
		  analysis makes it clear how important it is to be a
		  pioneer. Statistical correlation coefficients are used to
		  retrieve papers among a collection of 2,847 papers before
		  and after 1991 sharing the same topics with 273 papers in
		  1991 in Water Resources Research. The numbers of papers
		  before and after 1991 are then plotted against various
		  levels of citations for papers in 1991 to compare the
		  distributions of paper population before and after that
		  year. The similarity metrics based on word counts can
		  ensure that the “before” papers are like ancestors and
		  “after” papers are descendants in the same type of
		  research. This exercise gives us an idea of how many papers
		  are populated before and after 1991 (1991 is chosen based
		  on balanced numbers of papers before and after that year).
		  In addition, the impact of papers is measured in terms of
		  citation presented as “percentile,” a relative measure
		  based on rankings in one year, in order to minimize the
		  effect of time. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  (LZCS), a novel Lempel–Ziv approach suitable for

		  replacing them with a backward reference to their previous
		  occurrence. The result of the LZCS transformation is still
		  a valid structured document, which is human-readable and
		  can be transmitted by ASCII channels. Moreover, LZCS
		  transformed documents are easy to search, display, access

		  documents can be further compressed using any semistatic
		  technique, so that it is still possible to do all those

		  compression of collections of highly structured data, such

		  comparison with other structure-aware and standard

  abstract	= {Google News and other newsbots have automated the process
		  of news selection, providing Internet users with a
		  virtually limitless array of news and public information
		  dynamically culled from thousands of news organizations all
		  over the world. In order to help users cope with the
		  resultant overload of information, news leads are typically
		  accompanied by three cues: (a) the name of the primary
		  source from which the headline and lead were borrowed, (b)
		  the time elapsed since the story broke, and (c) the number
		  of related articles written about this story by other news
		  organizations tracked by the newsbot. This article
		  investigates the psychological significance of these cues
		  by positing that the information scent transmitted by each
		  cue triggers a distinct heuristic (mental shortcut) that
		  tends to influence online users' perceptions of a given
		  news item, with implications for their assessment of the
		  item's relevance to their information needs and interests.
		  A large 2 \texttimes{} 3 \texttimes{} 6 within-subjects
		  online experiment (N = 523) systematically varied two
		  levels of the source credibility cue, three levels of the
		  upload recency cue and six levels of the
		  number-of-related-articles cue in an effort to investigate
		  their effects upon perceived message credibility,
		  newsworthiness, and likelihood of clicking on the news
		  lead. Results showed evidence for source primacy effect,
		  and some indication of a cue-cumulation effect when source
		  credibility is low. Findings are discussed in the context

  abstract	= {A user's understanding of the libraries they work in, and
		  hence of what they can do in those libraries, is
		  encapsulated in their “mental models” of those
		  libraries. In this article, we present a focused case study
		  of users' mental models of traditional and digital
		  libraries based on observations and interviews with eight
		  participants. It was found that a poor understanding of
		  access restrictions led to risk-averse behavior, whereas a
		  poor understanding of search algorithms and relevance
		  ranking resulted in trial-and-error behavior. This
		  highlights the importance of rich feedback in helping users
		  to construct useful mental models. Although the use of
		  concrete analogies for digital libraries was not
		  widespread, participants used their knowledge of Internet
		  search engines to infer how searching might work in digital
		  libraries. Indeed, most participants did not clearly
		  distinguish between different kinds of digital resource,
		  viewing the electronic library catalogue, abstracting
		  services, digital libraries, and Internet search engines as

  abstract	= {The World Wide Web presents significant opportunities for
		  business intelligence analysis as it can provide
		  information about a company's external environment and its
		  stakeholders. Traditional business intelligence analysis on
		  the Web has focused on simple keyword searching. Recently,
		  it has been suggested that the incoming links, or
		  backlinks, of a company's Web site (i.e., other Web pages
		  that have a hyperlink pointing to the company of interest)
		  can provide important insights about the company's
		  “online communities.” Although analysis of these
		  communities can provide useful signals for a company and
		  information about its stakeholder groups, the manual
		  analysis process can be very time-consuming for business
		  analysts and consultants. In this article, we present a
		  tool called Redips that automatically integrates backlink
		  meta-searching and text-mining techniques to facilitate
		  users in performing such business intelligence analysis on
		  the Web. The architectural design and implementation of the
		  tool are presented in the article. To evaluate the
		  effectiveness, efficiency, and user satisfaction of Redips,
		  an experiment was conducted to compare the tool with two
		  popular business intelligence analysis methods—using
		  backlink search engines and manual browsing. The experiment
		  results showed that Redips was statistically more effective
		  than both benchmark methods (in terms of Recall and

		  created a Finnish–Swedish comparable corpus from two
		  loosely related document collections and used it as a
		  source of knowledge for query translation. Finnish test
		  queries were translated into Swedish and run against a

		  criterion levels—liberal, regular, and stringent—were
		  applied. The runs were also evaluated with generalized
		  recall and precision, which weight the retrieved documents
		  according to their relevance level. The performance of the
		  Comparable Corpus Translation system (COCOT) was compared
		  to that of a dictionary-based query translation program;
		  the two translation methods were also combined. The results
		  indicate that corpus-based CLIR performs particularly well
		  with highly relevant documents. In average precision, COCOT
		  even matched the monolingual baseline on the highest

		  translation methods was further analyzed by finding out
		  reasons for poor rankings of highly relevant documents. ©

		  Claude Shannon. The analogy is pursued both as an end in
		  itself and for its analytic value in understanding patterns
		  of retrieval from full-text systems. The multivalency of
		  individual words when isolated from their syntagm is
		  contrasted with the relative stability of meaning of
		  multiword sequences, when searching ordinary written
		  discourse. The syntagm is understood as the linear sequence
		  of oral and written language. Saussure's understanding of
		  the word, as a unit that compels recognition by the mind,
		  is endorsed, although not regarded as final. The lesser
		  multivalency of multiword sequences is understood as the
		  greater determination of signification by the extended
		  syntagm. The paradigm is primarily understood as the
		  network of associations a word acquires when considered
		  apart from the syntagm. The restriction of information
		  theory to expression or signals, and its focus on the
		  combinatorial aspects of the message, is sustained. The
		  message in the model of communication in information theory
		  can include sequences of written language. Shannon's
		  understanding of the written word, as a cohesive group of
		  letters, with strong internal statistical influences, is
		  added to the Saussurean conception. Sequences of more than

		  The study examined the stances of publishers as expressed
		  in the Copyright Transfer Agreements (CTAs) of the journals
		  toward self-archiving, the practice of depositing digital
		  copies of one's works in an Open Archives Initiative
		  (OAI)-compliant open access repository. Sixty-two percent
		  (32) do not make their CTAs available on the open Web; 38%
		  (20) do. Of the 38% that do make CTAs available, two are
		  open access journals. Of the 62% that do not have a
		  publicly available CTA, 40% are silent about
		  self-archiving. Even among the 20 journal CTAs publicly
		  available there is a high level of ambiguity. Closer
		  examination augmented by publisher policy documents on
		  copyright, self-archiving, and instructions to authors
		  reveals that only five, 10% of the ISI-ranked LIS journals
		  in the study, actually prohibit self-archiving by publisher
		  rule. Copyright is a moving target, but publishers appear
		  to be acknowledging that copyright and open access can
		  co-exist in scholarly journal publishing. The ambivalence
		  of LIS journal publishers provides unique opportunities to
		  members of the community. Authors can self-archive in open
		  access archives. A society-led, global scholarly
		  communication consortium can engage in the strategic
		  building of the LIS information commons. Aggregating
		  OAI-compliant archives and developing disciplinary-specific

		  universities, departments, countries, and scientific
		  journals, but not yet for individual scientists—an
		  important omission. The present research closes this gap by
		  investigating factors that may influence the Web impact
		  (i.e., inlink counts) of scientists' personal homepages.
		  Data concerning 456 scientists from five scientific
		  disciplines in six European countries were analyzed,
		  showing that both homepage content and personal and
		  institutional characteristics of the homepage owners had
		  significant relationships with inlink counts. A
		  multivariate statistical analysis confirmed that full-text
		  articles are the most linked-to content in homepages. At
		  the individual homepage level, hyperlinks are related to
		  several offline characteristics. Notable differences
		  regarding total inlinks to scientists' homepages exist
		  between the scientific disciplines and the countries in the
		  sample. There also are both gender and age effects: fewer
		  external inlinks (i.e., links from other Web domains) to
		  the homepages of female and of older scientists. There is
		  only a weak relationship between a scientist's recognition
		  and homepage inlinks and, surprisingly, no relationship

		  that the homepage owners put on their homepage and their

		  articles from research using numeric data files and

		  Shifts in electronic publishing and the emergence of new

		  to the research process. Evidence of use of large surveys
		  throughout the knowledge transfer process can be critical

		  limitations of the survey. Further work can be done to
		  expand the scope of material cited and analyze the data to
		  understand how the longitudinal aspect of the survey
		  contributes to the value of the research output. Building a
		  case for continued funding of national, longitudinal
		  surveys is a challenge. As far as I am aware, however,
		  little use has been made of citation tracking to assess the

		  In this article, the authors introduce a model of OSS based

		  scientific papers has increased due to the continuing
		  progress being made in scientific research. Since numerous
		  papers have only reported fragments of scientific facts,
		  there are possibilities for discovering new knowledge by
		  connecting these facts. We therefore developed a system
		  called BioTermNet to draft a conceptual network with hybrid
		  methods of information extraction and information
		  retrieval. Two concepts are regarded as related in this
		  system if (a) their relationship is clearly described in
		  MEDLINE abstracts or (b) they have distinctively
		  co-occurred in abstracts. PRIME data, including protein
		  interactions and functions extracted by NLP techniques, are
		  used in the former, and the Singhal-measure for information
		  retrieval is used in the latter. Relationships that are not
		  clearly or directly described in an abstract can be
		  extracted by connecting multiple concepts. To evaluate how
		  well this system performs, Swanson's association between
		  Raynaud's disease and fish oil and that between migraine
		  and magnesium were tested with abstracts that had been
		  published before the discovery of these associations. The
		  result was that when start and end concepts were given,
		  plausible and understandable intermediate concepts
		  connecting them could be detected. When only the start
		  concept was given, not only the focused concept (magnesium
		  and fish oil) but also other probable concepts could be
		  detected as related concept candidates. Finally, this
		  system was applied to find diseases related to the BRCA1
		  gene. Some other new potentially related diseases were
		  detected along with diseases whose relations to BRCA1 were
		  already known. The BioTermNet is available at

  abstract	= {In this article we distinguish between top-performance and
		  lower-performance groups in the analysis of statistical
		  properties of bibliometric characteristics of two large
		  sets of research groups. We find intriguing differences
		  between top-performance and lower-performance groups, and
		  between the two sets of research groups. These latter
		  differences may indicate the influence of research
		  management strategies. We report the following two main
		  observations: First, lower-performance groups have a larger
		  size-dependent cumulative advantage for receiving citations
		  than top-performance groups. Second, regardless of
		  performance, larger groups have fewer not-cited
		  publications. Particularly for the lower-performance
		  groups, the fraction of not-cited publications decreases
		  considerably with size. We introduce a simple model in
		  which processes at the microlevel lead to the observed
		  phenomena at the macrolevel. Next, we fit our findings into
		  the novel concept of hierarchically layered networks. In
		  this concept, which provides the “infrastructure” for
		  the model, a network of research groups constitutes a layer
		  of one hierarchical step higher than the basic network of
		  publications connected by citations. The cumulative size
		  advantage of citations received by a group resembles
		  preferential attachment in the basic network in which
		  highly connected nodes (publications) increase their
		  connectivity faster than less connected nodes. But in our
		  study it is size that causes an advantage. In general, the
		  larger a group (node in the research group network), the
		  more incoming links this group acquires in a nonlinear,
		  cumulative way. Nevertheless, top-performance groups are
		  about an order of magnitude more efficient in creating
		  linkages (i.e., receiving citations) than lower-performance
		  groups. This implies that together with the size-dependent
		  mechanism, preferential attachment, a quite common
		  characteristic of complex networks, also works. Finally, in
		  the framework of this study on performance-related
		  differences of bibliometric properties of research groups,
		  we also find that top-performance groups are, on average,
		  more successful in the entire range of journal impact. ©

  abstract	= {Due to e-mail's ubiquitous nature, millions of users are
		  intimate with the technology; however, most users are only
		  familiar with managing their own e-mail, which is an
		  inherently different task from exploring an e-mail archive.
		  Historians and social scientists believe that e-mail
		  archives are important artifacts for understanding the
		  individuals and communities they represent. To understand
		  the conversations evidenced in an archive, context is
		  needed. In this article, we present a new way to gain this
		  necessary context: analyzing the temporal rhythms of social
		  relationships. We provide methods for constructing
		  meaningful rhythms from the e-mail headers by identifying
		  relationships and interpreting their attributes. With these
		  visualization techniques, e-mail archive explorers can
		  uncover insights that may have been otherwise hidden in the
		  archive. We apply our methods to an individual's 15-year
		  e-mail archive, which consists of about 45,000 messages and
		  over 4,000 relationships. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  other user population, yet their day-to-day activities are
		  often elusive. One activity that consumes much of a
		  scientist's time is developing models that balance
		  contradictory and redundant evidence. Driven by our desire
		  to understand the information behaviors of this important
		  user group, and the behaviors of scientific discovery in
		  general, we conducted an observational study of academic
		  research scientists as they resolved different experimental
		  results reported in the biomedical literature. This article
		  is the first of two that reports our findings. In this
		  article, we introduce the Collaborative Information
		  Synthesis (CIS) model that reflects the salient information
		  behaviors that we observed. The CIS model emerges from a
		  rich collection of qualitative data including interviews,
		  electronic recordings of meetings, meeting minutes, e-mail
		  communications, and extraction worksheets. Our findings
		  suggest that scientists provide two information constructs:
		  a hypothesis projection and context information. They also
		  engage in four critical tasks: retrieval, extraction,
		  verification, and analysis. The findings also suggest that
		  science is not an individual but rather a collaborative
		  activity and that scientists use the results of one
		  analysis to inform new analyses. In Part 2, we compare and

  abstract	= {Context is one of the most important concepts in
		  information seeking and retrieval research. However, the
		  challenges of studying context are great; thus, it is more
		  common for researchers to use context as a post hoc
		  explanatory factor, rather than as a concept that drives
		  inquiry. The purposes of this study were to develop a
		  method for collecting data about information seeking
		  context in natural online environments, and identify which
		  aspects of context should be considered when studying
		  online information seeking. The study is reported in two
		  parts. In this, the first part, the background and method
		  are presented. Results and implications of this research
		  are presented in Part 2 (Kelly, in press). Part 1 discusses
		  previous literature on information seeking context and
		  behavior and situates the current work within this
		  literature. This part further describes the naturalistic,
		  longitudinal research design that was used to examine and
		  measure the online information seeking contexts of users
		  during a 14-week period. In this design, information
		  seeking context was characterized by a user's
		  self-identified tasks and topics, and several attributes of
		  these, such as the length of time the user expected to work
		  on a task and the user's familiarity with a topic. At
		  weekly intervals, users evaluated the usefulness of the
		  documents that they viewed, and classified these documents
		  according to their tasks and topics. At the end of the
		  study, users provided feedback about the study method. ©

		  highly related papers simultaneously in the same journal,

		  the association by adding the words, “and Technology”
		  (&amp;T). Today this change may be considered minor, but
		  for many involved at the time—it was a change that had
		  purpose and meaning. A study was initiated to trace the
		  society's transition toward a professional association more
		  inclusive of practitioners and applied research. The study
		  was conducted in two stages, using quantitative and
		  qualitative methods. Stage 1 compared the research
		  published in the conference proceedings both prior to and
		  following the society's name change. Stage 2 built upon the
		  assumption that a professional association is a reflection
		  of its membership. The Stage 1 results offer both an
		  aggregate and a comparative view of the papers accepted for
		  and presented at the annual conference. The results suggest
		  that as an association of researchers, the society may be
		  moving toward a renewed focus on practical and applied
		  information. The Stage 2 results suggest that some
		  ASIS&amp;T members welcome the increased focus on
		  technology, applied research, and the topics of interest to
		  practitioners. Others view the changes as negative, perhaps
		  even undermining the value of ASIS. The practical
		  implications suggest that an annual conference can be an
		  association's most important branding opportunity. It
		  should reflect the interests of its membership as well as
		  attract new members. A clear vision, supported by the

		  the importance of promoting them have been recognized in
		  previous research. To determine the factors affecting user
		  acceptance of Web-based subscription databases, this study
		  tests an integrated model of the antecedents and
		  consequences of user beliefs about intended use by
		  extending the technology acceptance model. The research
		  employs a cross-sectional field study using a Web survey
		  method targeting undergraduate students who have experience
		  with Web-based subscription databases. Overall, the
		  research model performs well in explaining user acceptance
		  of Web-based subscription databases. The effects of the
		  cognitive instrumental determinants of usefulness
		  perceptions are examined. Terminology clarity and
		  accessibility were found to be important determinants for
		  ease of use of the databases. The results indicate that
		  user training has no impact on either perceptions of
		  usefulness or ease of use, and that there is a need to
		  reexamine the effectiveness of user training in the context
		  of Web-based subscription databases. The results suggest
		  that user acceptance of the databases depends largely on
		  the utility they offer. The findings also suggest that
		  although a subjective norm does not directly affect
		  intended use, it exerts a positive influence on user
		  beliefs about the utility of the databases. © 2006 Wiley

		  been successfully used in the past to solve a number of
		  pattern recognition problems. In this article, the authors
		  propose a new approach to content-based image retrieval
		  (CBIR) that uses (a) a newly proposed similarity-preserving
		  space transformation method to transform the original
		  low-level image space into a high-level vector space that
		  enables efficient query processing, and (b) a clustering
		  scheme that further improves the efficiency of our
		  retrieval system. This combination is unique and the
		  resulting system provides synergistic advantages of using
		  both clustering and space transformation. The proposed
		  space transformation method is shown to preserve the order
		  of the distances in the transformed feature space. This
		  strategy makes this approach to retrieval generic as it can
		  be applied to object types, other than images, and feature
		  spaces more general than metric spaces. The CBIR approach
		  uses the inexpensive “estimated” distance in the
		  transformed space, as opposed to the computationally
		  inefficient “real” distance in the original space, to
		  retrieve the desired results for a given query image. The
		  authors also provide a theoretical analysis of the
		  complexity of their CBIR approach when used for color-based
		  retrieval, which shows that it is computationally more
		  efficient than other comparable approaches. An extensive
		  set of experiments to test the efficiency and effectiveness
		  of the proposed approach has been performed. The results
		  show that the approach offers superior response time
		  (improvement of 1–2 orders of magnitude compared to
		  retrieval approaches that either use pruning techniques
		  like indexing, clustering, etc., or space transformation,
		  but not both) with sufficiently high retrieval accuracy. ©

		  Towards this goal, 22 participants performed three
		  fact-finding tasks and two broader tasks in an

		  proportion of precise queries, and the speed of evaluating
		  result documents. Our results showed that the variables
		  related to Web experience had expected effects on TCS. The
		  increase in the years of Web use was related to improvement
		  in TCS in the broader tasks, whereas the less frequent Web
		  use was related to a decrease in TCS in the fact-finding
		  tasks. Other variables having significant effects on TCS in
		  either of the task types were the speed of composing
		  queries, the average number of query terms per query, the

		  source for investigating broad issues. RSS, as originally
		  conceived, is a method for publishing timely and concise

		  RSS feeds are potentially a nonintrusive source of
		  high-quality data about public opinion: Monitoring a large
		  number may allow quantitative methods to extract
		  information relevant to a given need. In this article we
		  describe an RSS feed-based coword frequency method to
		  identify bursts of discussion relevant to a given broad

		  debates from the corpus through investigating the top 1,000
		  “burst” words found only two genuine debates, however.
		  The low success rate was mainly caused by a few
		  pathological feeds that dominated the results and obscured
		  any significant debates. The results point to the need to
		  develop effective data cleansing procedures for RSS feeds,
		  particularly if there is not a large quantity of discussion
		  about the broad issue, and a range of potential techniques
		  is suggested. Finally, the analysis confirmed that the time

		  characteristics, if any, lead users engaged in interactive
		  information seeking to prefer certain sets of query terms.
		  Underlying this work is the assumption that query terms
		  that information seekers prefer induce a kind of cognitive
		  efficiency: They require less mental effort to process and
		  therefore reduce the energy required in the interactive
		  information-seeking process. Conceptually, this work
		  applies insights from linguistics and cognitive science to
		  the study of query-term quality. We report on an experiment
		  in which we compare user preference for three sets of
		  terms; one had been preconstructed by a human indexer, and
		  two were identified automatically. Twenty-four participants
		  used a merged list of all terms to answer a carefully
		  created set of questions. By design, the interface
		  constrained users to access the text exclusively via the
		  displayed list of query terms. We found that participants
		  displayed a preference for the human-constructed set of
		  terms eight times greater than the preference for either
		  set of automatically identified terms. We speculate about
		  reasons for this strong preference and discuss the
		  implications for information access. The primary
		  contributions of this research are (a) explication of the
		  concept of user preference as a measure of query-term
		  quality and (b) identification of a replicable procedure
		  for measuring preference for sets of query terms created by
		  different methods, whether human or automatic. All other
		  factors being equal, query terms that users prefer clearly

		  examine the need and adoption of teleophthalmology in
		  sub-Saharan Africa. Ethiopia, like most sub-Saharan African
		  countries, is faced with limited specialists and health
		  care services. These services are often concentrated in the
		  urban areas, leaving most of the rural population (about
		  70% of the country) without adequate and timely health care
		  delivery. In Ethiopia, the ratio of ophthalmologists to the
		  population is 1:1,200,000, resulting in inadequate delivery
		  of ophthalmology-related health care services. Using both
		  primary and secondary data collection approaches, the
		  authors report the need for telemedicine as well as the
		  adoption and application of teleophthalmology in Ethiopia.
		  Further, they present Ethiopia's teleophthalmology network,
		  integrated teleconsultation, and teleeducation services.
		  The authors conclude by presenting this research as a
		  starting point to investigate further teleophthalmology and
		  other telemedicine services for Ethiopia and by extension,
		  other developing countries. Therefore, they bring a
		  much-underresearched region (sub-Saharan Africa) and a
		  much-underresearched technology (telemedicine) to the
		  forefront of information systems (IS) research. It is the
		  authors' hope that colleagues in the field will be
		  motivated to investigate this “forgotten” region of the
		  world that is yet to reap the full potentials of
		  information and communications technologies (ICTs). © 2006

		  53 in the social sciences, and 51 in the sciences replied.
		  There were few disciplinary differences. Most respondents
		  reported reading between one and five book reviews a month
		  and writing between one and two a year. There was high
		  overall agreement between what the respondents thought were
		  important features of book reviews, but there were also
		  wide individual differences between them. This agreement
		  across the disciplines supports the notion that book
		  reviews can be seen as an academic genre with measurable
		  features. This has implications for how they are written,
		  and how authors might be taught to write them better. A
		  potential checklist for authors is suggested. © 2006 Wiley

		  of the objects (e.g., books, N-grams, etc.) that belong to
		  1, 2, …, n sets (more generally: families) (e.g.,

		  concentration theory, a theory of n-overlap similarity is
		  conceived together with corresponding measures, such as the
		  generalized Jaccard index (generalizing the well-known
		  Jaccard index in case n 5 2). Next, the distributional form
		  of the n-overlap vector is determined assuming certain
		  distributions of the object's and of the set (family)
		  sizes. In this section the decreasing power law and
		  decreasing exponential distribution is explained for the
		  n-overlap vector. Both item (token) n-overlap and source
		  (type) n-overlap are studied. The n-overlap properties of
		  objects indexed by a hierarchical system (e.g., books
		  indexed by numbers from a UDC or Dewey system or by
		  N-grams) are presented in the final section. The author
		  shows how the results given in the previous section can be

		  reviewing the major ideas of sense-making methodology
		  developed by Brenda Dervin. Sense-making methodology
		  approaches the phenomena of information use by drawing on
		  the metaphor of gap-bridging. The nature of this metaphor
		  is explored by utilizing the ideas of metaphor analysis
		  suggested by Lakoff and Johnson. First, the source domain
		  of the metaphor is characterized by utilizing the graphical
		  illustrations of sense-making metaphors. Second, the target
		  domain of the metaphor is analyzed by scrutinizing Dervin's
		  key writings on information seeking and use. The metaphor
		  of gap-bridging does not suggest a substantive conception
		  of information use; the metaphor gives methodological and
		  heuristic guidance to posit contextual questions as to how
		  people interpret information to make sense of it.
		  Specifically, these questions focus on the ways in which
		  cognitive, affective, and other elements useful for the
		  sense-making process are constructed and shaped to bridge
		  the gap. Ultimately, the key question of information use
		  studies is how people design information in context. ©

		  (1999–2003) and appeared in 16 different journals. An
		  overwhelming majority of contributions (91%) were written
		  in English, and 83% of them had single authorship.
		  Researchers based at Turkish universities produced 90% of
		  all publications. Two thirds of references in publications
		  were to monographs. The median age of all references was 12
		  years. Eighty percent of publications authored by Turkish
		  arts and humanities scholars were not cited at all while

		  argued that the same is not true for the social sciences
		  and humanities where knowledge is more often disseminated
		  in monographs that are not indexed in the journal-based

		  have made only partial assessments of the role played by

		  citation data from the CD-ROM versions of the Science
		  Citation Index (SCI), Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),
		  and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) databases
		  from 1981 to 2000 (Thomson ISI, Philadelphia, PA), the
		  authors quantify the share of citations to both serials and
		  other types of literature. Variations in time and between
		  fields are also analyzed. The results show that journal
		  literature is increasingly important in the natural and
		  social sciences, but that its role in the humanities is
		  stagnant and has even tended to diminish slightly in the
		  1990s. Journal literature accounts for less than 50% of the
		  citations in several disciplines of the social sciences and

  abstract	= {Producers in creative genres are frequently motivated by
		  goals that put those producers in opposition to popular
		  culture and marketplace pressures. Questions about whether
		  those goals reflect values that belong specifically to
		  print culture, or whether those values will continue to
		  motivate producers in creative genres after the
		  introduction of online technology, have not been answered
		  empirically. Previous studies of genre change have been
		  among those that have focused on the ability of human
		  actors to use information technology to alter those genres
		  as social structures. However, these studies have focused
		  on generic artifacts rather than on the creative values
		  that motivated the creation of those artifacts. Editors of
		  small literary magazines (generally referred to as little
		  magazines) make ideal subjects for this study. Creative
		  values play an important role in their decisions, and they
		  frequently publish poetry, fiction, and other work that
		  stand in opposition to popular culture and literature. This
		  study proposed and evaluated a conceptual framework for
		  anticipating whether editors of little magazines will use
		  online technologies to reinforce or alter the values
		  characteristic of their genre. The study found that the
		  values posited in the conceptual framework fit the goals
		  expressed by little magazine editors. Not all editors held
		  those values equally, however. These findings suggest that
		  producers in creative genres can use online technology in
		  ways that actually reflect an intensification of those
		  values. The concept of intensifying use of technology (IUT)
		  was posited to explain the differences. © 2006 Wiley

  abstract	= {Document keyphrases provide a concise summary of a
		  document's content, offering semantic metadata summarizing
		  a document. They can be used in many applications related
		  to knowledge management and text mining, such as automatic
		  text summarization, development of search engines, document
		  clustering, document classification, thesaurus
		  construction, and browsing interfaces. Because only a small
		  portion of documents have keyphrases assigned by authors,
		  and it is time-consuming and costly to manually assign
		  keyphrases to documents, it is necessary to develop an
		  algorithm to automatically generate keyphrases for
		  documents. This paper describes a Keyphrase Identification
		  Program (KIP), which extracts document keyphrases by using
		  prior positive samples of human identified phrases to
		  assign weights to the candidate keyphrases. The logic of
		  our algorithm is: The more keywords a candidate keyphrase
		  contains and the more significant these keywords are, the
		  more likely this candidate phrase is a keyphrase. KIP's
		  learning function can enrich the glossary database by
		  automatically adding new identified keyphrases to the
		  database. KIP's personalization feature will let the user
		  build a glossary database specifically suitable for the
		  area of his/her interest. The evaluation results show that
		  KIP's performance is better than the systems we compared to
		  and that the learning function is effective. © 2006 Wiley

		  Absent from current Web design practice, however, is a

		  failure when it is not addressed by the user interface. The
		  best practices are organized into five domains: the corpus,

		  of how Web users can retrieve documents in different
		  languages has arisen. Cross-language information retrieval
		  (CLIR), the study of retrieving information in one language

		  approach to the problem. Cross-language information
		  retrieval has attracted much attention in recent years.
		  Most research systems have achieved satisfactory

		  not been widely studied and evaluated for applications such
		  as Web portals. In this article, the authors present their
		  research in developing and evaluating a multilingual
		  English–Chinese Web portal that incorporates various CLIR
		  techniques for use in the business domain. A
		  dictionary-based approach was adopted and combines phrasal
		  translation, co-occurrence analysis, and pre- and
		  posttranslation query expansion. The portal was evaluated
		  by domain experts, using a set of queries in both English
		  and Chinese. The experimental results showed that
		  co-occurrence-based phrasal translation achieved a 74.6%
		  improvement in precision over simple word-by-word

		  is that individuals may be inclined to think more highly of
		  the materials that they themselves have found and are
		  almost certain to think more highly of their own work
		  product than they do of the products built by others. The
		  keys to neutralizing this problem are careful design and a
		  corresponding analytical model based on analysis of
		  variance. We model the several measures of task completion
		  with a linear model of five effects, describing the users
		  who interact with the system, the system used to finish the
		  task, the task itself, the behavior of individuals as
		  judges, and the self-judgment bias. Our analytical method
		  successfully isolates the effect of each variable. This

		  context, traditional information retrieval (IR) techniques
		  cannot be used whenever the user query and the documents
		  being retrieved are in different languages. To address this
		  problem, new cross-language information retrieval (CLIR)
		  techniques have been proposed. In this work, we describe a
		  method for cross-language retrieval of medical information.
		  This method combines query terms and related medical
		  concepts obtained automatically through a categorization
		  procedure. The medical concepts are used to create a
		  linguistic abstraction that allows retrieval of information
		  in a language-independent way, minimizing linguistic
		  problems such as polysemy. To evaluate our method, we
		  carried out experiments using the OHSUMED test collection,
		  whose documents are written in English, with queries
		  expressed in Portuguese, Spanish, and French. The results
		  indicate that our cross-language retrieval method is as
		  effective as a standard vector space model algorithm

		  used to collect, disseminate, and access an increasingly
		  huge amount of information, which constitutes the mainstay
		  of the so-called information and knowledge society. Because
		  of its spectacular growth, related to both Web resources
		  (pages, sites, and services) and number of users, the Web
		  is nowadays the main information repository and provides
		  some automatic systems for locating, accessing, and

		  So, soft computing represents a good candidate to design

		  approach to detecting and visualizing emerging trends and
		  transient patterns in scientific literature. The work makes
		  substantial theoretical and methodological contributions to
		  progressive knowledge domain visualization. A specialty is
		  conceptualized and visualized as a time-variant duality
		  between two fundamental concepts in information science:
		  research fronts and intellectual bases. A research front is
		  defined as an emergent and transient grouping of concepts
		  and underlying research issues. The intellectual base of a
		  research front is its citation and co-citation footprint in
		  scientific literature—an evolving network of scientific
		  publications cited by research-front concepts. Kleinberg's
		  (2002) burst-detection algorithm is adapted to identify
		  emergent research-front concepts. Freeman's (1979)
		  betweenness centrality metric is used to highlight
		  potential pivotal points of paradigm shift over time. Two
		  complementary visualization views are designed and
		  implemented: cluster views and time-zone views. The
		  contributions of the approach are that (a) the nature of an
		  intellectual base is algorithmically and temporally
		  identified by emergent research-front terms, (b) the value
		  of a co-citation cluster is explicitly interpreted in terms
		  of research-front concepts, and (c) visually prominent and
		  algorithmically detected pivotal points substantially
		  reduce the complexity of a visualized network. The modeling
		  and visualization process is implemented in CiteSpace II, a
		  Java application, and applied to the analysis of two
		  research fields: mass extinction (1981–2004) and
		  terrorism (1990–2003). Prominent trends and pivotal
		  points in visualized networks were verified in
		  collaboration with domain experts, who are the authors of
		  pivotal-point articles. Practical implications of the work

		  four types of writing-style features (lexical, syntactic,

		  and inductive learning algorithms are used to build
		  feature-based classification models to identify authorship
		  of online messages. To examine this framework, we conducted

		  messages. We compared the discriminating power of the four
		  types of features and of three classification techniques:
		  decision trees, backpropagation neural networks, and
		  support vector machines. The experimental results showed
		  that the proposed approach was able to identify authors of
		  online messages with satisfactory accuracy of 70 to 95%.
		  All four types of message features contributed to
		  discriminating authors of online messages. Support vector

		  Further, when combined with a traditional text-based

		  there has been little written on how to quantitatively
		  evaluate the accuracy of relatedness measures or the
		  resulting maps. The authors propose a new framework for
		  assessing the performance of relatedness measures and
		  visualization algorithms that contains four factors:
		  accuracy, coverage, scalability, and robustness. This
		  method was applied to 10 measures of journal–journal
		  relatedness to determine the best measure. The 10
		  relatedness measures were then used as inputs to a
		  visualization algorithm to create an additional 10 measures
		  of journal–journal relatedness based on the distances
		  between pairs of journals in two-dimensional space. This

		  remains best after dimension reduction). Results show that,
		  for low coverage (under 50%), the Pearson correlation is
		  the most accurate raw relatedness measure. However, the
		  best overall measure, both at high coverage, and after

		  the author describes the LKB construction process, which
		  customizes available translation resources based on the

		  consistently increased the percentage of correct

		  approach has produced significant improvement in EC-CLIR

		  journal volumes at academic libraries, i.e., removal to

		  collection. The method is based on the volume as the unit
		  of measurement and on user satisfaction with given titles.
		  The discarding age, calculated for each volume, from the
		  year of publication to the year of decision to discard, is
		  dependent on citation half-life, relative productivity,
		  knowledge area, and residual utility (potential
		  consultations). The model makes it possible to predict the
		  approximate size of a collection when a stationary state is
		  reached in which the inflow of journal volumes is equal to
		  the outflow from discarding. The model is also able to
		  determine the rate of growth of the holdings. This
		  information can be used to optimize future use of available
		  space and economic and maintenance resources; thus
		  promoting efficient management of the collection. © 2006

  abstract	= {An experiment was performed at the National Library of
		  Medicine® (NLM®) in word sense disambiguation (WSD) using
		  the Journal Descriptor Indexing (JDI) methodology. The
		  motivation is the need to solve the ambiguity problem
		  confronting NLM's MetaMap system, which maps free text to
		  terms corresponding to concepts in NLM's Unified Medical
		  Language System® (UMLS®) Metathesaurus®. If the text
		  maps to more than one Metathesaurus concept at the same
		  high confidence score, MetaMap has no way of knowing which
		  concept is the correct mapping. We describe the JDI
		  methodology, which is ultimately based on statistical
		  associations between words in a training set of MEDLINE®
		  citations and a small set of journal descriptors (assigned
		  by humans to journals per se) assumed to be inherited by
		  the citations. JDI is the basis for selecting the best
		  meaning that is correlated to UMLS semantic types (STs)
		  assigned to ambiguous concepts in the Metathesaurus. For
		  example, the ambiguity transport has two meanings:
		  “Biological Transport” assigned the ST Cell Function
		  and “Patient transport” assigned the ST Health Care
		  Activity. A JDI-based methodology can analyze text
		  containing transport and determine which ST receives a
		  higher score for that text, which then returns the
		  associated meaning, presumed to apply to the ambiguity
		  itself. We then present an experiment in which a baseline
		  disambiguation method was compared to four versions of JDI
		  in disambiguating 45 ambiguous strings from NLM's WSD Test
		  Collection. Overall average precision for the
		  highest-scoring JDI version was 0.7873 compared to 0.2492
		  for the baseline method, and average precision for
		  individual ambiguities was greater than 0.90 for 23 of them
		  (51%), greater than 0.85 for 24 (53%), and greater than
		  0.65 for 35 (79%). On the basis of these results, we hope
		  to improve performance of JDI and test its use in
		  applications. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract	= {Recent studies suggest that the wide variability in type,
		  detail, and reliability of online information motivate
		  expert searchers to develop procedural search knowledge. In
		  contrast to prior research that has focused on finding
		  relevant sources, procedural search knowledge focuses on
		  how to order multiple relevant sources with the goal of
		  retrieving comprehensive information. Because such
		  procedural search knowledge is neither spontaneously
		  inferred from the results of search engines, nor from the
		  categories provided by domain-specific portals, the lack of
		  such knowledge leads most novice searchers to retrieve
		  incomplete information. In domains like healthcare, such
		  incomplete information can lead to dangerous consequences.
		  To address the above problem, a new kind of domain portal
		  called a Strategy Hub was developed and tested. Strategy
		  Hubs provide critical search procedures and associated
		  high-quality links to enable users to find comprehensive
		  and accurate information. We begin by describing how we
		  collaborated with physicians to systematically identify
		  generalizable search procedures to find comprehensive
		  information about a disease, and how these search
		  procedures were made available through the Strategy Hub. A
		  controlled experiment suggests that this approach can
		  improve the ability of novice searchers in finding
		  comprehensive and accurate information, when compared to
		  general-purpose search engines and domain-specific portals.
		  We conclude with insights on how to refine and automate the
		  Strategy Hub design, with the ultimate goal of helping
		  users find more comprehensive information when searching in
		  unfamiliar domains. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  The distance between a pair of words is determined on the

		  have the same morphological or lexical basis. The heuristic
		  reports an approximate match if common letters agree in

		  Within the conditions of the experiments performed, the

		  determine the segmentation points in a Chinese sentence. No

		  segmentation is important in Chinese text indexing and thus
		  greatly affects the performance of Chinese information

		  (i.e., unknown words) are the major challenges in Chinese
		  segmentation. Many research studies dealing with the
		  problem of word segmentation have focused on the resolution
		  of segmentation ambiguities. The problem of unknown word
		  identification has not drawn much attention. The
		  experimental result shows that the proposed heuristic
		  method is promising to segment the unknown words as well as
		  the known words. The authors further investigated the
		  distribution of the errors of commission and the errors of

		  proposed technique, boundary detection. It is found that

		  literature, researchers must rely on a wide range of
		  disciplinary and multidisciplinary databases for ranking
		  and other research purposes. The study answers such

		  knowledge management requires a good understanding of
		  knowledge processes and the ability to differentiate
		  between information management and knowledge management.
		  Given the complexity of knowledge and the nature of its
		  existence, there is a need for graduate programs to go

		  disciplines that deal with social, cultural, and economic
		  issues such as communication, cognitive science, and

		  management curriculum. In this article, the design and
		  development of an interdisciplinary graduate program in
		  knowledge man-agement at Nanyang Technological University
		  in Singa-pore is reported. The initiation of the program
		  was influenced by the strong demand from the public sector
		  in Singapore for knowledge management professionals. It was
		  developed in close association with the information studies
		  program at Nanyang Technological University. In the first
		  year, the program attracted 230 applicants, of which 45

		  more downloads of the cited article through the citation.
		  An analysis of 1,190 papers in the journal during a time

		  effect of downloads upon citation and that of citation upon
		  downloads. Correlating initial downloads to later citation
		  counts, the correlation coefficient drops to 0.11. Findings

		  coverage of a topic, coupled with the development of
		  powerful search engines (designed to help users find such

		  comprehensive information about a topic. In domains such as
		  consumer healthcare, finding comprehensive information
		  about a topic is critical as it can improve a patient's
		  judgment in making healthcare decisions, and can encourage
		  higher compliance with treatment. However, recent studies
		  show that despite using powerful search engines, many
		  healthcare information seekers have difficulty finding
		  comprehensive information even for narrow healthcare topics
		  because the relevant information is scattered across many
		  Web sites. To date, no studies have analyzed how facts
		  related to a search topic are distributed across relevant
		  Web pages and Web sites. In this study, the distribution of
		  facts related to five common healthcare topics across
		  high-quality sites is analyzed, and the reasons underlying
		  those distributions are explored. The analysis revealed the
		  existence of few pages that had many facts, many pages that
		  had few facts, and no single page or site that provided all
		  the facts. While such a distribution conforms to other
		  information-related phenomena, a deeper analysis revealed
		  that the distributions were caused by a trade-off between
		  depth and breadth, leading to the existence of general,
		  specialized, and sparse pages. Furthermore, the results
		  helped to make explicit the knowledge needed by searchers
		  to find comprehensive healthcare information, and suggested
		  the motivation to explore

		  a fundamental image feature and belongs to one of the most
		  important image features used in CBIR. In this article we
		  propose a robust and effective shape feature known as the
		  compound image descriptor (CID), which combines the Fourier
		  transform (FT) magnitude and phase coefficients with the
		  global features. The underlying FT coefficients have been
		  shown analytically to be invariant to rotation,
		  translation, and scaling. We also present details of the
		  underlying innovative shape feature extraction method. The
		  global features, besides being incorporated with the FT
		  coefficients to form the CID, are also used to filter out
		  the highly dissimilar images during the image retrieval
		  process. Thus, they serve a dual purpose of improving the
		  accuracy and hence the robustness of the shape descriptor,
		  and of speeding up the retrieval process, leading to a
		  reduced query response time. Experiment results show that
		  the proposed shape descriptor is, in general, robust to

  abstract	= {Power laws as defined in 1926 by A. Lotka are increasing
		  in importance because they have been found valid in varied
		  social networks including the Internet. In this article
		  some unique properties of power laws are proven. They are
		  shown to characterize functions with the scale-free
		  property (also called self-similarity property) as well as
		  functions with the product property. Power laws have other
		  desirable properties that are not shared by exponential
		  laws, as we indicate in this paper. Specifically, Naranan
		  (1970) proves the validity of Lotka's law based on the
		  exponential growth of articles in journals and of the
		  number of journals. His argument is reproduced here and a
		  discrete-time argument is also given, yielding the same law
		  as that of Lotka. This argument makes it possible to
		  interpret the information production process as a
		  self-similar fractal and show the relation between Lotka's
		  exponent and the (self-similar) fractal dimension of the
		  system. Lotkaian informetric systems are self-similar
		  fractals, a fact revealed by Mandelbrot (1977) in relation
		  to nature, but is also true for random texts, which
		  exemplify a very special type of informetric system. ©

		  requires functions of a continuous variable j, replacing
		  the discrete variable n. Now j represents item densities
		  instead of number of items. The continuous Lotka power
		  function describes the density of sources with item density
		  j. The discrete Lotka function one obtains from data,
		  obtained empirically; the continuous Lotka function is the
		  one needed when one wants to apply Lotkaian informetrics,
		  i.e., to determine properties that can be derived from the
		  (continuous) model. It is, hence, important to know the
		  relations between the two models. We show that the
		  exponents of the discrete Lotka function (if not too high,
		  i.e., within limits encountered in practice) and of the
		  continuous Lotka function are approximately the same. This
		  is important to know in applying theoretical results (from

		  deploy, and evaluate inquiry learning capabilities for the
		  Alexandria Digital Library, an extant digital library of
		  primary sources in geography. We interviewed nine geography
		  faculty members who teach undergraduate courses about their
		  information seeking for research and teaching and their use
		  of information resources in teaching. These data were
		  supplemented by interviews with four faculty members from
		  another ADEPT study about the nature of knowledge in
		  geography. Among our key findings are that geography
		  faculty are more likely to encounter useful teaching
		  resources while seeking research resources than vice versa,
		  although the influence goes in both directions. Their
		  greatest information needs are for research data, maps, and
		  images. They desire better searching by concept or theme,
		  in addition to searching by location and place name. They
		  make extensive use of their own research resources in their
		  teaching. Among the implications for functionality and
		  architecture of geographic digital libraries for
		  educational use are that personal digital libraries are
		  essential, because individual faculty members have
		  personalized approaches to selecting, collecting, and
		  organizing teaching resources. Digital library services for
		  research and teaching should include the ability to import
		  content from common office software and to store content in
		  standard formats that can be exported to other
		  applications. Digital library services can facilitate
		  sharing among faculty but cannot overcome barriers such as
		  intellectual property rights, access to proprietary
		  research data, or the desire of individuals to maintain
		  control over their own resources. Faculty use of primary

		  are to design successful digital libraries for research and

  abstract	= {“Implicit knowledge” and “tacit knowledge” in
		  Knowledge Management (KM) are important, often synonymous,
		  terms. In KM they often refer to private or personal
		  knowledge that needs to be made public. The original
		  reference of “tacit knowledge” is to the work of the
		  late scientist and philosopher, Michael Polanyi (Polanyi,
		  1969), but there is substantial evidence that the KM
		  discourse has poorly understood Polanyi's term. Two
		  theoretical problems in Knowledge Management's notion of
		  “implicit knowledge,” which undermine empirical work in
		  this area, are examined. The first problem involves
		  understanding the term “knowledge” according to a
		  folk-psychology of mental representation to model
		  expression. The second is epistemological and social:
		  understanding Polanyi's term, tacit knowing as a
		  psychological concept instead of as an epistemological
		  problem, in general, and one of social epistemology and of
		  the epistemology of the sciences, in particular. Further,
		  exploring Polanyi's notion of tacit knowing in more detail
		  yields important insights into the role of knowledge in
		  science, including empirical work in information science.
		  This article has two parts: first, there is a discussion of
		  the folk-psychology model of representation and the need to
		  replace this with a more expressionist model. In the second
		  part, Polanyi's concept of tacit knowledge in relation to
		  the role of analogical thought in expertise is examined.
		  The works of philosophers, particularly Harr\'{e} and
		  Wittgenstein, are brought to bear on these problems.
		  Conceptual methods play several roles in information
		  science that cannot satisfactorily be performed empirically
		  at all or alone. Among these roles, such methods may
		  examine historical issues, they may critically engage
		  foundational assumptions, and they may deploy new concepts.
		  In this article the last two roles are examined. © 2005

		  in overwhelming volumes on the World Wide Web. How to
		  rapidly capture, utilize, and integrate the information on
		  the Internet to discover valuable biological knowledge is
		  one of the most critical issues in bioinformatics. Many
		  information integration systems have been proposed for
		  integrating biological data. These systems usually rely on
		  an intermediate software layer called wrappers to access
		  connected information sources. Wrapper construction for Web
		  data sources is often specially hand coded to accommodate
		  the differences between each Web site. However, programming
		  a Web wrapper requires substantial programming skill, and
		  is time-consuming and hard to maintain. In this article we
		  provide a solution for rapidly building software agents
		  that can serve as Web wrappers for biological information
		  integration. We define an XML-based language called Web
		  Navigation Description Language (WNDL), to model a
		  Web-browsing session. A WNDL script describes how to locate
		  the data, extract the data, and combine the data. By
		  executing different WNDL scripts, we can automate virtually
		  all types of Web-browsing sessions. We also describe IEPAD
		  (Information Extraction Based on Pattern Discovery), a data
		  extractor based on pattern discovery techniques. IEPAD
		  allows our software agents to automatically discover the
		  extraction rules to extract the contents of a structurally
		  formatted Web page. With a programming-by-example authoring
		  tool, a user can generate a complete Web wrapper agent by
		  browsing the target Web sites. We built a variety of
		  biological applications to demonstrate the feasibility of
		  our approach. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  to model that process. We found that each expert followed a

		  from which we developed a procedural model that describes
		  the process of conducting a functional analysis of a gene.

		  problems that are important in many contexts but, when

		  questions of digital identity matter and how we might
		  address and respond to some of them. We will begin by
		  examining the lines along which we draw a distinction
		  between the digital and the physical context and how, by

		  path that will be taken for a recovering addict to reach a

		  contribution is a semi-supervised learning algorithm that

		  is semi-supervised because it does not require precise
		  labeling of the exact location of features in the training
		  data. This significantly reduces the effort needed to
		  develop a training set. An active learning algorithm is
		  used to assist the semi-supervised learning algorithm to

		  examples are manually pruned during the active learning

		  languages, stored in different locations, and may be
		  seemingly unconnected. Crosslingual semantic
		  interoperability is a major challenge to generate an
		  overview of this disparate data and information so that it
		  can be analyzed, shared, searched, and summarized. The
		  recent terrorist attacks and the tragic events of September
		  11, 2001 have prompted increased attention on national
		  security and criminal analysis. Many Asian countries and
		  cities, such as Japan, Taiwan, and Singapore, have been
		  advised that they may become the next targets of terrorist
		  attacks. Semantic interoperability has been a focus in
		  digital library research. Traditional information retrieval
		  (IR) approaches normally require a document to share some
		  common keywords with the query. Generating the associations
		  for the related terms between the two term spaces of users
		  and documents is an important issue. The problem can be
		  viewed as the creation of a thesaurus. Apart from this,
		  terrorists and criminals may communicate through letters,
		  e-mails, and faxes in languages other than English. The
		  translation ambiguity significantly exacerbates the
		  retrieval problem. The problem is expanded to crosslingual
		  semantic interoperability. In this paper, we focus on the
		  English/Chinese crosslingual semantic interoperability
		  problem. However, the developed techniques are not limited
		  to English and Chinese languages but can be applied to many
		  other languages. English and Chinese are popular languages
		  in the Asian region. Much information about national
		  security or crime is communicated in these languages. An
		  efficient automatically generated thesaurus between these
		  languages is important to crosslingual information
		  retrieval between English and Chinese languages. To
		  facilitate crosslingual information retrieval, a
		  corpus-based approach uses the term co-occurrence
		  statistics in parallel or comparable corpora to construct a
		  statistical translation model to cross the language
		  boundary. In this paper, the text-based approach to align
		  English/Chinese Hong Kong Police press release documents
		  from the Web is first presented. We also introduce an
		  algorithmic approach to generate a robust knowledge base
		  based on statistical correlation analysis of the semantics
		  (knowledge) embedded in the bilingual press release corpus.

  abstract	= {In this paper we discuss the construction of information
		  systems ontologies. We summarize and discuss Barry Smith's
		  review (2003a) of the field in the paper, “Ontology.”
		  In that essay Smith concludes with a plea for ontologies
		  that reflect the categories of current scientific theories
		  because they represent our best knowledge of the world. In
		  this context, we develop an argument for a hermeneutic
		  approach to ontologies—one compatible with the
		  orientation introduced into information science by Winograd
		  and Flores (1986) and later developed by many others. To do
		  this, we argue that the literature in the philosophy and
		  history of science supports a hermeneutic interpretation of
		  the nature and growth of science. This, given Smith's
		  argument, shows the relevance of hermeneutics to the
		  creation of information system ontologies. The problems
		  associated with understanding and creating information
		  systems ontologies are addressed fruitfully only if one
		  begins by acknowledging that databases are mechanisms for
		  communication involving judgments and interpretations by
		  intelligent and knowledgeable users. The main contributions
		  of this paper are our conclusions that (a) information
		  system ontologies should take into consideration a
		  perspective of the philosophy and history of science, and
		  (b) hermeneutics as construed by Gadamer (1975, 1979)

		  Using the ADS usage logs along with membership statistics

		  organizations in general and arts organizations in
		  particular have been an understudied group. These managers
		  have much in common with their for-profit counterparts, but
		  their environment also differs in significant ways. The
		  goal of this exploratory research effort was to identify
		  how senior administrators in fine arts museums and symphony
		  orchestras go about identifying and acquiring the
		  information they want to complete a range of management
		  tasks. Deciding when and where to look for information,
		  obtaining the “right” information at the time it is
		  needed, evaluating its credibility and utility, and
		  determining when “enough” information has been
		  collected are challenges facing this group of information
		  users every day. A multiple-case studies design involving a
		  replication strategy was selected to structure the research
		  process. Data were collected from 12 arts administrators
		  using a pretested interview protocol that included the
		  Critical Incident Technique. Patterns in the data were
		  identified, and the data were further reviewed for
		  disconfirming evidence. The study resulted in a list of the
		  types and sources of information that arts administrators
		  use as well as a list of the factors or “stopping
		  criteria” that influence them to end their
		  information-seeking process. A model describing the way in
		  which arts administrators go about acquiring the
		  information they want was also developed. The main findings
		  of the study are (a) arts administrators do not consider
		  information seeking to be a discrete management task, (b)
		  they rely heavily on direct personal experience to fill
		  their information-seeking needs, and (c) they are
		  “satisficers” when it comes to seeking information.
		  Based on Simon's alternative to rational choice theory,
		  satisficers are people who are willing to pursue a “good
		  enough” option rather than the best possible option
		  (maximizers) (Simon, 1956). Since arts administrators have
		  not been studied in the context of LIS research before,
		  understanding more about where they go for information,
		  what factors influence the level of effort they are willing
		  to invest in seeking information, and how they decide when
		  they have “enough” information provides insights into
		  the information-seeking behavior of a new user group.
		  Furthermore, although this research effort is focused on
		  specific users in a specific field, the results from this
		  study may be compared to what we already know about other
		  user groups to confirm and expand existing models of
		  information-seeking behavior. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals,

  abstract	= {In this article a social constructionist approach to
		  information technology (IT) literacy is introduced. This
		  approach contributes to the literature on IT literacy by
		  introducing the concept of IT self as a description of the
		  momentary, context-dependent, and multilayered nature of
		  interpretations of IT competencies. In the research
		  literature, IT literacy is often defined as sets of basic
		  skills to be learned, and competencies to be demonstrated.
		  In line with this approach, research on IT competencies
		  conventionally develops models for explaining user
		  acceptance, and for measuring computer-related attitudes
		  and skills. The assumption is that computer-related
		  attitudes and self-efficacy impact IT adoption and success
		  in computer use. Computer self-efficacy measures are,
		  however, often based on self-assessments that measure
		  interpretations of skills rather than performance in
		  practice. An analysis of empirical interview data in which
		  academic researchers discuss their relationships with
		  computers and IT competence shows how a self-assessment
		  such as “computer anxiety” presented in one discussion
		  context can in another discussion context be consigned to
		  the past in favor of a different and more positive version.
		  Here it is argued that descriptions of IT competencies and
		  computer-related attitudes are dialogic social constructs
		  and closely tied with more general implicit understandings
		  of the nature of technical artifacts and technical
		  knowledge. These implicit theories and assumptions are
		  rarely taken under scrutiny in discussions of IT literacy
		  yet they have profound implications for the aims and
		  methods in teaching computer skills. © 2005 Wiley

  abstract	= {In this article, I analyze the role of Donald J. Urquhart
		  in the creation of modern library and information science.
		  Urquhart was one of the chief architects of information
		  science in Britain and founder of the National Lending
		  Library for Science and Technology (NLL), which evolved
		  into the present-day British Library Document Supply Centre
		  (BLDSC). In particular, I focus on the part played by
		  Urquhart in the development of that branch of information
		  science termed bibliometrics, the application of
		  mathematical and statistical techniques to information
		  phenomena, pursuing both historical and practical aims. The
		  article is intended not only to trace the history of the
		  probability distributions applicable to library use and
		  other facets of human knowledge but also to demonstrate how
		  these distributions can be used in the evaluation and
		  management of scientific journal collections. For these
		  purposes, the paper is divided into three parts of equal
		  importance. The first part is statistical and establishes
		  the theoretical framework, within which Urquhart's work is
		  considered. It traces the historical development of the
		  applicable probability distributions, discussing their
		  origins on the European continent and how Continental
		  principles became incorporated in the biometric statistics
		  that arose in Britain as a result of the Darwinian
		  revolution. This part analyzes the binomial and Poisson
		  processes, laying out the reasons why the Poisson process
		  is more suitable for modeling information phenomena. In
		  doing so, it describes key distributions arising from these
		  processes as well as the various tests for these
		  distributions, citing the literature that shows how to
		  conduct these tests. Throughout the discussion, the
		  relationship of these distributions to library use and the
		  laws of information science is emphasized. The second part
		  of the article analyzes the pioneering role of Urquhart as
		  a conduit for the entry of these probability distributions
		  into librarianship, converting it into library and
		  information science. He was the first librarian to apply
		  probability to library use, utilizing it not only to
		  establish and manage the scientific journal collections of
		  the NLL but also to evolve his Law of Supralibrary Use.
		  Urquhart's work is portrayed within the context of a
		  general trend to adopt probabilistic methods for analytical
		  purposes, and a major premise of this article is that his
		  law and the probabilistic breakthrough, on which it was
		  based, were most likely in Britain, which was one of the
		  few countries not only to develop but also maintain the
		  necessary scientific preconditions. The third—and
		  concluding section—discusses how Urquhart's Law forces a
		  probabilistic reconceptualization of the functioning of the
		  scientific journal system as well as the law's practical
		  implications for journal sales, collection evaluation and
		  management, resource sharing, and the transition from the
		  paper to the electronic format. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals,

		  computer security community has concentrated on improving
		  users' privacy by concealing their identity on the Web.
		  However, users may want or need to identify themselves over
		  the Net to receive certain services but still retain their
		  interests, needs, and intentions in private. PRAW—a
		  PRivAcy model for the Web suggested in this paper—is
		  aimed at hiding users' navigation tracks to prevent
		  eavesdroppers from inferring their profiles but still
		  allowing them to be identified. PRAW is based on continuous
		  generation of fake transactions in various fields of
		  interests to confuse eavesdroppers' automated programs,
		  thus providing them false data. A privacy measure is
		  defined that reflects the difference between users' actual
		  profile and the profile that eavesdroppers might infer. A
		  prototype system was developed to examine PRAW's
		  feasibility and conduct experiments to test its
		  effectiveness. Encouraging results and their analysis are
		  presented, as well as possible attacks and known
		  limitations. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  System (Kurtz et al., 2005) permit the easy accumulation of
		  a new type of bibliometric measure, the number of
		  electronic accesses (“reads”) of individual articles.
		  We explore various aspects of this new measure. We examine
		  the obsolescence function as measured by actual reads and
		  show that it can be well fit by the sum of four
		  exponentials with very different time constants. We compare
		  the obsolescence function as measured by readership with
		  the obsolescence function as measured by citations. We find
		  that the citation function is proportional to the sum of
		  two of the components of the readership function. This
		  proves that the normative theory of citation is true in the
		  mean. We further examine in detail the similarities and
		  differences among the citation rate, the readership rate,
		  and the total citations for individual articles, and
		  discuss some of the causes. Using the number of reads as a
		  bibliometric measure for individuals, we introduce the
		  read–cite diagram to provide a two-dimensional view of an
		  individual's scientific productivity. We develop a simple
		  model to account for an individual's reads and cites and
		  use it to show that the position of a person in the
		  read–cite diagram is a function of age, innate
		  productivity, and work history. We show the age biases of
		  both reads and cites and develop two new bibliometric
		  measures which have substantially less age bias than
		  citations: SumProd, a weighted sum of total citations and
		  the readership rate, intended to show the total
		  productivity of an individual; and Read10, the readership
		  rate for articles published in the last 10 years, intended
		  to show an individual's current productivity. We also
		  discuss the effect of normalization (dividing by the number

		  known how scientists and scholars actually include new
		  types of information sources, available through the new
		  media, in their published work. This article reports on a
		  comparative study of the lists of references in 38
		  scientific journals in five different scientific and social
		  scientific fields. The fields are sociology, library and
		  information science, biochemistry and biotechnology,
		  neuroscience, and the mathematics of computing. As is well
		  known, references, citations, and hyperlinks play different
		  roles in academic publishing and communication. Our study
		  focuses on hyperlinks as attributes of references in formal
		  scholarly publications. The study developed and applied a
		  method to analyze the differential roles of publishing
		  media in the analysis of scientific and scholarly
		  literature references. The present secondary databases that
		  include reference and citation data (the Web of Science)
		  cannot be used for this type of research. By the automated
		  processing and analysis of the full text of scientific and
		  scholarly articles, we were able to extract the references
		  and hyperlinks contained in these references in relation to
		  other features of the scientific and scholarly literature.
		  Our findings show that hyperlinking references are indeed,
		  as expected, abundantly present in the formal literature.
		  They also tend to cite more recent literature than the
		  average reference. The large majority of the references are
		  to Web instances of traditional scientific journals. Other
		  types of Web-based information sources are less well
		  represented in the lists of references, except in the case
		  of pure e-journals. We conclude that this can be explained
		  by taking the role of the publisher into account. Indeed,
		  it seems that the shift from print-based to electronic
		  publishing has created new roles for the publisher. By
		  shaping the way scientific references are hyperlinking to
		  other information sources, the publisher may have a large
		  impact on the availability of scientific and scholarly

  abstract	= {Automatic generation of play lists for commercial
		  broadcast radio stations has become a major research topic.
		  Audio identification systems have been around for a while,
		  and they show good performance for clean audio files.
		  However, songs transmitted by commercial radio stations are
		  highly distorted to cause greater impact on the casual
		  listener. This impact helps increase the probability that
		  the listener will stay tuned in, but the price we have to
		  pay is a severe modification in the audio itself. This
		  causes the failure of traditional identification systems.
		  Another problem is the fact that songs are never played
		  from the beginning to the end. Actually, they are put on
		  the air several seconds after their real beginning and
		  almost always under the voice of a speaker. The same thing
		  happens at the end. In this article, we present the RAA
		  project, which was conceived to deal with real broadcast
		  audio problems. The idea behind this project is to extract
		  automatically an audio fingerprint (the so-called AudioDNA)
		  that identifies the fragment of audio. This AudioDNA has to
		  be robust enough to appear almost the same under several
		  degrees of distortion. Once this AudioDNA is extracted from
		  the broadcast audio, a matching algorithm is able to find
		  its fragments inside a database. With this approach, the
		  system can find not only a whole song but also small
		  fragments of it, even with high distortion caused by
		  broadcast (and DJ) manipulations.},

		  free-text search capabilities, three levels of retrieval
		  strategies are employed. Moreover, the introduction of a
		  hierarchy of input modalities assures meeting the needs and
		  matching the expertise of a wide group of users. Singing,

		  used in the discovery of data dependencies; it evaluates
		  the importance of attributes, discovers the patterns of
		  data, reduces all redundant objects and attributes, and
		  seeks the minimum subset of attributes. Moreover, it is
		  being used for the extraction of rules from databases. In
		  this paper, we present a rough set approach to attribute
		  reduction and generation of classification rules from a set
		  of medical datasets. For this purpose, we first introduce a
		  rough set reduction technique to find all reducts of the
		  data that contain the minimal subset of attributes
		  associated with a class label for classification. To
		  evaluate the validity of the rules based on the
		  approximation quality of the attributes, we introduce a
		  statistical test to evaluate the significance of the rules.
		  Experimental results from applying the rough set approach
		  to the set of data samples are given and evaluated. In
		  addition, the rough set classification accuracy is also
		  compared to the well-known ID3 classifier algorithm. The
		  study showed that the theory of rough sets is a useful tool

		  very large document collections, especially when
		  query-based retrieval is the only means of exploration. We
		  propose system-mediated information access as a solution
		  for users' well-documented inability to formulate good
		  queries. Our approach is based on two main assumptions:
		  first, on the ability of document clustering to reveal the
		  topical, semantic structure of a problem domain represented
		  by a specialized "source collection," and, second, on the
		  capacity of statistical language models to convey content.
		  Taking the role of the human mediator or intermediary
		  searcher, a mediation system interacts with the user and
		  supports her exploration of a relatively small source
		  collection, chosen to be representative for the problem
		  domain. Based on the user's selection of relevant
		  "exemplary" documents and clusters from this source
		  collection, the system builds a language model of her
		  information need. This model is subsequently used to derive
		  "mediated queries," which are expected to convey precisely
		  and comprehensively the user's information need, and can be
		  submitted by the user to search any large and heterogeneous
		  "target collections." We present results of experiments
		  that simulated various mediation strategies and compared
		  the effect on mediation effectiveness of a variety of
		  parameters, such as the similarity measure, the weighting
		  scheme, and the clustering method. They provide both
		  upperbounds of performance that can potentially be reached
		  by real end users and a comparison between the
		  effectiveness of these strategies. The experimental
		  evidence suggests that information retrieval mediated
		  through a clustered specialized collection has potential to
		  improve effectiveness significantly.},

		  population has created a need for better searching and

		  However, existing search engines may not serve the needs of
		  many non-English-speaking Internet users. In this paper, we
		  propose a generic and integrated approach to searching and
		  browsing the Internet in a multilingual world. Based on
		  this approach, we have developed the Chinese Business
		  Intelligence Portal (CBiz-Port), a meta-search engine that
		  searches for business information of mainland China,
		  Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Additional functions provided by
		  CBizPort include encoding conversion (between Simplified
		  Chinese and Traditional Chinese), summarization, and
		  categorization. Experimental results of our user evaluation
		  study show that the searching and browsing performance of
		  CBiz-Port was comparable to that of regional Chinese search
		  engines, and CBizPort could significantly augment these
		  search engines. Subjects' verbal comments indicate that
		  CBizPort performed best in terms of analysis functions,
		  cross-regional searching, and user-friendliness, whereas
		  regional search engines were more efficient and more
		  popular. Subjects especially liked CBizPort's summarizer
		  and categorizer, which helped in understanding search
		  results. These encouraging results suggest a promising

  abstract	= {The essential characteristic of knowledge workers is that
		  they use information to produce information subsequently.
		  Hence, information seeking is a knowledge worker's central
		  aspect of work life. In a corporate research laboratory
		  environment, this is even more pronounced because the
		  results produced are often in the form of more information,
		  such as publications, tech reports, patent applications, or
		  the embodiment of these into prototypes. The practices and
		  expectations regarding information seeking and
		  collaboration are fundamental to productive research in a
		  corporate setting. To this end, a survey research project
		  sampled researchers from selected labs of Hewlett Packard
		  and Compaq Computer shortly after their merger. This survey
		  examined researchers' usage of information sources, their
		  preferred means of information seeking, and the types of
		  information assets they produced. Findings indicated that
		  participants relied heavily on the Internet and other
		  Web-based resources, more so than on their colleagues
		  inside the company. Participants chose which information
		  resources to use based on the time it took them to track
		  down the information as well as the authoritativeness of
		  the sources. Most information assets were generated
		  collaboratively by teams rather then by individuals.
		  Findings suggested that behavior was affected by the
		  unstable environment resulting from the merger and the
		  process of integrating the two research organizations.},

		  Immigrants have substantial information and practical needs

		  (QBPL). From our interviews and observation of 45 program

		  applied to a number of information retrieval tasks such as
		  to formalize the probabilistic model, to design practical
		  retrieval systems, to cluster documents, and to model
		  texture in image retrieval. In this report, the concept of
		  entropy is used for a different purpose. It is shown that
		  any positive Retrieval Status Value (RSV)-based retrieval
		  system may be conceived as a special probability space in
		  which the amount of the associated Shannon information is
		  being reduced; in this view, the retrieval system is
		  referred to as Uncertainty Decreasing Operation (UDO). The
		  concept of UDO is then proposed as a theoretical background
		  for term and query discrimination power, and it is applied
		  to the computation of term and query discrimination values
		  in the vector space retrieval model. Experimental evidence
		  is given as regards such computation; the results obtained
		  compare well to those obtained using vector-based
		  calculation of term discrimination values. The UDO-based
		  computation, however, presents advantages over the
		  vector-based calculation: It is faster, easier to assess
		  and handle in practice, and its application is not
		  restricted to the vector space model. Based on the ADI test
		  collection, it is shown that the UDO-based Term
		  Discrimination Value (TDV) weighting scheme yields better
		  retrieval effectiveness than using the vector-based TDV
		  weighting scheme. Also, experimental evidence is given to
		  the intuition that the choice of an appropriate weighting
		  scheme and similarity measure depends on collection
		  properties, and thus the UDO approach may be used as a
		  theoretical basis for this intuition. © 2005 Wiley

		  alleviates the difficulties associated with query

		  high-level way of browsing through information: instead of
		  browsing through document contents or document surrogates,
		  the user browses through a graphical representation of the
		  documents and their relations to the domain. The approach
		  requires other cognitive skills from the user than what is
		  currently required. Yet, a user evaluation in which the
		  metabrowsing system was compared with an ordinary
		  query-oriented system showed only some small indicatory
		  differences in effectiveness, efficiency, and user
		  satisfaction. We expect that more experience with
		  metabrowsing will result in a significantly better

		  of 22,144 documents dealing with Aspirin and published in
		  journals covered by MEDLINE during the years 1965-2001 are
		  studied. The research profile of Aspirin over the 37-year
		  period is analyzed through Aspirin subheadings and MeSH
		  indexing terms. Half of the documents had Aspirin as a
		  major indexing term, being the main aspects studied
		  therapeutic uses (28% of the documents), pharmacodynamics
		  (26%), adverse effects (18%), and administration and dosage
		  (10%). A frequency data table crossing indexing terms
		  \texttimes{} years is examined by correspondence analysis
		  to obtain time trends, which are shown graphically in a
		  map. Four time periods with a different distribution of
		  indexing terms are identified through cluster analysis. The
		  indexing term profile of every period is obtained by
		  comparison of the distribution of indexing terms of each
		  cluster with that of the whole period by means of the Chi-2
		  test. The research profile of the drug tends to change
		  faster with time. The most relevant finding is the
		  expanding therapeutic profile of Aspirin over the period.
		  The main advantages and limitations of the methodology are

  abstract	= {We have created a system for music search and retrieval. A
		  user sings a theme from the desired piece of music. The
		  sung theme (query) is converted into a sequence of
		  pitch-intervals and rhythms. This sequence is compared to
		  musical themes (targets) stored in a data-base. The top
		  pieces are returned to the user in order of similarity to
		  the sung theme. We describe, in detail, two different
		  approaches to measuring similarity between database themes
		  and the sung query. In the first, queries are compared to
		  database themes using standard string-alignment algorithms.
		  Here, similarity between target and query is determined by
		  edit cost. In the second approach, pieces in the database
		  are represented as hidden Markov models (HMMs). In this
		  approach, the query is treated as an observation sequence
		  and a target is judged similar to the query if its HMM has
		  a high likelihood of generating the query. In this article
		  we report our approach to the construction of a target
		  database of themes, encoding, and transcription of user
		  queries, and the results of preliminary experimentation
		  with a set of sung queries. Our experiments show that while
		  no approach is clearly superior to the other system, string
		  matching has a slight advantage. Moreover, neither approach

  abstract	= {This paper offers a new, nonlinear model of
		  information-seeking behavior, which contrasts with earlier
		  stage models of information behavior and represents a
		  potential cornerstone for a shift toward a new perspective
		  for understanding user information behavior. The model is
		  based on the findings of a study on interdisciplinary
		  information-seeking behavior. The study followed a
		  naturalistic inquiry approach using interviews of 45
		  academics. The interview results were inductively analyzed
		  and an alternative framework for understanding
		  information-seeking behavior was developed. This model
		  illustrates three core processes and three levels of
		  contextual interaction, each composed of several individual
		  activities and attributes. These interact dynamically
		  through time in a nonlinear manner. The behavioral patterns
		  are analogous to an artist's palette, in which activities
		  remain available throughout the course of
		  information-seeking. In viewing the processes in this way,
		  neither start nor finish points are fixed, and each process
		  may be repeated or lead to any other until either the query
		  or context determine that information-seeking can end. The
		  interactivity and shifts described by the model show
		  information-seeking to be nonlinear, dynamic, holistic, and
		  flowing. The paper offers four main implications of the
		  model as it applies to existing theory and models,
		  requirements for future research, and the development of
		  information literacy curricula. Central to these
		  implications is the creation of a new nonlinear perspective
		  from which user information-seeking can be interpreted.},

		  the consensus being that the citers and citees often have

		  this belief has been rather meager, however, in part
		  because social networks researchers have lacked
		  bibliometric data (e.g., pairwise citation counts from
		  online databases), and citation analysts have lacked
		  sociometric data (e.g., pairwise measures of
		  acquaintanceship). In 1997 Nazer extensively measured
		  personal relationships and communication behaviors in what
		  we call "Globenet," an international group of 16
		  researchers from seven disciplines that was established in
		  1993 to study human development. Since Globenet's
		  membership is known, it was possible during 2002 to obtain
		  citation records for all members in databases of the
		  Institute for Scientific Information. This permitted
		  examination of how members cited each other (intercited) in
		  journal articles over the past three decades and in a 1999
		  book to which they all contributed. It was also possible to
		  explore links between the intercitation data and the social
		  and communication data. Using network-analytic techniques,
		  we look at the growth of intercitation over time, the
		  extent to which it follows disciplinary or
		  inter-disciplinary lines, whether it covaries with degrees
		  of acquaintanceship, whether it reflects Globenet's
		  organizational structure, whether it is associated with
		  particular in-group communication patterns, and whether it
		  is related to the cocitation of Globenet members. Results
		  show cocitation to be a powerful predictor of intercitation
		  in the journal articles, while being an editor or co-author
		  is an important predictor in the book. Intellectualties
		  based on shared content did better as predictors than
		  content-neutral socialties like friendship. However,

		  to many audiences, including the scholars who use them and
		  Web educators who need to identify best practice. Several
		  large-scale European Union research projects have been
		  funded to build new indicators for online scientific
		  activity, reflecting recognition of the importance of the
		  Web for scholarly communication. In this paper we address
		  the key question of whether higher rated scholars produce
		  higher impact Web sites, using the United Kingdom as a case
		  study and measuring scholars' quality in terms of
		  university-wide average research ratings. Methodological
		  issues concerning the measurement of the online impact are
		  discussed, leading to the adoption of counts of links to a
		  university's constituent single domain Web sites from an
		  aggregated counting metric. The findings suggest that
		  universities with higher rated scholars produce
		  significantly more Web content but with a similar average
		  online impact. Higher rated scholars therefore attract more
		  total links from their peers, but only by being more
		  prolific, refuting earlier suggestions. It can be surmised
		  that general Web publications are very different from
		  scholarly journal articles and conference papers, for which
		  scholarly quality does associate with citation impact. This
		  has important implications for the construction of new Web
		  indicators, for example that online impact should not be
		  used to assess the quality of small groups of scholars,
		  even within a single discipline.},

  abstract	= {In May 1999, National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director
		  Harold Varmus proposed an electronic repository for
		  biomedical research literature server called "E-biomed."
		  E-biomed reflected the visions of scholarly electronic
		  publishing advocates: It would be fully searchable, be free
		  to readers, and contain full-text versions of both preprint
		  and postpublication biomedical research articles. However,
		  within 4 months, the E-biomed proposal was radically
		  transformed: The preprint section was eliminated, delays
		  were instituted between article publication and posting to
		  the archive, and the name was changed to "PubMed Central."
		  This case study examines the remarkable transformation of
		  the E-biomed proposal to PubMed Central by analyzing
		  comments about the proposal that were posted to an online
		  E-biomed forum created by the NIH, and discussions that
		  took place in other face-to-face forums where E-biomed
		  deliberations took place. We find that the transformation
		  of the E-biomed proposal into PubMed Central was the result
		  of highly visible and highly influential position
		  statements made by scientific societies against the
		  proposal. The literature about scholarly electronic
		  publishing usually emphasizes a binary conflict between
		  (trade) publishers and scholars/scientists. We conclude
		  that: (1)scientific societies and the individual scientists
		  they represent do not always have identical interests in
		  regard to scientific e-publishing; (2) stakeholder politics
		  and personal interests reign supreme in e-publishing
		  debates, even in a supposedly status-free online forum; and
		  (3) multiple communication forums must be considered in

		  (domain-expert-specified metadata for information

		  (captured as user profiles that indicate users' preferences
		  about experts as well as users' knowledge about
		  topics).Expert advice, the heart of the Web information
		  space model, is specified using topics and relationships
		  among topics (called metalinks), along the lines of the
		  recently proposed topic maps. Topics and metalinks
		  constitute metadata that describe the contents of the
		  underlying HTML/XML Web resources. The metadata
		  specification process is semiautomated, and it exploits XML
		  DTDs (Document Type Definition) to allow domain-expert
		  guided mapping of DTD elements to topics and metalinks. The
		  expert advice is stored in an object-relational database
		  management system (DBMS).To demonstrate the practicality

		  we created a prototype expert advice repository of more
		  than one million topics/metalinks for DBLP (Database and

		  graduate students enrolled in several sections of an

		  Structural equation modeling techniques supported the AEM
		  model. In particular, library anxiety and research
		  achievement were reciprocally related. Furthermore, library
		  anxiety mediated the relationship between research
		  performance and the following variables: age, grade point
		  average, learning style, academic procrastination, and
		  self-perception. The path analysis also revealed a direct,
		  positive path from self-perception to research performance.
		  In addition, self-perception moderated the relationship

		  from a predefined set of such codes to the answer given in
		  response to an open-ended question in a questionnaire (aka
		  survey). This task is usually carried out to group
		  respondents according to a predefined scheme based on their
		  answers. Survey coding has several applications, especially
		  in the social sciences, ranging from the simple
		  classification of respondents to the extraction of
		  statistics on political opinions, health and lifestyle
		  habits, customer satisfaction, brand fidelity, and patient
		  satisfaction. Survey coding is a difficult task, because
		  the code that should be attributed to a respondent based on
		  the answer she has given is a matter of subjective
		  judgment, and thus requires expertise. It is thus
		  unsurprising that this task has traditionally been
		  performed manually, by trained coders. Some attempts have
		  been made at automating this task, most of them based on
		  detecting the similarity between the answer and textual
		  descriptions of the meanings of the candidate codes. We
		  take a radically new stand, and formulate the problem of
		  automated survey coding as a text categorization problem,
		  that is, as the problem of learning, by means of supervised
		  machine learning techniques, a model of the association
		  between answers and codes from a training set of precoded
		  answers, and applying the resulting model to the
		  classification of new answers. In this article we
		  experiment with two different learning techniques: one
		  based on naive Bayesian classification, and the other one
		  based on multiclass support vector machines, and test the
		  resulting framework on a corpus of social surveys. The
		  results we have obtained significantly outperform the
		  results achieved by previous automated survey coding

		  also made relevance judgements of retrieved items in
		  relation to his/her own information need and participated

		  because it fails two tests of stability of measurement. The
		  instabilities arise when rs are recalculated after a first
		  coherent group of authors has been augmented by a second
		  coherent group with whom the first has little or no
		  cocitation. However, AJ&amp;R neither cluster nor map,
		  their data to demonstrate how fluctuations in rs will
		  mislead the analyst, and the problem they pose is remote
		  from both theory and practice in traditional ACA. By
		  entering their own rs into multidimensional scaling and
		  clustering routines, I show that, despite r's fluctuations,
		  clusters based on it are much the same for the combined
		  groups as for the separate groups. The combined groups when
		  mapped appear as polarized clumps of points in
		  two-dimensional space, confirming that differences between
		  the groups have become much more important than differences
		  within the groups--an accurate portrayal of what has
		  happened to the data. Moreover, r produces clusters and
		  maps very like those based on other coefficients that
		  AJ&amp;R mention as possible replacements, such as a cosine
		  similarity measure or a chi square dissimilarity measure.
		  Thus, r performs well enough for the purposes of ACA.
		  Accordingly, I argue that qualitative information revealing
		  why authors are cocited is more important than the cautions
		  proposed in the AJ&amp;R critique. I include notes on
		  topics such as handling the diagonal in author cocitation
		  matrices, lognormalizing data, and testing r for

		  intermediaries' elicitation utterances through three
		  dimensions--linguistic forms, utterance purposes, and
		  communicative functions--to determine whether indeed any
		  dimension appeared consistently, to be called "elicitation
		  styles." Five intermediaries from four academic libraries
		  (three national university libraries, one private
		  university library) and one research institute library
		  participated in the study. Thirty patrons with 30 genuine
		  search requests were recruited; thus, 30
		  patron/intermediary information retrieval interactions
		  making a total of 30 encounters were collected. Video/audio
		  data were taped. Dialogues between patron and intermediary
		  were transcribed. Statistical analysis revealed three types
		  of elicitation styles among the five intermediaries,
		  labeled, (1) situationally oriented, (2) functionally
		  oriented, and (3) stereotyped. This study seeks an
		  explanation for different elicitation styles. Qualitative
		  analysis was applied to investigate "inquiring minds." An
		  inquiring mind is termed to represent a mentality or
		  tendency that one elicits certain threads of questions
		  influenced by professional beliefs, individual
		  characteristics, tasks, goals, and interactional contexts
		  in conversation. The results of qualitative analysis
		  specified three modes of inquiring minds of the

		  (2) query formulation process, and (3) database

		  providing automated information services, such as
		  information classification, by means of a society of
		  collaborative agents. These agents augment each other's
		  knowledge structures (e.g., the vocabularies) and assist
		  each other in providing efficient information services to a
		  human user. However, when the number of agents present in
		  the society increases, exhaustive communication and
		  collaboration among agents result in a large communication
		  overhead and increased delays in response time. This paper
		  introduces a method to achieve selective interaction with a
		  relatively small number of potentially useful agents, based
		  on simple agent modeling and acquaintance lists. The key
		  idea presented here is that the acquaintance list of an
		  agent, representing a small number of other agents to be
		  collaborated with, is dynamically adjusted. The best
		  acquaintances are automatically discovered using a learning
		  algorithm, based on the past history of collaboration.
		  Experimental results are presented to demonstrate that such
		  dynamically learned acquaintance lists can lead to high
		  quality of classification, while significantly reducing the
		  delay in response time.},

		  research, which is dominated by complex problems, rapidly

		  highly specialized areas of expertise. An individual
		  scientist can seldom provide all of the expertise and
		  resources necessary to address complex research problems.
		  This paper describes collaboration among a group of
		  scientists, and considers how their experiences are
		  socially shaped. The scientists were members of a newly
		  formed distributed, multi-disciplinary academic research
		  center that was organized into four multi-disciplinary
		  research groups. Each group had 14 to 34 members, including
		  faculty, postdoctoral fellows and students, at four
		  geographically dispersed universities. To investigate
		  challenges that emerge in establishing scientific
		  collaboration, data were collected about members' previous
		  and current collaborative experiences, perceptions
		  regarding collaboration, and work practices during the
		  center's first year of operation. The data for the study
		  includes interviews with members of the center,
		  observations of videoconferences and meetings, and a
		  center-wide sociometric survey. Data analysis has led to
		  the development of a framework that identifies forms of
		  collaboration that emerged among scientists (e.g.,
		  complementary and integrative collaboration) and associated
		  factors, which influenced collaboration including personal
		  compatibility, work connections, incentives, and
		  infrastructure. These results may inform the specification
		  of social and organizational practices, which are needed to
		  establish collaboration in distributed, multi-disciplinary

		  processing (OLAP) offers a single subject-oriented source
		  for analyzing summary data based on various dimensions. We
		  demonstrate that the OLAP approach gives a promising
		  starting point for advanced analysis and comparison among
		  summary data in informetrics applications. At the moment
		  there is no single precise, commonly accepted

		  This is because the requirements of applications vary
		  considerably. We develop a conceptual/logical
		  multidimensional model for supporting the complex and

		  considered with respect of some dimensions. By changing
		  dimensions the user may construct other views on the same
		  summary data. We develop a multidimensional query language
		  whose basic idea is to support the definition of views in a
		  way, which is natural and intuitive for lay users in the
		  informetrics area. We show that this view-oriented query
		  language has a great expressive power and its degree of
		  declarativity is greater than in contemporary
		  operation-oriented or SQL (Structured Query Language)-like

		  were not found to a new form of publication, but rather a

		  to continue to advance, scientists unequivocally agreed

		  relevance concept, especially in regard to the

		  not just refer to the various relevance criteria users may
		  apply in the process of judging relevance of retrieved

		  concept. Thus, the objective of this article is to present
		  an overview of the many different views and ways by which
		  the concept of relevance is used--leading to a consistent
		  and compatible understanding of the concept. In addition,
		  special attention is paid to the type of situational
		  relevance. Many researchers perceive situational relevance
		  as the most realistic type of user relevance, and therefore
		  situational relevance is discussed with reference to its

		  radio/television news. The research was designed as an

		  By advancing the understanding of how information source
		  preferences can be identified empirically and their

		  classified together regardless of their technological
		  format; (b) The subjective importance principle, proposing
		  that the subjective importance of information should
		  determine its degree of visual salience and accessibility;

		  information should be retrieved and viewed by the user in
		  the same context in which it was previously used. We claim

		  wide range of information-seeking strategies in a single
		  system. This article describes the results of a study to

		  the legitimate users and in some cases render the target
		  systems inoperable and/or the target networks inaccessible.
		  DoS attacks have now become a serious and common security
		  threat to the Internet community. Public Key Infrastructure
		  (PKI) has long been incorporated in various authentication
		  protocols to facilitate verifying the identities of the
		  communicating parties. The use of PKI has, however, an
		  inherent problem as it involves expensive computational
		  operations such as modular exponentiation. An improper
		  deployment of the public-key operations in a protocol could
		  create an opportunity for DoS attackers to exhaust the
		  server's resources. This paper presents a public-key based
		  authentication and key establishment protocol coupled with
		  a sophisticated client puzzle, which together provide a
		  versatile solution for possible DoS attacks and various
		  other common attacks during an authentication process.
		  Besides authentication, the protocol also supports a joint
		  establishment of a session key by both the client and the
		  server, which protects the session communications after the
		  mutual authentication. The proposed protocol has been
		  validated using a formal logic theory and has been shown,
		  through security analysis, to be able to resist, besides

  abstract	= {A search for information can be viewed as a series of
		  decisions made by the searcher. Two dimensions of the
		  search environment affect a user's decisions: the user's
		  knowledge, and the configuration of the information
		  retrieval system. Drawing on previous findings on users'
		  lack of search or domain knowledge, this article
		  investigates what the user needs to know to make informed
		  search decisions at the United States Bureau of Labor
		  Statistics (BLS) Web site, which provides statistical
		  information on labor and related topics. Its extensive Web
		  site is a rich collection of statistical information,
		  ranging from individual statistics such as the current
		  Consumer Price Index (CPI), to a large statistical database
		  called LABSTAT that can be queried to construct a table or
		  time series on the fly. Two models of the search
		  environment and the query process in LABSTAT are presented.
		  They provide complementary views of the decision points at
		  which help may be needed, and also suggest useful help
		  content. Extensive examples based on the industry concept
		  illustrate how the information could assist users' search
		  decisions. The article concludes with a discussion of the
		  role of help facilities in Web searching, and the
		  interesting question of how to initiate the provision of
		  help.},

  abstract	= {Subject classifications and thesauri have become more
		  important than ever in the Web environment. Efforts made to
		  organize information into subject classifications, or
		  taxonomies, offer users the opportunity to substantially
		  improve the effectiveness of their search and retrieval
		  activities. This article continues earlier research on the
		  development of a new definition of the field of information
		  science and the creation of a "map" of the field showing
		  subjects central to it and their relationships to those on
		  the periphery. A case study describes the creation of a new
		  classification structure (taxonomy) for the Information
		  Science Abstracts (ISA) database, aiming to reflect and
		  accommodate the rapid and continued technological and
		  market changes affecting the information industry today and
		  into the future. Based on a sample of some 3,000 ISA
		  abstracts, two validation experiments were conducted by a
		  three-member team comprising a database editor, a reference
		  librarian, and an abstractor-indexer, who represent three
		  of the major communities within the information science
		  field. In the first experiment, the sample of abstracts was
		  classified according to the proposed new taxonomy; after
		  analysis of the data and revision of the taxonomy, it was
		  revalidated and fine tuned in a second experiment. Indexer
		  consistency measures obtained in this study were
		  significantly higher than those found in previous studies.
		  The taxonomy resulting from this research employs the
		  concepts, definition, and map of information science
		  previously developed. It presents them in an organized
		  hierarchical view of the field and thus makes a significant
		  contribution to information science.},

  abstract	= {As the demand for global information increases
		  significantly, multilingual corpora has become a valuable
		  linguistic resource for applications to cross-lingual
		  information retrieval and natural language processing. In
		  order to cross the boundaries that exist between different
		  languages, dictionaries are the most typical tools.
		  However, the general-purpose dictionary is less sensitive
		  in both genre and domain. It is also impractical to
		  manually construct tailored bilingual dictionaries or
		  sophisticated multilingual thesauri for large applications.
		  Corpus-based approaches, which do not have the limitation
		  of dictionaries, provide a statistical translation model
		  with which to cross the language boundary. There are many
		  domain-specific parallel or comparable corpora that are
		  employed in machine translation and cross-lingual
		  information retrieval. Most of these are corpora between
		  Indo-European languages, such as English/French and
		  English/Spanish. The Asian/Indo-European corpus, especially
		  English/Chinese corpus, is relatively sparse. The objective
		  of the present research is to construct English/ Chinese
		  parallel corpus automatically from the World Wide Web. In
		  this paper, an alignment method is presented which is based
		  on dynamic programming to identify the one-to-one Chinese
		  and English title pairs. The method includes alignment at
		  title level, word level and character level. The longest
		  common subsequence (LCS) is applied to find the most
		  reliable Chinese translation of an English word. As one
		  word for a language may translate into two or more words
		  repetitively in another language, the edit operation,
		  deletion, is used to resolve redundancy. A score function
		  is then proposed to determine the optimal title pairs.
		  Experiments have been conducted to investigate the
		  performance of the proposed method using the daily press
		  release articles by the Hong Kong SAR government as the
		  test bed. The precision of the result is 0.998 while the
		  recall is 0.806. The release articles and speech articles,
		  published by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation
		  Limited, are also used to test our method, the precision is
		  1.00, and the recall is 0.948.},

		  , July 9, 1999, http://www.computereconomics.

		  English speakers verses a 150% growth among non-English
		  speakers for the next five years. By 2005, 57% of Internet
		  users will be non-English speakers. A report by CNN.com in

		  been increased from 8.9 million to 16.9 million from
		  January to June in 2000 ("Report: China Internet users
		  double to 17 million," CNN.com, July, 2000,
		  http://cnn.org/2000/TECH/computing/07/27/
		  china.internet.reut/index.html). According to Nielsen/
		  NetRatings, there was a dramatic leap from 22.5 millions to
		  56.6 millions Internet users from 2001 to 2002. China had
		  become the second largest global at-home Internet

		  com/big_picture/geographics/article/0,,5911_1013841,00.
		  html). All of the evidences reveal the importance of
		  crosslingual research to satisfy the needs in the near
		  future.Digital library research has been focusing in
		  structural and semantic interoperability in the past.
		  Searching and retrieving objects across variations in
		  protocols, formats and disciplines are widely explored
		  (Schatz, B., &amp; Chen, H. (1999). Digital libraries:
		  technological advances and social impacts. IEEE Computer,
		  Special Issue on Digital Libraries, February, 32(2),
		  45-50.; Chen, H., Yen, J., &amp; Yang, C.C. (1999).
		  International activities: development of Asian digital
		  libraries. IEEE Computer, Special Issue on Digital
		  Libraries, 32(2), 48-49.). However, research in crossing
		  language boundaries, especially across European languages
		  and Oriental languages, is still in the initial stage. In
		  this proposal, we put our focus on cross-lingual semantic
		  interoperability by developing automatic generation of a
		  cross-lingual thesaurus based on English/Chinese parallel
		  corpus. When the searchers encounter retrieval problems,
		  professional librarians usually consult the thesaurus to
		  identify other relevant vocabularies. In the problem of
		  searching across language boundaries, a cross-lingual
		  thesaurus, which is generated by co-occurrence analysis and
		  Hopfield network, can be used to generate additional
		  semantically relevant terms that cannot be obtained from
		  dictionary. In particular, the automatically generated
		  cross-lingual thesaurus is able to capture the unknown
		  words that do not exist in a dictionary, such as names of
		  persons, organizations, and events. Due to Hong Kong's
		  unique history background, both English and Chinese are
		  used as official languagesl in all legal documents.
		  Therefore, English/Chinese cross-lingual information
		  retrieval is critical for applications in courts and the
		  government. In this paper, we develop an automatic
		  thesaurus by the Hopfield network based on a parallel
		  corpus collected from the Web site of the Department of
		  Justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
		  (HKSAR) Government. Experirnents are conducted to measure
		  the precision and recall of the automatic generated
		  English/Chinese thesaurus. The result shows that such
		  thesaurus is a promising tool to retrieve relevant terms,
		  especially in the language that is not the same as the
		  input term. The direct translation of the input term can
		  also be retrieved in most of the cases.},

		  fuzzy representation by human users is a criterion in
		  designing a fuzzy system, the simple fuzzy partition method
		  is preferable. In this method, each attribute is
		  partitioned by its various fuzzy sets with pre-specified
		  membership functions. The advantage of the simple fuzzy
		  partition method is that the linguistic interpretation of
		  each fuzzy set is easily obtained. The main aim of this
		  paper is exactly to propose a fuzzy data mining technique
		  to discover fuzzy sequential patterns by using the simple
		  partition method. Two numerical examples are utilized to
		  demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method.},

		  by the sources (e.g., journals producing articles, authors

		  called a type (e.g., a word), and an item a token (e.g.,
		  the use of words in texts). In informetrics, types that
		  occur often, for example, in a database will also be

		  scientists studying stateless nations should include four
		  additional features besides those identified by Ellis.
		  These new features are: accessing, networking, verifying,
		  and information managing. In view of that, the study
		  develops a new model, which, unlike Ellis's, groups all the

  abstract	= {This paper reports results from a project, which sought to
		  investigate the relationship between study approaches and
		  Web-based information seeking. Factor analyses were applied
		  to data from over 500 queries submitting in response to
		  three different search tasks to identify clusters of
		  variables associated with three Web-based search
		  strategies: Boolean, best-match, and combined. A consistent
		  pattern emerged across the nine analyses in relation to a
		  number of study approach variables. Boolean searching was
		  consistently associated with a reproductive (as opposed to
		  meaning-oriented) approach, anxiety (in the form of fear of
		  failure), and high levels of active interest. Best-match
		  was associated with the converse of all these measures.
		  Combined searching was differentiated from both Boolean and
		  best-match by being associated with poor time management.
		  There was also some evidence of changes in strategy in
		  relation to task complexity. A model is introduced which
		  seeks to explain these results. This project was
		  exploratory in nature, and the pattern of findings are
		  proposed as prima facie evidence to support the notion that
		  study approaches can influence choice of search strategies.
		  The results are considered essentially as hypotheses for
		  further systematic study, for which suggestions are made.},

		  cocitation analysis of information science, 1972-1995,"
		  White and McCain used multidimensional scaling,
		  hierarchical clustering, and factor analysis to display the
		  specialty groupings of 120 highly-cited ("paradigmatic")
		  information scientists. These statistical techniques are
		  traditional in author cocitation analysis (ACA). It is
		  shown here that a newer technique, Pathfinder Networks
		  (PFNETs), has considerable advantages for ACA. In PFNETs,
		  nodes represent authors, and explicit links represent
		  weighted paths between nodes, the weights in this case
		  being cocitation counts. The links can be drawn to exclude
		  all but the single highest counts for author pairs, which
		  reduces a network of authors to only the most salient
		  relationships. When these are mapped, dominant authors can
		  be defined as those with relatively many links to other
		  authors (i.e., high degree centrality). Links between
		  authors and dominant authors define specialties, and links
		  between dominant authors connect specialties into a
		  discipline. Maps are made with one rather than several
		  computer routines and in one rather than many computer
		  passes. Also, PFNETs can, and should, be generated from
		  matrices of raw counts rather than Pearson correlations,
		  which removes a computational step associated with
		  traditional ACA. White and McCain's raw data from 1998 are
		  remapped as a PFNET. It is shown that the specialty
		  groupings correspond closely to those seen in the factor
		  analysis of the 1998 article. Because PFNETs are fast to
		  compute, they are used in AuthorLink, a new Web-based
		  system that creates live interfaces for cocited author
		  retrieval on the fly.},

  abstract	= {A number of studies have examined the problems of query
		  expansion in monolingual Information Retrieval (IR), and
		  query translation for crosslanguage IR. However, no link
		  has been made between them. This article first shows that
		  query translation is a special case of query expansion.
		  There is also another set of studies on inferential IR.
		  Again, there is no relationship established with query
		  translation or query expansion. The second claim of this
		  article is that logical inference is a general form that
		  covers query expansion and query translation. This analysis
		  provides a unified view of different subareas of IR. We
		  further develop the inferential IR approach in two
		  particular contexts: using fuzzy logic and probability
		  theory. The evaluation formulas obtained are shown to
		  strongly correspond to those used in other IR models. This
		  indicates that inference is indeed the core of advanced
		  IR.},

  abstract	= {Humans can make hasty, but generally robust judgements
		  about what a text fragment is, or is not, about. Such
		  judgements are termed information inference. This article
		  furnishes an account of information inference from a
		  psychologistic stance. By drawing on theories from
		  nonclassical logic and applied cognition, an information
		  inference mechanism is proposed that makes inferences via
		  computations of information flow through an approximation
		  of a conceptual space. Within a conceptual space
		  information is represented geometrically. In this article,
		  geometric representations of words are realized as vectors
		  in a high dimensional semantic space, which is
		  automatically constructed from a text corpus. Two
		  approaches were presented for priming vector
		  representations according to context. The first approach
		  uses a concept combination heuristic to adjust the vector
		  representation of a concept in the light of the
		  representation of another concept. The second approach
		  computes a prototypical concept on the basis of exemplar
		  trace texts and moves it in the dimensional space according
		  to the context. Information inference is evaluated by
		  measuring the effectiveness of query models derived by
		  information flow computations. Results show that
		  information flow contributes significantly to query model
		  effectiveness, particularly with respect to precision.
		  Moreover, retrieval effectiveness compares favorably with
		  two probabilistic query models, and another based on
		  semantic association. More generally, this article can be
		  seen as a contribution towards realizing operational
		  systems that mimic text-based human reasoning.},

  abstract	= {When people search for documents, they eventually want
		  content, not words. Hence, search engines should relate
		  documents more by their underlying concepts than by the
		  words they contain. One promising technique to do so is
		  Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). LSI dramatically reduces
		  the dimension of the document space by mapping it into a
		  space spanned by conceptual indices. Empirically, the
		  number of concepts that can represent the documents are far
		  fewer than the great variety of words in the textual
		  representation. Although this almost obviates the problem
		  of lexical matching, the mapping incurs a high
		  computational cost compared to document parsing, indexing,
		  query matching, and updating. This article accomplishes
		  several things. First, it shows how the technique
		  underlying LSI is just one example of a unitary operator,
		  for which there are computationally more attractive
		  alternatives. Second, it proposes the Haar transform as
		  such an alternative, as it is memory efficient, and can be
		  computed in linear to sublinear time. Third, it generalizes
		  LSI by a multiresolution representation of the document
		  space. The approach not only preserves the advantages of
		  LSI at drastically reduced computational costs, it also
		  opens a spectrum of possibilities for new research.},

  abstract	= {Relevance has been a difficult concept to define, let
		  alone measure. In this paper, a simple operational
		  definition of relevance is proposed for a Web-based library
		  catalog: whether or not during a search session the user
		  saves, prints, mails, or downloads a citation. If one of
		  those actions is performed, the session is considered
		  relevant to the user. An analysis is presented illustrating
		  the advantages and disadvantages of this definition. With
		  this definition and good transaction logging, it is
		  possible to ascertain the relevance of a session. This was
		  done for 905,970 sessions conducted with the University of
		  California's Melvyl online catalog. Next, a methodology was
		  developed to try to predict the relevance of a session. A
		  number of variables were defined that characterize a
		  session, none of which used any demographic information
		  about the user. The values of the variables were computed
		  for the sessions. Principal components analysis was used to
		  extract a new set of variables out of the original set. A
		  stratified random sampling technique was used to form ten
		  strata such that each new strata of 90,570 sessions
		  contained the same proportion of relevant to nonrelevant
		  sessions. Logistic regression was used to ascertain the
		  regression coefficients for nine of the ten strata. Then,
		  the coefficients were used to predict the relevance of the
		  sessions in the missing strata. Overall, 17.85% of the
		  sessions were determined to be relevant. The predicted
		  number of relevant sessions for all ten strata was 11%, a
		  6.85% difference. The authors believe that the methodology
		  can be further refined and the prediction improved. This
		  methodology could also have significant application in
		  improving user searching and also in predicting electronic
		  commerce buying decisions without the use of personal
		  demographic data.},

		  extracting visual features from image and using them to
		  index images in a database. The comparisons that determine
		  similarity between images depend on the representations of
		  the features and the definition of appropriate distance
		  function. Most of the research literature uses vectors as
		  the predominate representation given the rich theory of
		  vector spaces. While vectors are an extremely useful
		  representation, their use in large databases may be
		  prohibitive given their usually large dimensions and
		  similarity functions. In this paper, we propose similarity
		  measures and an indexing algorithm based on information
		  theory that permits an image to be represented as a single
		  number. When use in conjunction with vectors, our method
		  displays improved efficiency when querying large
		  databases.},

  abstract	= {A fundamental aspect of content-based image retrieval
		  (CBIR) is the extraction and the representation of a visual
		  feature that is an effective discriminant between pairs of
		  images. Among the many visual features that have been
		  studied, the distribution of color pixels in an image is
		  the most common visual feature studied. The standard
		  representation of color for content-based indexing in image
		  databases is the color histogram. Vector-based distance
		  functions are used to compute the similarity between two
		  images as the distance between points in the color
		  histogram space. This paper proposes an alternative real
		  valued representation of color based on the information
		  theoretic concept of entropy. A theoretical presentation of
		  image entropy is accompanied by a practical description of
		  the merits and limitations of image entropy compared to
		  color histograms. Specifically, the L1 norm for color
		  histograms is shown to provide an upper bound on the
		  difference between image entropy values. Our initial
		  results suggest that image entropy is a promising approach
		  to image description and representation.},

		  First, the accuracy of the document space model of image

  abstract	= {Identifying the users and impact of research is important
		  for research performers, managers, evaluators, and
		  sponsors. It is important to know whether the audience
		  reached is the audience desired. It is useful to understand
		  the technical characteristics of the other
		  research/development/applications impacted by the
		  originating research, and to understand other
		  characteristics (names, organizations, countries) of the
		  users impacted by the research. Because of the many
		  indirect pathways through which fundamental research can
		  impact applications, identifying the user audience and the
		  research impacts can be very complex and time consuming.
		  The purpose of this article is to describe a novel approach
		  for identifying the pathways through which research can
		  impact other research, technology development, and
		  applications, and to identify the technical and
		  infrastructure characteristics of the user population. A
		  novel literature-based approach was developed to identify
		  the user community and its characteristics. The research
		  performed is characterized by one or more articles accessed
		  by the Science Citation Index (SCI) database, because the
		  SCI's citation-based structure enables the capability to
		  perform citation studies easily. The user community is
		  characterized by the articles in the SCI that cite the
		  original research articles, and that cite the succeeding
		  generations of these articles as well. Text mining is
		  performed on the citing articles to identify the technical
		  areas impacted by the research, the relationships among
		  these technical areas, and relationships among the
		  technical areas and the infrastructure (authors, journals,
		  organizations). A key component of text mining, concept
		  clustering, was used to provide both a taxonomy of the
		  citing articles' technical themes and further technical
		  insights based on theme relationships arising from the
		  grouping process. Bibliometrics is performed on the citing
		  articles to profile the user characteristics. Citation
		  Mining, this integration of citation bibliometrics and text
		  mining, is applied to the 307 first generation citing
		  articles of a fundamental physics article on the dynamics
		  of vibrating sand-piles. Most of the 307 citing articles
		  were basic research whose main themes were aligned with
		  those of the cited article. However, about 20% of the
		  citing articles were research or development in other
		  disciplines, or development within the same discipline. The
		  text mining alone identified the intradiscipline
		  applications and extradiscipline impacts and applications;
		  this was confirmed by detailed reading of the 307
		  abstracts. The combination of citation bibliometrics and
		  text mining provides a synergy unavailable with each
		  approach taken independently. Furthermore, text mining is a
		  REQUIREMENT for a feasible comprehensive research impact
		  determination. The integrated multigeneration citation
		  analysis required for broad research impact determination
		  of highly cited articles will produce thousands or tens or
		  hundreds of thousands of citing article Abstracts. Text
		  mining allows the impacts of research on advanced
		  development categories and/or extradiscipline categories to
		  be obtained without having to read all these citing article
		  Abstracts. The multifield bibliometrics provide multiple
		  documented perspectives on the users of the research, and
		  indicate whether the documented audience reached is the
		  desired target audience.},

		  description of change, it remains common, if implicit, in
		  much information science literature. Recent developments in
		  science and technology studies offer a social
		  constructivist alternative, in which technology is seen,
		  not as autonomous, but as the result of interests. However,
		  the stability of these interests can be argued to privilege
		  social factors in the same way as technological determinism
		  privileges technological factors. A second alternative is
		  to shift to a relativist stance and analyze discourse as
		  interaction, rather than as a neutral carrier of
		  information, or communication. The focus of the discourse
		  analyses of interview interactions presented in this
		  article is on two aspects of discursive structure, the
		  indexical category of research, and interest management,
		  which refers to the ways that participants manage their own
		  and others' stakes in particular accounts. The article
		  concludes by noting how formal scholarly communication acts
		  as a category entitlement in interviews, and how
		  technological determinism works as a dilemma for this
		  entitlement that participants (including researchers)
		  negotiate at the very local level of their interactions and

  abstract	= {Previously, a new method for measuring scientific
		  productivity was demonstrated for authors in mathematical
		  logic and some subareas of 19th-century physics. The
		  purpose of this article is to apply this new method to
		  other fields to support its general applicability. We show
		  that the method yields the same results for modern
		  physicists, biologists, psychologists, inventors, and
		  composers. That is, each individual's production is
		  constant over time, and the time-period fluctuations follow
		  the Poisson distribution. However, the productivity (e.g.,
		  papers per year) varies widely across individuals. We show
		  that the distribution of productivity does not follow the
		  normal (i.e., bell curve) distribution, but rather follows
		  the exponential distribution. Thus, most authors produce at
		  the lowest rate and very few authors produce at the higher
		  rates. We also show that the career duration of individuals
		  follows the exponential distribution. Thus, most authors
		  have a very short career and very few have a long career.
		  The principal advantage of the new method is that the
		  detail structure of author productivity can be examined,
		  such as trends, etc. Another advantage is that information
		  science studies have guidance for the length of time
		  interval being examined and estimating when an author's
		  entire body of work has been recorded.},

		  statistical population, and within this population also in
		  the groups of communications of the normal and the letter
		  journals, and the short communications. The correlation
		  analysis did not find notable statistical correlation
		  between the simple and specific degree of documentedness of
		  a communication and the number of works cited in it by ICR
		  act(s) either in the total population or in the selected
		  groups. There is no correlation either statistical or real
		  (i.e., cause-and-effect) between the documentedness of
		  scientific communications made by their authors and the
		  presence and intensity of the ICR method used by their
		  authors. However, in reality there exists a very strong
		  connection between these two statistically independent
		  variables: both depend on the referencing author, on
		  his/her subjectivity and barely limited subjective free
		  will. This subjective free will shapes the stock of the
		  formal-direct references of scientific communications,
		  thereby placing the achievements cited in this way and
		  their creators into the (indexed) showcase of present Big
		  Science. The same free will decides on the use or nonuse of
		  the ICR method, and in the case of use also on the
		  intensity with which the method is used.},

		  our work on an indexing and retrieval method that, based on

		  that can be employed in the model. Experimental results on
		  four text collections (MED, CRANFIELD, CISI, and CACM) show
		  that the incorporation of term dependencies in the
		  retrieval process performs statistically significantly
		  better than the classical vector space model with IDF
		  weights. We also show that the degree of semantic matching
		  versus direct word matching that performs best varies on
		  the four collections. We conclude that the model performs
		  well for certain types of queries and, generally, for

		  relation to information science (IS) and information
		  retrieval (IR). The differences between traditional
		  cognitive views and the socio-cognitive or domain-analytic
		  view are outlined. It is claimed that, given elementary
		  skills in computer-based retrieval, people are basically
		  interacting with representations of subject literatures in
		  IR. The kind of knowledge needed to interact with
		  representations of subject literatures is discussed. It is
		  shown how different approaches or paradigms in the
		  represented literature imply different information needs
		  and relevance criteria (which users typically cannot
		  express very well, which is why IS cannot primarily rely on
		  user studies). These principles are exemplified by
		  comparing behaviorism, cognitivism, psychoanalysis, and
		  neuroscience as approaches in psychology. The relevance
		  criteria implicit in each position are outlined, and
		  empirical data are provided to prove the theoretical
		  claims. It is further shown that the most general level of
		  relevance criteria is implied by epistemological theories.
		  The article concludes that the fundamental problems of IS
		  and IR are based in epistemology, which therefore becomes
		  the most important allied field for IS.},

		  speak about career experiences as a technical writer (a
		  placebo talk). The results of this experiment are reported

		  change in anxiety levels was measured (p = 0.5). Although
		  statistical tests did not reject three null hypotheses,
		  positive trends in change as a result of the ISP model were
		  identified. A second article reports on results of

  abstract	= {Several languages for querying and transforming XML,
		  including XML-QL, Quilt, and XQL, have been proposed.
		  However, these languages do not support ranked queries
		  based on textual similarity, in the spirit of traditional
		  IR. Several extensions to these XML query languages to
		  support keyword search have been made, but the resulting
		  languages cannot express IR-style queries such as "find
		  books and CDs with similar titles." In some of these
		  languages keywords are used merely as boolean filters
		  without support for true ranked retrieval; others permit
		  similarity calculations only between a data value and a
		  constant, and thus cannot express the above query. WHIRL
		  avoids both problems, but assumes relational data. We
		  propose ELIXIR, an expressive and efficient language for
		  XML information retrieval that extends XML-QL with a
		  textual similarity operator that can be used for similarity
		  joins, so ELIXIR is sufficiently expressive to handle the
		  sample query above. ELIXIR thus qualifies as a
		  general-purpose XML IR query language. Our central
		  contribution is an efficient algorithm for answering ELIXIR
		  queries that rewrites the original ELIXIR query into a
		  series of XML-QL queries to generate intermediate
		  relational data, and uses WHIRL to efficiently evaluate the
		  similarity operators on this intermediate data, yielding an
		  XML document with nodes ranked by similarity. Our
		  experiments demonstrate that our prototype scales well with
		  the size of the query and the XML data.},

  abstract	= {Users move from one state (or task) to another in an
		  information system's labyrinth as they try to accomplish
		  their work, and the amount of time they spend in each state
		  varies. This article uses continuous-time stochastic
		  models, mainly based on semi-Markov chains, to derive user
		  state transition patterns (both in rates and in
		  probabilities) in a Web-based information system. The
		  methodology was demonstrated with 126,925 search sessions
		  drawn from the transaction logs of the University of
		  California's MELVYL library catalog system
		  (www.melvyl.ucop.edu). First, user sessions were
		  categorized into six groups based on their similar use of
		  the system. Second, by using a three-layer hierarchical
		  taxonomy of the system Web pages, user sessions in each
		  usage group were transformed into a sequence of states. All
		  the usage groups but one have third-order sequential
		  dependency in state transitions. The sole exception has
		  fourth-order sequential dependency. The transition rates as
		  well as transition probabilities of the semi-Markov model
		  provide a background for interpreting user behavior
		  probabilistically, at various levels of detail. Finally,
		  the differences in derived usage patterns between usage
		  groups were tested statistically. The test results showed
		  that different groups have distinct patterns of system use.
		  Knowledge of the extent of sequential dependency is
		  beneficial because it allows one to predict a user's next
		  move in a search space based on the past moves that have
		  been made. It can also be used to help customize the design
		  of the user interface to the system to facilitate
		  interaction. The group CL6 labeled knowledgeable and
		  sophisticated usage and the group CL7 labeled
		  unsophisticated usage both had third-order sequential
		  dependency and had the same most-frequently occurring
		  search pattern: screen display, record display, screen
		  display, and record display. The group CL8 called highly
		  interactive use with good search results had fourth-order
		  sequential dependency, and its most frequently occurring
		  pattern was the same as CL6 and CL7 with one more screen
		  display action added. The group CL13, called known-item
		  searching had third-order sequential dependency, and its
		  most frequently occurring pattern was index access, search
		  with retrievals, screen display, and record display. Group
		  CL14 called help intensive searching, and CL18 called
		  relatively unsuccessful both had third-order sequential
		  dependency, and for both groups the most frequently
		  occurring pattern was index access, search without
		  retrievals, index access, and again, search without
		  retrievals.},

		  approach to automatically classifying Web query terms into
		  broad subject categories. Because a query is short in
		  length and simple in structure, its intended subject(s) of
		  search is difficult to judge. Our approach, therefore,
		  combines the search processes of real-world search engines
		  to obtain highly ranked Web documents based on each unknown
		  query term. These documents are used to extract cooccurring
		  terms and to create a feature set. An effective ranking
		  function has also been developed to find the most
		  appropriate categories. Three search engine logs in Taiwan
		  were collected and tested. They contained over 5 million
		  queries from different periods of time. The achieved
		  performance is quite encouraging compared with that of
		  human categorization. The experimental results demonstrate
		  that the approach is efficient in dealing with large
		  numbers of queries and adaptable to the dynamic Web
		  environment. Through good integration of human and machine
		  efforts, the frequency distributions of subject categories
		  in response to changes in users' search interests can be

  abstract	= {This article describes an evaluation of the Kea automatic
		  keyphrase extraction algorithm. Document keyphrases are
		  conventionally used as concise descriptors of document
		  content, and are increasingly used in novel ways, including
		  document clustering, searching and browsing interfaces, and
		  retrieval engines. However, it is costly and time consuming
		  to manually assign keyphrases to documents, motivating the
		  development of tools that automatically perform this
		  function. Previous studies have evaluated Kea's performance
		  by measuring its ability to identify author keywords and
		  keyphrases, but this methodology has a number of well-known
		  limitations. The results presented in this article are
		  based on evaluations by human assessors of the quality and
		  appropriateness of Kea keyphrases. The results indicate
		  that, in general, Kea produces keyphrases that are rated
		  positively by human assessors. However, typical Kea
		  settings can degrade performance, particularly those
		  relating to keyphrase length and domain specificity. We
		  found that for some settings, Kea's performance is better
		  than that of similar systems, and that Kea's ranking of
		  extracted keyphrases is effective. We also determined that
		  author-specified keyphrases appear to exhibit an inherent
		  ranking, and that they are rated highly and therefore
		  suitable for use in training and evaluation of automatic
		  keyphrasing systems.},

		  performed literature searches on their behalf. A number of

  abstract	= {An information architecture that allows users to easily
		  navigate through a system and quickly recover from mistakes
		  is often defined as a highly usable system. But usability
		  in systems design goes beyond a good interface and
		  efficient navigation. In this article we describe two
		  database systems in a law enforcement agency. One system is
		  a legacy, text-based system with cumbersome navigation
		  (RMS); the newer system is a graphical user interface with
		  simplified navigation (CopNet). It is hypothesized that law
		  enforcement users will evaluate CopNet higher than RMS, but
		  experts of the older system will evaluate it higher than
		  others will. We conducted two user studies. One study
		  examined what users thought of RMS and CopNet, and compared
		  RMS experts' evaluations with nonexperts. We found that all
		  users evaluated CopNet as more effective, easier to use,
		  and easier to navigate than RMS, and this was especially
		  noticeable for users who were not experts with the older
		  system. The second, follow-up study examined use behavior
		  after CopNet was deployed some time later. The findings
		  revealed that evaluations of CopNet were not associated
		  with its use. If the newer system had a better interface
		  and was easier to navigate than the older, legacy system,
		  why were law enforcement personnel reluctant to switch? We
		  discuss reasons why switching to a new system is difficult,
		  especially for those who are most adept at using the older
		  system. Implications for system design and usability are
		  also discussed.},

		  study examining information-seeking behavior in relation to
		  information-retrieval (IR) interaction. This article
		  focuses on the examination of the interaction variables
		  within Saracevic's (1989) triadic IR model. The analysis
		  involved an examination of the information-searching
		  behavior of academic researchers during a mediated
		  interaction with an IR system, particularly concentrating
		  on the interaction between the information seeker, the
		  search intermediary, and the IR system. To explore the
		  variables during mediated search interaction, two
		  small-scale studies of mediated on-line searching were
		  conducted at the University of Sheffield. The studies
		  involved mainly qualitative data analysis of interview
		  transcripts and on-line search results, together with
		  quantitative data analysis of questionnaire results. The
		  studies specifically investigated: (1) aspects of the
		  mediated search process, (2) relevant information sources,
		  and (3) interaction measures derived from search logs and
		  tape transcripts, and related interaction measures.
		  Findings include: (1) a number of different types of
		  interactions were identified, (2) the presearching
		  interactions between information seeker and intermediary
		  aided the information seeker to identify their idea and
		  problem, and (3) most information seekers in this study
		  were at the problem definition stage or problem resolution
		  stage following the search process. From this research, it
		  is clear that the interaction did affect the search
		  process. The intermediary helped the users to identify
		  their search terms more clearly and focus on the references
		  obtained. In most cases, the users and intermediary
		  considered the communication process very effective, and
		  the interactions that took place during the on-line search
		  were found to affect the users' perceptions of the problem,
		  personal knowledge, and relevance judgments. The
		  interaction process aided the users to obtain very useful
		  results with help from the intermediary. In general, the
		  users gave a positive evaluation of the retrieved answers
		  in terms of focus, completeness, novelty, and degree of
		  nonrelevancy.},

		  fact that individual Web files are often the only choice if

		  defining the Web "document": that which should comprise the
		  single indissoluble unit of coherent material. Three

		  under the assumption that a more effective heuristic will

		  reduce the impact of anomalous linking behavior between

		  choice. Reasons are then given as to why a document model

		  Three organizations with differing functions and outputs
		  were studied: a law firm, an educational institution, and a

		  at all levels had substantial awareness of the nature of
		  knowledge within the organization, and there were a

		  Their information-seeking behavior and success on the fully

		  Children were more successful on the fully self-generated
		  task than the two fully assigned tasks. Children preferred
		  the fully self-generated task to the two fully assigned
		  tasks due to their ability to find the information sought
		  and satisfaction with search results rather than the nature
		  of the task in itself (i.e., self-generated aspect).
		  Children were more successful when they browsed than when

		  modern large IR environments. The proposed methods are (1)
		  a novel application of P-R curves and average precision

		  recall and precision based directly on multiple grade

		  retrieval process, one should use both graded relevance
		  assessments and effectiveness measures that enable one to
		  observe the differences, if any, between retrieval methods
		  in retrieving documents of different levels of relevance.

  abstract	= {This article presents an overview of some of the
		  methodology used in a project that examined children's
		  understanding of library information and how those
		  perspectives change in the first 5 years of formal
		  schooling. Because our understanding of information is
		  reflected in the manner in which we classify, or typify,
		  that information in order to view the library collection
		  from a child's perspective children were invited to shelve
		  (i.e., classify) terms representative of library books and
		  then to label those categories. The resulting shelf
		  categories help us to see library information from a
		  child's perspective. Data collection using group dialog,
		  visual imagery, narrative, cooperative learning techniques,
		  and hands-on manipulatives is described for one session of
		  a project in which children used induction to form concepts
		  related to knowledge organization in a hypothetical
		  library. Analysis for this session included use of
		  hierarchical clustering and multidimensional scaling to
		  examine and compare children's constructions for
		  qualitative differences on several grade levels. Following
		  the description of data collection methods and analysis, a
		  discussion focuses on the reasons for using these
		  particular methods of data collection with a child

		  shopping is built on the premise that distance and location
		  are irrelevant (with the possible exception of shipping
		  charges), tourism and onsite inspection of goods have a
		  geospatial dimension and distance and location are relevant
		  factors. Current search engines build indices based on
		  keyword occurrence and frequency for query negotiation
		  using these indices. This approach is fast, robust, and
		  generic but when queries are related to physical locations
		  and distances rather than cyberdistances this approach
		  leaves the user to sort through pages of results. In this
		  paper, we describe an algorithm that assigns location
		  coordinates dynamically to web sites based on the URL. A
		  prototype search system was built using this algorithm that
		  uses this information to re-rank the results of search
		  engines for queries with a geospatial dimension. We found
		  that over 80% of the URLs tested could be assigned correct
		  location coordinates. This work makes a contribution to
		  retrieval on the web by providing an alternative ranking

		  credence to their use for the investigation of scholarly
		  communication. This paper reports on a study to investigate
		  the factors that influence the creation of links to journal
		  Web sites. An empirical approach is used: collecting data
		  and testing for significant patterns. The specific
		  questions addressed are whether site age and site content
		  are inducers of links to a journal's Web site as measured
		  by the ratio of link counts to Journal Impact Factors, two
		  variables previously discovered to be related. A new

		  uses the Internet Archive to obtain an earliest known

		  site age and site content are significant factors for the
		  disciplines studied: library and information science, and
		  law. Comparisons between the two fields also show

		  useful to predict aspects of the network traffic. Yet, the
		  notion of predicting network traffic does not appear in the
		  relevant literature reporting analysis of network traffic.
		  This literature is both well developed and skeptical about
		  the value of traditional time series analysis on network
		  data. It has consistently reported three "traffic
		  invariants" in the analysis of network and Internet
		  traffic. This study uses such time series analysis on a
		  day's worth of Internet log data and finds poor support for
		  one of the invariants. In the preliminary analysis,
		  evidence of nonlinearity was discovered in these data and
		  the analysis presented here examines this question further.
		  This study posits that nonlinear events may be a traffic
		  invariant although this hypothesis would have to be
		  investigated further. The appearance of nonlinear
		  structures is important to the question of predicting
		  network traffic because there are currently no methods to
		  predict time series with nonlinear structures. The
		  discovery of non-linear structures, then, may mean that
		  developing a predictive model is impossible with current
		  techniques. On the other hand, these nonlinearities may
		  result from interactions from other OSI Layers than the one

		  largely present difficulty in coping with images with
		  changes in orientations and scales. The underlying feature
		  extraction process involves a log-polar transform followed
		  by an adaptive row shift invariant wavelet packet
		  transform. The log-polar transform converts a given image
		  into a rotation and scale invariant but row-shifted image,
		  which is then further processed through an adaptive
		  row-shift invariant wavelet packet transform operation to
		  generate adaptively selected subbands of rotation and scale
		  invariant wavelet coefficients, based on an information
		  cost function. An energy signature is computed for each
		  subband of these wavelet coefficients. To reduce feature
		  dimensionality, only the most dominant log-polar wavelet
		  energy signatures are selected for the feature vector for
		  image retrieval. The overall feature extraction process is
		  quite efficient and involves only O(n . log n) complexity.

		  Filtering rules may refer to various attributes of the data

		  rule-based filtering systems, each user has his/her own
		  personal filtering rules. In stereotype rule-based
		  filtering systems, a user is assigned to a group of similar

		  rules. Although, intuitively, personal filtering rules seem

		  rules, our comparative study reveals that stereotype

		  Four data collection methods were employed: search task

		  plagiarisms of each other. The first, the ranking family,
		  uses information retrieval techniques; extending this
		  family, we propose the identity measure, which is
		  specifically designed for identification of co-derivative
		  documents. The second, the fingerprinting family, uses
		  hashing to generate a compact document description, which
		  can then be compared to the fingerprints of the documents
		  in the collection. We introduce a new method for evaluating
		  the effectiveness of these techniques, and demonstrate it
		  in practice. Using experiments on two collections, we
		  demonstrate that the identity measure and the best
		  fingerprinting technique are both able to accurately
		  identify coderivative documents. However, for
		  fingerprinting parameters must be carefully chosen, and
		  even so the identity measure is clearly superior.},

		  piece of information during a search task, it is much
		  harder to measure how much someone has learned during the
		  search process. Searchers who are learning often exhibit
		  exploratory behaviors, and so current research is often
		  focused on improving support for exploratory search.
		  Consequently, we need effective measures of learning to
		  demonstrate better support for exploratory search. Some
		  approaches, such as quizzes, measure recall when learning
		  from a fixed source of information. This research, however,
		  focuses on techniques for measuring open-ended learning,
		  which often involve analyzing handwritten summaries
		  produced by participants after a task. There are two common
		  techniques for analyzing such summaries: a counting facts
		  and statements and b judging topic coverage. Both of these
		  techniques, however, can be easily confounded by simple
		  variables such as summary length. This article presents a
		  new technique that measures depth of learning within
		  written summaries based on Bloom's taxonomy B.S. Bloom
		  &amp;M.D. Engelhart, 1956. This technique was generated
		  using grounded theory and is designed to be less
		  susceptible to such confounding variables. Together, these
		  three categories of measure were compared by applying them
		  to a large collection of written summaries produced in a
		  task-based study, and our results provide insights into
		  each of their strengths and weaknesses. Both
		  fact-to-statement ratio and our own measure of depth of

  abstract	= {Synthesizing and building on many ideas from the
		  literature, this article presents an improved conceptual
		  framework that clarifies the notion of relevance with its
		  many elements, variables, criteria, and situational
		  factors. Relevance is defined as a Relationship (R) between
		  an Information Object (I) and an Information Need (N)
		  (which consists of Topic, User, Problem/Task, and
		  Situation/Context) with focus on R. This defines
		  Relevance-as-is (conceptual relevance, strong relevance).
		  To determine relevance, an Agent A (a person or system)
		  operates on a representation I′ of the information object
		  and a representation N′ of the information need,
		  resulting in relevance-as-determined (operational measure
		  of relevance, weak relevance, an approximation). Retrieval
		  tests compare relevance-as-determined by different agents.
		  This article discusses and compares two major approaches to
		  conceptualizing relevance: the entity-focused approach
		  (focus on elaborating the entities involved in relevance)
		  and the relationship-focused approach (focus on explicating
		  the relational nature of relevance). The article argues
		  that because relevance is fundamentally a relational
		  construct the relationship-focused approach deserves a
		  higher priority and more attention than it has received.
		  The article further elaborates on the elements of the
		  framework with a focus on clarifying several critical
		  issues on the discourse on relevance. © 2013 Wiley

		  proposed typology provides a generic framework for
		  integrating different pieces of clinical evidence and a
		  multifaceted view of a clinical problem. In medical problem
		  solving structured knowledge plays a key role. The typology
		  provides the conceptual basis for integrating and

		  communication and funding processes to assess the epistemic
		  and social legitimacy of the mechanisms by which knowledge
		  communities vet and self-regulate their work. Despite vocal

		  addition, the notion of bias is predicated on an implicit
		  ideal that, once articulated, raises questions about the

		  This review provides a brief description of the function,
		  history, and scope of peer review; articulates and
		  critiques the conception of bias unifying research on bias
		  in peer review; characterizes and examines the empirical,

  abstract	= {Traditional information retrieval (IR) systems show
		  significant limitations on returning relevant documents
		  that satisfy the user's information needs. In particular,
		  to answer geographic and temporal user queries, the IR task
		  becomes a nonstraightforward process where the available
		  geographic and temporal information is often unstructured.
		  In this article, we propose a geotemporal search approach
		  that consists of modeling and exploiting geographic and
		  temporal query context evidence that refers to implicit
		  multivarying geographic and temporal intents behind the
		  query. Modeling geographic and temporal query contexts is
		  based on extracting and ranking geographic and temporal
		  keywords found in pseudo-relevant feedback (PRF) documents
		  for a given query. Our geotemporal search approach is based
		  on exploiting the geographic and temporal query contexts
		  separately into a probabilistic ranking model and jointly
		  into a proximity ranking model. Our hypothesis is based on
		  the concept that geographic and temporal expressions tend
		  to co-occur within the document where the closer they are
		  in the document, the more relevant the document is.
		  Finally, geographic, temporal, and proximity scores are
		  combined according to a linear combination formula. An
		  extensive experimental evaluation conducted on a portion of
		  the New York Times news collection and the TREC 2004 robust
		  retrieval track collection shows that our geotemporal
		  approach outperforms significantly a well-known baseline
		  search and the best known geotemporal search approaches in
		  the domain. Finally, an in-depth analysis shows a positive
		  correlation between the geographic and temporal query
		  sensitivity and the retrieval performance. Also, we find
		  that geotemporal distance has a positive impact on
		  retrieval performance generally. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals,

		  Classification usually takes place at the level of

		  journal-level classification systems have two important
		  limitations: They offer only a limited amount of detail,

		  To avoid these limitations, we introduce a new methodology
		  for constructing classification systems at the level of

		  relative simplicity of the methodology and its fairly
		  modest computing and memory requirements. The main
		  limitation of the methodology is its exclusive reliance on
		  direct citation relations between publications. The

		  as implicit relevance feedback by the user on the results
		  offered to them. In particular, the selection of results by
		  users can be interpreted as a confirmation of the relevance
		  of those results, and used to reorder or prioritize
		  subsequent search results. This collection of search/result
		  pairings is called clickthrough data, and many uses for it
		  have been proposed. However, the reliability of
		  clickthrough data has been challenged and it has been
		  suggested that clickthrough data are not a completely
		  accurate measure of relevance between search term and
		  results. This paper reports on an experiment evaluating the
		  reliability of clickthrough data as a measure of the mutual
		  relevance of search term and result. The experiment
		  comprised a user study involving over 67 participants and
		  determines the reliability of image search clickthrough
		  data, using factors identified in previous similar studies.
		  A major difference in this work to previous work is that
		  the source of clickthrough data comes from image searches,
		  rather than the traditional text page searches. Image
		  search clickthrough data were rarely examined in prior
		  works but has differences that impact the accuracy of
		  clickthrough data. These differences include a more
		  complete representation of the results in image search,
		  allowing users to scrutinize the results more closely
		  before selecting them, as well as presenting the results in
		  a less obviously ordered way. The experiment reported here
		  demonstrates that image clickthrough data can be more
		  reliable as a relevance feedback measure than has been the
		  case with traditional text-based search. There is also
		  evidence that the precision of the search system influences
		  the accuracy of click data when users make searches in an

  abstract	= {Knowledge creation and dissemination in science and
		  technology systems are perceived as prerequisites for
		  socioeconomic development. The efficiency of creating new
		  knowledge is considered to have a geographical component,
		  that is, some regions are more capable in terms of
		  scientific knowledge production than others. This article
		  presents a method of using a network representation of
		  scientific interaction to assess the relative efficiency of
		  regions with diverse boundaries in channeling knowledge
		  through a science system. In a first step, a weighted
		  aggregate of the betweenness centrality is produced from
		  empirical data (aggregation). The subsequent randomization
		  of this empirical network produces the necessary null model
		  for significance testing and normalization (randomization).
		  This step is repeated to provide greater confidence about
		  the results (re-sampling). The results are robust estimates
		  for the relative regional efficiency of brokering
		  knowledge, which is discussed along with cross-sectional
		  and longitudinal empirical examples. The network
		  representation acts as a straightforward metaphor of
		  conceptual ideas from economic geography and neighboring
		  disciplines. However, the procedure is not limited to
		  centrality measures, nor is it limited to geographical
		  aggregates. Therefore, it offers a wide range of
		  applications for scientometrics and beyond. © 2012 Wiley

  abstract	= {A new collaborative approach in information organization
		  and sharing has recently arisen, known as collaborative
		  tagging or social indexing. A key element of collaborative
		  tagging is the concept of collective intelligence (CI),
		  which is a shared intelligence among all participants. This
		  research investigates the phenomenon of social tagging in
		  the context of CI with the aim to serve as a stepping-stone
		  towards the mining of truly valuable social tags for web
		  resources. This study focuses on assessing and evaluating
		  the degree of CI embedded in social tagging over time in
		  terms of two-parameter values, number of participants, and
		  top frequency ranking window. Five different metrics were
		  adopted and utilized for assessing the similarity between
		  ranking lists: overlapList, overlapRank, Footrule, Fagin's
		  measure, and the Inverse Rank measure. The result of this
		  study demonstrates that a substantial degree of CI is most
		  likely to be achieved when somewhere between the first 200
		  and 400 people have participated in tagging, and that a
		  target degree of CI can be projected by controlling the two
		  factors along with the selection of a similarity metric.
		  The study also tests some experimental conditions for
		  detecting social tags with high CI degree. The results of
		  this study can be applicable to the study of filtering
		  social tags based on CI; filtered social tags may be
		  utilized for the metadata creation of tagged resources and
		  possibly for the retrieval of tagged resources. © 2012

		  institutions based on their journal publication profiles.
		  We believe that journals in which researchers from academic
		  institutions publish their works can be considered as
		  useful identifiers for representing the relationships
		  between these institutions and establishing comparisons.
		  However, when academic journals are used for research
		  output representation, distinctions must be introduced
		  between them, based on their value as institution
		  descriptors. This leads us to the use of journal weights
		  attached to the institution identifiers. Since a journal in
		  which researchers from a large proportion of institutions
		  published their papers may be a bad indicator of similarity
		  between two academic institutions, it seems reasonable to
		  weight it in accordance with how frequently researchers
		  from different institutions published their papers in this
		  journal. Cluster analysis can then be applied to group the
		  academic institutions, and dendrograms can be provided to
		  illustrate groups of institutions following agglomerative
		  hierarchical clustering. In order to test this methodology,
		  we use a sample of Spanish universities as a case study. We
		  first map the study sample according to an institution's
		  overall research output, then we use it for two scientific
		  fields (Information and Communication Technologies, as well

		  However, since 1990, the advent of the digital age, the
		  relation between IFs and paper citations has been
		  weakening. This began first in physics, a field that was
		  quick to make the transition into the electronic domain.
		  Furthermore, since 1990 the overall proportion of highly
		  cited papers coming from highly cited journals has been
		  decreasing and, of these highly cited papers, the
		  proportion not coming from highly cited journals has been
		  increasing. Should this pattern continue, it might bring an
		  end to the use of the IF as a way to evaluate the quality

		  They rely on a large number of features to compute the rank

		  were identified by searching the Web of Science (Thomson
		  Reuters, Philadelphia, PA) and discipline-level databases.
		  The majority (72%) of all articles were published in life

		  small set of canonical publications by John Maynard Smith;
		  OBI represents a decoupling of the use of the phrase and a
		  citation to a John Maynard Smith publication. Across all
		  articles at the record level, OBI is measured by the number
		  of articles with the phrase in the database record but
		  which lack a reference to a source article (implicit
		  citations). At the citation-in-context level, articles that
		  coupled a non-Maynard Smith citation with the ESS phrase
		  (indirect citations) were counted along with those that
		  cited relevant Maynard Smith publications (explicit
		  citations) and OBI counted only based on those articles
		  that lacked any citation coupled with the ESS text phrase.
		  The degree of OBI observed depended on the level of

		  through the journals in which they have been published. The
		  problem is that while many journals are assigned to a
		  single subfield, many others are assigned to several. This
		  article discusses a multiplicative and a fractional
		  strategy to deal with this situation. The empirical part
		  studies different aspects of citation distributions under
		  the two strategies, namely: the number of articles, the
		  mean citation rate, the broad shape of the distribution,
		  their characterization in terms of size- and
		  scale-invariant indicators of high and low impact, and the
		  presence of extreme distributions, that is, distributions
		  that behave very differently from the rest. We found that,
		  despite large differences in the number of articles
		  according to both strategies, the similarity of the
		  citation characteristics of articles published in journals
		  assigned to one or several subfields guarantees that
		  choosing one of the two strategies may not lead to a
		  radically different picture in practical applications.
		  Nevertheless, the characterization of citation excellence
		  through a high-impact indicator may considerably differ

  abstract	= {Recommender systems can mitigate the information overload
		  problem and help workers retrieve knowledge based on their
		  preferences. In a knowledge-intensive environment,
		  knowledge workers need to access task-related codified
		  knowledge (documents) to perform tasks. A worker's document
		  referencing behavior can be modeled as a knowledge flow
		  (KF) to represent the evolution of his or her information
		  needs over time. Document recommendation methods can
		  proactively support knowledge workers in the performance of
		  tasks by recommending appropriate documents to meet their
		  information needs. However, most traditional recommendation
		  methods do not consider workers’ KFs or the information
		  needs of the majority of a group of workers with similar
		  KFs. A group's needs may partially reflect the needs of an
		  individual worker that cannot be inferred from his or her
		  past referencing behavior. In other words, the group's
		  knowledge complements that of the individual worker. Thus,
		  we leverage the group perspective to complement the
		  personal perspective by using hybrid approaches, which
		  combine the KF-based group recommendation method (KFGR)
		  with traditional personalized-recommendation methods. The
		  proposed hybrid methods achieve a trade-off between the
		  group-based and personalized methods by exploiting the
		  strengths of both. The results of our experiment show that

		  which the indicators fluctuate strongly and the ranking of
		  scientists in the evaluated group is sometimes completely
		  mixed up by minor changes in the database. The erratic
		  behavior is traced to the specific way in which weights are
		  attributed to the six percentile rank classes, specifically

		  for differences in citation behavior in different fields.

		  R(6,k) = 1.91 can be avoided by a new scoring rule: the

		  understanding text is the problem of entity disambiguation.
		  While humans find it easy to determine that a person named
		  in one story is the same person referenced in a second
		  story, machines rely heavily on crude heuristics such as
		  string matching and stemming to make guesses as to whether
		  nouns are coreferent. A key advantage that humans have over
		  machines is the ability to mentally make connections
		  between ideas and, based on these connections, reason how
		  likely two entities are to be the same. Mirroring this
		  natural thought process, we have created a prototype
		  framework for disambiguating entities that is based on
		  connectedness. In this article, we demonstrate it in the
		  practical application of disambiguating authors across a
		  large set of bibliographic records. By representing
		  knowledge from the records as edges in a graph between a
		  subject and an object, we believe that the problem of
		  disambiguating entities reduces to the problem of
		  discovering the most strongly connected nodes in a graph.
		  The knowledge from the records comes in many different
		  forms, such as names of people, date of publication, and
		  themes extracted from the text of the abstract. These
		  different types of knowledge are fused to create the graph
		  required for disambiguation. Furthermore, the resulting
		  graph and framework can be used for more complex

		  novel Anna Karenina is: “Happy families are all alike;
		  every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Here,
		  Tolstoy means that for a family to be happy, several key
		  aspects must be given (e.g., good health of all family
		  members, acceptable financial security, and mutual
		  affection). If there is a deficiency in any one or more of
		  these key aspects, the family will be unhappy. In this

		  (recognition as a scarce resource). If resources are scarce
		  at the highly competitive research front (journal space,
		  funds, reception, and recognition), there can be success
		  only when several key prerequisites for the allocation of
		  the resources are fulfilled. If any one of these
		  prerequisites is not fulfilled, the grant proposal,

  abstract	= {This experiment studied the impact of various task
		  phrasings on the search process. Eighty-eight searchers
		  performed four web search tasks prescribed by the
		  researchers. Each task was linked to an existing target web
		  page, containing a piece of text that served as the basis
		  for the task. A matching phrasing was a task whose wording
		  matched the text of the target page. A nonmatching phrasing
		  was synonymous with the matching phrasing, but had no match
		  with the target page. Searchers received tasks for both
		  types in English and in Hebrew. The search process was
		  logged. The findings confirm that task phrasing shapes the
		  search process and outcome, and also user satisfaction.
		  Each search stage—retrieval of the target page, visiting
		  the target page, and finding the target answer—was
		  associated with different phenomena; for example, target
		  page retrieval was negatively affected by persistence in
		  search patterns (e.g., use of phrases), user-originated
		  keywords, shorter queries, and omitting key keywords from
		  the queries. Searchers were easily driven away from the
		  top-ranked target pages by lower-ranked pages with title
		  tags matching the queries. Some searchers created
		  consistently longer queries than other searchers,
		  regardless of the task length. Several consistent behavior
		  patterns that characterized the Hebrew language were
		  uncovered, including the use of keyword modifications
		  (replacing infinitive forms with nouns), omitting prefixes
		  and articles, and preferences for the common language. The
		  success self-assessment also depended on whether the

		  disambiguation (AND) affects the results of an author-based
		  citation analysis study, and identify conditions under
		  which the traditional simplified approach of using surnames
		  and first initials may suffice in practice. We compare
		  author citation ranking and cocitation mapping results in
		  the stem cell research field from 2004 to 2009 using two
		  AND approaches: the traditional simplified approach of
		  using author surname and first initial and a sophisticated
		  algorithmic approach. We find that the traditional approach
		  leads to extremely distorted rankings and substantially
		  distorted mappings of authors in this field when based on
		  first- or all-author citation counting, whereas
		  last-author-based citation ranking and cocitation mapping
		  both appear relatively immune to the author name ambiguity
		  problem. This is largely because Romanized names of Chinese
		  and Korean authors, who are very active in this field, are
		  extremely ambiguous, but few of these researchers
		  consistently publish as last authors in bylines. We
		  conclude that a more earnest effort is required to deal
		  with the author name ambiguity problem in both citation
		  analysis and information retrieval, especially given the
		  current trend toward globalization. In the stem cell
		  research field, in which laboratory heads are traditionally
		  listed as last authors in bylines, last-author-based
		  citation ranking and cocitation mapping using the
		  traditional approach to author name disambiguation may
		  serve as a simple workaround, but likely at the price of
		  largely filtering out Chinese and Korean contributions to

		  criticized as being insufficiently specific and not
		  appropriate for all types of scientific research. In an
		  effort to examine the extent to which funded projects
		  represented Broader Impacts, the researchers performed a
		  content analysis of the abstracts from projects in the
		  National Science Digital Library, an NSF project that
		  crossed many disciplines and applications, but is of

		  results of these analyses are placed in the context of the
		  controversy surrounding the Broader Impacts merit review
		  criterion, it is clear that this criterion is interpreted
		  broadly and that even successful proposals often include
		  aspirational or incomplete claims of impact. Because
		  current proposed revisions to the merit review criteria
		  that include emphases on demonstrable innovation and
		  economic benefit will likely only complicate proposers'
		  abilities to describe their projects' potentials,
		  researchers may benefit from a greater understanding of

		  contrasted with the Anglophone one, which is perceived as
		  different and rooted mainly in Shannon's mathematical
		  theory of communication. While there is such a thing as a
		  French conception of information science, this conception
		  is not totally divorced from the Anglophone one.
		  Unbeknownst to researchers from the two geographical and
		  cultural regions, they share similar conceptions of the
		  field and invoke similar theoretical foundations, in
		  particular the socio-constructivist theory. There is also a
		  convergence of viewpoints on the dual nature of information
		  science, i.e., the fact that it is torn between two
		  competing paradigms—objectivist and subjectivist.
		  Technology is another area where a convergence of
		  viewpoints is noticeable: Scholars from both geographic and
		  cultural zones display the same suspicion toward the role
		  of technology and of computer science. It would therefore
		  be misleading to uphold the view that Anglophone
		  information science is essentially objectivist and
		  technicist while the French conception is essentially
		  social and rooted in the humanities. This paper highlights
		  converging analyses from authors based in both linguistic
		  and geographical regions with the aim to foster a better

		  Using data on 7,700+ articles of Internet studies published

		  journals in 2000–2009, the study adopted a multilevel
		  model to disentangle the impact between article- and

		  to be journal-level factors, accounting for 14% of the

		  some, if not all, article-level factors on citations are
		  moderated by journal-level factors. Internet studies, like
		  studies in other areas (e.g., management, demography, and
		  ecology), are cited more for rhetorical purposes, as
		  suggested by the social constructivist approach, rather
		  than as a form of reward, as argued by normative theory.

		  challenge in the bibliometric field, but relatively

		  bibliometric analysis on the new “funding

		  Science. All publications covered by the database in 2009
		  have been analyzed. The presence and length of the FA text,
		  as well as the presence of “peer interactive
		  communication” in the acknowledgments, are related to
		  impact indicators, distribution of papers by fields,
		  countries of the authors, and collaboration level of the

		  There are also differences across countries and disciplines

		  acknowledgment of peer interactive communication. China is
		  the country with the highest share of publications
		  acknowledging funding, while the presence of FAs in the

  abstract	= {Focusing on information behavior in a context where
		  medical evidence is explicitly evolving (management of the
		  menopause transition), this investigation explored how
		  women interact with and make sense of uncertain health
		  information mediated by formal and informal sources. Based
		  on interviews with 28 information seekers and 12 health
		  professionals (HPs), findings demonstrate that participants
		  accessed and valued a wide range of information sources,
		  moved fluidly between formal and informal sources, and
		  trust was strengthened through interaction and referral
		  between sources. Participants were motivated to seek
		  information to prepare for formal encounters with HPs,
		  evaluate and/or supplement information already gathered,
		  establish that they were “normal,” understand and
		  address the physical embodiment of their experiences, and
		  prepare for future information needs. Findings revealed
		  four strategies used to construct sense from health
		  information mediated by the many information sources
		  encountered and accessed on an everyday basis: women
		  assumed analytic and experiential “postures”; they
		  valued social contexts for learning and knowledge
		  construction; information consistency was used as a
		  heuristic representing accuracy and credibility; and an
		  important feature of sense making was source
		  complementarity. Implications for health information

		  contributes to artificial barriers that can impede
		  interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research. The
		  authors considered this problem by examining the domains,
		  objectives, and architectures of nine metadata schemes used
		  to document scientific data in the physical, life, and
		  social sciences. They used a mixed-methods content analysis
		  and Greenberg's () metadata objectives, principles,
		  domains, and architectural layout (MODAL) framework, and
		  derived 22 metadata-related goals from textual content
		  describing each metadata scheme. Relationships are
		  identified between the domains (e.g., scientific discipline
		  and type of data) and the categories of scheme objectives.
		  For each strong correlation (&gt;0.6), a Fisher's exact
		  test for nonparametric data was used to determine
		  significance (p &lt; .05).Significant relationships
		  were found between the domains and objectives of the
		  schemes. Schemes describing observational data are more
		  likely to have “scheme harmonization” (compatibility
		  and interoperability with related schemes) as an objective;
		  schemes with the objective “abstraction” (a conceptual
		  model exists separate from the technical implementation)
		  also have the objective “sufficiency” (the scheme
		  defines a minimal amount of information to meet the needs
		  of the community); and schemes with the objective “data
		  publication” do not have the objective “element
		  refinement.” The analysis indicates that many
		  metadata-driven goals expressed by communities are
		  independent of scientific discipline or the type of data,
		  although they are constrained by historical community
		  practices and workflows as well as the technological
		  environment at the time of scheme creation. The analysis
		  reveals 11 fundamental metadata goals for metadata
		  documenting scientific data in support of sharing research
		  data across disciplines and domains. The authors report
		  these results and highlight the need for more

		  support of, much-improved data curation. (Hanson, Sugden,
		  &amp; Alberts)Researchers are producing an unprecedented
		  deluge of data by using new methods and instrumentation.
		  Others may wish to mine these data for new discoveries and
		  innovations. However, research data are not readily
		  available as sharing is common in only a few fields such as
		  astronomy and genomics. Data sharing practices in other
		  fields vary widely. Moreover, research data take many
		  forms, are handled in many ways, using many approaches, and
		  often are difficult to interpret once removed from their
		  initial context. Data sharing is thus a conundrum. Four
		  rationales for sharing data are examined, drawing examples
		  from the sciences, social sciences, and humanities: (1) to
		  reproduce or to verify research, (2) to make results of
		  publicly funded research available to the public, (3) to
		  enable others to ask new questions of extant data, and (4)
		  to advance the state of research and innovation. These
		  rationales differ by the arguments for sharing, by
		  beneficiaries, and by the motivations and incentives of the

		  understand which data might be shared, by whom, with whom,

		  and describe a case study of EOL based on analysis of
		  interviews, online discussions, and survey data. Our
		  findings are characterized into two broad categories:
		  information integration and social integration. Information
		  integration challenges at EOL include the need to (a)
		  accommodate and validate multiple sources and (b) integrate
		  traditional peer reviewed sources with user-generated,
		  nonpeer-reviewed content. Social integration challenges at
		  EOL include the need to (a) establish the credibility of
		  open-access resources within the scientific community and
		  (b) facilitate collaboration between experts and novices.
		  After identifying the challenges, we discuss the potential
		  strategies EOL and other content curation communities can
		  use to address them, and provide technical, content, and
		  social design recommendations for overcoming them. © 2012

		  profiling. As LIWC is a tool that has been developed in the
		  psycholinguistic field rather than the computational
		  linguistics field, it was hypothesized that it would be
		  effective, both as a single type feature set because of its
		  psycholinguistic basis, and in combination with other
		  feature sets, because it should be sufficiently different
		  to add insight rather than redundancy. It was found that
		  LIWC features were competitive with previously used feature
		  types in identifying the first language of an author, and
		  that combined feature sets including LIWC features
		  consistently showed better accuracy rates and average F
		  measures than were achieved by the same feature sets
		  without the LIWC features. As a secondary issue, this study

		  Many of the traditional CMC tools lack the needed support

		  authors, a decrease was observed in the field's
		  market-share of all social science and humanities research.
		  Collaborative authorship is now the norm, a pattern seen

		  those from citation networks, which have not been deeply

  abstract	= {Multidocument summarization (MDS) aims for each given
		  query to extract compressed and relevant information with
		  respect to the different query-related themes present in a
		  set of documents. Many approaches operate in two steps.
		  Themes are first identified from the set, and then a
		  summary is formed by extracting salient sentences within
		  the different documents of each of the identified themes.
		  Among these approaches, latent semantic analysis (LSA)
		  based approaches rely on spectral decomposition techniques
		  to identify the themes. In this article, we propose a major
		  extension of these techniques that relies on the quantum
		  information access (QIA) framework. The latter is a
		  framework developed for modeling information access based
		  on the probabilistic formalism of quantum physics. The QIA
		  framework not only points out the limitations of the
		  current LSA-based approaches, but motivates a new
		  principled criterium to tackle multidocument summarization
		  that addresses these limitations. As a byproduct, it also
		  provides a way to enhance the LSA-based approaches.
		  Extensive experiments on the DUC 2005, 2006 and 2007
		  datasets show that the proposed approach consistently
		  improves over both the LSA-based approaches and the systems
		  that competed in the yearly DUC competitions. This
		  demonstrates the potential impact of quantum-inspired

		  four top level categories and 13 subcategories represents

		  conducted on a corpus of 1,703 messages using email samples
		  of two managers. Using the k-NN (k-nearest neighbor)
		  algorithm, statistical treatments automatically classified
		  the email according to lexical and nonlexical features
		  representative of managers' triage patterns. The automatic
		  classification of email according to the lexicon of the

		  form a representative search query out of the query patent
		  and is found to be more effective than is using any number

		  combining terms extracted from different fields of the
		  query patent by giving higher importance to terms extracted
		  from the abstract, claims, and description fields than to
		  terms extracted from the title field is more effective than
		  treating all extracted terms equally while forming the

  abstract	= {A critical part of a scientific activity is to discern how
		  a new idea is related to what we know and what may become
		  possible. As the number of new scientific publications
		  arrives at a rate that rapidly outpaces our capacity of
		  reading, analyzing, and synthesizing scientific knowledge,
		  we need to augment ourselves with information that can
		  effectively guide us through the rapidly growing
		  intellectual space. In this article, we address a
		  fundamental issue concerning what kinds of information may
		  serve as early signs of potentially valuable ideas. In
		  particular, we are interested in information that is
		  routinely available and derivable upon the publication of a
		  scientific paper without assuming the availability of
		  additional information such as its usage and citations. We
		  propose a theoretical and computational model that predicts
		  the potential of a scientific publication in terms of the
		  degree to which it alters the intellectual structure of the
		  state of the art. The structural variation approach focuses
		  on the novel boundary-spanning connections introduced by a
		  new article to the intellectual space. We validate the role
		  of boundary-spanning in predicting future citations using
		  three metrics of structural variation—namely, modularity
		  change rate, cluster linkage, and Centrality
		  Divergence—along with more commonly studied predictors of
		  citations such as the number of coauthors, the number of
		  cited references, and the number of pages. Main effects of
		  these factors are estimated for five cases using
		  zero-inflated negative binomial regression models of
		  citation counts. Key findings indicate that (a) structural
		  variations measured by cluster linkage are a better
		  predictor of citation counts than are the more commonly
		  studied variables such as the number of references cited,
		  (b) the number of coauthors and the number of references
		  are both good predictors of global citation counts to a
		  lesser extent, and (c) the Centrality Divergence metric is
		  potentially valuable for detecting boundary-spanning
		  activities at interdisciplinary levels. The structural
		  variation approach offers a new way to monitor and discern
		  the potential of newly published papers in context. The
		  boundary-spanning mechanism offers a conceptually
		  simplified and unifying explanation of the roles played by
		  commonly studied extrinsic properties of a publication in

  abstract	= {YouTube is one of the world's most popular websites and
		  hosts numerous amateur and professional videos. Comments on
		  these videos might be researched to give insights into
		  audience reactions to important issues or particular
		  videos. Yet, little is known about YouTube discussions in
		  general: how frequent they are, who typically participates,
		  and the role of sentiment. This article fills this gap
		  through an analysis of large samples of text comments on
		  YouTube videos. The results identify patterns and give some
		  benchmarks against which future YouTube research into
		  individual videos can be compared. For instance, the
		  typical YouTube comment was mildly positive, was posted by
		  a 29-year-old male, and contained 58 characters. About 23%
		  of comments in the complete comment sets were replies to
		  previous comments. There was no typical density of
		  discussion on YouTube videos in the sense of the proportion
		  of replies to other comments: videos with both few and many
		  replies were common. The YouTube audience engaged with each
		  other disproportionately when making negative comments,
		  however; positive comments elicited few replies. The
		  biggest trigger of discussion seemed to be religion,
		  whereas the videos attracting the least discussion were
		  predominantly from the Music, Comedy, and How to &amp;
		  Style categories. This suggests different audience uses for
		  YouTube, from passive entertainment to active debating. ©

		  An online survey questionnaire was distributed to top and

		  Findings show that altruism is the most influential

		  motivations, such as reputation or reciprocity, although
		  there are some variations across different groups of

		  Significant differences were observed during query

		  management also rises. Community management has three main
		  purposes: to create a positive experience for existing
		  participants, to promote appropriate, socionormative

		  contributions. Research indicates that the quality of

		  study examines 240 medical-image descriptions produced by
		  three different groups of medical-image users (novices,

		  This article reports several important findings: First, the
		  effect of domain knowledge has a significant relationship
		  with the use of semantic image attributes in image-users'
		  descriptions. We found that experts employ more high-level
		  image attributes which require high-reasoning or diagnostic
		  knowledge to search for a medical image (Abstract Objects
		  and Scenes) than do novices; novices are more likely to
		  describe some basic objects which do not require much
		  radiological knowledge to search for an image they need
		  (Generic Objects) than are experts. Second, all image users
		  in this study prefer to use image attributes of the
		  semantic levels to represent the image that they desired to
		  find, especially using those specific-level and
		  scene-related attributes. Third, image attributes generated
		  by medical-image users can be mapped to all levels of the
		  pyramid model that was developed to structure visual
		  information. Therefore, the pyramid model could be
		  considered a robust instrument for indexing medical

  abstract	= {Social media is frequently used as a platform for the
		  exchange of information and opinions as well as propaganda
		  dissemination. But online content can be misused for the
		  distribution of illicit information, such as violent
		  postings in web forums. Illicit content is highly
		  distributed in social media, while non-illicit content is
		  unspecific and topically diverse. It is costly and time
		  consuming to label a large amount of illicit content
		  (positive examples) and non-illicit content (negative
		  examples) to train classification systems. Nevertheless, it
		  is relatively easy to obtain large volumes of unlabeled
		  content in social media. In this article, an artificial
		  immune system-based technique is presented to address the
		  difficulties in the illicit content identification in
		  social media. Inspired by the positive selection principle
		  in the immune system, we designed a novel labeling
		  heuristic based on partially supervised learning to extract
		  high-quality positive and negative examples from unlabeled
		  datasets. The empirical evaluation results from two large
		  hate group web forums suggest that our proposed approach
		  generally outperforms the benchmark techniques and exhibits
		  more stable performance. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract	= {This article presents a search-intent-based method to
		  generate pornographic blacklists for collaborative
		  cyberporn filtering. A novel porn-detection framework that
		  can find newly appearing pornographic web pages by mining
		  search query logs is proposed. First, suspected queries are
		  identified along with their clicked URLs by an
		  automatically constructed lexicon. Then, a candidate URL is
		  determined if the number of clicks satisfies majority
		  voting rules. Finally, a candidate whose URL contains at
		  least one categorical keyword will be included in a
		  blacklist. Several experiments are conducted on an MSN
		  search porn dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our
		  method. The resulting blacklist generated by our
		  search-intent-based method achieves high precision (0.701)
		  while maintaining a favorably low false-positive rate
		  (0.086). The experiments of a real-life filtering
		  simulation reveal that our proposed method with its
		  accumulative update strategy can achieve 44.15% of a
		  macro-averaging blocking rate, when the update frequency is
		  set to 1 day. In addition, the overblocking rates are less
		  than 9% with time change due to the strong advantages of
		  our search-intent-based method. This user-behavior-oriented
		  method can be easily applied to search engines for
		  incorporating only implicit collective intelligence from
		  query logs without other efforts. In practice, it is
		  complementary to intelligent content analysis for keeping
		  up with the changing trails of objectionable websites from
		  users' perspectives. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  abstract	= {In plagiarism detection (PD) systems, two important
		  problems should be considered: the problem of retrieving
		  candidate documents that are globally similar to a document
		  q under investigation, and the problem of side-by-side
		  comparison of q and its candidates to pinpoint plagiarized
		  fragments in detail. In this article, the authors
		  investigate the usage of structural information of
		  scientific publications in both problems, and the
		  consideration of citation evidence in the second problem.
		  Three statistical measures namely Inverse Generic Class
		  Frequency, Spread, and Depth are introduced to assign a
		  degree of importance (i.e., weight) to structural
		  components in scientific articles. A term-weighting scheme
		  is adjusted to incorporate component-weight factors, which
		  is used to improve the retrieval of potential sources of
		  plagiarism. A plagiarism screening process is applied based
		  on a measure of resemblance, in which component-weight
		  factors are exploited to ignore less or nonsignificant
		  plagiarism cases. Using the notion of citation evidence,
		  parts with proper citation evidence are excluded, and
		  remaining cases are suspected and used to calculate the
		  similarity index. The authors compare their approach to two
		  flat-based baselines, TF-IDF weighting with a Cosine
		  coefficient, and shingling with a Jaccard coefficient. In
		  both baselines, they use different comparison units with
		  overlapping measures for plagiarism screening. They
		  conducted extensive experiments using a dataset of 15,412
		  documents divided into 8,657 source publications and 6,755
		  suspicious queries, which included 18,147 plagiarism cases
		  inserted automatically. Component-weight factors are
		  assessed using precision, recall, and F-measure averaged
		  over a 10-fold cross-validation and compared using the
		  ANOVA statistical test. Results from structural-based
		  candidate retrieval and plagiarism detection are evaluated
		  statistically against the flat baselines using paired-t
		  tests on 10-fold cross-validation runs, which demonstrate
		  the efficacy achieved by the proposed framework. An
		  empirical study on the system's response shows that
		  structural information, unlike existing plagiarism
		  detectors, helps to flag significant plagiarism cases,
		  improve the similarity index, and provide human-like
		  plagiarism screening results. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

		  Although most sentiment analysis addresses commercial
		  tasks, such as extracting opinions from product reviews,
		  there is increasing interest in the affective dimension of
		  the social web, and Twitter in particular. Most sentiment
		  analysis algorithms are not ideally suited to this task
		  because they exploit indirect indicators of sentiment that
		  can reflect genre or topic instead. Hence, such algorithms
		  used to process social web texts can identify spurious
		  sentiment patterns caused by topics rather than affective
		  phenomena. This article assesses an improved version of the
		  algorithm SentiStrength for sentiment strength detection
		  across the social web that primarily uses direct
		  indications of sentiment. The results from six diverse
		  social web data sets (MySpace, Twitter, YouTube, Digg,
		  RunnersWorld, BBCForums) indicate that SentiStrength 2 is
		  successful in the sense of performing better than a
		  baseline approach for all data sets in both supervised and
		  unsupervised cases. SentiStrength is not always better than
		  machine-learning approaches that exploit indirect
		  indicators of sentiment, however, and is particularly
		  weaker for positive sentiment in news-related discussions.

		  information source for superior image search and retrieval
		  experiences. Although various heuristics are valuable to
		  boost tag-based search for images, there is a lack of
		  general framework to study the impact of these heuristics.
		  Specifically, the task of ranking images matching a given
		  tag query based on their associated tags in descending
		  order of relevance has not been well studied. In this
		  article, we take the first step to propose a generic,
		  flexible, and extensible framework for this task and
		  exploit it for a systematic and comprehensive empirical
		  evaluation of various methods for ranking images. To this
		  end, we identified five orthogonal dimensions to quantify
		  the matching score between a tagged image and a tag query.
		  These five dimensions are: (i) tag relatedness to measure
		  the degree of effectiveness of a tag describing the tagged
		  image; (ii) tag discrimination to quantify the degree of
		  discrimination of a tag with respect to the entire tagged
		  image collection; (iii) tag length normalization analogous
		  to document length normalization in web search; (iv)
		  tag-query matching model for the matching score computation
		  between an image tag and a query tag; and (v) query model
		  for tag query rewriting. For each dimension, we identify a
		  few implementations and evaluate their impact on
		  <span>NUS-WIDE</span> dataset, the largest human-annotated
		  dataset consisting of more than 269K tagged images from
		  <span>Flickr</span>. We evaluated 81 single-tag queries and
		  443 multi-tag queries over 288 search methods and
		  systematically compare their performances using standard
		  metrics including Precision at top-K, Mean Average
		  Precision (<span>MAP</span>), Recall, and Normalized
		  Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).(This work was done

  abstract	= {Biomedical decision making often requires relevant
		  evidence from the biomedical literature. Retrieval of the
		  evidence calls for a system that receives a natural
		  language query for a biomedical information need and, among
		  the huge amount of texts retrieved for the query, ranks
		  relevant texts higher for further processing. However,
		  state-of-the-art text rankers have weaknesses in dealing
		  with biomedical queries, which often consist of several
		  correlating concepts and prefer those texts that completely
		  talk about the concepts. In this article, we present a
		  technique, Proximity-Based Ranker Enhancer (PRE), to
		  enhance text rankers by term-proximity information. PRE
		  assesses the term frequency (TF) of each term in the text
		  by integrating three types of term proximity to measure the
		  contextual completeness of query terms appearing in nearby
		  areas in the text being ranked. Therefore, PRE may serve as
		  a preprocessor for (or supplement to) those rankers that
		  consider TF in ranking, without the need to change the
		  algorithms and development processes of the rankers.
		  Empirical evaluation shows that PRE significantly improves
		  various kinds of text rankers, and when compared with
		  several state-of-the-art techniques that enhance rankers by
		  term-proximity information, PRE may more stably and
		  significantly enhance the rankers. © 2011 Wiley

		  researcher's specific impact (i.e., impact per paper) as
		  much as it is a measure of overall impact. While this is
		  true for the productive “core” of publications, it can
		  be argued that the g-index does not differ from the square
		  root of the total number of citations in a bibliometrically
		  meaningful way when the entire publication list is
		  considered. The R-index also has a tendency to follow total
		  impact, leaving only the A-index as a true measure of
		  specific impact. The main difference between the g-index
		  and the h-index is that the former penalizes consistency of
		  impact whereas the latter rewards such consistency. It is
		  concluded that the h-index is a better bibliometric tool
		  than is the g-index, and that the square root of the total
		  number of citations is a convenient measure of a

		  Journal of the American Society for Information Science and
		  Technology differ by a factor of 2 in terms of their
		  respective impact factors (IF), but the journal with the
		  lower IF has the higher impact. Using percentile ranks

  abstract	= {Is Web 2.0 more than a buzzword? In recent years,
		  technologists and others have heatedly debated this
		  question, even in Wikipedia, itself an example of Web 2.0.
		  From the perspective of the present study, Web 2.0 may
		  indeed be a buzzword, but more substantially it is also an
		  example of an organizing vision that drives a community's
		  discourse about certain new Information Technology (IT),
		  serving to advance the technology's adoption and diffusion.
		  Every organizing vision has a career that reflects its
		  construction over time, and in the present study we examine
		  Web 2.0's career as captured in its Wikipedia entry over a
		  5-year period, finding that it falls into three distinct
		  periods termed Germination, Growth, and Maturation. The
		  findings reveal how Wikipedia, as a discourse vehicle,
		  treats new IT and its many buzzwords, and more broadly
		  captures the careers of their organizing visions. Too, they
		  further our understanding of Wikipedia as a new
		  encyclopedic form, providing novel insights into its uses,
		  its community of contributors, and their editing
		  activities, as well as the dynamics of article

		  article titles in order to reveal the cognitive structure
		  of Library and Information Science (LIS). The use of title
		  words to elucidate the cognitive structure of LIS has been
		  relatively neglected. The present study addresses this gap
		  by performing (a) co-word analysis and hierarchical
		  clustering, (b) multidimensional scaling, and (c)
		  determination of trends in usage of terms. The study is
		  based on 10,344 articles published between 1988 and 2007 in
		  16 LIS journals. Methodologically, novel aspects of this
		  study are: (a) its large scale, (b) removal of non-specific
		  title words based on the “word concentration” measure
		  (c) identification of the most frequent terms that include
		  both single words and phrases, and (d) presentation of the
		  relative frequencies of terms using “heatmaps”.
		  Conceptually, our analysis reveals that LIS consists of
		  three main branches: the traditionally recognized
		  library-related and information-related branches, plus an
		  equally distinct bibliometrics/scientometrics branch. The
		  three branches focus on: libraries, information, and
		  science, respectively. In addition, our study identifies
		  substructures within each branch. We also tentatively
		  identify “information seeking behavior” as a branch
		  that is establishing itself separate from the three main
		  branches. Furthermore, we find that cognitive concepts in
		  LIS evolve continuously, with no stasis since 1992. The
		  most rapid development occurred between 1998 and 2001,
		  influenced by the increased focus on the Internet. The
		  change in the cognitive landscape is found to be driven by
		  the emergence of new information technologies, and the

		  help to compensate the shortcoming of the standard training
		  dataset. The new idea proposed in the present article is
		  based on extending the feature vector by adding some words

		  feature vector by applying secondary feature selection to
		  discard inappropriate features. In fact, a phase of
		  secondary feature selection is applied to choose more

		  efficiency of the classifier. To evaluate the proposed
		  system, a corpus is gathered from the Farsi Wikipedia
		  website and some articles in the Hamshahri newspaper, the
		  Roshd periodical, and the Soroush magazine. In addition to
		  studying the role of a thesaurus and applying secondary
		  feature selection, the effect of a various number of
		  categories, size of the training dataset, and average
		  number of words in the test data also are examined. As the
		  results indicate, classification efficiency improves by

		  model (T. Saracevic &amp; K.B. Kantor, 1997), we developed
		  a tool called the Information Assessment Method to more
		  clearly understand how physicians use clinical information.
		  In primary healthcare, we conducted a naturalistic and
		  longitudinal study of searches for clinical information.
		  Forty-one family physicians received a handheld computer
		  with the Information Assessment Method linked to one
		  commercial electronic knowledge resource. Over an average
		  of 320 days, 83% of 2,131 searches for clinical information
		  were rated using the Information Assessment Method.
		  Searches to address a clinical question, as well as the

		  patient. Searches done out of curiosity were negatively
		  associated with the use of clinical information. We found
		  significant associations between specific types of
		  cognitive impact and information use for a specific
		  patient. For example, when the physician reported “My
		  practice was changed and improved” as a result of this
		  clinical information, the odds that information was used
		  for a specific patient increased threefold. Our findings

		  publications (ARIST, IP&amp;M, JAMIA, JASIST, MISQ, and
		  Scientometrics) over the last three decades. Logistic
		  regression tested the relationships between citations
		  received and seven factors: authorship type, author's
		  subregion, country income level, publication year, number
		  of authors, document type, and journal title. The main
		  authorship type since 1995 was national collaboration. It
		  was also the dominant type for all publications studied

		  citation counts, the logistic regression analysis found all
		  seven factors were significant. Papers that included

		  We aim to go beyond the bag-of-words approach to document

		  that relevant documents are distinguishable from
		  nonrelevant ones by sequential patterns of relevance

		  relevance flow, which refers to a stream of sentence-query
		  relevance within a document. We then present a framework to
		  learn a function for ranking documents effectively based on
		  various features extracted from their relevance flows and
		  leverage the output to enhance existing retrieval models.
		  We validate the effectiveness of our approach by performing
		  a number of retrieval experiments on three standard test
		  collections, each comprising a different type of document:
		  news articles, medical references, and blog posts.
		  Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach

		  that utilizes tag co-occurrence information to re-rank the

  abstract	= {Bias quantification of retrieval functions with the help
		  of document retrievability scores has recently evolved as
		  an important evaluation measure for recall-oriented
		  retrieval applications. While numerous studies have
		  evaluated retrieval bias of retrieval functions, solid
		  validation of its impact on realistic types of queries is
		  still limited. This is due to the lack of well-accepted
		  criteria for query generation for estimating
		  retrievability. Commonly, random queries are used for
		  approximating documents retrievability due to the
		  prohibitively large query space and time involved in
		  processing all queries. Additionally, a cumulative
		  retrievability score of documents over all queries is used
		  for analyzing retrieval functions (retrieval) bias.
		  However, this approach does not consider the difference

		  article provides an in-depth study of retrievability over
		  different QCs. It analyzes the correlation of lower/higher
		  retrieval bias with different query characteristics. The

		  strongly influenced by how much information the digital

		  information seeking from digital knowledge repositories,

  abstract	= {Large online social rating networks (e.g., Epinions,
		  Blippr) have recently come into being containing
		  information related to various types of products.
		  Typically, each product in these networks is associated
		  with a group of members who have provided ratings and
		  comments on it. These people form a product community. A
		  potential member can join a product community by giving a
		  new rating to the product. We refer to this phenomenon of a
		  product community's ability to “attract” new members as
		  product affinity. The knowledge of a ranked list of
		  products based on product affinity is of much importance
		  for implementing policies, marketing research, online
		  advertisement, and other applications. In this article, we
		  identify and analyze an array of features that exert effect
		  on product affinity and propose a novel model, called
		  AffRank, that utilizes these features to predict the future
		  rank of products according to their affinities. Evaluated
		  on two real-world datasets, we demonstrate the
		  effectiveness and superior prediction quality of AffRank
		  compared with baseline methods. Our experiments show that
		  features such as affinity rank history, affinity evolution
		  distance, and average rating are the most important factors
		  affecting future rank of products. At the same time,
		  interestingly, traditional community features (e.g.,
		  community size, member connectivity, and social context)

		  word chains, and holonyms, that exist between terms in Text
		  Retrieval Conference queries and those in their supporting
		  sentences in the Advanced Question Answering for
		  Intelligence (Graff, 2002) corpus. The most frequently
		  occurring relationship type was the hypernym (e.g.,
		  Katherine Hepburn is an actress). The aim of the present
		  work, therefore, was to develop a method for determining a
		  person's occupation from syntactic data in a text corpus.
		  First, in the P-System, we compared predicate–argument
		  data involving a proper name for different occupations
		  using Okapi's BM25 weighting algorithm. When classifying
		  actors and using sufficiently frequent names, an accuracy
		  of 0.955 was attained. For evaluation purposes, we also
		  implemented a standard apposition-based classifier
		  (A-System). This performs well, but only if a particular
		  name happens to appear in apposition with the corresponding
		  occupation. Last, we created a hybrid (H-System) which
		  combines the strengths of P with those of A. Using data
		  with a minimum of 100 predicate–argument pairs, H
		  performed best with an overall lenient accuracy of 0.750
		  while A and P scored 0.615 and 0.656, respectively. We

		  dependent on three user characteristics: source experience,

		  the information being used in trust judgments; namely

		  judgments of novices remained mostly unchanged. Moreover,
		  despite the influence of accuracy, the percentage of
		  trusting participants, both experts and novices, was high

  abstract	= {This article proposes a theory of information need for

		  denotes the start state for someone seeking information,
		  which includes information search using an IR system. There
		  are two perspectives on information need. The dominant,
		  computer science perspective is that the user needs to find
		  an answer to a well-defined question which is easy for the
		  user to formulate into a query to the system. Ironically,
		  information science's best known model of information need
		  (Taylor, 1968) deems it to be a “black
		  box”—unknowable and nonspecifiable by the user in a
		  query to the information system. Information science has
		  instead devoted itself to studying eight adjacent or
		  surrogate concepts (information seeking, search and use;
		  problem, problematic situation and task; sense making and
		  evolutionary adaptation/information foraging). Based on an
		  analysis of these eight adjacent/surrogate concepts, we
		  create six testable propositions for a theory of
		  information need. The central assumption of the theory is
		  that while computer science sees IR as an information- or
		  answer-finding system, focused on the user finding an
		  answer, an information science or user-oriented theory of
		  information need envisages a knowledge
		  formulation/acquisition system. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals,

		  considerable interest to library and information science

		  lose their autonomy, that the understanding of theory and

		  the social sciences? Although numerous articles have
		  suggested that research has become more interdisciplinary,
		  yet no study has compared the extent to which the
		  interdisciplinarity of different social science subjects
		  has changed. To address this gap, changes in the level of
		  interdisciplinarity since 1980 are investigated for
		  subjects with many articles in the Social Sciences Citation
		  Index (SSCI), using the percentage of cross-disciplinary
		  citing documents (PCDCD) to evaluate interdisciplinarity.
		  For the 14 SSCI subjects investigated, the median level of
		  interdisciplinarity, as measured using cross-disciplinary
		  citations, declined from 1980 to 1990, but rose sharply
		  between 1990 and 2000, confirming previous research. This
		  increase was not fully matched by an increase in the
		  percentage of articles that were assigned to more than one
		  subject category. Nevertheless, although on average the

		  interdisciplinary, the extent of this change varies
		  substantially from subject to subject. The SSCI subject
		  with the largest increase in interdisciplinarity between

		  In, it has become important to understand the effect of

		  allow various relationships between askers and answerers as
		  well as among answerers. This study classifies social ties
		  in CKSs into three kinds of ties: answering ties,
		  co-answering ties, and getting answers ties. This study
		  examines the influence of the structural and relational

		  centrality of the answering ties significantly influences
		  the quality of answers while the average strength of the

  abstract	= {Web data repositories usually contain references to
		  thousands of real-world entities from multiple sources. It
		  is not uncommon that multiple entities share the same label
		  (polysemes) and that distinct label variations are
		  associated with the same entity (synonyms), which
		  frequently leads to ambiguous interpretations. Further,
		  spelling variants, acronyms, abbreviated forms, and
		  misspellings compound to worsen the problem. Solving this
		  problem requires identifying which labels correspond to the
		  same real-world entity, a process known as entity
		  resolution. One approach to solve the entity resolution
		  problem is to associate an authority identifier and a list
		  of variant forms with each entity—a data structure known
		  as an authority file. In this work, we propose a generic
		  framework for implementing a method for generating
		  authority files. Our method uses information from the Web
		  to improve the quality of the authority file and, because
		  of that, is referred to as WER—Web-based Entity
		  Resolution. Our contribution here is threefold: (a) we
		  discuss how to implement the WER framework, which is
		  flexible and easy to adapt to new domains; (b) we run
		  extended experimentation with our WER framework to show
		  that it outperforms selected baselines; and (c) we compare
		  the results of a specialized solution for author name
		  resolution with those produced by the generic WER
		  framework, and show that the WER results remain

  abstract	= {Studying scientific collaboration using coauthorship
		  networks has attracted much attention in recent years. How
		  and in what context two authors collaborate remain among
		  the major questions. Previous studies, however, have
		  focused on either exploring the global topology of
		  coauthorship networks (macro perspective) or ranking the
		  impact of individual authors (micro perspective). Neither
		  of them has provided information on the context of the
		  collaboration between two specific authors, which may

		  proposes a novel method (meso perspective) to analyze
		  scientific collaboration, in which a contextual subgraph is

		  defined as a small subgraph of a large-scale coauthorship
		  network that captures relationship and context between two
		  coauthors. This method is applied to the field of library
		  and information science. Topological properties of all the
		  subgraphs in four time spans are investigated, including

		  power, and information) tend to override space of places.
		  Information and communication technology infrastructures,
		  cognitive infrastructures (as groundwork of knowledge
		  cities and creative cities), and city-level knowledge
		  management are of great importance. Digital libraries
		  provide access to the global explicit knowledge. The

		  of 20 years since the term was first published. Searches
		  for the terms embryo, blastocyst, preimplantation embryo,
		  and preembryo were performed. Then, Boolean operators were
		  applied to measure associations between terms. Finally,
		  statistical assessments were made to compare the use of
		  each term in the scientific literature, and in specific
		  areas where preembryo is most used. From a total of 93,019
		  registers, 90,888 corresponded to embryo; 8,366 to
		  blastocyst; 2,397 to preimplantation embryo; and 172 to
		  preembryo. The use frequency for preembryo was 2:1000. The

		  (343) in comparison with the others (25,448; 5,530; and

		  scientific community, probably because it is confusing or
		  inadequate. The authors suggest that its use in the
		  scientific literature should be avoided in future
		  publications. The bibliometric analysis confirms this

		  trigger model—originally developed for incorporating
		  distant word dependencies—in order to model the
		  characteristics of personal opinions that cannot be
		  properly modeled by standard n-grams. Our primary
		  assumption is that there are two constituents to form a
		  subjective opinion. One is the subject of the opinion or
		  the object that the opinion is about, and the other is a
		  subjective expression; the former is regarded as a
		  triggering word and the latter as a triggered word. We

		  Conference Blog track test collections show that, when used
		  for reranking initial search results, our proposed model
		  significantly improves opinionated document retrieval. In
		  addition, we report on an experiment on dynamic adaptation
		  of the model to a given query, which is found effective for
		  most of the difficult queries categorized under politics
		  and organizations. We also demonstrate that, without any

		  assumes that the top-ranked documents from the first-pass

		  to extract true articles from the large amount of the

  abstract	= {An innovative model to measure the influence among

		  is based on the path analysis of a journal citation
		  network, and its output is a journal influence matrix that
		  describes the directed influence among all journals. Based
		  on this model, an index of journals' overall influence, the
		  quality-structure index (QSI), is derived. Journal ranking
		  based on QSI has the advantage of accounting for both
		  intrinsic journal quality and the structural position of a
		  journal in a citation network. The QSI also integrates the
		  characteristics of two prevailing streams of
		  journal-assessment measures: those based on bibliometric
		  statistics to approximate intrinsic journal quality, such
		  as the Journal Impact Factor, and those using a journal's
		  structural position based on the PageRank-type of
		  algorithm, such as the Eigenfactor score. Empirical results
		  support our finding that the new index is significantly
		  closer to scholars' subjective perception of journal
		  influence than are the two aforementioned measures. In
		  addition, the journal influence matrix offers a new way to
		  measure two-way influences between any two academic
		  journals, hence establishing a theoretical basis for future

		  reorganization of document categories that a user has
		  created previously. As documents are available in
		  increasing quantities and accelerating frequencies, the
		  manual approach to reorganizing document categories becomes
		  prohibitively tedious and ineffective, thus making a
		  system-oriented approach appealing. Previous research
		  (Larsen &amp; Aone, 1999; Pantel &amp; Lin, 2002) largely
		  has followed the category-discovery approach, which groups
		  documents by using a document-clustering technique to
		  partition a document corpus. This approach does not
		  consider existing categories a user created previously,
		  which in effect reflect his or her document-grouping
		  preference. A handful of studies (Wei, Hu, &amp; Dong,

		  category-evolution approach to develop lexicon-based
		  techniques for preserving user preference in
		  document-category reorganizations, but have serious
		  limitations. Responding to the significance of
		  document-category reorganizations and addressing the
		  fundamental problems of salient, lexicon-based techniques,
		  we develop an ontology-based category evolution (ONCE), a
		  technique that first enriches a concept hierarchy by
		  incorporating important concept descriptors (jointly
		  referred to as an ontology) and then employs the resulting
		  enriched ontology to support category evolutions at a
		  concept level rather than analyzing and comparing feature
		  vectors at the lexicon level. We empirically evaluate our
		  proposed technique and compare it with two benchmark
		  techniques: CE2 (a lexicon-based category-evolution
		  technique) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC;
		  a conventional hierarchical document-clustering technique).
		  Overall, our results show that the ONCE technique is more
		  effective than are CE2 and HAC, across all the scenarios
		  studied. Furthermore, the completeness of a concept
		  hierarchy has important impacts on the performance of the
		  proposed technique. Our results have some important

		  relevant documents. Empirical results show that the
		  proposed framework improves the performance of several
		  existing diversification methods. The framework also gives
		  rise to a simple yet effective cluster-based approach to
		  result diversification that selects documents from
		  different clusters to be included in a ranked list in a
		  round robin fashion. We describe a set of experiments aimed
		  at thoroughly analyzing the behavior of the two main
		  components of the proposed diversification framework,
		  ranking and selecting clusters for diversification. Both
		  components have a crucial impact on the overall performance
		  of our framework, but ranking clusters plays a more
		  important role than selecting clusters. We also examine
		  properties that clusters should have in order for our
		  diversification framework to be effective. Most relevant
		  documents should be contained in a small number of
		  high-quality clusters, while there should be no dominantly
		  large clusters. Also, documents from these high-quality
		  clusters should have a diverse content. These properties
		  are strongly correlated with the overall performance of the

		  among fields. Can these drawbacks be counteracted by
		  fractionally counting citation weights instead of using
		  whole numbers in the numerators? (a) Fractional citation
		  counts are normalized in terms of the citing sources and
		  thus would take into account differences in citation
		  behavior among fields of science. (b) Differences in the

		  their significance at different levels of aggregation. (c)

		  provides a TREC-like platform for evaluating

		  has been using a set of precision-recall based metrics for
		  its ad hoc tasks. The authors investigate the reliability
		  and robustness of these focused retrieval measures, and of
		  the INEX pooling method. They explore four specific
		  questions: How reliable are the metrics when assessments
		  are incomplete, or when query sets are small? What is the
		  minimum pool/query-set size that can be used to reliably
		  evaluate systems? Can the INEX collections be used to
		  fairly evaluate “new” systems that did not participate
		  in the pooling process? And, for a fixed amount of
		  assessment effort, would this effort be better spent in
		  thoroughly judging a few queries, or in judging many
		  queries relatively superficially? The authors' findings
		  validate properties of precision-recall-based metrics
		  observed in document retrieval settings. Early precision
		  measures are found to be more error-prone and less stable
		  under incomplete judgments and small topic-set sizes. They
		  also find that system rankings remain largely unaffected
		  even when assessment effort is substantially (but
		  systematically) reduced, and confirm that the INEX
		  collections remain usable when evaluating nonparticipating
		  systems. Finally, they observe that for a fixed amount of
		  effort, judging shallow pools for many queries is better
		  than judging deep pools for a smaller set of queries.
		  However, when judging only a random sample of a pool, it is
		  better to completely judge fewer topics than to partially

		  (Smyth, 2010) have elaborated the importance of

		  document‐level maps of science. To create a local map,
		  one defines and directly maps a sample of data, such as all
		  literature published in a set of information science
		  journals. To create a global map of a research field, one
		  maps “all of science” and then locates a literature
		  sample within that full context. We provide a deductive
		  argument that global mapping should create more accurate
		  partitions of a research field than does local mapping,
		  followed by practical reasons why this may not be so. The
		  field of information science is then mapped at the document
		  level using both local and global methods to provide a case
		  illustration of the differences between the methods.
		  Textual coherence is used to assess the accuracies of both
		  maps. We find that document clusters in the global map have
		  significantly higher coherence than do those in the local
		  map, and that the global map provides unique insights into
		  the field of information science that cannot be discerned
		  from the local map. Specifically, we show that information
		  science and computer science have a large interface and
		  that computer science is the more progressive discipline at
		  that interface. We also show that research communities in
		  temporally linked threads have a much higher coherence than
		  do isolated communities, and that this feature can be used
		  to predict which threads will persist into a subsequent
		  year. Methods that could increase the accuracy of both
		  local and global maps in the future also are discussed. ©

		  second‐order, reflective construct that has a significant
		  direct and indirect impact on continuance intentions in the
		  context of mHealth information services. It also confirms
		  that consumer trust plays the key, mediating role between
		  trustworthiness and continuance intentions, while
		  trustworthiness does not have any moderating influence in
		  the relationship between consumer trust and continuance
		  intentions. Overall, the authors conclude by discussing
		  conceptual contributions, methodological implications,
		  limitations, and future research directions of the study.

  abstract	= {The mapping of scientific fields, based on principles
		  established in the seventies, has recently shown a
		  remarkable development and applications are now booming
		  with progress in computing efficiency. We examine here the
		  convergence of two thematic mapping approaches,
		  citation‐based and word‐based, which rely on quite
		  different sociological backgrounds. A corpus in the
		  nanoscience field was broken down into research themes,
		  using the same clustering technique on the 2 networks
		  separately. The tool for comparison is the table of
		  intersections of the M clusters (here M=50) built on either
		  side. A classical visual exploitation of such contingency
		  tables is based on correspondence analysis. We investigate
		  a rearrangement of the intersection table (block modeling),
		  resulting in pseudo‐map. The interest of this
		  representation for confronting the two breakdowns is
		  discussed. The amount of convergence found is, in our view,
		  a strong argument in favor of the reliability of
		  bibliometric mapping. However, the outcomes are not
		  convergent at the degree where they can be substituted for
		  each other. Differences highlight the complementarity
		  between approaches based on different networks. In contrast
		  with the strong informetric posture found in recent
		  literature, where lexical and citation markers are
		  considered as miscible tokens, the framework proposed here
		  does not mix the two elements at an early stage, in
		  compliance with their contrasted logic. © 2011 Wiley

		  of whether the ranking of Wikipedia articles in search
		  engines is justified by the quality of the articles. After
		  an overview of current research on information quality in
		  Wikipedia, a summary of the extended discussion on the
		  quality of encyclopedic entries in general is given. On
		  this basis, a heuristic method for evaluating Wikipedia
		  entries is developed and applied to Wikipedia articles that
		  scored highly in a search engine retrieval effectiveness
		  test and compared with the relevance judgment of jurors. In
		  all search engines tested, Wikipedia results are
		  unanimously judged better by the jurors than other results
		  on the corresponding results position. Relevance judgments
		  often roughly correspond with the results from the
		  heuristic evaluation. Cases in which high relevance
		  judgments are not in accordance with the comparatively low
		  score from the heuristic evaluation are interpreted as an
		  indicator of a high degree of trust in Wikipedia. One of
		  the systemic shortcomings of Wikipedia lies in its
		  necessarily incoherent user model. A further tuning of the
		  suggested criteria catalog, for instance, the different
		  weighing of the supplied criteria, could serve as a
		  starting point for a user model differentiated evaluation
		  of Wikipedia articles. Approved methods of quality
		  evaluation of reference works are applied to Wikipedia

		  (hybrid) journals in the past decade, usage metrics have
		  become an interesting complement to citation metrics. In
		  this article we investigate the similarities of and
		  differences between usage and citation indicators for
		  pharmacy and pharmacology journals and relate the results
		  to a previous study on oncology journals. For the
		  comparison at journal level we use the classical citation
		  indicators as defined in the Journal Citation Reports and
		  compute the corresponding usage indicators. At the article
		  level we not only relate download and citation counts to
		  each other but also try to identify the possible effect of
		  citations upon subsequent downloads. Usage data were
		  provided by ScienceDirect both at the journal level and,
		  for a few selected journals, on a paper‐by‐paper basis.
		  The corresponding citation data were retrieved from the Web
		  of Science and Journal Citation Reports. Our analyses show
		  that electronic journals have become generally accepted
		  over the last decade. While the supply of ScienceDirect
		  pharma journals rose by 50% between 2001 and 2006, the
		  total number of article downloads (full‐text articles
		  [FTAs]) multiplied more than 5‐fold in the same period.
		  This also impacted the pattern of scholarly communication
		  (strong increase in the immediacy index) in the past few
		  years. Our results further reveal a close relation between
		  citation and download frequencies. We computed a high
		  correlation at the journal level when using absolute values
		  and a moderate to high correlation when relating usage and
		  citation impact factors. At the article level the rank
		  correlation between downloads and citations was only
		  medium‐sized. Differences between downloads and citations
		  exist in terms of obsolescence characteristics. While more
		  than half of the articles are downloaded in the publication
		  year or 1 year later, the median cited half‐life was
		  nearly 6 years for our journal sample. Our attempt to

		  marketing of aero engines for commercial and defense
		  purposes, away from the selling of products to the
		  provision of services. This research was undertaken in an
		  aerospace company, which designs and manufactures aero
		  engines and also offers contracts, under which it remains
		  responsible for the maintenance of engines. These contracts
		  allow the company to collect far more data about the
		  in-service performance of their engines than was previously
		  available. This article aims at identifying what parts of
		  this in-service information are required when components or
		  systems of existing engines need to be redesigned because
		  they have not performed as expected in service. In
		  addition, this article aims at understanding how designers
		  use this in-service information in a redesign task. In an
		  attempt to address these aims, we analyzed five case
		  studies involving redesign of components or systems of an
		  existing engine. The findings show that the in-service
		  information accessed by the designers mainly contains the
		  undesired physical actions (e.g., deterioration mechanisms,
		  deterioration effects, etc.) and the causal chains of these
		  undesired physical actions. We identified a pattern in the
		  designers' actions regarding the use of these causal
		  chains. The designers have generated several solutions that
		  utilize these causal chains seen in the in-service

  abstract	= {Hierarchical text classification (HTC) approaches have
		  recently attracted a lot of interest on the part of
		  researchers in human language technology and machine
		  learning, since they have been shown to bring about equal,
		  if not better, classification accuracy with respect to
		  their “flat” counterparts while allowing exponential
		  time savings at both learning and classification time. A
		  typical component of HTC methods is a “local” policy
		  for selecting negative examples: Given a category c, its
		  negative training examples are by default identified with
		  the training examples that are negative for c and positive
		  for the categories which are siblings of c in the
		  hierarchy. However, this policy has always been taken for
		  granted and never been subjected to careful scrutiny since
		  first proposed 15 years ago. This article proposes a
		  thorough experimental comparison between this policy and
		  three other policies for the selection of negative examples
		  in HTC contexts, one of which (BEST LOCAL (k)) is being
		  proposed for the first time in this article. We compare
		  these policies on the hierarchical versions of three
		  supervised learning algorithms (boosting, support vector
		  machines, and na\"{\i}ve Bayes) by performing experiments
		  on two standard TC datasets, REUTERS-21578 and RCV1-V2. ©

		  tools and systems assume the top-down approach to indexing
		  in which a trained professional is responsible for
		  assigning index terms to information sources with a

		  create, organize, index, and search for images and other

		  based on controlled vocabularies has the potential to

		  trend-driven, with Friendster, MySpace, and Facebook being
		  successively the most popular. Given that teens are often
		  early adopters of communication technologies, it seems
		  reasonable to assume that the typical user of any
		  particular SNS would change over time, probably becoming
		  older and covering different segments of the population.
		  This article analyzes changes in MySpace self-reported
		  member demographics and behavior from 2007 to 2010 using
		  four large samples of members and focusing on the United
		  States. The results indicate that despite its take-up rate
		  declining, with only about 1 in 10 members being active a
		  year after joining, the dominant (modal) age for active
		  U.S. members remains midadolescence, but has shifted by
		  about 2 years from 15 to 17, and the U.S. dominance of
		  MySpace is shrinking. There also has been a dramatic
		  increase in the median number of Friends for new U.S.
		  members, from 12 to 96—probably due to MySpace's
		  automated Friend Finder. Some factors show little change,
		  however, including the female majority, the 5% minority gay
		  membership, and the approximately 50% private profiles. In
		  addition, there has been an increase in the proportion of
		  Latino-Hispanic U.S. members, suggesting a shifting ethnic
		  profile. Overall, MySpace has surprisingly stable
		  membership demographics and is apparently maintaining its

		  Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Service Co. affirmed
		  originality as a constitutional requirement for copyright.
		  Originality has a specific sense and is constituted by a
		  minimal degree of creativity and independent creation. The
		  not original is the more developed concept within the
		  decision. It includes the absence of a minimal degree of
		  creativity as a major constituent. Different levels of
		  absence of creativity also are distinguished, from the
		  extreme absence of creativity to insufficient creativity.
		  There is a gestalt effect of analogy between the
		  delineation of the not original and the concept of
		  computability. More specific correlations can be found
		  within the extreme absence of creativity. “[S]o
		  mechanical” in the decision can be correlated with an
		  automatic mechanical procedure and clauses with a
		  historical resonance with understandings of computability
		  as what would naturally be regarded as computable. The

		  regarded as the product of a computational process. The

		  understanding of the extreme absence of creativity,
		  primarily through the correlations with aspects of

		  based on a Web survey of 92 Finnish corporate finance

  abstract	= {The search task and the system both affect the demand on
		  cognitive resources during information search. In some
		  situations the demands may become too high for a person.
		  This article has a three-fold goal. First, it presents and
		  critiques methods to measure cognitive load. Second, it
		  explores the distribution of load across search task
		  stages. Finally, it seeks to improve our understanding of
		  factors affecting cognitive load levels in information
		  search. To this end, a controlled Web search experiment
		  with 48 participants was conducted. Interaction logs were
		  used to segment search tasks semiautomatically into task
		  stages. Cognitive load was assessed using a new variant of
		  the dual-task method. Average cognitive load was found to
		  vary by search task stages. It was significantly higher
		  during query formulation and user description of a relevant
		  document as compared to examining search results and
		  viewing individual documents. Semantic information shown
		  next to the search results lists in one of the studied
		  interfaces was found to decrease mental demands during
		  query formulation and examination of the search results
		  list. These findings demonstrate that changes in dynamic
		  cognitive load can be detected within search tasks. Dynamic
		  assessment of cognitive load is of core interest to
		  information science because it enriches our understanding
		  of cognitive demands imposed on people engaged in the
		  search process by a task and the interactive information
		  retrieval system employed. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals,

		  decisions are involved, which makes it impossible to test

		  proportionate to the number of references in the citing
		  documents—citations can be contextualized at the paper
		  level and aggregated impacts of sets can be tested for

		  individual's research accomplishments. The aggregation of
		  individuals' measures is also the basis for global measures
		  at institutional or national levels. To investigate whether
		  the h index can be reliably computed through alternative
		  sources of citation records, the Web of Science (WoS),
		  PsycINFO and Google Scholar (GS) were used to collect
		  citation records for known publications of four Spanish
		  psychologists. Compared with WoS, PsycINFO included a
		  larger percentage of publication records, whereas GS
		  outperformed WoS and PsycINFO in this respect. Compared
		  with WoS, PsycINFO retrieved a larger number of citations
		  in unique areas of psychology, but it retrieved a smaller
		  number of citations in areas that are close to statistics
		  or the neurosciences, whereas GS retrieved the largest
		  numbers of citations in all cases. Incorrect citations were
		  scarce in Wos (0.3%), more prevalent in PsycINFO (1.1%),
		  and overwhelming in GS (16.5%). All platforms retrieved
		  unique citations, the largest set coming from GS. WoS and
		  PsycINFO cover distinct areas of psychology unevenly, thus
		  applying different penalties on the h index of researches
		  working in different fields. Obtaining fair and accurate h

		  is a difficult problem which, despite the many efforts from

		  The method successively fuses clusters of citations of

		  similarity measures on the components of the citations
		  (e.g., coauthor names, work title, and publication venue
		  title). During the disambiguation task, the information

		  The results indicate that users present different behavior

		  manually enhanced system abstracts on three criteria:
		  balance (satisfaction of the ANSI standards), fluency (text
		  coherence), and understandability (clarity). The results
		  suggest that it is possible to use the system output
		  directly without manual modification, but there are issues
		  that need to be addressed in further studies to make the
		  system a better tool. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

		  theory (Giddens, [1979] [1984]; Orlikowski, [1992] [2000])

		  used to guide investigation into the dynamics of online
		  question and answer (Q&amp;A) communities. This approach is

		  that research on online communities should take into
		  account social, technical, and contextual factors (Kling,
		  Rosenbaum, &amp; Sawyer, [2005]), the utility of this
		  approach is demonstrated with an analysis of three online

  abstract	= {Architectural design projects are heavily reliant on
		  electronic information seeking. However, there have been
		  few studies on how architects look for and use information
		  on the Web. We examined the electronic information behavior
		  of 9 postgraduate architectural design and urban design
		  students. We observed them undertake a self-chosen,
		  naturalistic information task related to one of their
		  design projects and found that although the architectural
		  students performed many similar interactive information
		  behaviors to academics and practitioners in other
		  disciplines, they also performed behaviors reflective of
		  the nature of their domain. The included exploring and
		  encountering information (in addition to searching and
		  browsing for it) and visualizing-appropriating information.
		  The observations also highlighted the importance of
		  information use behaviors (such as editing and recording)
		  and communication behaviors (such as sharing and
		  distributing) as well as the importance of multimedia
		  materials, particularly images, for architectural design
		  projects. A key overarching theme was that inspiration was
		  found to be both an important driver for and potential
		  outcome of information work in the architecture domain,
		  suggesting the need to design electronic information tools
		  for architects that encourage and foster creativity. We
		  make suggestions for the design of such tools based on our

  abstract	= {This study investigated factors that motivate or impede
		  faculty participation in self-archiving practices—the
		  placement of research work in various open access (OA)
		  venues, ranging from personal Web pages to OA archives. The
		  author's research design involves triangulation of survey
		  and interview data from 17 Carnegie doctorate universities
		  with DSpace institutional repositories. The analysis of
		  survey responses from 684 professors and 41 telephone
		  interviews identified seven significant factors: (a)
		  altruism—the idea of providing OA benefits for users; (b)
		  perceived self-archiving culture; (c) copyright concerns;
		  (d) technical skills; (e) age; (f) perception of no harmful
		  impact of self-archiving on tenure and promotion; and (g)
		  concerns about additional time and effort. The factors are
		  listed in descending order of their effect size. Age,
		  copyright concerns, and additional time and effort are
		  negatively associated with self-archiving, whereas
		  remaining factors are positively related to it. Faculty are
		  motivated by OA advantages to users, disciplinary norms,
		  and no negative influence on academic reward. However,
		  barriers to self-archiving—concerns about copyright,
		  extra time and effort, technical ability, and age—imply
		  that the provision of services to assist faculty with
		  copyright management, and with technical and logistical
		  issues, could encourage higher rates of self-archiving. ©
