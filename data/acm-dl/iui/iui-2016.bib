abstract = {In 2006, Netflix announced a $1M prize competition to advance recommendation algorithms. The recommendation problem was simplified as the accuracy in predicting a user rating measured by the Root Mean Squared Error. While that formulation helped get the attention of the research community, it put the focus on the wrong approach and metric while leaving many important factors out, in particular the UI. In this talk I will talk of the Netflix Prize as the past of recommendations. I will then describe the present from an industry perspective based on my personal experience at Netflix first and Quora now . I will describe the different components of modern recommender systems such as: personalized ranking, similarity, explanations, context-awareness, or search as recommendation. I will also review the usage of novel algorithmic approaches such as Factorization Machines, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, SimRank, Deep Neural Networks, or Listwise Learning-to-rank. We will see how those components and algorithmic approaches can be used to recommend not only movies, but also questions, answers, topics, or users.But, most importantly, I will give many examples of prototypical industrial-scale recommender systems with special focus on the user interface and its interaction with the algorithms. It is clearly in the interface of the UI and the novel algorithms where the future of recommender systems lays.},

abstract = {In centralized countries, not only population, media and economic power are concentrated, but people give more attention to central locations. While this is not inherently bad, this behavior extends to micro-blogging platforms: central locations get more attention in terms of information flow. In this paper we study the effects of an information filtering algorithm that decentralizes content in such platforms. Particularly, we found that users from non-central locations were not able to identify the geographical diversity on timelines generated by the algorithm, which were diverse by construction. To make users see the inherent diversity, we define a design rationale to approach this problem, focused on the treemap visualization technique. Then, we deployed an" in the wild" implementation of our proposed system. On one hand, we found that there are effects of centralization in exploratory user behavior. On the other hand, we found that the treemap was able to make users see the inherent geographical diversity of timelines. We measured these effects based on how users engaged with content filtered by the algorithm. With these results in mind, we propose practical actions for micro-blogging platforms to account for the differences and biased behavior induced by centralization.},

abstract = {We report on the design and evaluation of TagFlip, a novel interface for active music discovery based on social tags of music. The tool, which was built for phone-sized screens, couples high user control on the recommended music with minimal interaction effort. Contrary to conventional recommenders, which only allow the specification of seed attributes and the subsequent like/dislike of songs, we put the users in the centre of the recommendation process. With a library of 100,000 songs, TagFlip describes each played song to the user through its most popular tags on Last.fm and allows the user to easily specify which of the tags should be considered for the next song, or the next stream of songs. In a lab user study where we compared it to Spotify's mobile application, TagFlip came out on top in both subjective user experience (control, transparency, and trust) and our objective measure of number of interactions per liked song. Our users found TagFlip to be an important complementary experience to that of Spotify, enabling more active and directed discovery sessions as opposed to the mostly passive experience that traditional recommenders offer.},

In contrast to existing work, our approach is capable of extracting single products and provides categorizations for both articles and expenses, through the use of microtasks which are delegated to an unpaid crowd. To evaluate our approach, we developed a smartphone application based on a receipt analysis and an online questionnaire in which users are able to track expenses by taking photos of receipts, and solve microtasks to enhance the recognition. To provide additional motivation to solve these tasks, we make use of gamification. In a three-week-long user study (N=12), we found that our system is appreciated, that our approach reduces the error rate of captured receipts significantly, and that the gamification provided additional motivation to contribute more and thereby enrich the database.},

Command recommenders aim to increase awareness of an application's capabilities by generating personalized recommendations for new commands. A primary distinguishing characteristic of these recommenders concerns the manner in which they determine command relevance. Social approaches do so by analyzing community usage logs, whereas, task-based approaches mine web documentation for logical command clusters. Through a qualitative study with sixteen participants, in this work we explored user attitudes towards these different approaches and the supplemental information they enable.},

abstract = {Multitasking and interruptions in information work make frequent activity switches necessary. Individuals need to recall and restore earlier states of work which generally involves retrieval of information objects. To avoid resulting tooling time an activity-centric organization of information objects has been proposed. For each activity a collection with related information objects (like documents, websites etc.) is created to improve information access and serve as a memory aid. While the manual maintenance of such information collections is a tedious task and becomes an interruption on its own, the automatic maintenance of such collections using activity mining is promising. Activity mining utilizes interaction histories to extract unique activities based on the stream of interaction with information objects. For activity mining, existing work shows varying success in limited study setups. In this paper, we present a method for activity mining to generate activity-centric information object collections automatically from interaction histories. The technique is a hybrid approach considering all information types used in previous work -- activity stream and accessed content related information. Method performance is evaluated based on interaction histories collected during real work data from eight information workers collected over several weeks. For the dataset our hybrid approach shows on average a performance of 0.53 ARI up to 0.77 ARI, outperforming single metric-based approaches.},

The search system learns the user intent based on this feedback and employs it to recommend novel results. However, the amount of user feedback is very limited compared to the size of the information space to be explored. To tackle this problem, we take into account user feedback on both the retrieved items (documents) and their features (keywords). In order to combine feedback from multiple domains, we introduce a coupled multi-armed bandits algorithm, which employs a probabilistic model of the relationship between the domains. Simulation results show that with multi-domain feedback, the search system can find the relevant items in fewer iterations than with only one domain. A preliminary user study indicates improvement in user satisfaction and quality of retrieved information.},

abstract = {Player behavior during game play can be used to construct player models that help adapt the game and make it more fun for the player involved. Similarly in-game behavior could help model personality traits that describe people's attitudes in a fashion that can be stable over time and over different domains, e.g., to support health coaching, or other behavior change approaches. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of this approach by relating Need for Cognition (NfC) a personality trait that can predict the effectiveness of different persuasion strategies upon users to a commonly used game mechanic -- hints. An experiment with N=188 participants confirmed our hypothesis that NfC has a negative correlation with the number of hints players follow during the game. Future work should confirm if adherence to hints can be used as a predictor of behavior in different games, and to find other game mechanics than hints, that help predict user traits.},

abstract = {Large and high-dimensional real-world datasets are being gathered across a wide range of application disciplines to enable data-driven decision making. Interactive data visualization can play a critical role in allowing domain experts to select and analyze data from these large collections. However, there is a critical mismatch between the very large number of dimensions in complex real-world datasets and the much smaller number of dimensions that can be concurrently visualized using modern techniques. This gap in dimensionality can result in high levels of selection bias that go unnoticed by users. The bias can in turn threaten the very validity of any subsequent insights. In this paper, we present Adaptive Contextualization (AC), a novel approach to interactive visual data selection that is specifically designed to combat the invisible introduction of selection bias. Our approach (1) monitors and models a user's visual data selection activity, (2) computes metrics over that model to quantify the amount of selection bias after each step, (3) visualizes the metric results, and (4) provides interactive tools that help users assess and avoid bias-related problems. We also share results from a user study which demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique.},

Given a query, traditional blog sites return a set of conversations often consisting of thousands of comments with complex thread structure. Since the interfaces of these blog sites do not provide any overview of the data, it becomes very difficult for the user to explore and analyze such a large amount of conversational data. In this paper, we present MultiConVis, a visual text analytics system designed to support the exploration of a collection of online conversations. Our system tightly integrates NLP techniques for topic modeling and sentiment analysis with information visualizations, by considering the unique characteristics of online conversations. The resulting interface supports the user exploration, starting from a possibly large set of conversations, then narrowing down to the subset of conversations, and eventually drilling-down to the set of comments of one conversation. Our evaluations through case studies with domain experts and a formal user study with regular blog readers illustrate the potential benefits of our approach, when compared to a traditional blog reading interface.},

The topics are also analyzed to detect bursts to highlight "hot" topics during a time interval. As the user manipulates a time interval slider, the people nodes and links are dynamically updated. We evaluate the results of LDA topic modeling for the visualization by comparing topic keywords against the submitted keywords from the InfoVis 2004 Contest, and we found that the additional terms provided by LDA-based keyword sets result in improved similarity between a topic keyword set and the documents in a corpus.

As the process unfolds and new knowledge is acquired, interest drifts occur inevitably and need to be accounted for. Despite the advances in retrieval and recommender algorithms, real-world interfaces have remained largely unchanged: results are delivered in a relevance-ranked list. However, it quickly becomes cumbersome to reorganize resources along new interests, as any new search brings new results. We introduce uRank and investigate interactive methods for understanding, refining and reorganizing documents on-the-fly as information needs evolve. uRank includes views summarizing the contents of a recommendation set and interactive methods conveying the role of users' interests through a recommendation ranking. A formal evaluation showed that gathering items relevant to a particular topic of interest with uRank incurs in lower cognitive load compared to a traditional ranked list. A second study consisting in an ecological validation reports on usage patterns and usability of the various interaction techniques within a free, more natural setting.},

While multitasking during video conferencing is often necessary, it is also viewed as impolite and sometimes unacceptable. One potential contributor to negative attitudes towards such multitasking is the disrupted sense of eye contact that occurs when an individual shifts their gaze away to another screen, for example, in a dual-monitor setup, common in office settings. We present an approach to improve a sense of eye contact over videoconferencing in dual-monitor setups. Our approach uses computer vision and desktop activity detection to dynamically choose the camera with the best view of a user's face. We describe two alternative implementations of our solution (RGB-only, and a combination of RGB and RGB-D cameras). We then describe results from an online experiment that shows the potential of our approach to significantly improve perceptions of a person's politeness and engagement in the meeting.},

The model aims to narrow the gap between human and machine intelligence by providing AI agents that, in the presence of incomplete knowledge about an improv scene, can use procedural representations not only to understand human parties but also to negotiate their mental models with them. The described approach allows flexible modeling of ambiguous, non-Boolean knowledge through the use of fuzzy logic and situation calculus that allows reasoning under uncertainty in a dynamic improvisational setting.},

abstract = {Navigation systems allow drivers to find the shortest or fastest path between two or multiple locations mostly using time or distance as input parameters. Various researchers extended traditional route planning approaches by taking into account the user's preferences, such as enjoying a coastal view or alpine landscapes during a drive. Current approaches mainly rely on volunteered geographic information (VGI), such as point of interest (POI) data from OpenStreetMap, or social media data, such as geotagged photos from Flickr, to generate scenic routes. While these approaches use proximity, distribution or other spatial relationships of the data sets, they do not take into account the actual view on specific route segments. In this paper, we propose Autobahn: a system for generating scenic routes using Google Street View images to classify route segments based on their visual characteristics enhancing the driving experience. We show that this vision-based approach can complement other approaches for scenic route planning and introduce a personalized scenic route by aligning the characteristics of the route to the preferences of the user.},

We grounded the design of Mastery Grids in self-regulated learning and learning motivation theories, as well as in our past work in social comparison, OLM, and adaptive navigation support. The force behind the interface is the combination of adaptive navigation functionality with the mastery-oriented aspects of OLM and the performance-oriented aspects of social comparison. We examined different configurations of Mastery Grids in two classroom studies and report the results of analysis of log data and survey responses. The results show how Mastery Grids interacts with different factors, like gender and achievement-goal orientation, and ultimately, its impact on student engagement, performance, and motivation.},

abstract = {Trust is a significant factor in user adoption of new systems. However, although trust is a dynamic attitude of the user towards the system and changes over time, trust in intelligent systems is typically captured as a single quantitative measure at the conclusion of a task. This paper challenges this approach. We report a case study that employed a combination of repeated quantitative and qualitative measures to examine how trust in an intelligent system evolved over time and whether this varied depending on whether the system offered explanations. We discovered different patterns in participants' trust journeys. When provided with explanations, participants' trust levels initially increased, before returning to their original level. Without explanations, participants' trust reduced over time. The qualitative data showed that perceived system ability was more important in determining trust amongst with-explanation participants and perceived transparency was a greater influence on the trust of participants who did not receive explanations. The findings provide a deeper understanding of the development of user trust in intelligent systems and indicate the value of the approach adopted.},

abstract = {People are able to interact with domain-specific intelligent assistants (IAs) and get help with tasks. But sometimes user goals are complex and may require interactions with multiple applications. However current IAs are limited to specific applications and users have to directly manage execution spanning multiple applications in order to engage in more complex activities. An ideal personal agent would be able to learn, over time, about tasks that span different resources. This paper addresses the problem of cross-domain task assistance in the context of spoken dialogue systems. We propose approaches to discover users' high-level intentions and using this information to assist users in their task. We collected real-life smartphone usage data from 14 participants and investigated how to extract high-level intents from users' descriptions of their activities. Our experiments show that understanding high-level tasks allows the agent to actively suggest apps relevant to pursuing particular user goals and reduce the cost of users' self-management.},

abstract = {We present an intelligent user interface that allows people to perform rehabilitation exercises by themselves under the offline supervision of a therapist. Every year, many people suffer injuries that require rehabilitation. This entails considerable time overheads since it requires people to perform specified exercises under the direct supervision of a therapist. Therefore it is desirable that patients continue performing exercises outside the clinic (for instance at home, thus without direct supervision), to complement in-clinic physical therapy. However, to perform rehabilitation tasks accurately, patients need appropriate feedback, as otherwise provided by a physical therapist, to ensure that these unsupervised exercises are correctly executed. Different approaches address this problem, providing feedback mechanisms to aid rehabilitation. Unfortunately, test subjects frequently report having trouble to completely understand the feedback thus provided, which makes it hard to correctly execute the prescribed movements. Worse, injuries may occur due to incorrect performance of the prescribed exercises, which severely hinders recovery. SleeveAR is a novel approach to provide real-time, active feedback, using multiple projection surfaces to provide effective visualizations. Empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach as compared to traditional video-based feedback. Our experimental results show that our intelligent UI can successfully guide subjects through an exercise prescribed (and demonstrated) by a physical therapist, with performance improvements between consecutive executions, a desirable goal to successful rehabilitation.},

The criteria include not only the song's title and artist name but also its content automatically estimated by music/singing signal processing and artist-level social analysis. The artist-level social information is discovered from Wikipedia and DBpedia. With regard to manipulating playback order, existing interfaces typically allow the user to change it manually or automatically by choosing one of a few types of criteria. The proposed interface, on the other hand, deals with nine properties and multiple integrations of them (e.g., vocal gender and beats per minute). To realize the ordering by multiple criteria, a distance matrix is computed from the criteria vectors and is then used to estimate paths for ascending, descending, and random orders by applying principle component analysis or to estimate a path for a smooth order by solving the travelling salesman problem.},

abstract = {Classical reminiscence therapy has been shown to effectively enhance the stability of memory and identity in people with dementia. Typically, reminiscence therapy uses biography artifacts like photos and personal items and objects. Today, many of these artifacts are from the digital realm providing new options to adapt or even improve the purely analog therapy. In this work we propose a method to enhance reminiscence therapy by computer simulated biographic associations. Our approach provides assistance for associative reasoning on affective stimuli and thus enables access to biographic content so that no deliberate search is required. We develop a recommender model for mapping mental states to biographic content based on similarity. The system dynamically adapts its state and the depicted digital artifacts to the responses of the user. It is a first step towards an immersive reminiscence therapy which will incorporate associated stimuli on multiple channels to increase effectiveness. A preliminary study showed encouraging results concerning the usability of the system.},

Using a head-mounted display, users can levitate in a virtual world by doing meditation exercises. The system measures users' brain activity in real time via EEG and calculates estimates for the level of conCentration and relaxation. These values are then mapped into the virtual reality. In a user study of 43 subjects, we were able to show that the RelaWorld system elicits deeper relaxation, feeling of presence and a deeper level of meditation when compared to a similar setup without head-mounted display or neurofeedback.},

abstract = {Location-sharing services such as Facebook and Foursquare/Swarm have become increasingly popular, due to the ease at which users can share their locations, and participate in services, games and other applications that leverage these locations. But it is important for people who use these services to configure appropriate location-privacy preferences so that they can control to whom they want to share their location information. Manually configuring these preferences may be burdensome and confusing, and so location-privacy preference recommenders based on crowdsourcing preferences from other users have been proposed. Whether people will accept the recommended preferences acquired from other users, who they may not know or trust, has not, however, been investigated. In this paper, we present a user experiment (n=99) to explore what factors influence people's acceptance of location-privacy preference recommenders. We find that 44% of our participants have privacy concerns about such recommenders. These concerns are shown to have a negative effect (p&lt;0.001) on their acceptance of the recommendations and their satisfaction about their choices. Furthermore, users' acceptance of recommenders varies according to both context and recommendations being made. Our findings are potentially useful to designers of location-sharing services and privacy recommenders.},

abstract = {In micro-blogging platforms, people connect and interact with others. However, due to cognitive biases, they tend to interact with like-minded people and read agreeable information only. Many efforts to make people connect with those who think differently have not worked well. In this paper, we hypothesize, first, that previous approaches have not worked because they have been direct -- they have tried to explicitly connect people with those having opposing views on sensitive issues. Second, that neither recommendation or presentation of information by themselves are enough to encourage behavioral change. We propose a platform that mixes a recommender algorithm and a visualization-based user interface to explore recommendations. It recommends politically diverse profiles in terms of distance of latent topics, and displays those recommendations in a visual representation of each user's personal content. We performed an" in the wild" evaluation of this platform, and found that people explored more recommendations when using a biased algorithm instead of ours. In line with our hypothesis, we also found that the mixture of our recommender algorithm and our user interface, allowed politically interested users to exhibit an unbiased exploration of the recommended profiles. Finally, our results contribute insights in two aspects: first, which individual differences are important when designing platforms aimed at behavioral change; and second, which algorithms and user interfaces should be mixed to help users avoid cognitive mechanisms that lead to biased behavior.},

abstract = {Novice composers often find it difficult to go beyond common chord progressions. To make it easier for composers to experiment with radical chord choices, we built a creativity support tool, ChordRipple, which makes chord recommendations that aim to be both diverse and appropriate to the current context. Composers can use it to help select the next chord, or to replace sequences of chords in an internally consistent manner. To make such recommendations, we adapt a neural network model from natural language processing known as Word2Vec to the music domain. This model learns chord embeddings from a corpus of chord sequences, placing chords nearby when they are used in similar contexts. The learned embeddings support creative substitutions between chords, and also exhibit topological properties that correspond to musical structure. For example, the major and minor chords are both arranged in the latent space in shapes corresponding to the circle-of-fifths. Our structured observations with 14 music students show that the tool helped them explore a wider palette of chords, and to make "big jumps in just a few chords". It gave them "new ideas of ways to move forward in the piece", not just on a chord-to-chord level but also between phrases. Our controlled studies with 9 more music students show that more adventurous chords are adopted when composing with ChordRipple.},

Drawing from recent experience in Web search and movie recommenders, we explore the effect of temporal trends and characteristics on the ability to predict buying sessions. We suggest a new approach, based on items' temporal dynamics, together with sessions' temporal aspects for predicting whether a session is going to end up with a purchase. We suggest a model for estimating the probability of a session to end with a purchase, according to the purchase history of items clicked on during the session over the past few days. The predictions can be used by recommender systems, enabling them to take relevant actions, thus improving shoppers experience as well as increasing sales for e-commerce companies. Our findings shed light on the importance of considering temporal dynamics in items recommendations in e-commerce sites. Empirical results on imbalanced e-commerce dataset with more than nine million sessions demonstrate that we achieve high Precision, Recall and ROC in predicting whether session ends up with a purchase or not.},

In a capturing session, the server collects in realtime the viewfinder images of all devices and stitches them on-the-fly to create a panorama preview, which is then streamed to all devices as visual guidance. The system also allows one camera to be the host and send direct visual instructions to others to guide camera adjustment. When ready, all devices take pictures at the same time for panorama stitching. Our preliminary study suggests that the proposed system can help users capture high quality panoramas with an enjoyable teamwork experience.},

When they asked participants to narrate an animated film of two triangles and a circle moving in and around a box, participants described the shapes' movement in terms of human actions. Using a framework for authoring and annotating animations in the style of Heider and Simmel, we established new crowdsourced datasets where the motion trajectories of animated shapes are labeled according to the actions they depict. We applied two machine learning approaches, a spatial-temporal bag-of-words model and a recurrent neural network, to the task of automatically recognizing actions in these datasets. Our best results outperformed a majority baseline and showed similarity to human performance, which encourages further use of these datasets for modeling perception from motion trajectories. Future progress on simulating human-like motion perception will require models that integrate motion information with top-down contextual knowledge.},

abstract = {Communication and collaboration between deaf people and hearing people is hindered by lack of a common language. Although there has been a lot of research in this domain, there is room for work towards a system that is ubiquitous, non-invasive, works in real-time and can be trained interactively by the user. Such a system will be powerful enough to translate gestures performed in real-time, while also being flexible enough to be fully personalized to be used as a platform for gesture based HCI. We propose SCEPTRE which utilizes two non-invasive wrist-worn devices to decipher gesture-based communication. The system uses a multi-tiered template based comparison system for classification on input data from accelerometer, gyroscope and electromyography (EMG) sensors. This work demonstrates that the system is very easily trained using just one to three training instances each for twenty randomly chosen signs from the American Sign Language(ASL) dictionary and also for user-generated custom gestures. The system is able to achieve an accuracy of 97.72% for ASL gestures.},

abstract = {Current pedestrian collision warning systems use either auditory alarms or visual symbols to inform drivers. These traditional approaches cannot tell the driver where the detected pedestrians are located, which is critical for the driver to respond appropriately. To address this problem, we introduce a new driver interface taking advantage of a volumetric head-up display (HUD). In our experimental user study, sixteen participants drove a test vehicle in a parking lot while braking for crossing pedestrians using different interface designs on the HUD. Our results showed that spatial information provided by conformal graphics on the HUD resulted in not only better driver performance but also smoother braking behavior as compared to the baseline.},

abstract = {Recent advancement of smart devices and wearable tech-nologies greatly enlarges the variety of personal data people can track. Applications and services can leverage such data to provide better life support, but also impose privacy and security threats. Obfuscation schemes, consequently, have been developed to retain data access while mitigate risks. Compared to offering choices of releasing raw data and not releasing at all, we examine the effect of adding a data obfuscation option on users' disclosure decisions when configuring applications' access, and how that effect varies with data types and application contexts. Our online user experiment shows that users are less likely to block data access when the obfuscation option is available except for locations. This effect significantly differs between applications for domain-specific dynamic tracking data, but not for generic personal traits. We further unpack the role of context and discuss the design opportunities.},

abstract = {Recent years have initiated a paradigm shift from pure taskbased human-machine interfaces towards socially-sensitive interaction. In addition to what users explicitly say or gesture at, socially-sensitive interfaces are able to sense more subtle human cues, such as head postures and movements, to infer psychological user states, such as attention and affect, and also to enrich system responses with social signals. However, most approaches focus on offline analysis of previously recorded data limiting the investigation to prototypical behaviors in laboratory-like settings. In my presentation, I will focus on challenges that arise when integrating social signal processing techniques into interactive systems designed for real-world applications. From a technical perspective, this requires effective tools able to synchronize, process, and analyze relevant signals in online mode. From a user perspective, appropriate strategies need to be defined to respond to social signals at the right moment in time without disturbing the flow of interaction. I will discuss two interaction styles for socially-sensitive interfaces. In the area of information retrieval, the concept of empathic stimulation has been used to optimize the selection and presentation of data. The basic idea is to exploit sensory data on the users' emotional state to provide them with cues that inspire their curiosity during the data exploration task. In the domain of social coaching, the concept of social augmentation has been employed to give people ambient feedback on their behavior while being engaged in a social interaction. The presentation will be illustrated by examples from various national and international projects following these two interaction styles.},

Psychophysiological measurements are promising research methods for perceiving and understanding audience's responses in real-time. Currently, such research are conducted by collecting biometric data from audience when they are watching a performance. In this paper, we draw on techniques from brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and knowledge from quality of performing arts to develop a system that monitor audience engagement in real time using electroencephalography (EEG) measurement and seek to improve it by triggering the adaptive performing cues when the engagement level decreased. We simulated the immersive theatre performances to provide audience a high-fidelity visual-audio experience. An experimental evaluation is conducted with 48 participants during two different performance studies. The results showed that our system could successfully detect the decreases in audience engagement and the performing cues had positive effects on regain audience engagement. Our research offers the guidelines for designing theatre performances from the audience's perception.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel smart eyewear that uses embedded photo reflective sensors and machine learning to recognize a wearer's facial expressions in daily life. We leverage the skin deformation when wearers change their facial expressions. With small photo reflective sensors, we measure the proximity between the skin surface on a face and the eyewear frame where 17 sensors are integrated. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm was applied for the sensor information. The sensors can cover various facial muscle movements and can be integrated into everyday glasses. The main contributions of our work are as follows. (1) The eyewear recognizes eight facial expressions (92.8% accuracy for one time use and 78.1% for use on 3 different days). (2) It is designed and implemented considering social acceptability. The device looks like normal eyewear, so users can wear it anytime, anywhere. (3) Initial field trials in daily life were undertaken. Our work is one of the first attempts to recognize and evaluate a variety of facial expressions in the form of an unobtrusive wearable device.},

And while there exist systems that offer improved categorizations of sports plays (e.g., into relatively coarse clusters), to the best of our knowledge there does not exist any retrieval system that can effectively search for the most relevant plays given a specific input query. One significant design challenge is how best to phrase queries for multi-agent spatiotemporal trajectories such as sports plays.We have developed a novel query paradigm and retrieval system, which we call Chalkboarding, that allows the user to issue queries by drawing a play of interest (similar to how coaches draw up plays). Our system utilizes effective alignment, templating, and hashing techniques tailored to multi-agent trajectories, and achieves accurate play retrieval at interactive speeds.We showcase the efficacy of our approach in a user study, where we demonstrate orders-of-magnitude improvements in search quality compared to baseline systems.},

We present AppGrouper, an alternative approach to algorithmic-only solutions, incorporating human input in a knowledge-graph-based clustering process. AppGrouper provides an interactive interface that lets domain experts steer the clustering process in early, mid, and late stages. We deployed and evaluated AppGrouper with internal experts. We found that AppGroup improved quality of algorithm-generated app clusters on 56 out of 82 search queries. We also found that the internal experts made more changes in early and mid stages for lower-quality algorithmic results, focusing more on narrow queries. Our result suggests, in some contexts, machine learning systems can greatly benefit from steering from human experts, creating a symbiotic working relationship.},

abstract = {Data transformation often requires users to write many trivial and task-dependent programs to transform thousands of records. Recently, programming-by-example (PBE) approaches enable users to transform data without coding. A key challenge of these PBE approaches is to deliver correctly transformed results on large datasets, since these transformation programs are likely to be generated by non-expert users. To address this challenge, existing approaches aim to identify a small set of potentially incorrect records and ask users to examine these records instead of the entire dataset. However, because the transformation scenarios are highly task-dependent, existing approaches cannot capture the incorrect records for various scenarios. We present a approach that learns from past transformation scenarios to generate a meta-classifier to identify the incorrect records. Our approach color-codes these transformed records and then presents them for users to examine. The method allows users to either enter an example for a record transformed incorrectly or confirm the correctness of a transformed record. And our approach can learn from the users' labels to refine the meta-classifier to accurately identify the incorrect records. Simulation results and a user study show that our method can identify the incorrectly transformed records and reduce the user efforts in examining the results.},

We present an intelligent interface that can automatically extract human gestures using Microsoft Kinect to make speakers aware of their mannerisms. We use a sparsity-based algorithm, Shift Invariant Sparse Coding, to automatically extract the patterns of body movements. These patterns are displayed in an interface with subtle question and answer-based feedback scheme that draws attention to the speaker's body language. Our formal evaluation with 27 participants shows that the users became aware of their body language after using the system. In addition, when independent observers annotated the accuracy of the algorithm for every extracted pattern, we find that the patterns extracted by our algorithm is significantly (p&lt;0.001) more accurate than just random selection. This represents a strong evidence that the algorithm is able to extract human-interpretable body movement patterns. An interactive demo of AutoManner is available at http://tinyurl.com/AutoManner.},

Thus simulation systems need to be able to provide the key cues needed in making decisions with high fidelity. In this paper we present the first version of Desitra, a simulation environment for teaching decision making in dental surgery. System design was driven by an observational study of teaching sessions for endodontic surgery in the operating room which identified perceptual cues used in decision making as well as tutorial intervention strategies used by surgeons. Desitra provides an open environment for learning decision making -- students carry out dental procedures and are free to make mistakes. The pedagogical module monitors the student actions and intervenes when students make mistakes, providing as little guidance as necessary to keep students on a productive learning path. The system is implemented to run on Android tablets to be maximally accessible. Preliminary evaluation of the system shows that Desitra effectively captures key perceptual cues.},

abstract = {Numerous VR simulators have been developed as a means of addressing limitations of the traditional apprenticeship approach to dental surgical skill training. Most existing simulators support intra- and extra-coronal procedures such as carries removal. In this paper we address the problem of automated outcome assessment for endodontic surgery. Outcome assessment is an essential component of any system that provides formative feedback, which requires assessing the outcome, relating it to the procedure, and communicating in a language natural to dental students. This paper takes a first step toward automated generation of such comprehensive feedback. Our system automatically computes reference templates based on tooth anatomy, which provides flexibility to adjust parameters such as tolerance and to create new templates on demand. Detailed scores are transformed into the standard scoring language used by dental schools. Preliminary evaluation of our system on fifteen outcome samples with three expert endodontists shows a high degree of agreement with expert scores.},

abstract = {Instructional videos are one of the most popular ways of teaching and learning in an online setting. However, navigation in videos is linear as compared to other instructional resources such as textbooks, where a table of topics and a multi-faceted index of different anchor points i.e., list of figures, tables aid in efficiently navigating to a desired point of interest. There is a lack of appropriate techniques and interfaces which can support such textbook-style navigation in instructional videos. This paper presents a novel approach to automatically localize and classify different anchor points in a video including figures, tables, equations, flowcharts, code snippets and charts. Our approach uses a deep convolution neural network in a semi-supervised fashion where the training data is obtained from the unconstrained Internet images. On an anchor point dataset of about 10K images, the proposed algorithm leads to a classification accuracy of 86%. Further, we designed a system ViZig that uses these localized anchor points along with a automatically generated list of topics for non-linear video navigation and studied its effectiveness in real-world. Our user studies with 18 participants establish that the proposed video navigation mechanism provides statistically significant time savings as compared to the popularly used time-synched transcript along with youtube-style timeline scrubbing.},

abstract = {We present AnalyticalInk, a novel math learning environment prototype that uses a semantic graph as the knowledge representation of algebraic and geometric word problems. The system solves math problems by reasoning upon the semantic graph and automatically generates conceptual and procedural scaffoldings in sequence. We further introduces a step-wise tutoring framework, which can check students' input steps and provide the adaptive scaffolding feedback. Based on the knowledge representation, AnalyticalInk highlights keywords that allow users to further drag them onto the workspace to gather insight into the problem's initial conditions. The system simulates a pen-and-paper environment to let users input both in algebraic and geometric workspaces. We conducted an usability evaluation to measure the effectiveness of AnalyticalInk. We found that keyword highlighting and dragging is useful and effective toward math problem solving. Answer checking in the tutoring component is useful. In general, our prototype shows the promise in helping users to understand geometrical concepts and master algebraic procedures under the problem solving.},
