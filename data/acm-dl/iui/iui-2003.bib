abstract = {The next generation of voice-based user interface technology will enable easy-to-use automation of new and existing communication services, achieving a more natural human-machine interaction. By natural, we mean that the machine understands what people actually say, in contrast to what a system designer expects them to say. This approach is in contrast with menu-driven or strongly-prompted systems, where many users are unable or unwilling to navigate such highly structured interactions. AT&amp;Ts How May I Help You? (HMIHY)(sm) technology shifts the burden from human to machine wherein the system adapts to peoples language, as contrasted with forcing users to learn the machins jargon. We have developed algorithms which learn to extract meaning from fluent speech via automatic acquisition and exploitation of salient words, phrases and grammar fragments from a corpus. In this talk I will describe the speech, language and dialog technology underlying HMIHY, plus experimental evaluation on live customer traffic from AT&amp;T's national deployment for customer careAllen Gorin is the Head of the Speech Interface Research Department at AT&amp;T Laboratories, with long-term research interests focusing on machine learning methods for spoken language understanding. In recent years, he has led a research team in applying speech, language and dialog technology to AT&amp;Ts "How May I Help You?" (HMIHY) (sm) service, which has been deployed nationally for long distance customer care.

abstract = {Where the sea meets the land, life has blossomed into a myriad of unique forms in the turbulence of water, sand, and wind. At another seashore between the land of atoms and the sea of bits, we are now acing the challenge of reconciling our dual citizenships in the physical and digital worlds. Windows to the digital world are confined to flat square screens and pixels, or "painted bits." Unfortunately, one cannot feel and confirm the virtual existence of this digital information through one's body. Tangible Bits, our vision of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), seeks to realize seamless interfaces between humans, digital information, and the physical environment by giving physical form to digital information, making bits directly manipulable and perceptible. The goal is to blur the boundary between our bodies and cyberspace and to turn the architectural space into an interface between the people, bits, and atoms. In this talk, I will present a variety of tangible user interfaces the Tangible Media Group has designed and presented within the CHI, SIGGRAPH, UIST, CSCW, IDSA, ICSID, ICC, and Ars Electronica communitiesHiroshi Ishii is a tenured Associate Professor of Media Arts and Sciences, at the MIT Media Lab. His research focuses upon the design of seamless interfaces between humans, digital information, and the physical environment.At the MIT Media Lab, he founded and directs the Tangible Media Group pursuing a new vision of Human Computer Interaction (HCI): "Tangible Bits." His team seeks to change the "painted bits" of GUIs to "tangible bits" by giving physical form to digital information. He also co-directs Things That Think (TTT) Consortium at the MIT Media Lab.Ishii and his students have presented their vision of "Tangible Bits" at a variety of academic, industrial design, and artistic venues (including ACM SIGCHI, ACM SIGGRAPH, Industrial Design Society of America, and Ars Electronica), emphasizing that the development of tangible interfaces requires the rigor of both scientific and artistic review. A display of many of the groups projects took place at the NTT InterCommunication Center (ICC) in Tokyo in summer 2000. A new, two-year-long exhibition "Get in Touch" that features the Tangible Media group's work opened at Ars Electronica Center (Linz, Austria) in September 2001Prior to MIT, from 1988-1994, he led a CSCW research group at the NTT Human Interface Laboratories, where his team invented TeamWorkStation and ClearBoard. In 1993 and 1994, he was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Toronto, Canada. He received B. E. degree in electronic engineering, M. E. and Ph.

abstract = {Todays computer interfaces are one size fits all. Users with little programming experience have only limited opportunities to customize their interface to their task and work habits (e.g., adding buttons to a toolbar). Furthermore, the overhead induced by generic interfaces will be proportionately greater on small form-factor PDAs, embedded applications and wearable devices. Searching for a solution, researchers argue that productivity can be greatly enhanced if interfaces anticipated their users, adapted to their preferences, and reacted to high-level customization requests. But realizing these benefits is tricky, because there is an inherent tension between the dynamism implied by automatic interface adaptation and the stability required in order for the user to maintain an accurate mental model, predict the computers behavior, and feel in control. In this talk, I discuss several principles governing effective adaptation, describe algorithms for data mining user action traces, and suggest mechanisms for dynamically transforming interfaces},

A multimodal interface was created to communicate with users by using two ambient channels for interruption: heat and light. These ambient displays acted as external interruption generators designed to get users attention away from their current task; playing a game on a desktop computer. It was verified that the disruptiveness and effectiveness of interruptions varies with the interruption modality used to interrupt. The thermal modality produced a larger decrease in performance and disruptiveness on a task being interrupted than the visual modality. Our results set the initial point in providing the theory behind future self-adaptive multimodal-interruption interfaces that will employ users individual physiological responses to each interruption modality and dynamically select the modality based on effectiveness and performance metrics},

abstract = {Current recommender systems, based on collaborative filtering, implement a rather limited model of interaction. These systems intelligently elicit information from a user only during the initial registration phase. Furthermore, users tend to collaborate only indirectly. We believe there are several unexplored opportunities in which information can be effectively elicited from users by making the underlying interaction model more conversational and collaborative. In this paper, we propose a set of techniques to intelligently select what information to elicit from the user in situations in which the user may be particularly motivated to provide such information. We argue that the resulting interaction improves the user experience. We conclude by reporting results of an offline experiment in which we compare the influence of different elicitation techniques on both the accuracy of the systems predictions and the users effort},

abstract = {This paper describes the interface components for a system called Bettys Brain, an intelligent agent we have developed for studying the learning by teaching paradigm. Our previous studies have shown that students gain better understanding of domain knowledge when they prepare to teach others versus when they prepare to take an exam. This finding has motivated us to develop computer agents that students teach using concept map representations with a visual interface. Betty is intelligent not because she learns on her own, but because she can apply qualitative-reasoning techniques to answer questions that are directly related to what she has been taught through the concept map. We evaluate the agents interfaces in terms of how well they support learning activities, using examples of their use by fifth grade students in an extensive study that we performed in a Nashville public school. A critical analysis of the outcome of our studies has led us to propose the next generation interfaces in a multi-agent paradigm that should be more effective in promoting constructivist learning and self-regulation in the learning by teaching framework},

abstract = {In this paper it is argued that animated characters in the interaction with consumer electronics products can have four kinds of benefits. They can add fun to the interaction and realise a more enjoyable experience. Animated characters can deploy social behaviour and social rules known from daily life and thus make it more natural and easier to interact with consumer electronic products. Furthermore an animated character can set the right level of expectation and finally they can make system errors and interaction obstacles more acceptableTwo examples are described to illustrate this argumentation. The L-icons are virtual personal friends that live inside the television and that represent a so-called recommendation system. Bello is a virtual pet dog that facilitates voice-controlled interaction for a television set. The evaluation results of two example applications confirm the four arguments, but they also show that the right form of animated character must be application specific in order to come to an optimal match between the characteristics of the character and those of the system they represent},

The user is presented with a graphical representation of primary lifestyle goals such as home, car, vacation, education, etc. As the user selects goals and modifies them, it presents the impact on the users life by graphically depicting the impact of a decision on her other goals. In effect, Personal Choice Point is a planner that helps restrict the users search for a suitable allocation of resources among goals to the likely set of allocations, from the much larger space of possible ones. The result is a system that changes the focus of the users task from managing the mechanics of resource allocation to the evaluation and selection of likely ones},

We have developed a method for on-line adaptation of a touch pad keyboard layout. The method starts from an original layout and monitors the usage of the keyboard by recording and analyzing the keystrokes. An on-line learning algorithm subtly moves the keys according to the spatial distribution of keystrokes. In consequence, the keyboard matches better to the users physical extensions and grasp of the device, and makes the physical trajectories during typing more comfortable. We present two implementations that apply different vector quantization algorithms to produce an adaptive keyboard with visual on-line feedback. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that the changes in the keyboard are consistent, and related to the user's handedness and hand extensions. The testees found the on-line personalization positive. The method can either be applied for on-line personalization of keyboards or for ergonomics research},

abstract = {To provide a more robust context for personalization, we desire to extract a continuum of general (long-term) to specific (short-term) interests of a user. Our proposed approach is to learn a user interest hierarchy (UIH) from a set of web pages visited by a user. We devise a divisive hierarchical clustering (DHC) algorithm to group words (topics) into a hierarchy where more general interests are represented by a larger set of words. Each web page can then be assigned to nodes in the hierarchy for further processing in learning and predicting interests. This approach is analogous to building a subject taxonomy for a library catalog system and assigning books to the taxonomy. Our approach does not need user involvement and learns the UIH "implicitly." Furthermore, it allows the original objects, web pages, to be assigned to multiple topics (nodes in the hierarchy). In this paper, we focus on learning the UIH from a set of visited pages. We propose a few similarity functions and dynamic threshold-finding methods, and evaluate the resulting hierarchies according to their meaningfulness and shape},

KANAL helps users author sound plans by simulating them, checking for a variety of errors and presenting the results in an accessible format that allows the user to see an overview of the plan steps or timelines of objects in the plan. From our experience in two domains, users tend to interleave plan authoring and plan checking while extending background knowledge of actions. This has led us to refine KANAL to provide a high-level overview of plans and integrate a tool for refining the background knowledge about actions used to check plans. We report on these lessons learned and new directions in KANAL.},

Previous approaches to textual affect sensing have employed keyword spotting, lexical affinity, statistical methods, and hand-crafted models. This paper demonstrates a new approach, using large-scale real-world knowledge about the inherent affective nature of everyday situations (such as "getting into a car accident") to classify sentences into "basic" emotion categories. This commonsense approach has new robustness implications.Open Mind Commonsense was used as a real world corpus of 400,000 facts about the everyday world. Four linguistic models are combined for robustness as a society of commonsense-based affect recognition. These models cooperate and compete to classify the affect of text. Such a system that analyzes affective qualities sentence by sentence is of practical value when people want to evaluate the text they are writing. As such, the system is tested in an email writing application. The results suggest that the approach is robust enough to enable plausible affective text user interfaces.},

DESK acts as a client-side complement of a dynamic web page generation system, PEGASUS, which generates HTML pages from a formally structured domain model and an abstract presentation model. Authorized users can modify the internal presentation model by editing the generated HTML pages with DESK in a WYSIWYG environment.

Yet NLIs are only usable if they map natural language questions to SQL queries correctly. As Schneiderman and Norman have argued, people are unwilling to trade reliable and predictable user interfaces for intelligent but unreliable ones. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework for reliable NLIs, which is the foundation for the fully implemented Precise NLI. We prove that, for a broad class of semantically tractable natural language questions, Precise is guaranteed to map each question to the corresponding SQL query. We report on experiments testing Precise on several hundred questions drawn from user studies over three benchmark databases. We find that over 80% of the questions are semantically tractable questions, which Precise answers correctly. Precise automatically recognizes the 20% of questions that it cannot handle, and requests a paraphrase. Finally, we show that Precise compares favorably with Mooney's learning NLI and with Microsoft's English Query product},

We give some general heuristics for improving interpretability in a system and explain how they apply in an implemented system, an assistant for exploratory statistical analysis.

The paper goes on to describe the implementation and evaluation of the EXACT interface to appliances, which is based on this reduction. EXACT maps each English user request to an SQL query, which is transformed to create a PDDL goal, and uses the Blackbox planner [13] to map the planning problem to a sequence of appliance commands that satisfy the original request. Both theoretical arguments and experimental evaluation show that EXACT is highly reliable},

We argue that there are three basic requirements for such an architecture: a personal service platform for using services, tools for creating services, and a network for sharing services, and we present our motivation, design, and implementation of these parts. With our enabling architecture we hope to demonstrate a feasible prototype system that stimulates the emergence of more specialized services for all users},

However they also raise expectations of social abilities, and failure to meet those expectations can have unintended negative effects. The Social Intelligence Project is developing improved social interaction skills for guidebots.

abstract = {Computer-based annotation is increasing in popularity as a mechanism for revising documents and sharing comments over the Internet. One reason behind this surge is that viewpoints, summaries, and notes written by others are often helpful to readers. In particular, these types of annotations can help users locate or recall relevant documents. We believe that this model can be applied to the problem of retrieval on the Semantic Web. In this paper, we propose a generalized annotation environment that supports richer forms of description such as natural language. We discuss how RDF can be used to model annotations and the connections between annotations and the documents they describe. Furthermore, we explore the idea of a question answering interface that allows retrieval based both on the text of the annotations and the annotations associated metadata. Finally, we speculate on how these features could be pervasively integrated into an information management environment, making Semantic Web annotation a first class player in terms of document management and retrieval},

Based on these concepts, we have implemented three applications, all of which were to existing technology. Using one of the applications, the AWARE Preflight system, pilots found significantly more hazards in about half the time compared to using the current technology},

Previous approaches to this problem have been based on the idea of prediction of the text, but these require the user to take overt action to verify or select the system's predictions. We propose taking advantage of the duality between prediction and compression. We allow the user to enter text in compressed form, in particular, using a simple stipulated abbreviation method that reduces characters by about 30% yet is simple enough that it can be learned easily and generated relatively fluently. Using statistical language processing techniques, we can decode the abbreviated text with a residual word error rate of about 3%, and we expect that simple adaptive methods can improve this to about 1.5%. Because the system's operation is completely independent from the user's, the overhead from cognitive task switching and attending to the system's actions online is eliminated, opening up the possibility that the compression-based method can achieve text input efficiency improvements where the prediction-based methods have not},

abstract = {Listening to music while travelling is a pleasant activity. The latest MP3 players demonstrate that storage and management of music will not be a problem in the near future. Besides listening to music the user might also want to gather new music from the Internet. We propose a music gathering application that helps the user to collect music and that is able to proactively search and download music based on the users music preferences. Furthermore, we developed an emotional interface character that provides instant and natural feedback on the status of the application},

abstract = {Embodied agents present ongoing challenging agenda for research in multi-modal user interfaces and human-computer-interaction. Such agent metaphors will only be widely applicable to online applications when there is a standardised way to map underlying engines with the visual presentation of the agents. This paper delineates the functions and specifications of a mark-up language for scripting the animation of virtual characters. The language is called: Character Mark-up Language (CML) and is an XML-based character attribute definition and animation scripting language designed to aid in the rapid incorporation of lifelike characters/agents into online applications or virtual reality worlds. This multi-modal scripting language is designed to be easily understandable by human animators and easily generated by a software process such as software agents. CML is constructed based jointly on motion and multi-modal capabilities of virtual life-like figures. The paper further illustrates the constructs of the language and describes a real-time execution architecture that demonstrates the use of such a language as a 4G language to easily utilise and integrate MPEG-4 media objects in online interfaces and virtual environments},

abstract = {Bettys Brain [1] is a learning-by-teaching environment where students "teach" Betty by constructing a concept map that models relations between domain concepts. The relations can be causal, hierarchical, and property links between the entities that represent the domain. The goal is for students to understand and then teach Betty about interdependence and balance among entities in a river ecosystem. As a part of the teaching process, students can query and quiz Betty to assess her understanding based on what she has been taught.Students can query Betty by asking her two types of questions: (i) "What happens to <concept a=""> when <concept b=""> increase/decrease?" and (ii) "Tell me about <concept a="">". Betty answers questions by employing a qualitative reasoning mechanism, and explains her answers verbally and by using animation. Bettys explanations, and some feedback on the correctness of the answers should prompt the students to think more deeply about the domain processes, and motivate them to learn better before they teach her againStudents can request external feedback by asking Betty to take quizzes that are administered by a teacher agent. The teacher agent uses an overlay model to provide hints about concepts and links missing from the concept map. The hint levels start from general (e.g., suggesting that the student read a particular resource) to specific (e.g. indicating that a link is missing between two specific concepts. By seeing the quiz questions, students become aware of which concepts are important to model domain phenomena. The feedback from the teacher agent, points the students to understanding interrelationships among conceptsResults from our most recent study indicate that the query feature appeared to be effective in helping students develop an understanding of the interrelationships of living and non-living things in an ecosystem. The quiz feature is effective in helping students decide the important domain concepts and types of relationships to teach Betty. However, our observations of students during the study suggest that students using the quiz feature may have been overly focused on "getting the quiz questions correct" rather than "making sure that Betty (and themselves) understood the information.To help students focus more on learning, the next versions of Betty and teacher agent will be more interactive and metacognitive. In addition, the teacher will provide feedback that is related more to the global issues of balance and interdependence instead of individual links.At the demonstration, we will have a working version of our teachable agent system, Bettys Brain. We will demonstrate its user interfaces for the student to create and modify their concept maps, the query interface, and Bettys response to queries, and the teacher agent interface that responds when the students ask for help. In addition, the system also contains online resources that students can refer to when they are creating and updating their concept maps.},

abstract = {An important criterion for many intelligent user interfaces is that the interface be multimodal, that is, allow the user to interact with the system using a variety of different input channels. In addition to user interface interactions per se, the system may need to process input from multiple channels to make decisions in response to interface interactions or for other related purposes.The multimodal event parsing system described in our paper has been implemented in a working system called CERA, the Complex Event Recognition Architecture. CERA, developed under contract with NASA, has been used to identify complex events across multiple sensor channels in an advanced life support system demonstration project.We will demonstrate:The CERA event recognition language,The CERA event recognition engine at work,A custom development environment for writing and debugging CERA event recognizers, Visualization tools for complex event display,Integrating CERA with various toolkits and projects.The CERA event recognition engine is written in Common Lisp [1] and has a custom development environment with visualization tools based within the Eclipse extensible IDE [2]. This combination provides an easy to use development environment that can be used remotely, while maintaining the interactive flexibility of Lisp.As well as being a stand-alone event recognition system, CERA has also been tightly integrated with the RAP execution system [3] and the I/NET Conversational Interface system for dialogue management [4]. This combination allows the creation of human/computer interfaces for dynamic systems that make use of natural language, multi-channel controls and sensors, and other available physical context.Our demonstration will consist of a number of different components designed to illustrate the various aspects of CERA and our approach to building multimodal interfaces. The first demonstration will show CERA processing and combining events from multiple input streams, including examples from the NASA advanced life support system domain. The emphasis of this demonstration will be to show how event recognizers are built and how they work in practice.Our second demonstration will illustrate the CERA IDE and visualization tools. These tools allow the programming of a remote CERA system and the monitoring and debugging of its operation. Techniques for monitoring recognition progress and examining partial recognition state will be examined.Finally, we will demonstrate a more complex interface that combines natural language input with various non-linguistic input streams. An automotive telematics application will form the basis of this demonstration. The audience will be encouraged to participate in this demonstration.},

abstract = {The need for Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) to databases has become increasingly acute as more nontechnical people access information through their web browsers, PDAs and cell phones. Yet NLIs are only usable if they map natural language questions to SQL queries correctly. We introduce the Precise NLI [2], which reduces the semantic interpretation challenge in NLIs to a graph matching problem. Precise uses the max-flow algorithm to efficiently solve this problem. Each max-flow solution corresponds to a possible semantic interpretation of the sentence. precise collects max-flow solutions, discards the solutions that do not obey syntactic constraints and retains the rest as the basis for generating SQL queries corresponding to the question q. The syntactic information is extracted from the parse tree corresponding to the given question which is computed by a statistical parser [1]. For a broad, well-defined class of semantically tractable natural language questions, Precise is guaranteed to map each question to the corresponding SQL querySemantically tractable questions correspond to a natural, domain-independent subset of English that can be efficiently and accurately interpreted as nonrecursive Datalog clauses. Precise is transportable to arbitrary databases, such as the Restaurants,Jobs and Geography databases used in our implementation. Examples of semantically tractable questions include: "What Chinese restaurants with a 3.5 rating are in Seattle?", "What are the areas of US states with large populations?", "What jobs require 4 years of experience and desire a B.S.CS degree?".Given a question which is not semantically tractable, Precise recognizes it as such and informs the user that it cannot answer it.Given a semantically tractable question, Precise computes the set of non-equivalent SQL interpretations corresponding to the question. If a unique such SQL interpretation exists, Precise outputs it together with the corresponding result set obtained by querying the current database. If the set contains more than one SQL interpretation, the natural language question is ambiguous in the context of the current database. In this case, Precise asks for the user's help in determining which interpretation is the correct one.Our experiments have shown that Precise has high coverage and accuracy over common English questions. In future work, we plan to explore increasingly broad classes of questions and include Precise as a module in a full-fledged dialog system. An important direction for future work is helping users understand the types of questions Precise cannot handle via dialog, enabling them to build an accurate mental model of the system and its capabilities. Also, our own group's work on the EXACT natural language interface [3] builds on Precise and on the underlying theoretical framework. EXACT composes an extended version of Precise with a sound and complete planner to develop a powerful and provably reliable interface to household appliances},
