abstract = {In this paper, we describe an architecture for conversational systems that enables human-like performance along several important dimensions. First, interpretation is incremental, multi-level, and involves both general and task- and domain-specific knowledge. Second, generation is also incremental, proceeds in parallel with interpretation, and accounts for phenomena such as turn-taking, grounding and interruptions. Finally, the overall behavior of the system in the task at hand is determined by the (incremental) results of interpretation, the persistent goals and obligations of the system, and exogenous events of which it becomes aware. As a practical matter, the architecture supports a separation of responsibilities that enhances portability to new tasks and domains.},

abstract = {This paper describes work in progress to automatically generate camera shots featuring the composition techniques of expert photographers. This effort builds upon an automated camera planner that computes a shot satisfying a given set of constraints. In this prior work, users manually specify the set of constraints and the numeric parameters for each. A typical two subject shot can be described by eleven constraints involving sixty numeric parameters. This work aims to develop a high-level interface to automatically generate such constraint sets. Photographic composition techniques such as composition in depth can be realized by automatically constructing appropriate sets of camera constraints then submitting them to a constraint solver.},

The graphical presentations for both the booths and the mobile devices are generated from a common source and for the common task of way finding, but they use different techniques to convey possibly different subsets of the relevant information. The form of the presentations is depending on technical limitations of the output media, accuracy of location information, and cognitive restrictions of the user. We analyze what information needs to be conveyed, how limited resources influence the presentation of this information, and argue, that by generating all different presentations in a common framework, a consistent appearance across devices can be achieved and that the different device classes can complement each other in facilitating the navigation task.},

abstract = {Recommender systems provide personalized suggestions about items that users will find interesting.  Typically, recommender systems require a user interface that can ``intelligently'' determine the interest of a user and use this information to make suggestions.  The common solution, ``explicit ratings'', where users tell the system what they think about a piece of information, is well-understood and fairly precise.  However, having to stop to enter explicit ratings can alter normal patterns of browsing and reading. A more ``intelligent'' method is to useimplicit ratings, where a rating is obtained by a method other than obtaining it directly from the user.  These implicit interest indicators have obvious advantages, including removing the cost of the user rating, and that every user interaction with the system can contribute to an implicit rating.Current recommender systems mostly do not use implicit ratings, nor is the ability of implicit ratings to predict actual user interest well-understood.  This research studies the correlation between various implicit ratings and the explicit rating for a single Web page.  A Web browser was developed to record the user's actions (implicit ratings) and the explicit rating of a page.  Actions included mouse clicks, mouse movement, scrolling and elapsed time. This browser was used by over 80 people that browsed more than 2500 Web pages.Using the data collected by the browser, the individual implicit ratings and some combinations of implicit ratings were analyzed and compared with the explicit rating.  We found that the time spent on a page, the amount of scrolling on a page and the combination of time and scrolling had a strong correlation with explicit interest, while individual scrolling methods and mouse-clicks were ineffective in predicting explicit interest.},

abstract = {Custom interfaces, which we call appliances, allow users to efficiently carry out specialized tasks. Without one, a user is often required to perform repetitive mechanical steps using general purpose interfaces, which we call tools. Much research has attempted to enable non-programmers to create appliances for themselves.We present a system in which a user can choose an example of the task behavior to be automated from a visualization of his past operations. The example is transformed into a visual language, using two simple rules to generalize from the single example to a class of tasks. The user can then edit this representation directly, or continue to refine the example using selective undo and redo. The visual representation can be transformed into an esthetically pleasing appliance by deleting irrelevant components, and rearranging, resizing, and relabeling other components. Restricting the domain to data analysis tasks enables a well-matched visual query language to be used. Appliance interactions are automatically provided by the underlying interactive visualization system in which the appliance is embedded.An observational study suggests that this system represents a useful point on the ease-of-use vs. expressive power tradeoff appropriate for data analysis, and that the ability to choose and modify examples after the fact is helpful.},

The present study examines the impact of search tools adaptation to their users. A significant preference toward user-oriented search method over the conventional content-based method was found.

We propose a set of techniques that will aid UI designers who are working in the domain of mobile computing. These techniques will allow designers to build UIs across several platforms, while respecting the unique constraints posed by each platform. In addition, these techniques will help designers to recognize and accommodate the unique contexts in which mobile computing occurs. Central to our approach is the development of a user-interface model that serves to isolate those features that are common to the various contexts of use, and to specify how the user-interface should adjust when the context changes. We claim that without some abstract description of the UI, it is likely that the design and the development of user-interfaces for mobile computing will be very time consuming, error-prone or even doomed to failure.},

We start with an example of a sketching system(nuSketch COA Creator)designed to aid military planners, to provide context and a source of examples. We then describe four dimensions of sketching,visual understanding, conceptual understanding, language understanding,anddrawing,that can be used to characterize the competence of existing systems and identify open problems.  The issues involved will be illustrated by examples from our experience with nuSketch.  Three research challenges are posed, to serve as milestones towards a computational model of sketching that can explain and replicate human abilities in this area.},

The community search assistant enables communities of users to search in a collaborative fashion. All queries submitted by the community are stored in the form of a graph. Links are made between queries that are found to be related. Users can peruse the network of related queries in an ordered way: following a path from a first cousin, to a second cousin to a third cousin, etc. to a set of search results. The first key idea behind the use of query graphs is that the determination of relatedness depends on the documents returned by the queries, not on the actual terms in the queries themselves. The second key idea is that the construction of the query graph transforms single user usage of information networks (e.g. search) into collaborative usage: all users can tap into the knowledge base of queries submitted by others.},

Herein, we give a thorough account of Rasa's underlying multiagent framework, and its recognition, understanding, and multimodal integration components. Moreover, we examine five properties of language-generativity, comprehensibility, compositionality, referentiality, and, at times, persistence-that render it suitable as an augmentation approach, contrasting these properties to those of other augmentation methods. It is these properties of language that allow users of Rasa to augment physical objects, transforming them into tangible interfaces.},

abstract = {The digital personal calendar has long been established as an effective tool for supporting workgroup coordination. For the new class of ubiquitous computing applications, however, the calendar can also be seen as a sensor, providing both location and availability information to these applications. In most cases, however, the calendar represents a sequence of events that people could (or should) attend, not their actual daily activities. To assist in the accurate determination of user whereabouts and availability, we present Ambush, a calendar system extension that uses a Bayesian model to predict the likelihood of one's attendance at the events listed on his or her schedule. We also present several techniques for the visual display of these likelihoods in a manner intended to be quickly interpreted by users examining the calendar.},

abstract = {One difficulty in creating synthetic characters for interactive stories is that these characters must convey their role in the story in a believable way. However, the relation between believability, on one side, and the role a character plays in a drama, on the other, has not yet been fully addressed. In this paper we will present a view on how to develop believable synthetic characters whose behaviour is based on a set of predefined functions (Propp's functions) associated with the role they play in the story. To illustrate the approach, we will present a collaborative virtual environment, Teatrix, designed for children to build their own stories-fairy tales. In Teatrix, virtual actors play roles (such as villain, hero, magician, etc), which are functional for the development of the story. Such roles have pre-defined goals and plans, allowing the story to flow and climax situations to arise. Teatrixis already in use by children ages between 7 and 9, in the context of a Computer-Integrated Classroom scenario.},

abstract = {Social navigation is the process of making navigational decisions in real or virtual environments based on social and communicative interaction with others. A computational model for social navigation is presented as an extension to an existing framework for general navigation, reducing decision-making to the minimization of cognitive costs. Consideration for social navigation gives rise to a classification framework based on the synchronicity, directness, and social presence during social interaction, each of which has direct effect on the cognitive costs of navigational tasks. Finally, a new recommender system, TRAILGUIDE, is presented as a tool that facilitates social navigation by allowing authors to explicitly publish "trails" within and between World Wide Web pages.},

abstract = {The Apt Decision agent learns user preferences in the domain of rental real estate by observing the user's critique of apartment features. Users provide a small number of criteria in the initial interaction, receive a display of sample apartments, and then react to any feature of any apartment independently, in any order. Users learn which features are important to them as they discover the details of specific apartments. The agent uses interactive learning techniques to build a profile of user preferences, which can then be saved and used in further retrievals. Because the user's actions in specifying preferences are also used by the agent to create a profile, the result is an agent that builds a profile without redundant or unnecessary effort on the user's part.},

abstract = {This paper describes a set of visualization techniques for interactive planning in a physical force simulation called AFS. We have developed a 3D environment in which textures are overlaid on a simulated landscape to convey information about environmental properties, agent actions, and possible strategies. Scenes are presented, via automated camera planning, such that some simple agent goals can be induced visually with little effort. These two areas of visualization functionality in AFS exploit properties of human low-level and intermediate-level vision, respectively. This paper presents AFS, its visualization environment, and studies we have run to explore the relationship between AFS visualizations and the high-level planning process.},

abstract = {&gt;Synchronized punch-card displaysare an interface technique to visualize tens of thousands of variables by encoding their values as color chips in a rectangular array. Our technique ties multiple such displays to a timeline of events enabling the punch-card displays to show animations of the behavior of complex systems. Punch-card displays not only make it easy to understand the high-level behavior of systems, but also enable users to quickly focus on individual variables and on fine-grained time intervals. This paper describes synchronized punch-card displays and shows how this technique is extremely powerful for understanding the behavior of complex multi-agent systems.},

abstract = {Applications of machine learning can be viewed as teacher-student interactions in which the teacher provides training examples and the student learns a generalization of the training examples.  One such application of great interest to the IUI community is adaptive user interfaces.  In the traditional learning interface, the scope of teacher-student interactions consists solely of the teacher/user providing some number of training examples to the student/learner and testing the learned model on new examples.  Active learning approaches go one step beyond the traditional interaction model and allow the student to propose new training examples that are then solved by the teacher.  In this paper, we propose that interfaces for machine learning should even more closely resemble human teacher-student relationships.  A teacher's time and attention are precious resources. An intelligent student must proactively contribute to the learning process, by reasoning about the quality of its knowledge, collaborating with the teacher, and suggesting new examples for her to solve.  The paper describes a variety of rich interaction modes that enhance the learning process and presents a decision-theoretic framework, called DIAManD, for choosing the best interaction.  We apply the framework to the SMARTedit programming by demonstration system and describe experimental validation and preliminary user feedback.},
