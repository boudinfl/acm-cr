abstract = {This presentation will demonstrate and discuss the design principles to create interactive programs featuring a doctor talking to you about healthcare...to a florist talking to you about flowers...to a teacher talking to you about geometry. The Interactive Conversation Interface is a more engaging way to provide services and information for nearly any major site on the Web and provide an answer to the question: "What is an interactive television show?" (And no, it isn't clicking on Jennifer Aniston sweater so your daughter can stop the program, right in the middle of a funny scene, and buy it while you sit there waiting to get back to the show). ICI is a form of interactive mass communication that can be used on any platform, whether it is a PC, wireless device, interactive television or just a regular phone. It's cool: why interact with a "page" when you can interact with a "person".},

abstract = {In traditional human-computer interfaces, a human master directs a computer system as a servant, telling it not only what to do, but also how to do it. Collaborative interfaces attempt to realign the roles, making the participants collaborators in solving the person's problem. This paper describes Writer's Aid, a system that deploys AI planning techniques to enable it to serve as an author's collaborative assistant. Writer's Aid differs from previous collaborative interfaces in both the kinds of actions the system partner takes and the underlying technology it uses to do so. While an author writes a document, Writer's Aid helps in identifying and inserting citation keys and by autonomously finding and caching potentially relevant papers and their associated bibliographic information from various on-line sources. This autonomy, enabled by the use of a planning system at the core of Writer's Aid, distinguishes this system from other collaborative interfaces. The collaborative design and its division of labor result in more efficient operation: faster and easier writing on the user's part and more effective information gathering on the part of the system. Subjects in our laboratory user study found the system effective and the interface intuitive and easy to use.},

abstract = {This work unifies two important threads of research in intelligent user interfaces which share the common element of explicit task modeling. On the one hand, longstanding research on task-centered GUI design (sometimes called model-based design) has explored the benefits of explicitly modeling the task to be performed by an interface and using this task model as an integral part of the interface design process. More recently, research on collaborative interface agents has shown how an explicit task model can be used to control the behavior of a software agent that helps a user perform tasks using a GUI. This paper describes a collection of tools we have implemented which generate both a GUI and a collaborative interface agent from the same task model. Our task-centered GUI design tool incorporates a number of novel features which help the designer to integrate the task model into the design process without being unduly distracted. Our implementation of collaborative interface agents is built on top of the COLLAGEN middleware for collaborative interface agents.},

We chose a tourist information system as a test environment and conducted the study on three different devices (PDA, TV set, and desktop computer) to investigate whether the best modality-combination depends on the used device. It turned out that the modality-combination of spoken text in connection with a picture was the most effective regarding recall-performance. This effect was strongest for users working with PDAs, which can be explained by the cognitive load theory. In contrast to this, participants ranked different modality combinations as most appealing, namely those with written text.},

abstract = {The ability to reason about the activity of a user is crucial to the implementation of any Intelligent User Interface. If it is able to recognize what a user is doing, a computer can act to cooperate. Most computer systems limit themselves to command-response interactions-their trivial understandings of their users cannot support a more complicated interaction. However, by looking at the tasks that their users are performing and reasoning about sequences of actions, a computer system can provide a more interesting level of interaction that is more efficient and does not demand as much of its users. Furthermore, the understanding of the user's activity provides a context within which to better understand future actions and to tune the sensing systems to look and listen for the actions that the user is most likely to take next. Finally, in many domains, such computer systems can recognize user tasks and act to cooperate without requiring a deep, goal-oriented understanding. In this paper, we look at the process-based interface used in the Intelligent Classroom, focusing on how a human lecturer can control it by simply going about her presentation. Also, we look at how the general ideas have been adapted to Jabberwocky, a speech-based interface to Microsoft PowerPoint that automatically switches slides, and how they are being applied to extend the functionality of Watson, an autonomous web research tool that uses the document a user is viewing as a search context.},

The multiple selection can then be used for inserting, deleting, copying, pasting, or other editing commands. Simultaneous editing uses two levels of inference, first inferring a group of records to be edited, then inferring multiple selections with exactly one selection in each record. Both techniques have been evaluated by user studies and shown to be fast and usable for novices. Simultaneous editing required only 1.26 examples per selection in the user study, approaching the ideal of 1-example PBD. Multiple selections bring many benefits, including better user feedback, fast, accurate inference, novel forms of intelligent assistance, and the ability to override system inferences with manual corrections.},

At the same time, the visual interaction style provides an alternative to the dialog-based model employed in most mixed-initiative (MI) systems. Visual thinking tools avoid complex analyses of turn taking, and put users in control all the time. We are especially interested in implementing visual "affordances" in such systems and present three examples used in COMIND, a visual MI system that we have developed. We show how humans can more effectively concentrate on synthesizing problems, selecting resolution paths that were unseen by the machine, and reformulating problems if solutions cannot be found or are unsatisfactory. We further discuss our evaluation of the techniques at the end of the paper.},

abstract = {Recommender systems have become valuable resources for users seeking intelligent ways to search through the enormous volume of information available to them. One crucial unsolved problem for recommender systems is how best to learn about a new user. In this paper we study six techniques that collaborative filtering recommender systems can use to learn about new users. These techniques select a sequence of items for the collaborative filtering system to present to each new user for rating. The techniques include the use of information theory to select the items that will give the most value to the recommender system, aggregate statistics to select the items the user is most likely to have an opinion about, balanced techniques that seek to maximize the expected number of bits learned per presented item, and personalized techniques that predict which items a user will have an opinion about. We study the techniques thru offline experiments with a large pre-existing user data set, and thru a live experiment with over 300 users. We show that the choice of learning technique significantly affects the user experience, in both the user effort and the accuracy of the resulting predictions.},

abstract = {The ease with which a user interface can be navigated strongly contributes to its usability. In this paper we describe preliminary results of a project aimed at making the evaluation of user interfaces from this perspective more routine. We have designed a system to carry out an autonomous, exploratory navigation through the graphical user interface of interactive, off-the-shelf software applications. The system is not a robust tool, but rather a proof of concept that can exhibit interesting behaviors. The traversal process generates a representation of the connectivity of the user interface, as well as navigational paths to specific commands. The reasoning component of the system is based on the ACT-R architecture, while the perceptual and motor components of the system are built on top of the SegMan perception/action substrate. We present the design of the system and its use in exploring a simple user interface.},

This paper reports on experience in building a robot agent for hosting activities, both the architecture and applications being used. The paper then turns to a range of issues to be addressed in creating hosting agents, especially robotic ones. The issues include the tasks and capabilities needed for hosting agents, and social relations, especially human trust of agent hosts.

In order to be useful, high-functionality applications have to provide a large number of features, creating huge learning problems for users. We address this dilemma by developing intelligent interfaces that support learning on demand by enabling users to learn new features when they are needed during work. We support learning on demand with information delivery by identifying learning opportunities of which users might not be aware. The challenging issues in implementing information delivery are discussed and techniques to address them are illustrated with the CodeBroker system. CodeBroker supports Java programmers in learning reusable software components in the context of their normal development environments and practice by proactively delivering task-relevant and personalized information. Evaluations of the system have shown its effectiveness in supporting learning on demand.},

To enable the systematic design of interaction controls, we study and abstract control properties.

abstract = {In order for intelligent interfaces to provide proactive assistance, they must customize their behavior based on the user's task context. Existing systems often assess context based on a single snapshot of the user's current activities (e. g., examining the content of the document that the user is currently consulting). However, an accurate picture of the user's context may depend not only on this local information, but also on information about the user's behavior over time. This paper discusses work on a recommender system, Calvin, which learns to identify broader contexts by relating documents that tend to be accessed together. Calvin's text analysis algorithm, WordSieve, develops term vector descriptions of these contexts in real time, without needing to accumulate comprehensive statistics about an entire corpus. Calvin uses these descriptions (1) to index documents to suggest them in similar future contexts and (2) to formulate contextbased queries for search engines. Results of initial experiments are encouraging for the approach's improved ability to associate documents with the research tasks in which they were consulted, compared to methods using only local information. This paper sketches the project goals, the current implementation of the system, and plans for its continued development and evaluati.},

While we ourselves have made this claim, we acknowledge that little empirical data has been presented to support it. Therefore, in the limited space available we present a terse overview of a study comparing reference to content as bases for indexing documents. This study indicates that reference identifies the value of documents more accurately and with a greater diversity of language than content.},

Using the preference information it has gathered from watching its users, and knowledge of how genres of music interrelate, how artists have influenced each other, and what kinds of transitions between songs people tend to make, the 'virtual DJ' finds a compromise and chooses a song. The system tries to satisfy the tastes of people in the room, but it also makes a playlist that fits its own notion of what should come next.

In the current paper we describe a new approach for evaluating the usability of intelligent products, based on information available in the designer's task model. This measure is then used to determine the degree to which users are able to access the task support provided by the product, and to identify users' needs for additional assistance. In this way, the usability measures presented in this paper can contribute to an iterative user-centered design process for designing and building product intelligence.},

In the best case, the appropriate place on these dimensions -- i.e., which documents will be of most value to the user at the current time -- can be determined by the user's current task, prior knowledge, etc. Does the user need more detail, or less, for example? In the current state of the art, it is difficult to compute this automatically. Instead, we propose that users should be enabled view these dimensions using themometers and to navigate them using themostats -- controls that offer users a choice of documents on the same topic, but with differing levels of detail, positive or negative spin, personal or impersonal voice, etc. The dimensions along which we can provide this kind of control must be easily computable. We have been able to characterize documents with respect to a number of these dimensions using simple statistical measures as well as specialized dictionaries, and describe these methods herein.},

abstract = {In this paper an ongoing research into dynamic intelligent handler of frequently asked questions (FAQs) is described. Although, the use of FAQs is widely used, there is no evidence that most FAQs contain frequently asked questions. This doubt arises due to the lack of a count of the number of times particular questions are asked; lack of indicators of the most recently asked question and a profile of users who asked these questions, and when these questions were last asked. These inadequacies render FAQs less useful for gauging user information needs and for devising appropriate interventions for different categories of users. Thus, a consulting environment in which an "intelligent handler" gets questions, dynamically creates FAQs with views based on user profiles, allows users to respond to questions and choose best response to questions is being developed.},

As product information is increasingly coming from multiple and heterogeneous sources, the number of profiles becomes unmanageably large. We present SmartClient, a technology based on constraint programming where a thin but intelligent client provides personalized information access for its user. As the process can run on the user's side, it allows much stronger filtering and visualization support with a wider range of personalization options than existing tools. It also eliminates the need to personalize many sites individually with different parameters, and supports product configuration and integration of different information sources in the same framework. We illustrate the technology using an application in travel e-commerce, which is currently under commercial deployment.},

In particular, in designing Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), it is effective to develop a prototype and to show it to end-users in order to reflect end-users' viewpoints, because the design of the GUI strongly affects the usability of the application. Use case diagrams and scenarios are described from end-users' viewpoints, so it is considered that GUIs reflecting end-users' viewpoints can be developed using use case diagrams. In this paper, we propose a method for generating GUI prototypes from given use case diagrams and scenarios. GUI prototypes can be generated based on the extracted control structure with appended simple widget information.},

Mixed reality depends on users' interactions with everyday objects that are enhanced with computational overlays. We describe an implementation, MACK (Media lab Autonomous Conversational Kiosk), an ECA who can answer questions about and give directions to the MIT Media Lab's various research groups, projects and people. MACK uses a combination of speech, gesture, and indications on a normal paper map that users place on a table between themselves and MACK. Research issues involve users' differential attention to hand gestures, speech and the map, and how reference using these modalities can be fused in input and generation.},

Thus a user often needs to select useful Web pages from them with page information like the title, the URL on the hit list, and actually fetch the Web pages for checking relevance. Since the page information is neither sufficient nor necessary for a user, adequate information is necessary for valid selection. Hence we propose adaptive interface AOAI in which different page information agents are organized through human evaluation.},
