abstract = {Hypertext has always been about allowing us to connect information in creative and useful ways. Anything can be linked to anything. This is the promise and problem of hypertext. It is possible to link things well but far easier to link things badly. The result is spaghetti writing to go with our spaghetti code, masses of senseless trails and tunnels where the reader loses all sense of attention and purpose. The computer science community responded to this diet of pasta with new practices, promoting interoperable, repeatable, reusable, object-oriented programming tools.},

abstract = {Readers familiar with the works of Douglas Adams will get the joke! This presentation will explore what has happened to hypermedia since the advent of the World Wide Web. In particular we will consider why there is so little use of hypermedia in the Web. Associative linking is at best added value and at worst irrelevant to most Web sites. Search engines are the dominant means of finding information, but everyone is aware of their limitations. This is all set to change as we move into the world of pervasive computing and increasingly access the internet through hand-held devices. Agent technology will become the dominant means of building distributed information management systems. This together with the development of the Semantic Web will enable us to build environments which provide users with highly personalized and adaptive global information spaces to navigate through. The presentation will consider the role of hypermedia in such environments will there be more links or less? The answer is of course 42.},

abstract = {While the HTML document format dominates most of the information
presented on the Web, the vision behind the Web has always been
that the information accessible on it should be machine-processable
as well as human consumable. While knowledge representation has a
long and distinguished history, it has largely concentrated on
capturing expertise in specialised domains. Allowing information to
be made machine processable in an environment as diverse as the Web
requires a number of underlying assumptions to be reassessed.A number of international initiatives are already investigating
the path to take towards enabling a machine-processable,
knowledge-rich information environment. Among these are the RDF and
RDFS working groups in W3C,and the DAML and Ontoknowledge projects.
In addition, the MPEG7 community is one of the key projects for
investigating the complex issues of combining semantics not only
with textual information, but also multimedia. We propose to
explore these issues and consider what problems need to be solved
to make the Semantic Web a reality.},

Document structures can be looked at in terms of layout and formatting features such as pages, columns, and so on. Despite the wide diversity of document structures, authors intentions are not taken into account. The concept of intentions is considered here as the effects that authors intend to have on their readers. It includes the reasons that led the authors to write the document and to select certain features instead of others. Intentional structures are a set of relations between document fragments that make explicit authors' intentions. Intentional structures are generally implicit. We want to help authors to make some of their intentions more explicit. This paper presents a new model based on speech act theory dealing with intentional structures and arguments of how it can be used to enhance written communication.},

Current shared workspace systems do not adequately support the evolving character of shared workspaces as needed by Extended Enterprises, i.e. the dynamic cooperation processes, various kinds of shared information contents and the set of cooperative tools. In this paper, the usage scenarios and requirements developed in a European Extended Enterprise project are used to derive the requirements for shared enterprise workspaces.Our approach utilizes component-based cooperative hypermedia to organize shared enterprise workspaces that contain team and process structures, information contents and their corresponding tools. The approach extends classical hypertext models to shared hypermedia objects as well as dynamic bindings between these and the Groupware Components working on them. To demonstrate the approach, a prototype system and a prototypical usage scenario are presented.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, hypermedia systems have become increasingly open, distributed, and modular. As a direct result of this, open hypermedia systems have been increasingly successful in providing middleware services such as linking to a large set of clients. This paper presents a new approach to service provision in open hypermedia systems based on the concept of multiple open services. The overall idea with multiple open services is to rethink the way in which services are provided to clients. The goal is to split up services into components, each of which provides a general, scalable, and functionally independent (orthogonal) service. This results in a highly flexible architectural framework that can serve as a vehicle to further investigate many of the open issues relating to open hypermedia systems. The approach can be viewed as a natural next step in the evolution towards more open, distributed, and modular hypermedia systems. The concept of multiple open services is described in detail, and a proof of concept implementation called Construct is presented.},

We consider the mechanism for delivery of the metadata across a distributed system, the format and content of the metadata flow itself, and the presentation of the media and augmenting metadata to the user. Two initial proof of concept applications have been developed to demonstrate these concepts, which we describe. Finally we propose a framework for highly distributed delivery and processing of multicast continuous metadata, as a part of the infrastructure necessary to provide a more complete multimedia environment for hypermedia systems.},

abstract = {Recent research on link analysis has shown the existence of numerous web communities on the Web. A web community is a collection of web pages created by individuals or any kind of associations that have a common interest on a specific topic. In this paper, we propose a technique to create a web community chart, that connects related web communities, from thousands of seed pages. This allows the user to navigate through related web communities, and can be used for a `What's Related Community' service that provides not only the web community including a given page but also related web communities. Our technique is based on a related page algorithm that gives related pages to a given page using only link analysis. We show that the algorithm can be used for creating the chart by applying the algorithm to each seed, then using similarities of the results to classify seeds into clusters and to deduce their relationships. We perform experiments to create a web community chart of companies and organizations from thousands of seed pages. First, we improve the precision of an existing related page algorithm, Companion, and evaluated the improved version, Companion-, by an user study. Then the chart is created using Companion-. The result chart consists of web communities including related pages, and paths between related web communities. From the chart, we can find many web communities of companies classified by their category of business, and relationships between the communities.},

abstract = {The development of spatial hypertext systems was driven by the need to lower users' effort of expression. Users express categories and interrelationships through the visual similarity and co-location of information objects. The ease of changing a visual property or moving an object makes spatial hypertext better suited to tasks where the information continually evolves. But the implicit nature of the structure poses challenges for tasks in which the authors and readers are not the same set of people. The Visual Knowledge Builder (VKB) includes the ease of expression of earlier spatial hypertexts while adding greater support for long-term collaboration and tasks requiring explicit links. VKB includes a history mechanism that records the evolution of the spatial hypertext and local, global, and historical links for explicit navigational connections between chunks of information. The mechanisms added to VKB make spatial hypertext applicable in a much wider variety of tasks. In particular, VKB's global links enable wide-area distributed spatial hypertext using the existing infrastructure of the Internet. Versions of VKB have been in use for two years in tasks including note taking, writing, project management, and conference organization.},

abstract = {This paper outlines the technical and social dimensions to a hypertext tool that has been successfully used in organizational settings to improve meetings, and capture group memory in real time. The approach derives from hypertext research systems from the mid-1980s-90s which sought to manipulate conceptual structures as hypertextual concept maps. However, many did not receive sustained use due to issues of cognitive overheads and representational inflexibility. Many decided that such tools would never fulfill their promise. The gIBIS system exemplified this early work, but has since evolved into a broader approach to collective sensemaking called Compendium. We outline Compendium, which demonstrates the impact that a hypertext facilitator can have on the learning and adoption problems that often ambush hypertext sensemaking tools before they have the chance to establish roots in work practice.},

abstract = {A common issue in Web browsing is how to manage information found while browsing or searching. The usual approach is either to bookmark an entire page when perhaps only one element is relevant, or to copy information from the page and paste it into a second application, such as a text editor. Neither approach is sufficient. Bookmarks over capture data; copying and pasting components implies that users must shift task focus from search tasks to information management tasks. This forced divided attention [8] between knowledge discovery and information management generally compromises both tasks. In this paper, we look at our iterative process to determine requirements for a tool to support the gathering process. In particular, we consider how these requirements have raised other issues about this interactive process, and how, by further evaluation, we hope to develop a richer Web-based design heuristics for within-page collections.},

abstract = {A hypermedia application offers its users much freedom to navigate through a large hyperspace. For authors finding a good compromise between offering navigational freedom and offering guidance is difficult, especially in applications that target a broad audience. Adaptive hypermedia (AH) offers (automatically generated) personalized content and navigation support, so the choice between freedom and guidance can be made on an individual basis. Many adaptive hypermedia systems (AHS) are tightly integrated with one specific application. In this paper we study design issues for general-purpose adaptive hypermedia systems, built according to an application-independent architecture. We use the Dexter-based AHAM reference model for adaptive hypermedia [7] to describe the functionality of such systems at the conceptual level. We concentrate on the architecture and behavior of a general-purpose adaptive engine. Such an engine performs adaptation and updates the user model according to a set of adaptation rules specified in an adaptation model. In our study of the behavior of such a system we concentrate on the issues of termination and confluence, which are important to detect potential problems in an adaptive hypermedia application. We draw parallels with static rule analysis in active database systems [1,2]. By using common properties of AIIS we are able to obtain more precise (less conservative) results for AHS than for active databases in general, especially for the problem of termination.},

We draw on computational and psycholinguistic analyses of texts which have derived a set of relationships that are termed Cognitive Coherence Relations (CCR). We validate this by re-expressing established cinematic patterns, and relations relevant to scholarly hypertext, in terms of CCR, and with this conceptual bridge in place, present examples to show how cinematic techniques could assist the presentation of scholarly discourse. This theoretical work also informs system design. We describe how an abstract relational layer based on CCR is being implemented as a semantic hypertext system to mediate scholarly discourse.},

Two example points in the structure versioning design space are presented, corresponding to most existing composite-based hypertext versioning systems. Using the presented design spaces allows the data models of existing hypertext versioning systems to be decomposed and compared in a principled way, and provides new system designers significant insight into the design tradeoffs between various link and structure versioning approaches.},

Bookmarks, paths over Web pages, and catalogs like Yahoo! are examples of page collections that can become out-of-date as changes are made to their components. Maintaining these collections requires that they be updated continuously. Tools to help in this maintenance require an understanding of what changes are important, such as when pages no longer exist, and what changes are not, such as when a visit counter changes. We performed a study to look at the effect of the type and quantity of change on people's perception of its importance. Subjects were presented pairs of Web pages with changes to either content (e.g., text), structure (e.g., links), or presentation (e.g., colors, layout). While changes in content were the most closely connected to subjects perceptions of the overall change to a page, subjects indicated a strong desire to be notified of structural changes. Subjects only considered the simultaneous change of many presentation characteristics as important.},

abstract = {The growth of the World Wide Web holds great promise for universal online information access. New information is constantly being made available for users. However, the information accessible on the Web changes constantly. These changes may occur as modifications to both the content and the location of previously existing Web resources. As these changes occur, the accessibility to past versions of such Web resources is often lost. This paper presents an approach to provide content persistence of Web resources by organizing collections of historical Web resources in a distributed configuration management system to allow online, read-only access to the versioned resources.},

There is the description of a typical KM architecture as well as some of the current KM and KM-like systems deployed in production at large corporations. This discussion will introduce the perceptions of KM and then emphasize the role of hypertext systems in tackling problems in processing distributed and collaborative knowledge. Although at the moment, hypertext is not seen as an architectural component of KM systems, its potential as an epistemic aid presents opportunities. Finally, I will show the appropriateness of hypertext research to KM development.},

abstract = {Ontologies provide a powerful tool for distributed agent-based information systems. However, in their raw form they can be difficult for users to interact with directly. Different query architectures use structured query languages as an interface but these still require the users to have an expert understanding of the underlying ontologies.By using an Open Hypermedia model as an interface to an ontological information space, users can interact with such a system using familiar browsing and navigation techniques, which are translated into queries over the underlying information. Coupled with dynamic document generation, this allows complicated queries to be made without the user having to interact directly with the ontologies.Our key contribution is a notion of hypermedia links between concepts and queries within an ontological information space. This approach is demonstrated with a Dynamic CV application built around the SoFAR agent framework and the Fundamental Open Hypermedia Model (FOHM). In addition to abstracting the interface, Open Hypermedia allows alternative linkbases to be used to represent different “query recipes”, providing different views and navigational experiences to the user.},

The assumed premise is that the textual content of a HTML page is not sufficient for a indexing process to extract the information that the page conveys. By the use of both local and complementary content when indexing pages, the quality of their index is improved and so is the effectiveness of the search engine.},

The data used in the estimation process was obtained through an experiment where effort and size metrics were collected.We have shown that case-based reasoning is a candidate technique to effort estimation and, with the aid of an automated environment, can be applied to hypermedia development effort prediction.},
