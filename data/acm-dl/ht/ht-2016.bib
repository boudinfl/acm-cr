abstract = {In an age of information overload, the ability to make sense of vast amounts of data and to render insightful visualizations is as important as the ability to read and write. This talk explains and exemplifies the power of data visualizations not only to help locate us in physical space but also to help us understand the extent and structure of our collective knowledge, to identify bursts of activity, pathways of ideas, and borders that beg to be crossed. It introduces a theoretical visualization framework meant to empower anyone to systematically render data into insights together with tools that support temporal, geospatial, topical, and network analyses and visualizations. Materials from the Information Visualization MOOC (http://ivmooc.cns.iu.edu) and maps from the Places &amp; Spaces: Mapping Science exhibit (http://scimaps.org) will be used to illustrate key concepts and to inspire participants to visualize their very own data.},

abstract = {The Web, as envisaged by its inventors, was founded on the idea of hyperlinks. Derived from the notion of hypertext in literary theory, a hyperlink is a relation rather than an object. It is a system of connections that connects distant pieces of text, resulting in a non-linear, open, active, decentralized, and diverse space we called the World Wide Web. But in the past few years, and with the rise of closed social networks, as well as mobile apps, the hyperlink - and thereby the Web - are in serious trouble. Most social networks have created a closed, linear, centralized, sequential, passive, and homogeneous space, where users are encouraged to stay in all the time -- a space that is more like television.The Web was imagined as an intellectual project that promoted knowledge, debate, and tolerance; as something I call library-internet. Now it has become more about entertainment and commerce; I call this tv-internet.},

abstract = {Online Social Networks (e.g., Twitter, Facebook) have dramatically grown in usage and popularity in recent years. In addition to keeping track of friends and acquaintances, these networks provide powerful means of exchanging and sharing information on many different topics of interest (e.g., sports, religion, politics, health concerns, etc.). Moreover, the use of these networks has introduced a completely new way of collaboration among people, virtually creating spheres of friends who generally feel comfortable discussing a variety of subjects and even helping each other to grow in knowledge about certain subjects. In this work, we built and analyzed networks of social groups on Twitter related to the top leading causes of death in the United States. Due to space limitations, we present results for the state of Florida and only for the top four leading causes of death. We show that using a concept of time window in the creation of relations between users, we can reconstruct social networks for these conversations and these networks have characteristics that are similar to typical social networks. The argument is that social network information can be extracted even in cases where users are not directly talking to each other (as it is the case in most of Twitter).},

abstract = {Eye tracking has been widely used to investigate user interactions with the Web to improve user experience. In our previous work, we developed an algorithm called Scanpath Trend Analysis (STA) that analyses eye movement sequences (i.e., scanpaths) of multiple users on a web page and identifies their most commonly followed path in terms of the visual elements of the page. These visual elements are mainly the segments of a page generated by automated segmentation approaches. In our previous work, we also showed that the STA algorithm performs better than other existing algorithms in terms of providing the most representative scanpath of users. However, we did not know whether the validity of the algorithm is limited to a particular segmentation approach. In this paper, we investigate the effect of two different segmentation approaches on the STA algorithm. The results suggest that the validity of the algorithm is not affected by the segmentation approach used. Specifically, the resulting scanpath of the STA algorithm is the most representative scanpath of users in comparison with the resulting scanpaths of other existing algorithms regardless of the segmentation approach used.},

Content and transaction log analysis revealed the processes by which Answerbag users negotiated the meaning of contested terms, and suggested instances when conflict was a positive force for the community.},

abstract = {Websites have an inherent interest in steering user navigation in order to, for example, increase sales of specific products or categories, or to guide users towards specific information. In general, website administrators can use the following two strategies to influence their visitors' navigation behavior. First, they can introduce click biases to reinforce specific links on their website by changing their visual appearance, for example, by locating them on the top of the page. Second, they can utilize link insertion to generate new paths for users to navigate over. In this paper, we present a novel approach for measuring the potential effects of these two strategies on user navigation. Our results suggest that, depending on the pages for which we want to increase user visits, optimal link modification strategies vary. Moreover, simple topological measures can be used as proxies for assessing the impact of the intended changes on the navigation of users, even before these changes are implemented.},

This paper focuses on playback plans that guide users through the recorded meeting content by automatically following available hyperlinks. Our system generates playback plans based on users' interests or prior meeting attendance and presents a dialog that lets users select the most appropriate plan. Prior experience with playback plans revealed users' confusion with automatic link following within a sequence of meetings. To address this issue, we designed three timeline visualizations of playback plans. A user study comparing the timeline designs indicated that different visualizations are preferred for different tasks, making switching among them important. The study also provided insights that will guide research of personalized hypervideo, both inside and outside a meeting context.},

abstract = {Location based narratives are an emerging form of digital storytelling that use location technologies to trigger content on smart devices according to a user's location. In previous work on the Canyons, Deltas and Plains (CDP) model we argued that they are best considered as a form of sculptural hypertext, but sculptural hypertext is a relatively unexplored medium with few examples, and limited critical theory. This means that there is little guidance for authors on what is possible with the medium, and no common authoring tools, both of which impede adoption and experimentation. In this paper we describe our work to tackle this problem by working with creative writing students to create 40 location based sculptural hypertexts using an approach similar to paper-prototyping, and then analysing these for common patterns (structures of nodes, rules, and conditions used for a poetic purpose). We present seven key patterns: Parallel Threads, Gating, Concurrent Nodes, Alternative Nodes, Foldbacks, Phasing, and Unlocking. In doing so we see some overlap with the patterns identified in traditional (calligraphic) hypertext, but in many cases these patterns are particularly suited to sculptural hypertext, and hint at a different poetics for the form. Our findings refine our original CDP model, but also present a starting point for educating writers on how to approach sculptural stories, and form a foundation for future location-based authoring tools.},

Most of such observations, however, have been made through the analysis of limited ethnographic or cross-sectional data. Using a temporally extended, large-scale dataset and comparative analyses to remedy this shortcoming, we examined how and why the age difference in the behaviors of users in Instagram might have occurred through the lenses of social cognition, developmental psychology, and human-computer interaction. We proposed two hypotheses -- teens as digital natives and the need for social interactions -- as the theoretical framework for understanding the factors that help explain the behavioral differences. Our computational analysis identified the following novel findings: (1) teens post fewer photos than adults; (2) teens remove more photos based on the number of Likes the photos received; and (3) teens have less diverse photo content. Our analysis was also able to confirm prior ethnographic accounts that teens are more engaged in Liking and commenting, and express their emotions and social interests more than adults. We discussed theoretical and practical interpretations and implications as well as future research directions from the results. Our datasets are available at: https://goo.gl/LqTYNv},

These users leave their activity traces as they maintain friendships and interact with other users in these OSNs. In this work, we analyze how users maintain friendship in multiple OSNs by studying users who have accounts in both Twitter and Instagram. Specifically, we study the similarity of a user's friendship and the evenness of friendship distribution in multiple OSNs. Our study shows that most users in Twitter and Instagram prefer to maintain different friendships in the two OSNs, keeping only a small clique of common friends in across the OSNs. Based upon our empirical study, we conduct link prediction experiments to predict missing friendship links in multiple OSNs using the neighborhood features, neighborhood friendship maintenance features and cross-link features. Our link prediction experiments shows that unsupervised methods can yield good accuracy in predicting links in one OSN using another OSN data and the link prediction accuracy can be further improved using supervised method with friendship maintenance and others measures as features.},

Using a dataset of 20,877 food businesses in Singapore, we conduct analysis of several key factors including business categories, locations, and neighboring businesses. From these factors, we extract a set of relevant features and develop a robust predictive model to estimate the popularity of a business location. Our experiments have shown that the popularity of neighboring business contributes the key features to perform accurate prediction. We finally illustrate the practical usage of our proposed approach via an interactive web application system.},

abstract = {The proliferation of social media is bringing about significant changes in how people make sense of their world and adopt new information. However, social, cultural and political divisions continue to separate users and information into different social media systems. Twitter and Facebook, for example, are strictly forbidden in mainland China. As a result, 21.97% of all world-wide Internet users are thus excluded from participating in these platforms. In this study, we investigate whether the dynamics of information diffusion, modeled as the adoption patterns of topical hashtags, differ between the communities of the mentioned social media sites as a result of this separation. Specifically, we compare Weibo and Twitter, the two largest micro-blogging sites serving respectively the Chinese population and the rest of the world, by exploring the similarities and differences of how their respective users adopt new information. By leveraging sophisticated community detection algorithms and heterogeneous graph mining methods, we investigate and compare how the different characteristics of these communities influence information diffusion and adoption. Experimental results show that while community-specific information influences topic diffusion and adoption in both environments, novel features, extracted from heterogeneous graph based communities, have a greater effect on Weibo information adoption than Twitter. We also find that users sharing hashtags is an important factor in information diffusion on both Twitter and Weibo, whereas user mentions are important for Weibo, but less so for Twitter. Overall, we conclude that Weibo and Twitter differ sharply in how their users adopt information in response to similar factors.},

abstract = {Web videos are becoming more and more popular. Current web technologies make it simpler than ever to both stream videos and create complex constructs of interlinked videos with additional information (video, audio, images, and text); so called hypervideos. When viewers interact with hypervideos by clicking on links, new content has to be loaded. This may lead to excessive waiting times, interrupting the presentation - especially when videos are loaded into the hypervideo player. In this work, we propose hypervideo pre-fetching strategies, which can be implemented in players to minimize waiting times. We examine the possibilities offered by the HTML5 <video> tag as well as the Media Source Extensions (MSE). Both HTML5 and MSE allow element pre-fetching (video and additional information) up to a certain granularity. Depending on the strategy and technology used, beginning scene waiting times and the overall download volume may increase. The strategies presented in this paper allow the number of delays during playback and the overall waiting time of a video to be reduced significantly from an average of 8.1 breaks to less than one break. The overall waiting times can be reduced by one third, to less than 18 seconds improving the hypervideo watching experience.},

These crisis-related messages disperse among multiple categories like infrastructure damage, information about missing, injured, and dead people etc. The challenge here is to extract important situational updates from these messages, assign them appropriate informational categories, and finally summarize big trove of information in each category. In this paper, we propose a novel framework which first assigns tweets into different situational classes and then summarize those tweets. In the summarization phase, we propose a two stage summarization framework which first extracts a set of important tweets from the whole set of information through an Integer-linear programming (ILP) based optimization technique and then follows a word graph and content word based abstractive summarization technique to produce the final summary. Our method is time and memory efficient and outperforms the baseline in terms of quality, coverage of events, locations et al., effectiveness, and utility in disaster scenarios.},

abstract = {Spatial hypertext represents associations between chunks of information by spatial or visual attributes (such as proximity, color, shape, etc.). This supports expressing information structures implicitly and in an intuitive way. However, automatic recognition of such informal, implicitly encoded structures by a machine (a so-called spatial parser) is still a challenge. Conventional parsers are conceptually restricted by their underlying source of information. Due to this limitation there are various possible structures that cannot be recognized properly, as the machine has no means to detect them. This inevitably limits both the quality of parser output and hence parser performance. In this paper we show that considering temporal aspects in spatial parser design will lead to significant increase in parsing accuracy, detection of richer structures and thus higher parser performance. We call machines that consider such spatial and temporal information spatio-temporal parsers.For the purpose of providing evidence, parsers for recognizing spatial, visual, and temporal object relations have been implemented and tested in a series of user surveys. One aim was to find out how "close" the machine interpretetation of structures get to human interpretation. It turned out that in none of the test cases pure spatial or visual parser could outperform the spatio-temporal parser. Instead, the spatio-temporal parser was able to compensate limitations of conventional parsers. Furthermore, we have statistically tested parsing accuracy. The results indicate a non-trivial effect that is recognizable by humans. This shows that spatio-temporal parsers produce output that is significantly closer to what knowledge workers intend to express compared to traditional spatial parsers.},

abstract = {The notion of implicit (or explicit) collaborative information access refers to systems and practices allowing a group of users to unintentionally (respectively intentionally) seek, share and retrieve information to achieve similar (respectively shared) information-related goals. Despite an increasing adoption in social environments, collaboration behavior in information seeking and retrieval is mainly limited to small-sized groups, generally restricted to working spaces. Much remains to be learned about collaborative information seeking within open web social spaces. This paper is an attempt to better understand either implicit or explicit collaboration by studying Twitter, one of the most popular and widely used social networks. We study in particular the complex intertwinement of human interactions induced by both collaboration and social networking. We empirically explore explicit collaborative interactions based on focused conversation streams during two crisis. We identify structural patterns of temporally representative conversation subgraphs and represent their topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling. Our main findings suggest that: 1) the critical mass of collaboration is generally limited to small-sized flat networks, with or without an influential user, 2) users are active as members of weakly overlapping groups and engage in numerous collaborative search and sharing tasks dealing with different topics, and 3) collaborative group ties evolve within the time-span of conversations.},

abstract = {During web search and browsing, people often accept misinformation due to their inattention to information credibility and biases. To obtain correct web information and support effective decision making, it is important to enhance searcher credibility assessment and develop algorithms to detect suspicious information. In this paper, we investigate how credibility alarms for web search results affect searcher behavior and decision making in information access systems. This study focuses on disputed topic suggestion as a credibility alarm approach. We conducted an online user study in which 92 participants performed a search task for health information. Through log analysis and user surveys, we confirmed the following. (1) Disputed topic suggestion in a search results list makes participants spend more time browsing pages than ordinary search conditions, thereby promoting careful information seeking. (2) Disputed topic suggestion during web browsing does not change participant behaviors but works as complementary information. This study contributes to system designs to enhance user engagement in critical and careful information seeking.},

We then construct comment semantics features and build several regression models to explore the value of comment semantics dynamics. The results reconfirm the usefulness of several essential quality predictors, including time, reputation, length, and editorship. We also found that comment semantics are valuable to shape the answer quality. Specifically, the diversity of comments significantly contributes to the answer quality. In addition, when searching for good quality answers, it is important to look for global semantics dynamics (diversity), rather than observe local differences (disputable content). Finally, the presence of comments shepherd the community to revise the posts by attracting attentions to the posts and eventually facilitate the editing process.},

abstract = {It is increasingly rare to encounter a Web service that doesn't engage in some form of automated recommendation, with Collaborative Filtering (CF) techniques being virtually ubiquitous as the means for delivering relevant content. Yet several key issues still remain unresolved, including optimal handling of cold starts and how best to maintain user-privacy within that context. Recent work has demonstrated a potentially fruitful line of attack in the form of cross-system user modelling, which uses features generated from one domain to bootstrap recommendations in another. In this paper we evidence the effectiveness of this approach through direct real-world user feedback, deconstructing a cross-system news recommendation service where user models are generated via social media data. It is shown that even when a relatively naive vector-space approach is used, it is possible to automatically generate user-models that provide statistically superior performance than when items are explicitly filtered based on a user's self-declared preferences. Detailed qualitative analysis of why such effects occur indicate that different models are capturing widely different areas within a user's preference space, and that hybrid models represent fertile ground for future research.},

To be effective, approaches for data graph exploration should take into account the utility from a user's point of view. We have been investigating knowledge utility -- how useful the trajectories in a data graph are for expanding users' knowledge. Following the theory for meaningful learning, according to which new knowledge is developed starting from familiar entities (anchors) and expanding to new and unfamiliar entities, we propose here an approach to identify knowledge anchors in a data graph. Our approach is underpinned by the Cognitive Science notion of basic level objects in domain taxonomies. Several metrics for extracting knowledge anchors in a data graph, and the corresponding algorithms, are presented. The metrics performance is examined, and a hybridization approach that combines the strengths of each metric is proposed.},

abstract = {Synonyms or other semantic associations can be used in web search in query substitution to improve or augment the query to retrieve more relevant search results. The value of substitution depends on how well the synonyms preserve semantic meaning, as any attrition in meaning can result in semantic drift of query results. Many synonyms are not synonyms in the traditional, thesaurus sense, but are semantic associations discovered automatically from online data, with the risk of semantic drift in substitution. This discovery of synonyms or other semantic associations arises from different methods applied over web search logs, and in this paper we review the candidate synonym pairs of words or phrases generated from three different methods applied over the same web search logs. The suitability of the candidate synonym pairs for the purpose of query substitution is evaluated in an experiment where 68 subjects assessed the search results generated by both the original query and the substituted query. It was found that two of the discovery methods returned significantly worse results with the substitution than were returned by the original query for the majority of queries, with only around 20-22% of substituted queries generating either improved or equally-relevant results. The third method however returned a very similar level of superior results as the original query, and saw over 71% of substituted queries generating either improved or equally-relevant results. These results indicate that even when candidate synonym pairs are confirmed as being semantically associated using other methods, they still may not be suitable for query substitution, depending on the method of synonym discovery.},

abstract = {The key success factor for modern web applications is their acceptance by the end-users which heavily depends on the quality of the user experience that they offer to them. Users require applications designed in such a way that it enables them to learn the supported functionalities easily, so that they can quickly find the information that they are looking for. Therefore, the usability and the overall design quality of an application can determine its success or failure. In this paper, we analyze the conceptual model of CMS-based web applications in terms of the incorporated design fragments that support the various user interaction processes. We consider these fragments as recurrent interaction patterns occurring in the application model, consisting of a configuration of front-end interface components that interrelate each other and interact with the user to achieve certain functionality. We have developed a methodology that automatically extracts the conceptual model of a web application and subsequently performs a pattern-based analysis of the model in order to identify the occurrences of all the recurrent interaction patterns. Finally, we calculate evaluation metrics revealing whether these patterns are used consistently throughout the application design. By utilizing these patterns, developers can produce more consistent and predictable designs, improving the ease of use of web applications.},

abstract = {User-authored reviews offer a window into micro-level engagement with issue-focused documentary films, which is a critical yet insufficiently understood topic in media impact assessment. Based on our data, features, and supervised learning method, we find that ratings of non-documentary (feature film) reviews can be predicted with higher accuracy (73.67%, F1 score) than ratings of documentary reviews (68.05%). We also constructed a classifier that separates reviews of documentaries from reviews of feature films with an accuracy of 71.32%. However, as our goal with this paper is not to improve the accuracy of predicting the rating and type or genre of film reviews, but to advance our understanding of the perception of documentaries in comparison to feature films, we also identified commonalities and differences between these two types of films as well as between low versus high ratings. We find that in contrast to reviews of feature films, comments on documentaries are shorter but composed of longer sentences, are less emotional, contain less positive and more negative terms, are lexically more concise, and are more focused on verbs than on nouns and adjectives. Compared to low-rated reviews, comments with a high rating are shorter, are more emotional and contain more positive than negative sentiment, and have less question marks and more exclamation points. Overall, this work contributes to advancing our understanding of the impact of different types of information products on individual information consumers.},

abstract = {Computational modeling of information exchange over social media is important for understanding coordination in online environments. Many contagion dynamics models that have been used to model Twitter, Facebook, and blog information transmission are polynomial-time computable, and hence can be efficiently simulated on networked populations. Game-theoretic models of collective action (i.e., coordination problems that require common knowledge among agents), however, have dynamics that are controlled in part by specific network structures such as cliques and bicliques. Contagion dynamics with these models cannot be efficiently computed because finding all bicliques in a graph, for example, is an NP-hard problem. We investigate a recent model of common knowledge dynamics that represents information spread on Facebook in which the biclique is the characterizing structure and convert the model into an efficiently computable one by using an approximation. We demonstrate this through experiments on seven different graphs for a total of 168 sets of conditions, including a 4-order of magnitude span in dynamics parameter values. Our approach speeds computations in two ways: (i) it obviates the need to find all bicliques in a social network, which is a very time- consuming task (computations can take 30 to 120 hours or more of wall clock time), and (ii) it reduces the time of simulation computations, in some cases by well over an order of magnitude. Our method also enables evaluation of much larger networks that are being mined from social media.},

abstract = {Air travel is one of the most frequently used means of transportation in our every-day life. Thus, it is not surprising that an increasing number of travelers share their experiences with airlines and airports in form of online reviews on the Web. In this work, we thrive to explain and uncover the features of airline reviews that contribute most to traveler satisfaction. To that end, we examine reviews crawled from the Skytrax air travel review portal. Skytrax provides four review categories to review airports, lounges, airlines and seats. Each review category consists of several five-star ratings as well as free-text review content. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive feature study and we find that not only five-star rating information such as airport queuing time and lounge comfort highly correlate with traveler satisfaction but also inferred features in the form of the review text sentiment. Based on our findings, we create classifiers to predict traveler satisfaction using the best performing rating features. Our results reveal that given our methodology, traveler satisfaction can be predicted with high accuracy. Additionally, we find that training a model on the sentiment of the review text provides a competitive alternative when no five-star rating information is available. We believe that our work is of interest for researchers in the area of modeling and predicting user satisfaction based on available review data on the Web.},

abstract = {When the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred in 2011, it was difficult to immediately grasp all telecommunications network conditions using only information from network monitoring devices because the damage was considerably heavy and a severe congestion control state occurred. Moreover, at the time of the earthquake, telephone and e-mail services could not be used in many cases-although social networking services (SNSs) were still available. In an emergency, such as an earthquake, users proactively convey information on telecommunications network conditions through SNSs. Therefore the collective intelligence of SNSs is suitable as a means of information detection complementary to conventional observation through network monitoring devices. In this paper, we propose a network failure detection system that detects telephony failures with a high degree of accuracy by using the collective intelligence of Twitter, one of the most widely used SNSs. We also show that network control can be performed automatically and autonomically using information on telecommunications network conditions detected with our system.},

abstract = {It is not unusual for documents on the Web to degrade and suffer from problems associated with unexpected change. In an analysis of the Association for Computing Machinery conference list, we found that categorizing the degree of change affecting digital documents over time is a difficult task. More specifically, we found that categorizing this degree of change is not a binary problem where documents are either unchanged or they have changed so dramatically that they do not fit within the scope of the collection. It is in part, a characterization of the intent of the change. In this paper, we present a case study that compares change detection methods based on machine learning algorithms against the assessment made by human subjects in a user study. Consequently, this paper will focus on two research questions. First, how can we categorize the various degrees of change that documents endure? And second, how did our automatic detection methods fare against the human assessment of change in the ACM conference list?},

We focus on meticulous comparison of various, well-known models of rumor propagation in the social network. We introduce the model incorporating mass media and effects of absent nodes. In this model the information appears spontaneously in the graph. Using the most conservative metric, we showed that the distribution of cascades sizes generated by this model fits the real data much better than the previously considered models.},

abstract = {Crowd-mapping is a form of collaborative work that empowers users to gather and share geographic knowledge. OpenStreetMap is one of the most successful examples of such paradigm, where the goal of building a global map of the world is collectively performed by over 2M contributors. Despite geographic information being intrinsically evolving, little research has so far gone into analysing maintenance practices in these domains. In this paper, we perform a preliminary exploration to quantitatively capture maintenance dynamics in geographic crowd-sourced datasets, in terms of: the extent to which different maintenance actions are taking place, the type of spatial information that is being maintained, and who engages in these practices. We apply this method to 117 countries in OSM, over one year of mapping activity. Our findings reveal that, although maintenance practices vary substantially from country to country in terms of how widespread they are, strong commonalities exist in terms of what metadata is being maintained and by whom.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a method for classifying Twitter accounts into non-targeting accounts, which post messages to the general public, and targeting accounts, which post messages to specific people. For example, an account posting general news information is a non-targeting account, while an account posting announcements to members of a specific organization is a targeting account. An account posting information on very specific minor topic, and an account used for communication with friends, are also targeting accounts. Our method finds some properties that are common to most followers of a given account, and calculate how much a user set with such a consistency deviates from a random sample from the given universe of users (e.g., the set of all Twitter users in some country). If it largely deviates, the account is a targeting account. We use two types of properties of followers: (1) terms in their metadata and (2) their followees. The result of our experiment shows that one of our methods, which computes two scores based on these two types of properties and combines them using SVM, achieves the accuracy 0.944, and outperforms the baselines.},

User-provided reviews of local businesses have provided rich information in terms of users' preferences regarding businesses and their interactions in reviewing systems; however, little is known about how the reviewing behaviors of users can benefit businesses in terms of suggesting potential collaboration opportunities. In the current study, we aim to build a recommendation system for businesses to provide suggestions for business collaboration. Based on historical data from Yelp that shows two businesses being reviewed by the same users within a same season, we were able to identify businesses that might attract the same customers in the future, and hence provide them with a collaboration suggestion. Our results suggest that the evidence - two businesses sharing reviews from same users - can provide recommendations for businesses to pursue future collaborative marketing opportunities.},

abstract = {Automated text analysis (ATA) has been a widely used tool for determining the sentiment of writing samples. However, it is unclear how ATA compares to human ratings of text when estimating affect. There are costs and benefits associated with each method, and comparing the two approaches will help determine which one provides the most useful and accurate results. This study uses 279 journal entries from individuals with chronic pain in order to estimate the positive and negative affect scores reported directly by participants. We use Lasso to select the features that are most predictive of affect. Our results indicate that the model combining human coders and ATA accounts for the most variance in self-reported positive affect scores, resulting in adjusted R-squared=0.36. For negative affect scores, we obtain a lower adjusted R-squared=0.30 with the combined model, however, ATA results in significantly higher adjusted R-squared=0.27 compared to the model using only human coders, R-squared=0.14. This suggests that utilizing human coders may be the most beneficial when the focus is on positive affect, but automated text analysis may be sufficient when studying negative affect.},

Twitter has been described in both the popular media and academic literature as an ideal space for serendipity to occur, though little research has sought to empirically confirm this relationship. The perception of Twitter as a space for serendipitous experiences is fueled by its dynamic qualities, trigger rich interface, and networked nature, which have the potential to prompt unexpected encounters with information and ideas. The present paper examined 184 individuals' use of Twitter features in relation to their perceptions of Twitter as serendipitous and tested for the influence of demographic differences. We found that age and use of Twitter features (checking timeline, tweeting, and searching) were strongly related to perceptions of Twitter as a serendipitous digital environment. Findings have implications for the design of digital environments that endeavor to facilitate serendipity.},

We found SMP to be effective, efficient and engaging for browsing tasks. Subsequently, ANOVA tests were employed which proved that it took fewer clicks to complete the task using SMP. However, the use of SMP did not prove to make a significant difference in expediting the completion of the task.},
