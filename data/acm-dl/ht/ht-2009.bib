abstract = {Online, hyperlinks connect not just related information, but people who relate to one another. In this talk I will discuss the many dimensions and uses of the social hyperlink across a variety of online communities. Sometimes it is the information that brings the people together, as they are seeking answers to questions, or seeking to answer questions. In online question and answer forums, hyperlinks record a fleeting social interaction, an information exchange. In other instances, for example, in virtual worlds, social hyperlinks may be conduits for social influence, direct transfer of information, or even the sharing of virtual goods. Occasionally, an online tie is established in order to navigate the real world, or more specifically, find a real couch to sleep on. This of course takes a good deal of trust - trust that is expressed in hyperlinks.},

abstract = {Annals and chronicles may be the foundation of accounting, but writers of stories and histories have long known that they seldom render a satisfactory account of complex events. In place of a simple chronological list, narrative instead organizes our account in new sequences in order to illuminate the interplay of actors and events. We want hypertext narrative to do things we cannot achieve in print; though we may occasionally use links to introduce variation in presentation or in story; it is now clear that hypertext will most frequently prove useful in changing (or adapting) plot. After discussing the ways in which plot may be varied, I describe the use of stretchtext as a reaction against the perceived incoherence of classic hypertext narrative, demonstrate the limitations that conventional stretchtext necessarily imposes on hypertext narrative, and describe an implemented generalization of stretchtext that matches the expressive and formal capabilities of classical hypertext systems while appearing to be a mere stretchtext and while running within the confines of a Web browser.},

abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study of the automatic correction of broken (dead) Web links focusing, in particular, on links broken by the relocation ofWeb pages. Our first contribution is that we developed an algorithm that incorporates a comprehensive set of heuristics, some of which are novel, in a single unified framework. The second contribution is that we conducted a relatively large-scale experiment, and analysis of our results revealed the characteristics of the problem of finding movedWeb pages. We demonstrated empirically that the problem of searching for moved pages is different from typical information retrieval problems. First, it is impossible to identify the final destination until the page is moved, so the index-server approach is not necessarily effective. Secondly, there is a large bias about where the new address is likely to be and crawler-based solutions can be effectively implemented, avoiding the need to search the entire Web. We analyzed the experimental results in detail to show how important each heuristic is in real Web settings, and conducted statistical analyses to show that our algorithm succeeds in correctly finding new links for more than 70% of broken links at 95% confidence level.},

At the session level, we distinguish four profiles of browsing dynamics in 2005-2006, and point out the growing dichotomy between straight routine sessions and exploratory browsing. At a global level, we observe that although each individual's corpus of visited sites is permanently growing, his browsing practices are structured around routine well-known sites which operate as links providers to new sites. We argue that this tension between the known and the unknown is constitutive of Web practices and is a fundamental property of personal Web territories.},

abstract = {How to help learners construct knowledge from hypertext and plan a navigation process on the Web are important issues in Web based learning. To provide solutions to these issues, this paper presents Knowledge Puzzle, a tool for knowledge construction from the Web. Its main contribution to Web-based learning is the personalization of information structure on the Web to cope with the knowledge structure in the learner's mind. Self-directed learners will be able to adapt the path of instruction on the Web to their way of thinking, regardless of how the Web content is delivered. The way to achieve that is to provide learners with a meta-cognitive tool that enables them to bring knowledge gained from the Web to the surface and visualize what they have in mind. Once we get the learner's viewpoint externalized, it will be converted to a hypermedia layer that will be laid over the Web pages visited by the learner. The attached layer adapts the views of Web pages to the learner's information needs by associating information pieces that are not already linked in hyperspace and attaching the learner's notes to the page content. Finally, a hypertext version of the whole constructed knowledge is produced to enable fast and easy reviewing.},

We are interested in a related question: do expert rankings of real-world entities correlate with search engine (SE) rankings of corresponding web resources? To answer this question we compared rankings of college football teams in the US with rankings of their associated web resources. We looked at the weekly polls released by the Associated Press (AP) and USA Today Coaches Poll. Both rank the top 25 teams according to the aggregated expertise of sports writers and college football coaches. For the entire 2008 season (8/2008 - 1/2009), we compared the ranking of teams (top 10 and top 25) according to the polls with the rankings of one to eight URLs associated with each team in Google, Live Search and Yahoo. We found moderate to high correlations between the final rankings of 2007 and the SE ranking in mid 2008 but the correlation between the polls and the SEs steadily decreased as the season went on. We believe this is because the rankings in the web graph (as reported via SEs) have "inertia" and do not rapidly fluctuate as do the teams' on the field fortunes.},

In a previous paper, we proposed a novel recommendation model that allows conversational systems to autonomously improve a fixed strategy and eventually learn a better one using reinforcement learning techniques. This strategy is optimal for the given model of the interaction and it is adapted to the users' behaviors. In this paper we validate our approach in an online CRS by means of a user study involving several hundreds of testers. We show that the optimal strategy is different from the fixed one, and supports more effective and efficient interaction sessions.},

abstract = {We argue that relationships between Web pages are functions of the user's intent. We identify a class of Web tasks - information-gathering - that can be facilitated by providing links to pages related to the page the user is currently viewing. We define three kinds of intentional relationships that correspond to whether the user is a) seeking sources of information, b) reading pages which provide information, or c) surfing through pages as part of an extended information-gathering process. We show that these three relationships can be mined using a combination of textual and link information and provide three scoring mechanisms that correspond to them: SeekRel, FactRel and SurfRel. These scoring mechanisms incorporate both textual and link information. We build a set of capacitated subnetworks, each corresponding to a particular keyword. Scores are computed by computing flows on these subnetworks. The capacities of the links are derived from the hub and authority values of the nodes they connect, following the work of Kleinberg (1998) on assigning authority to pages in hyperlinked environments. We evaluated our scoring mechanism by running experiments on four data sets taken from the Web. We present user evaluations of the relevance of the top results returned by our scoring mechanisms and compare those to the top results returned by Google's Similar Pages feature, and the Companion algorithm (Dean and Henzinger, 1999).},

The challenge of generating adaptive and personalised hypertext presentations from open source content promises a dramatic improvement of the choice of information shown to the learner. This paper proposes an architecture of such a dynamic hypertext generation system and its use in an authentic learning environment. The system is evaluated in terms of educational benefit, as well as the satisfaction of the users testing the system. Concluding from this evaluation, the paper will explore the future work necessary to further enhance the system performance and learning experience.},

abstract = {The early Web was hailed for being easy to use, and what is more important, giving people a chance to participate in its growth. The Web3D was believed to have potential to be the next step in the Web's evolution, since it could benefit from graphics hardware and provide users with new and exciting experiences. Nevertheless, Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML), the first Web3D standard, and its successor X3D, did not generate commercial success. These languages were excessively complex for average Internet users.In this paper, we propose 2LIPGarden, a 3D Hypermedia publishing framework that lets individuals who only know basic HTML - those same enthusiasts who could write pages for the early Web - create simple, easy to use yet interactive 3D web pages. Our framework builds upon 2-Layer Interface Paradigm (2LIP), an attempt to marry advantages of 3D experience with the advantages of narrative structure of hypertext. We introduce c-link to HTML, a new type of hyperlink, which connects text with its 3D visualization.},

In this paper we explore how themes could be used to enrich automatically generated narratives, and describe how a system which generated story selections in the form of photo montages was developed using a thematic model of narrative. This was achieved by selecting narrative atoms, in this case photographs, from a selection of images on a specific subject with relevance to a desired theme. Our pilot study shows that our thematic system selects images with greater relevance to desired titles, and that the positive impact of thematic selection increases when the images are presented together. We hope that our thematic work will inform others working on narrative systems, and will lead to richer automated narratives.},

In the world of XML, powerful and widely-supported solutions exist to create such documents. Surprisingly enough, a lot of interesting features - especially those envisioned by the pioneers of the hypermedia community - are still missing for XML inclusions. The goal of this paper is to investigate these issues and identify possible improvements in this area. Our main inspiration is the Xanadu project and the concept of transclusions. This paper proposes an enhanced model to describe and interact with XML inclusions. We identify multiple classes of inclusions and multiple views of multi-source documents. Particular attention is also given to the idea of making inclusions transparent to both users and applications. An engine producing composite documents, with rich information about inclusions, and a viewer for modularized XML documents are presented as well.},

However, while sighted people can visually parse and understand these complex layouts in seconds, current assistive technologies such as screen readers cannot. This puts visually impaired users at a great disadvantage. In order to design better assistive technologies, we conducted a study of how people interpret modular layouts of news and shopping Web pages. The study revealed that when the layout complexity increases, the interpretation process gets longer and the reading gets more varied. Also, before looking at the main content, users first frame the Web page by looking for familiar structural elements that can be used as references and entry points. These elements include navigational bars, search boxes, and ads. This implies that assistive technologies can reduce the time required to frame the pages if they help users identify reference points and entry points.},

Preserving user identity in the data set allows us to discover novel properties of Web traffic that directly affect models of hypertext navigation. We find that the popularity of Web sites--the number of users who contribute to their traffic--lacks any intrinsic mean and may be unbounded. Further, many aspects of the browsing behavior of individual users can be approximated by log-normal distributions even though their aggregate behavior is scale-free. Finally, we show that users' click streams cannot be cleanly segmented into sessions using timeouts, affecting any attempt to model hypertext navigation using statistics of individual sessions. We propose a strictly logical definition of sessions based on browsing activity as revealed by referrer URLs; a user may have several active sessions in their click stream at any one time. We demonstrate that applying a timeout to these logical sessions affects their statistics to a lesser extent than a purely timeout-based mechanism.},

abstract = {In tagging systems users can annotate items of interest with free-form terms. A good understanding of usage characteristics of such systems is necessary to improve the design of current and next generation of tagging systems. To this end, this work explores three aspects of user behavior in CiteULike and Connotea, two systems that include tagging features to support online personalized management of scientific publications. First, this study characterizes the degree to which users re-tag previously published items and reuse tags: 10 to 20% of the daily activity can be characterized as re-tagging and about 75% of the activity as tag reuse. Second, we use the pairwise similarity between users' activity to characterize the interest sharing in the system. We present the interest sharing distribution across the system, show that this metric encodes information about existing usage patterns, and attempt to correlate interest sharing levels to indicators of collaboration such as co-membership in discussion groups and semantic similarity of tag vocabularies. Finally, we show that interest sharing leads to an implicit structure that exhibit a natural segmentation. Throughout the paper we discuss the potential impact of our findings on the design of mechanisms that support tagging systems.},

Our solution is based on multifaceted search, which provides an efficient update mechanism for relations between objects, as well as efficient search over the heterogeneous data. We describe a social search engine positioned within a large enterprise, applied over social data gathered from several Web 2.0 applications. We conducted a large user study with over 600 people to evaluate the contribution of social data for search. Our results demonstrate the high precision of social search results and confirm the strong relationship of users and tags to the topics retrieved.},

abstract = {People share millions of resources (photos, bookmarks, videos, etc.) in Folksonomies (like Flickr, Delicious, Youtube, etc.). To access and share resources, they add keywords called tags to the resources. As the tags are freely chosen keywords, it might not be possible for users to tag their resources with all the relevant tags. As a result, many resources lack sufficient number of relevant tags. The lack of relevant tags results into sparseness of data, and this sparseness of data makes many relevant resources unsearchable against user queries.In this paper, we explore two dimensions of semantic relationships between tags, based on the context and the distribution of tags. We exploit semantic relationships between tags to reduce sparseness in Folksonomies and propose different enriched vector space models. We also propose a vector space model Best of Breed which utilizes appropriate enrichment method based on the type of the query. We evaluate the proposed methods on a large dataset of 27 million resources, 92 thousand tags and 94 million tag assignments. Experimental results show that the enriched vector space models help in improving search, especially for the rare queries which have few relevant resources in the sparse data.},

One of the most basic tools, the analysis of connected components, however cannot be applied meaningfully: Tagging networks tend to be almost entirely connected. We therefore propose a generalization of connected components, m-hyperincident connected components. We show that decomposing tagging networks into 2-hyperincident connected components yields a characteristic component distribution with a salient giant component that can be found across various datasets. This pattern changes if the underlying formation process changes, for example, if the hypergraph is constructed from search logs, or if the tagging data is contaminated by spam: It turns out that the second- to 129th largest components of the spam-labeled Bibsonomy dataset are inhabited exclusively by spam users. Based on these findings, we propose and unsupervised method for spam detection.},

We consider several different network representations of tags and documents, and apply a graph clustering algorithm on these networks to obtain groups of tags or documents corresponding to the different meanings of an ambiguous tag. Our experiments show that networks which explicitly take the social context into account are more likely to give a better picture of the semantics of a tag.},

abstract = {The rapidly increasing popularity of Web 2.0 knowledge and content sharing systems and growing amount of shared data make discovering relevant content and finding contacts a difficult enterprize. Typically, folksonomies provide a rich set of structures and social relationships that can be mined for a variety of recommendation purposes. In this paper we propose a formal model to characterize users, items, and annotations in Web 2.0 environments. Our objective is to construct social recommender systems that predict the utility of items, users, or groups based on the multi-dimensional social environment of a given user. Based on this model we introduce recommendation mechanisms for content sharing frameworks. Our comprehensive evaluation shows the viability of our approach and emphasizes the key role of social meta knowledge for constructing effective recommendations in Web 2.0 applications.},

abstract = {The Social Web is successfully established and poised for continued growth. Web 2.0 applications such as blogs, bookmarking, music, photo and video sharing systems are among the most popular; and all of them incorporate a social aspect, i.e., users can easily share information with other users. But due to the diversity of these applications -- serving different aims -- the Social Web is ironically divided. Blog users who write about music for example, could possibly benefit from other users registered in other social systems operating within the same domain, such as a social radio station. Although these sites are two different and disconnected systems, offering distinct services to the users, the fact that domains are compatible could benefit users from both systems with interesting and multi-faceted information. In this paper we propose to automatically establish social links between distinct social systems through cross-tagging, i.e., enriching a social system with the tags of other similar social system(s). Since tags are known for increasing the prediction quality of recommender systems (RS), we propose to quantitatively evaluate the extent to which users can benefit from cross-tagging by measuring the impact of different cross-tagging approaches on tag-aware RS for personalized resource recommendations. We conduct experiments in real world data sets and empirically show the effectiveness of our approaches.},

To do so I use autoethnography to reconstruct my personal blogging practices in relation to developing PhD ideas from two perspectives. I first discuss my practices of using a weblog as a personal information management tool and then analyse its uses at different stages in the process of working on a PhD dissertation: dealing with fuzzy insights, sense-making and turning ideas into a dissertation text. The findings illustrate that next to supporting thinking in a way private notebooks do, a weblog might serve similar roles as papers on one's office desk: dealing with emerging insights and difficult to categorise ideas, while at the same time creating opportunities for accidental feedback and impressing those who drop by.},

Tools for creating hypertext fiction typically represent such narratives in the form of nodes and links. However, existing tools are not particularly helpful when an author wants to create a story with a more complex structure, such as a story told from multiple points of view. In this paper, we describe our work to develop HypeDyn, a new hypertext authoring tool that provides alternative representations designed to make it easier to create complex hypertext story structures. As an initial exploration, the tool has been designed to support authoring of interactive, multiple-points-of-view stories. In order to describe the tool, we describe a simplified transformation of Rashomon into a progressively more interactive narrative. Along the way, we identify useful new representations, mechanisms, and visualizations for helping the author. We conclude with some thoughts about the design of interactive storytelling authoring tools in general.},

Furthermore, the infrastructure also provides an open search engine over domain names using meta-information like tags or geo-location.

To evaluate its feasibility and use, we used logging, surveys, and statistical analysis for collecting and analyzing the data. We discovered that guests found the Olympics guide application to be the most popular, followed by Nokia Maps and then photo sharing on Ovi. The results demonstrate that the techniques used in our evaluation can be used to determine the type of applications that are relevant to consumers at a real-time event, and suggests ways for improving the mobile application design and user experience.},

The Intelligent Agent analyzes the Web sites visited by the users collecting information useful to her/his characterization and crosses such information with the personal preferences expressed by the user her/himself. The user profile is stored in a document written in pCard format that we have defined as an evolution of the vCard format.},

abstract = {Collaborative annotation tools are in widespread use. The metadata from these systems can be mined to induce semantic relationships among Web objects (sites, pages, tags, concepts, users), which in turn can support improved search, recommendation, and otherWeb applications. We build upon prior work by extracting relationships among tags and among resources from two social bookmarking systems, Bibsonomy.org and GiveALink.org. We introduce a scalable and collaborative measure that we name maximum information path (MIP) similarity. Our analysis shows that MIP outperforms the best scalable similarity measures in the literature. We are currently integrating MIP similarity into a number of applications under development in the GiveALink project, including search and recommendation, Web navigation maps, bookmark management, social networks, spam detection, and a tagging game to create incentives for collaborative annotations.},

Users of social media sites such as Flickr often face the enormous challenge of which group to choose, due to the presence of numerous competing groups of similar content. Determining an empirical measure of significance of a group can help tackle this problem. The proposed framework therefore determines an optimal measure per group based on past user participation and interaction as well as likely future activity in the group. The framework is tested on a Flickr dataset and the results show that this method can yield satisfactory predictions of group activity. This implies that the computed measure of significance of a group can be used by end users to choose groups with rich activity.},

Then the selected information is processed and submitted to a search engine. We propose an algorithm based on information retrieval techniques to select the most relevant information and to rank the candidate pages provided for the search engine, in order to help the user to find the best replacement. To test the different methods, we have also defined a methodology which does not require the user judgements, what increases the objectivity of the results.},

If one of the first three measures is high, then the fourth measure is probably high too, if the change in agents and dependencies is a cause for a change in coalitions. If the first three measures are low, but the change in coalitions is high, it is due to internal processes like violations of the coalition agreements.},

In this paper we are interested in describing a computer mediated activity by a person throughout a semi-automatic redocumentation process. This process uses traces generated automatically, during a user-system interaction, to assist a person in producing a personalized document describing the traced activity. To support that, a general framework for an authoring tool is proposed through two main phases. During the first phase, an automatic and parameterized transformation is applied on the input activity trace to generate a fragmented document. Each fragment describes one or many observed elements of the modeled trace and relations between fragments are deduced from relations between these elements. The second phase consists in interactive transformations on the intermediate produced document until getting the final hypermedia document. Our authoring tool uses composition of personalized document issues and RST principals to interpret user's choices and to maintain the coherence of the produced document.},

In order to get high rank, some try to improve contents of web pages while others just put dirty tricks, such as link spam. Link spam is a trick targeting at link-based ranking algorithms by artificially created tight link structures to push some target pages get undeserved high ranks. This problem becomes even worse with the advent of wikis, blogs, forums, which are rich in links. We tackle the problem of improving link-based ranking by more fundamental viewpoint--"noisy link" analysis. Motivated by how "non-voting" hyperlinks affect quality of ranking, we propose an approach and corresponding penalty strategies to both detect and handle "noisy link" effectively and automatically. We also compared our approach with other related works to demonstrate that our approach is rather effective in noisy link filtering and could improve the final search results significantly.},
