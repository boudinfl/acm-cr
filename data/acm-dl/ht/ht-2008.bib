abstract = {In the ongoing movement toward socially-produced information resources, we are increasingly able to look through the content being created and see the individuals, incentives, and larger social processes at work. Designing and working with large-scale participatory social computing applications requires that we think not just about technological issues, but also about fundamental principles of human social interaction. Through the digital traces that these applications generate, we can begin to quantify and reason about such principles at unprecedented levels of scale and resolution.In this talk, we consider a crucial type of social process in this setting - the mechanisms by which information flows through groups of people engaged in sharing and synthesizing knowledge. As information, ideas, opinions, and beliefs spread through an underlying social network, their dynamics resemble that of an epidemic, moving "contagiously" from person to person. But social contagion is different from biological contagion in many respects; understanding the analogies and contrasts between these two kinds of processes leads us to consider the rich temporal characteristics of information flow within a network and the complex decision rules by which people choose to act on new information. The result is a richer picture of the communities that create knowledge and its interlinkages, and of the resources that ultimately arise from these processes.},

abstract = {The current Web is a dynamic collection where little effort is made to version pages or to enable users to access historical data. As a consequence, they generally do not have sufficient temporal support when browsing the Web. However, we think that there are many benefits to be obtained from integrating documents with their histories. For example, a document's history can enable us to travel back through time to establish its trustworthiness. This paper discusses the possible types of interactions that users could have with document histories and it presents several examples of systems that we have implemented for utilizing this historical data. To support our view, we present the results of an online survey conducted with the objective of investigating user needs for temporal support on the Web. Although the results indicated quite low use of Web archives by users, they simultaneously emphasized their considerable interest in page histories.},

If websites are to script a personalization experience that draws on information held by the user, it is imperative that this information be easily comprehensible by heterogeneous websites. In this paper, we demonstrate how Semantic Web technologies can be used to realize a vision of client-side Web personalization.

abstract = {As the popularity of the web increases, particularly the use of social networking sites and style sharing platforms, users are becoming increasingly connected, sharing more and more information, resources, and opinions. This vast array of information presents unique opportunities to harvest knowledge about user activities and interests through the exploitation of large-scale, complex systems. Communal tagging sites, and their respective folksonomies, are one example of such a complex system, providing huge amounts of information about users, spanning multiple domains of interest. However, the current Web infrastructure provides no mechanism for users to consolidate and exploit this information since it is spread over many desperate and unconnected resources. In this paper we compare user tag-clouds from multiple folksonomies to: (a) show how they tend to overlap, regardless of the focus of the folksonomy (b) demonstrate how this comparison helps finding and aligning the user's separate identities, and (c) show that cross-linking distributed user tag-clouds enriches users profiles. During this process, we find that significant user interests are often reflected in multiple Web2.0 profiles, even though they may operate over different domains. However, due to the free-form nature of tagging, some correlations are lost, a problem we address through the implementation and evaluation of a user tag filtering architecture.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a temporally evolving representation framework for context that can efficiently predict communication flow in social networks between a given pair of individuals. The problem is important because it facilitates determining social and market trends as well as efficient information paths among people. We describe communication flow by two parameters: the intent to communicate and communication delay. To estimate these parameters, we design features to characterize communication and social context. Communication context refers to the attributes of current communication. Social context refers to the patterns of participation in communication (information roles) and the degree of overlap of friends between two people (strength of ties). A subset of optimal features of the communication and social context is chosen at a given time instant using five different feature selection strategies. The features are thereafter used in a Support Vector Regression framework to predict the intent to communicate and the delay between a pair of individuals. We have excellent results on a real world dataset from the most popular social networking site, www.myspace.com. We observe interestingly that while context can reasonably predict intent, delay seems to be more dependent on the personal contextual changes and other latent factors characterizing communication, e.g. 'age' of information transmitted and presence of cliques among people.},

abstract = {In this paper, we develop a simple model to study and analyze communication dynamics in the blogosphere and use these dynamics to determine interesting correlations with stock market movement. This work can drive targeted advertising on the web as well as facilitate understanding community evolution in the blogosphere. We describe the communication dynamics by several simple contextual properties of communication, e.g. the number of posts, the number of comments, the length and response time of comments, strength of comments and the different information roles that can be acquired by people (early responders / late trailers, loyals / outliers). We study a "technology-savvy" community called Engadget (http://www.engadget.com). There are two key contributions in this paper: (a) we identify information roles and the contextual properties for four technology companies, and (b) we model them as a regression problem in a Support Vector Machine framework and train the model with stock movements of the companies. It is interestingly observed that the communication activity on the blogosphere has considerable correlations with stock market movement. These correlation measures are further cross-validated against two baseline methods. Our results are promising yielding about 78% accuracy in predicting the magnitude of movement and 87% for the direction of movement.},

We show that graph synopses defined by the importance of vertices provide small, relatively accurate portraits, independent of the importance measure, of the larger underlying graphs and of the important vertices.

This paper presents a generative tagging model that integrates both components, the background knowledge and the influence of previous tag assignments.

Some writers have applied this to expository and argumentative hypertext, taking advantage of hypertext's ability to expand the "margins" of a document in new directions. Where argumentative issues or contexts are complex and self-reflexive enough, these writers urge that hypertexts become complex multi-dimensional expository and argumentative texts with elaborate rhetorical and argumentative structures that take place over sequences of links. However this ideal is challenged by developments on the Web, where argumentative hypertexts are dominated by a linked mini-essay style that uses one-step link patterns for its rhetorical moves. Was the ideal of complex hypertext rhetorical structures mistaken? This essay analyzes the situation, argues for the viability of more complex hypertexts, suggests some causes for the dominance of the single page and single-step rhetorical move, and looks at some developments that may challenge this dominance.},

abstract = {Scanning books, magazines, and newspapers has become a widespread activity because people believe that much of the worlds information still resides off-line. In general after works are scanned they are indexed for search and processed to add links. This paper describes a new approach to automatically add links by mining popularly quoted passages. Our technique connects elements that are semantically rich, so strong relations are made. Moreover, link targets point within a work, facilitating navigation. This paper makes three contributions. We describe a scalable algorithm for mining repeated word sequences from extremely large text corpora. Second, we present techniques that filter and rank the repeated sequences for quotations. Third, we present a new user interface for navigating across and within works in the collection using quotation links. Our system has been run on a digital library of over 1 million books and has been used by thousands of people.},

Whereas search engines help you find information you are looking for, discovery engines help you find things that you never knew existed. A common discovery technique is to automatically identify and display objects similar to ones previously viewed by the user. Core to this approach is an accurate method to identify similar documents. In this paper, we present a new approach to identifying similar documents based on a conceptual tree-similarity measure. We represent each document as a concept tree using the concept associations obtained from a classifier. Then, we make employ a tree-similarity measure based on a tree edit distance to compute similarities between concept trees. Experiments on documents from the CiteSeer collection showed that our algorithm performed significantly better than document similarity based on the traditional vector space model.},

The tool works by adding additional hyperlinks to blogs, links which connect blog entries addressing similar topics. These hyperlinks are generated by an algorithm that uses statistical language modeling and graph based analysis to exploit the implicit associative structure of the blogosphere.

abstract = {Social bookmarks allow Web users to actively annotate individual Web resources. Researchers are exploring the use of these annotations to create implicit links between online resources. We define an implicit link as a relationship between two online resources established by the Web community. An individual may create or reinforce a relationship between two resources by applying a common tag or organizing them in a common folder. This has led to the exploration of techniques for building networks of resources, categories, and people using the social annotations. In order for these techniques to move from the lab to the real world, efficient building and maintenance of these potentially large networks remains a major obstacle. Methods for assembling and indexing these large networks will allow researchers to run more rigorous assessments of their proposed techniques. Toward this goal we explore an approach from the sparse matrix literature and apply it to our system, GiveALink.org. We also investigate distributing the assembly, allowing us to grow the network with the body of resources, annotations, and users. Dividing the network is effective for assembling a global network where the implicit links are dependent on global properties. Additionally, we explore alternative implicit link measures that remove global dependencies and thus allow for the global network to be assembled incrementally, as each participant makes independent contributions. Finally we evaluate three scalable similarity measures, two of which require a revision of the data model underlying our social annotations.},

abstract = {Social bookmarking systems constitute an established part of the Web 2.0. In such systems users describe bookmarks by keywords called tags. The structure behind these social systems, called folksonomies, can be viewed as a tripartite hypergraph of user, tag and resource nodes. This underlying network shows specific structural properties that explain its growth and the possibility of serendipitous exploration.Today's search engines represent the gateway to retrieve information from the World Wide Web. Short queries typically consisting of two to three words describe a user's information need. In response to the displayed results of the search engine, users click on the links of the result page as they expect the answer to be of relevance.This clickdata can be represented as a folksonomy in which queries are descriptions of clicked URLs. The resulting network structure, which we will term logsonomy is very similar to the one of folksonomies. In order to find out about its properties, we analyze the topological characteristics of the tripartite hypergraph of queries, users and bookmarks on a large snapshot of del.icio.us and on query logs of two large search engines. All of the three datasets show small world properties. The tagging behavior of users, which is explained by preferential attachment of the tags in social bookmark systems, is reflected in the distribution of single query words in search engines. We can conclude that the clicking behaviour of search engine users based on the displayed search results and the tagging behaviour of social bookmarking users is driven by similar dynamics.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web (WWW) provides access to a vast array of interconnected educational content on almost every subject imaginable. A great deal of this content is ideal for incorporation into personalised eLearning experiences. However the discovery, harvesting and incorporation of appropriate educational material have proven to be complex and arduous tasks.Traditional educational hypertext systems are based upon the generation of links and anchors between content objects [1]. However the dynamic incorporation of open corpus educational content in eLearning requires the generation of a relationship between educational concepts and the hypertext documents. One approach to create this overlay between concept and content is to use a Mindmap interface to allow learners to explore and associate hypertext content with knowledge maps of their own creation.This paper presents the Open Corpus Content Service (OCCS), a framework that uses the hypertext structure of the WWW to provide methods of educational content discovery and harvesting. The OCCS semantically examines linked content on both the WWW and in digital content repositories, and creates concept specific caches of content. The paper also introduces U-CREATe, a novel user-driven Mindmap interface for supporting the exploration and assembly of content cached by the OCCS, in a pedagogically meaningful manner. The combination of these systems benefits both the educator and learner, empowering the learner through ownership of the educational experience and allowing the educator to focus on the pedagogical design of educational offerings rather than content authoring.},

The infrastructure is inspired from earlier work on open hypermedia, in the sense that the anchoring and blogging functionality can be integrated to augment arbitrary Web sites providing information that is relevant to places or objects in the physical world. The blog and anchor functionality is implemented as a set of Web services running on a server external to the content server. Experiences and design issues from three cases are discussed, which use Semacode-based physical anchoring to support lightweight urban Web applications.},

abstract = {Tag clouds are a popular method for visualizing and linking socially-organized information on websites. Tag clouds represent variables of interest (such as popularity) in the visual appearance of the keywords themselves - using text properties such as font size, weight, or colour. Although tag clouds are becoming common, there is still little information about which visual features of tags draw the attention of viewers. As tag clouds attempt to represent a wider range of variables with a wider range of visual properties, it becomes difficult to predict what will appear visually important to a viewer. To investigate this issue, we carried out an exploratory study that asked users to select tags from clouds that manipulated nine visual properties. Our results show that font size and font weight have stronger effects than intensity, number of characters, or tag area; but when several visual properties are manipulated at once, there is no one property that stands out above the others. This study adds to the understanding of how visual properties of text capture the attention of users, indicates general guidelines for designers of tag clouds, and provides a study paradigm and starting points for future studies. In addition, our findings may be applied more generally to the visual presentation of textual hyperlinks as a way to provide more information to web navigators.},

Here we introduce and evaluate network-based visualizations for facilitating the exploration of a Web knowledge space. We developed a force directed network interface to visualize the result sets provided by GiveALink.org, a social bookmarking site. The classifications and tags by users are aggregated to build a social similarity network between bookmarked resources. We administered a user study to evaluate the potential of leveraging such social links in an exploratory search task. During exploration, the similarity links are used to arrange the resources in a semantic layout. Users in our study prefer a hybrid interface combining a conventional ranked list and a two dimensional network map, allowing them to find the same amount of relevant information using fewer queries. This behavior is a direct result of the additional structural information present in the network visualization, which aids them in the exploration of the information space.},

Only a small set of requirements needs to be implemented as part of the browser's software, the rest is accounted by client-side code.Client-side code has the advantage that it can account for missing functionality with no changes to the browser, thus making it more dynamic, easier to implement, and enabling third-party developers to contribute. At the same time, it is risk-free for users accessing other content types. On the downside, client-side code suffers from degraded performance and potentially introduces security concerns.},
