abstract = {In this keynote we give an introduction to wisdom of crowds in the Web, the long tail of web content, and the bias involved in the generation of user generated content (UGC). This bias creates the wisdom of ad-hoc crowds or the wisdom of a few. Although it is well known that user activity in most settings follows a power law, that is, few people do a lot, while most do nothing, there are few studies that characterize well this activity. In a recent analysis of social network data we corroborated that a small percentage of the active users (passive users are the majority) represent at least the 50% of the UGC. This implies that most of the wisdom comes from a few users, which is not that surprising, as the Web is a reflection of our own society, where economical or political power also is in the hands of minorities.},

abstract = {Big data can be used for more than improving the targeting of marketing campaigns. In this talk I will present five big data visualization engines we have created at the MIT Media Lab's Macro Connections group and will show how we can use big data and visualizations to improve our understanding of the development of economies, cultures and cities. The data visualization engines I will demo include (i) the Observatory of Economic Complexity (atlas.media.mit.edu), which is the most comprehensive tool for exploring international trade data created to date; (ii) DataViva (dataviva.info), which is a tool we created to open up data for the entire formal sector economy of Brazil, including data on all of the working force, municipalities, industries, and occupations of Brazil; (iii) Pantheon (pantheon.media.mit.edu), a dataset and visualization engine we created to explore global patterns of cultural production; (iv) Immersion (immersion.media.mit.edu), which is a tool that inverts the email interface, by focusing it on people rather than messages; and (v) Place Pulse and StreetScore (pulse.media.mit.edu &amp; streetscore.media.mit.edu), which are crowd-sourcing and machine learning tools we have developed to help understand the aesthetic aspects of cities and their evolution.},

abstract = {Users' personal information such as their political views is important for many applications such as targeted advertisements or real-time monitoring of political opinions. Huge amounts of data generated by social media users present opportunities and challenges to study these preferences in a large scale. In this paper, we aim to infer social media users' political views when only network information is available. In particular, given personal preferences about some of the social media users, how can we infer the preferences of unobserved individuals in the same network? There are many existing solutions that address the problem of classification with networked data problem. However, networks in social media normally involve millions and even hundreds of millions of nodes, which make the scalability an important problem in inferring personal preferences in social media. To address the scalability issue, we use social influence theory to construct new features based on a combination of local and global structures of the network. Then we use these features to train classifiers and predict users' preferences. Due to the size of real-world social networks, using the entire network information is inefficient and not practical in many cases. By extracting local social dimensions, we present an efficient and scalable solution. Further, by capturing the network's global pattern, the proposed solution, balances the performance requirement between accuracy and efficiency.},

abstract = {Social networks are a popular medium for building and maintaining a professional network. Many studies exist on general communication and connection practices within these networks. However, studies on expertise search suggest the existence of subgroups centered around a particular profession. In this paper, we analyze commonalities and differences between these groups, based on a set of 94,155 public user profiles. The results confirm that such subgroups can be recognized. Further, the average number of connections differs between groups, as a result of differences in intention for using social media. Similarly, within the groups, specific topics and resources are discussed and shared, and there are interesting differences in the tone and wording the group members use. These insights are relevant for interpreting results from social media analyses and can be used for identifying group-specific resources and communication practices that new members may want to know about.},

abstract = {Online socio-technical systems can be studied as proxy of the real world to investigate human behavior and social interactions at scale. Here we focus on Instagram, a media-sharing online platform whose popularity has been rising up to gathering hundred millions users. Instagram exhibits a mixture of features including social structure, social tagging and media sharing. The network of social interactions among users models various dynamics including follower/followee relations and users' communication by means of posts/comments. Users can upload and tag media such as photos and pictures, and they can "like" and comment each piece of information on the platform. In this work we investigate three major aspects on our Instagram dataset: (i) the structural characteristics of its network of heterogeneous interactions, to unveil the emergence of self organization and topically-induced community structure; (ii) the dynamics of content production and consumption, to understand how global trends and popular users emerge; (iii) the behavior of users labeling media with tags, to determine how they devote their attention and to explore the variety of their topical interests.Our analysis provides clues to understand human behavior dynamics on socio-technical systems, specifically users and content popularity, the mechanisms of users' interactions in online environments and how collective trends emerge from individuals' topical interests.},

abstract = {Focused crawling is the process of exploring a graph iteratively, focusing on parts of the graph relevant to a given topic. It occurs in many situations such as a company collecting data on competition, a journalist surfing the Web to investigate a political scandal, or an archivist recording the activity of influential Twitter users during a presidential election. In all these applications, users explore a graph (e.g., the Web or a social network), nodes are discovered one by one, the total number of exploration steps is constrained, some nodes are more valuable than others, and the objective is to maximize the total value of the crawled subgraph. In this article, we introduce scalable, generic, and adaptive systems for focused crawling. Our first effort is to define an abstraction of focused crawling applicable to a large domain of real-world scenarios. We then propose a generic algorithm, which allows us to identify and optimize the relevant subsystems. We prove the intractability of finding an optimal exploration, even when all the information is available.Taking this intractability into account, we investigate how the crawler can be steered in several experimental graphs. We show the good performance of a greedy strategy and the importance of being able to run at each step a new estimation of the crawling frontier. We then discuss this estimation through heuristics, self-trained regression, and multi-armed bandits. Finally, we investigate their scalability and efficiency in different real-world scenarios and by comparing with state-of-the-art systems.},

abstract = {This work addresses the problem of detecting topic-based influencers in social media. For that end, we devise a novel behavioral model of authors and readers, where authors try to influence readers by generating ``emph{attractive}" content, which is both emph{relevant} and emph{unique}, and readers can become authors themselves by further citing or referencing content made by other authors. The model is realized by means of a content-based citation graph, where nodes represent authors with their generated content and edges represent reader-to-author citations. To find the top influencers for a given topic, we first profile the content of authors (nodes) and citations (edges) and derive topic-based similarity scores to the topic, which further model the unique and relevant topic interests of users. We then present three different extensions of the Topic-Sensitive PageRank algorithm that exploit the similarity scores to find topic-based influencers. We evaluate our solution on a large real-world dataset that was gathered from Twitter by measuring information diffusion in social networks. We show that, overall, our methods outperform several state-of-the-art methods. This work further serves as an evidence that the topic uniqueness aspect in user interests within social media should be considered for the influencers detection task; this is in comparison to previous works that have solely focused on detecting topic-based influencers using the combination of link structure and topic-relevance.},

As a basis taxonomy, we use the 23 main categories of Wikipedia Category Graph, which has been assembled over the years by the wisdom of the crowds. Following a proof of concept of our approach, we analyze differences in topic coverage and topic impact. The results show many differences between Web services like Twitter, Flickr and Delicious, which reflect users' behavior and the usage of each system. The paper concludes with a user study that demonstrates the benefits of fingerprints over traditional textual methods for recommendations of heterogeneous resources.},

abstract = {This paper discusses Cross-Site Personalization (CSP) an approach to provide personalized assistance for the user in addressing information needs that span independently hosted websites. This is done by seamlessly personalizing the support offered to each individual user, as they browse across multiple websites, by modeling the user's interactions and then augmenting information access points, such as links, on each independent website. Cross-Site Personalization is realized as a third-party API offering Personalisation As a Service to ensure cross-site and cross-device usage. The personalized augmentations are provided through module extensions for the Web-based Content Management Systems (WCMS) Drupal. The approach is non-intrusive and does not limit or alter the user's information access paradigm. This is done by visually augmenting the existing hyperlinks on webpages. The design of the API ensures user's privacy by not disclosing personal browsing information to the websites. Rather, this approach recommends how each website may adapt their information and navigation structures to meet user's information needs. Finally, the approach ensures user control and scrutiny. The user can enable/disable CSP at any time and view any information collected. The evaluation of the approach was conducted with a real-world use case. This paper introduces the architecture, a prototype implementation and encouraging evaluation results.},

abstract = {The success of a society is often judged by its ability to support the most vulnerable. Supporting the most vulnerable individuals is extremely challenging from an information needs perspective, since it requires data from numerous domains and systems, including Social Care, Healthcare, Public Safety and Juridical systems. Information sharing on this scale gives rise to scientific and technical challenges with regard to data representation, access, integration and retrieval granularity. This is a practice-oriented paper presenting a Linked Data-based approach that is uniquely positioned to access and surface information across domains and data sources using a combination of vulnerability indexes and contextual exploration. We apply this approach on a set of enterprise systems from IBM to develop an information sharing architecture and prototype for Care Coordination with a focus on Social Care and Healthcare. We report on expert feedback and user studies that indicate that our approach indeed reduces the time required to gain some business insight while maintaining the flexibility of a Linked Data-based integration approach.},

Over the last years, research has extensively investigated this group of users while another group of Wikipedia users, the readers, their preferences and their behavior have not been much studied.

We carried out a study on two datasets covering a 13-months period to obtain insights on users preferences and reading behavior in Wikipedia. We show that the most read articles do not necessarily correspond to those frequently edited, suggesting some degree of non-alignment between user reading preferences and author editing preferences. We also identified that popular and often edited articles are read according to four main patterns, and that how an article is read may change over time. We illustrate how this information can provide valuable insights to Wikipedia's editor community.},

abstract = {User attribute extraction on social media has gain considerable attention, while existing methods are mostly supervised which suffer great difficulty in insufficient gold standard data. In this paper, we validate a strong hypothesis based on homophily and adapt it to ensure the certainty of user attribute we extracted via weakly supervised propagation. Homophily, the theory which states that people who are similar tend to become friends, has been well studied in the setting of online social networks. When we focus on age attribute, based on this theory, online friends tend to have similar age. In this work, we take a step further and study the hypothesis that the age gap between online friends become even smaller in a larger friendship clique. We empirically validate our hypothesis using two real social network data sets. We further design a propagation-based algorithm to predict online users' age, leveraging the clique-based hypothesis. We find that our algorithm can outperform several baselines. We believe that this method could work as a way to enrich sparse data and the hypothesis we validated would shed light on exploring the proximity of other user attributes such as education as well.},

abstract = {The "filter bubble" is a term which refers to people getting encapsulated in streams of data such as news or social network updates that are personalized to their interests. While people need protection from information overload and maybe prefer to see content they feel familiar or agree with, there is the danger that important issues that should be of concern for everyone will get filtered away and people will lack exposure to different views, living in "echo-chambers", blissfully unaware of the reality. We have proposed a design of an interactive visualization, which provides the user of a social networking site with awareness of the personalization mechanism (the semantics and the source of the content that is filtered away), and with means to control the filtering mechanism. The visualization has been implemented in a peer-to-peer social network, called MADMICA, and we present here the results of a large scale lab study with 163 crowd-sourced participants. The results demonstrate that the visualization leads to increased users' awareness of the filter bubble, understandability of the filtering mechanism and to a feeling of control over their data stream.},

The goal of this work is to automatically suggest routes that are not only short but also emotionally pleasant. To quantify the extent to which urban locations are pleasant, we use data from a crowd-sourcing platform that shows two street scenes in London (out of hundreds), and a user votes on which one looks more beautiful, quiet, and happy. We consider votes from more than 3.3K individuals and translate them into quantitative measures of location perceptions. We arrange those locations into a graph upon which we learn pleasant routes. Based on a quantitative validation, we find that, compared to the shortest routes, the recommended ones add just a few extra walking minutes and are indeed perceived to be more beautiful, quiet, and happy. To test the generality of our approach, we consider Flickr metadata of more than 3.7M pictures in London and 1.3M in Boston, compute proxies for the crowdsourced beauty dimension (the one for which we have collected the most votes), and evaluate those proxies with 30 participants in London and 54 in Boston. These participants have not only rated our recommendations but have also carefully motivated their choices, providing insights for future work.},

One of such critical demands relies on comparing the Chinese and the rest of the world (e.g., Americans), where communities' ideological and cultural backgrounds can be significantly different. While traditional studies aim to learn the similarities and differences between these communities via high-cost user studies, in this paper we propose a much more efficient method to compare different communities by utilizing social media. Specifically, Weibo and Twitter, the two largest microblogging systems, are employed to represent the target communities, i.e. China and the Western world (mainly United States), respectively. Meanwhile, through the analysis of the Wikipedia page-click log, we identify a set of categorical `hot events' for one month in 2012 and search those hot events in Weibo and Twitter corpora along with timestamps via information retrieval methods. We further quantitatively and qualitatively compare users' responses to those events in Twitter and Weibo in terms of three aspects: popularity, temporal dynamic, and information diffusion. The comparative results show that although the popularity ranking of those events are very similar, the patterns of temporal dynamics and information diffusion can be quite different.},

We focus on a set of visual-content features and on tags. We identify the smallest set of features, that by themselves or combined together with others, can perform well in properly predicting the degree of sensitivity of users' images. We consider both the case of binary privacy settings (i.e. public, private), as well as the case of more complex privacy options, characterized by multiple sharing options.

abstract = {Trust plays an important role in helping online users collect reliable information, and has attracted increasing attention in recent years. We learn from social sciences that, as the conceptual counterpart of trust, distrust could be as important as trust. However, little work exists in studying distrust in social media. What is the relationship between trust and distrust? Can we directly apply methodologies from social sciences to study distrust in social media? In this paper, we design two computational tasks by leveraging data mining and machine learning techniques to enable the computational understanding of distrust with social media data. The first task is to predict distrust from only trust, and the second task is to predict trust with distrust. We conduct experiments in real-world social media data. The empirical results of the first task provide concrete evidence to answer the question, "is distrust the negation of trust?" while the results of the second task help us figure out how valuable the use of distrust in trust prediction.},

abstract = {When we encounter an interesting entity (e.g., a person's name or a geographic location) while reading text, we typically search and retrieve relevant information about it. Entity linking (EL) is the task of linking entities in a text to the corresponding entries in a knowledge base, such as Wikipedia. Recently, EL has received considerable attention. EL can be used to enhance a user's text reading experience by streamlining the process of retrieving information on entities. Several EL methods have been proposed, though they tend to extract all of the entities in a document including unnecessary ones for users. Excessive linking of entities can be distracting and degrade the user experience. In this paper, we propose a new method for evaluating the helpfulness of linking entities to users. We address this task using supervised machine-learning with a broad set of features. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods by approximately 5.7%-12% F1. In addition, we propose an application, Linkify, which enables developers to integrate EL easily into their web sites.},

abstract = {Collaborative Question Answering (cQA) platforms are a very popular repository of crowd-generated knowledge. By formulating questions, users express needs that other members of the cQA community try to collaboratively satisfy. Poorly formulated questions are less likely to receive useful responses, thus hindering the overall knowledge generation process. Users are often asked to reformulate their needs, adding specific details, providing examples, or simply clarifying the context of their requests. Formulating a good question is a task that might require several interactions between the asker and other community members, thus delaying the actual answering and, possibly, decreasing the interest of the community in the issue. This paper contributes new insights to the study of cQA platforms by investigating the editing behaviour of users. We identify a number of editing actions, and provide a two-step approach for the automatic suggestion of the most likely editing actions to be performed for a newly created question. We evaluated our approach in the context of the Stack Overflow cQA , demonstrating how, for given types of editing actions, it is possible to provide accurate reformulation suggestions.},

To our knowledge, this is one of the first studies to comprehensively examine brands by incorporating user-generated social content and information about user interactions. This paper makes several important contributions. We build and normalize a weighted, undirected network representing interactions among users and brands. We then explore the structure of this network using modified network measures to understand its characteristics and implications. As a part of this exploration, we address three important research questions: (1) What is the structure of a brand-brand network? (2) Does an influential brand have a large number of fans? (3) Does an influential brand receive more positive or more negative comments from social users? Experiments conducted with Facebook data show that the influence of a brand has (a) high positive correlation with the size of a brand, meaning that an influential brand can attract more fans, and, (b) low negative correlation with the sentiment of comments made by users on that brand, which means that negative comments have a more powerful ability to generate awareness of a brand than positive comments. To process the large-scale datasets and networks, we implement MapReduce-based algorithms.},

Based on homophily, in a social network it is expected to observe a higher degree of homogeneity among connected than disconnected people. Many researchers use this simple yet effective principal to infer users' missing information and interests based on the information provided by their neighbors. In a directed social network, the neighbors can be further divided into followers and followees. In this work, we investigate the homophily effect in a directed network. To explore the homophily effect in a directed network, we study if a user's personal preferences can be inferred from those of users connected to her (followers or followees). We investigate which of followers or followees are more effective in helping to infer users' personal preferences. Our findings can help to raise the awareness of users over their privacy and can help them better manage their privacy.},

This type of cooperation is ubiquitous nowadays, not only in Online Social Networks, but also in many other situations, such as scientific research on a worldwide scale. Mass cooperation is also at the source of most complex systems. One problem to which researchers are confronted to when they study such cooperation is to build an intuitive representation of what is happening. Many tools and metrics exist to study the results of the cooperation, but sometimes, these metrics can be misleading if one doesn't really observe what the cooperation process really looks like. The main proposition of this paper is a visualization of the cooperation flow. The novelty of our approach is to represent the internal structure of the cooperation in a longitudinal perspective. Through examples, we present how one can form a rich understanding of what form the cooperation takes in a given context, and how this understanding can help to formulate hypothesis which can consequently be studied with appropriate tools such as statistical analysis.},

To illustrate a possible application of our outcomes, we present a classification experiment aiming to infer users' social information through the analysis of their posts, with satisfactory preliminary results. Our findings help to understand not only collective peculiarities of online social media users, but also important characteristics of the textual genre 'post', being one of the first and most comprehensive studies on this topic.},

Knowing identity attributes such as gender, age, and/or nationality are a first step in many studies which seek to describe various phenomena related to computational social science. Often, it is through such attributes that studies of social media that focus on, for example, the isolation of foreigners, become possible. However, such characteristics are not often clearly stated by Twitter users, so researchers must turn to other means to ascertain various categories of identity. In this paper, we discuss the challenge of detecting the nationality of Twitter users using rich features from their profiles. In addition, we look at the effectiveness of different features as we go about this task. For the case of a highly diverse country---Qatar---we provide a detailed network analysis with insights into user behaviors and linking preference (or the lack thereof) to other nationalities.},

Different languages can be a barrier between monolingual communities, and the dynamics of language choice could explain the prosperity or demise of local languages in an international setting. We study this interplay of language and network structure in diverse, multi-lingual societies, using Twitter. In our analysis, we are particularly interested in the role of bilinguals. Concretely, we attempt to quantify the degree to which users are the "bridge-builders" between monolingual language groups, while monolingual users cluster together. Also, with the revalidation of English as a lingua franca on Twitter, we reveal users of the native non-English language have higher influence than English users, and the language convergence pattern is consistent across the regions. Furthermore, we explore for which topics these users prefer their native language rather than English. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest sociolinguistic study in a network setting.},

We start with a machine learning problem of predicting a user's preference among two alternative choices of Twitter friends. We show that co-following information provides strong signals for diverse classification tasks and that these signals persist even when the most discriminative features are removed. Going beyond mere classification performance optimization, we present applications of our methodology to Computational Social Science. Here we confirm stereotypes such as that the country singer Kenny Chesney (@kennychesney) is more popular among @GOP followers, whereas Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) enjoys more support from @TheDemocrats followers.In the domain of marketing we give evidence that celebrity endorsement is reflected in co-following and we demonstrate how our methodology can be used to reveal the audience similarities between not so obvious entites such as Apple and Puma.},

Due to the sheer volume of information generated during a disaster, a key challenge is to filter tweets from the crisis region so their analysis can be prioritized. In this paper, we introduce the task of identifying whether a tweet is generated from crisis regions and formulate it as a decision problem. This problem is challenging due to the fact that only ~1% of all tweets have location information. Existing approaches tackle this problem by predicting the location of the user using historical tweets from users or their social network. As collecting historical information is not practical during emergency situations, we investigate whether it is possible to determine that a tweet originates from the crisis region through the information in the tweet and the publishing user's profile.},

For example, a variation in the delivered Quality of Services (QoS) can frustrate buyers and they leave the e-marketplace, causing revenue loss. The inherent uncertainties of open marketplaces motivate the design of reputation systems to facilitate buyers in finding honest feedback from other buyers (advisers). Defining the threshold for acceptable level of honesty of advisers is very important, since inappropriately set thresholds would filter away possibly good advice, or the opposite - allow malicious buyers to badmouth good services. However, currently, there is no systematic approach for setting the honesty threshold. We propose a self-adaptive honesty threshold management mechanism based on PID feedback controller. Experimental results show that adaptively tuning the honesty threshold to the market performance enables honest buyers to obtain higher quality of services in comparison with static threshold values defined by intuition and used in previous work.},

Thus, the textual features of this content (e.g., the title, description, and tags) can directly impact the view count of a particular content item, and ultimately the advertisement generated revenue. More importantly, the textual features can generally be optimized to attract more search traffic. This study makes progress on the problem of automating tag selection for online video content with the goal of increasing viewership. It brings two key insights: first, based on evidence that existing tags for YouTube videos can be improved by an automated tag recommender, even for a sample of well curated movies, it explores the impact of using information mined from repositories created by different production modes (e.g., peer- and expert-produced); second, this study performs a preliminary characterization of the factors that impact the quality of the tag recommendation pipeline for different input data sources.},

We study and discuss the predictability of talk attendances using real-world face-to-face contact data and user interests extracted from the users' previous publications. For our experiments, we apply RFID-tracked talk attendance information captured at the ACM Conference on Hypertext and Hypermedia 2011. We find that contact and similarity networks achieve comparable results, and that combining these networks helps to a limited extent to improve the prediction quality.},

abstract = {Twitter is often referred to as a backchannel for conferences. While the main conference takes place in a physical setting, attendees and virtual attendees socialize, introduce new ideas or broadcast information by microblogging on Twitter. In this paper we analyze the scholars' Twitter use in 16 Computer Science conferences over a timespan of five years. Our primary finding is that over the years there are increasing differences with respect to conversation use and information use in Twitter. We studied the interaction network between users to understand whether assumptions about the structure of the conversations hold over time and between different types of interactions, such as retweets, replies, and mentions. While `people come and people go,' we want to understand what keeps people staying engaged with the conference on Twitter. By casting the problem as a classification task, we find different factors that contribute to the continuing participation of users to the online Twitter conference activity. These results have implications for research communities to implement strategies for continuous and active participation among members.},

The aggregated value of the ratings per item represents the reputation of this item. The accuracy of the reputation scores is important as it is used to rank items.Most of the aggregation methods didn't consider the frequency of distinct ratings and they didn't test how accurate their reputation scores over different datasets with different sparsity. In this work we propose a new aggregation method which can be described as a weighted average, where weights are generated using the normal distribution. The evaluation result shows that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods over different sparsity datasets.},

Local search returns located results, e.g., extracted entities located in a certain spot or area, but their quality can be difficult to judge.Compared to normal Web search, local Web search has additional inherent issues due to factors such as insufficient semantics, ambiguity of references, imprecise mapping, or unknown status of the real-world entities described in documents. We present selected issues and features of geospatial quality and credibility based on spatial, temporal, and topical indicators as an additional measurement of spatial relevance.},

Experimental results on a commodity cluster show that we can load large RDF data very quickly in memory while remaining within an interactive range for query processing with the secondary index.},

In this work, we analyze the list of celebrities that a set of Twitter users are following in December 2013 to infer the social ties that existed between these users till July 2009. We use two probabilistic models given by Kossinets et al. [Science, 2006] and Crandall et al. [PNAS, 2010] for this purpose. The model of Kossinets et al. is meant to give an upper bound for the probability of friendship between a pair of users, whereas the model by Crandall et al. is supposed to give an almost accurate estimate of the same. We observe that the model of Kossinets et al. is able to give an upper bound whereas the model given by Crandall et al. is unable to give an almost accurate estimate for our dataset. However, the model by Crandall et al. is observed to provide a correct estimate of the probability of friendship between the users when we consider following a particular type of celebrity profile, e.g. CEO, Author etc., as the activity of a user.},

The combination of these three axes can classify most major types of follow links.
