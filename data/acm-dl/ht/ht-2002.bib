We will look at why horizontal links disappear, how to support horizontal navigation in modern hyper-courseware, and our earlier attempts to provide horizontal navigation in Web-based electronic textbooks. Here, we present map-based navigation - a new approach to support horizontal navigation in open corpus educational courseware that we are currently investigating. We will describe the mechanism behind this approach, present a system KnowledgeSea that implements this approach, and provide some results of a classroom study of this system.},

abstract = {We present HyperContext, a framework for adaptive and adaptable hypertext. Our fundamental premise is that when people encounter the same document, each may interpret the information it contains differently. Usually, the interpretations are not available to future users of the same information. HyperContext permits users to make these interpretations explicit, and provides support to structure hyperspace around interpretations of documents, rather than around the documents themselves. When a user browses through hyperspace, a document's context is used to determine which interpretation to present to the user. We also derive a user model of the user's short-term interests, by first representing the user's interest in the current document as a salient interpretation before combining it with the salient interpretations of other documents accessed by the user on the same path of traversal. This paper describes the adaptive features of the HyperContext framework, and presents the results of an initial evaluation of one of the features.},

abstract = {Hypertext represents ideas through chunks of text or other media interconnected by relations, typically navigational links. The similarity to knowledge representations such as frames and semantic nets has led to much effort in using hypertext systems for knowledge representation and extending hypertext systems to make them able to express more. This work has met with limited success due to difficulties including the tacit and situated nature of much knowledge. Instead of viewing knowledge expression as an all at once event, we view it as a constructive process, i.e. knowledge building. The Visual Knowledge Builder (VKB) lets users express content via visual or textual means and later formalize that content in the form of attributes, values, types, and relations. VKB proactively supports this process through a set of suggestion agents whose interaction with the user is mediated by the suggestion manager. Preliminary evaluation of the suggestion manager and suggestion agents yields positive results but further confirms that there is no "silver bullet" for knowledge engineering -- semantic expression is most likely to happen during, and is driven by, task performance.},

They are designed based on the ART (Amplifying Representational Talkback) principle, which emphasizes the importance of visual interaction and the power of external representations. The systems use spatial hypertext not as a medium for representing final artifacts but as a means of interacting with linear information during an authoring process. This paper first describes the role and the effect of the spatial hypertext representation plays in support of early stages of authoring linear information, and explains the ART interaction model for the approach. The ART#001 system, which supports early stages of writing, is described in detail and the other three ART systems are used to illustrate the essential aspects of our approach. The paper concludes with a discussion on the semiotic interpretation of spatial hypertext as a representation, and on the innovative use of spatial hypertext as an instrument to compose information, rather than as an information medium.},

Its success has prompted further interest and development in Fluid hypertexts. We have designed and implemented an authoring tool called the Fluid Writer that uses a new treetable visualization to help authors construct and manage alternative paths in a Fluid hypertext. Finally, an exploration of the narrative implications of Fluid hypertext suggests that it may be more suitable than conventional hypertext for formulaic fictions such as mystery stories.},

In this paper we document the motivation for developing the tool and describe its operation and novel features. Since usability and technology adoption issues are critical for software and hypertext tool uptake, our approach has been to develop a system that is highly usable and sufficiently "pliant" to support and integrate with a wide range of working practices and styles. We discuss some industrial application experience to date, which has informed the design and is informing future requirements.

To find out that two or more documents are in fact related, users have to navigate by the documents in carry out an analysis about their content. This paper presents an infrastructure allowing the use of latent semantic analysis and open hypermedia concepts in the automatic identification of relationships among web pages. Latent Semantic Analysis has been proposed by the information retrieval community as an attempt to organize automatically text objects into a semantic structure appropriate for matching. In open hypermedia systems, links are managed and stored in a special database, a linkbase, which allows the addition of hypermedia functionality to a document without changing the original structure and format of the document. We first present two complementary link-related efforts: an extensible latent semantic indexing service and an open linkbase service. Leveraging off those efforts, we present an infrastructure that identifying latent semantic links within web repositories and makes them available in an open linkbase. To demonstrate by example the utility of our open infrastructure, we built an application presenting a directory of semantic links extracted from web sites.},

We describe the Topos 3D Spatial Hypermedia system and how it has been developed to support geo-spatial hypermedia coupling hypermedia information to model representations of real world buildings and landscapes. The prototype experiments are primarily aimed at supporting architects and landscape architects in their work on site. Here it is useful to be able to superimpose and add different layers of information to, e.g. a landscape depending on the task being worked on. We introduce a number of central concepts to understand the relation between hypermedia and spatial information management. The distinction between metaphorical (and abstract) versus literal (and concrete) spaces is introduced together with a workspace composition semantics and a distinction between direct and indirect navigation. Finally, we conclude with a number of research issues which are central to the future development of geo-spatial hypermedia, including design issues in combining metaphorical and literal hypermedia space, as well as a discussion of the role of spatial parsing in a geo-spatial context.},

abstract = {Contextualised Open Hypermedia can be used to provide added value to document collections or artefacts. However, transferring the underlying hyper structures into a users conceptual model is often a problem. Augmented reality provides a mechanism for presenting these structures in a visual and tangible manner, translating the abstract action of combining contextual linkbases into physical gestures of real familiarity to users of the system. This paper examines the use of augmented reality in hypermedia and explores some possible modes of interaction that embody the functionality of open hypermedia and contextual linking using commonplace and easily understandable real world metaphors.},

The system described in this paper has been used in three use cases and initial feedback indicates that it has successfully addressed several such practical challenges.},

abstract = {Previewing links in hypertext navigation helps reduce the cognitive overhead associated with deciding whether or not to follow a link. In this paper we introduce a new concept called Dual-Use of Image Space (DUIS) and we show how it is used provide preview information of image map links. In DUIS the pixels in the image space are used both as shading information as well as characters which can be read. This concept provides a mechanism for placing the text information related to images in context, that is, the text is placed within the corresponding objects. Prior to DUIS contextualized preview of links was only possible with text links. The following are the advantages of contextualized preview image map links: (1) Readers can benefit from both the text and the image without making visual saccades between the two. (2) The text does not obstruct the image as is the case in the existing techniques. (3) It is easy for the readers to associate the image and its corresponding image since the two are presented close to each other. The text in the image space may also contain links, and for this reason, it is possible to introduce multiple links for image maps.},

In contrast, this paper examines the accuracy of predicting a user's next action based on analysis of the content of the pages requested recently by the user. Predictions are made using the similarity of a model of the user's interest to the text in and around the hypertext anchors of recently requested Web pages. This approa22ch can make predictions of actions that have never been taken by the user and potentially make predictions that reflect current user interests. We evaluate this technique using data from a full-content log of Web activity and find that textual similarity-based predictions outperform simpler approaches.},
