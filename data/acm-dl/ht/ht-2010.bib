abstract = {Missing web pages, URIs that return the 404 "Page Not Found" error or the HTTP response code 200 but dereference unexpected content, are ubiquitous in today's browsing experience. We use Internet search engines to relocate such missing pages and provide means that help automate the rediscovery process. We propose querying web pages' titles against search engines. We investigate the retrieval performance of titles and compare them to lexical signatures which are derived from the pages' content. Since titles naturally represent the content of a document they intuitively change over time. We measure the edit distance between current titles and titles of copies of the same pages obtained from the Internet Archive and display their evolution. We further investigate the correlation between title changes and content modifications of a web page over time. Lastly we provide a predictive model for the quality of any given web page title in terms of its discovery performance. Our results show that titles return more than 60% URIs top ranked and further relevant content returned in the top 10 results. We show that titles decay slowly but are far more stable than the pages' content. We further distill stop titles than can help identify insufficiently performing search engine queries.},

abstract = {Parallel browsing describes a behavior where users visit Web pages in multiple concurrent threads. Web browsers explicitly support this by providing tabs. Although parallel browsing is more prevalent than linear browsing online, little is known about how users perform this activity. We study the use of parallel browsing through a log-based study of millions of Web users and present findings on their behavior. We identify a power law distribution in browser metrics comprising "outclicks" and tab switches, which signify the degree of parallel browsing. We find that users switch tabs at least 57.4% of the time, but user activity, measured in pageviews, is split among tabs rather than increasing overall activity. Finally, analysis of a subset of the logs focused on Web search shows that while the majority of users do not branch from search engine result pages, the degree of branching is higher for non-navigational queries. Our findings have design implications for Web sites and browsers, search interfaces, and log analysis.},

abstract = {A wide variety of systems could be considered 'narrative systems', either directly working towards generating rich narratives or, more frequently, because they present or handle information in a narrative context. These narratives, generated or otherwise handled, may contain themes; an essential part of the subtext of narrative communicating important concepts outside the capabilities of the literal meaning of the content and forming the thematic cohesion that aids the flow of the presented narrative. However despite this very little work has been undertaken to understand of take advantage of these themes, particularly in narrative generation where the presence of well defined themes may improve the richness of those generated narratives. In this paper we evaluate the performance of a system utilising a thematic model in order to generate simple narratives in the form of photo montages compared to a keyword based system that does not. The experiment demonstrates that the system utilising the thematic model is capable of successfully connoting themes within these narratives. It also shows that the relevance of the resulting narratives to the titles used to generate them is higher in the thematic system than those generated by the other system.},

abstract = {Refinding information has been interwoven with web activity since its early beginning. Even though all common web browsers were equipped with a history list and bookmarks early enough to facilitate this need, most users typically use search engines to refind information. However, both bookmarks and search based tools have significant limitations that impact their usability: the former are known to be hard to manage over the course of time, whereas the latter require the user to recall a specific combination of keywords or context. Most importantly, though, both are particularly inappropriate in cases where a piece of information is contained within an unstructured web page. In this paper, we present in-context annotation as a more efficient alternative to these methodologies. To verify this claim, we conducted a study in which we compare the performance of experienced users in all three approaches while revisiting specific pieces of information in the web after a long period of time. The outcomes suggest that in-context annotation clearly outperforms both traditional strategies.},

abstract = {Vacation planning is one of the frequent---but nonetheless laborious---tasks that people engage themselves with online; requiring skilled interaction with a multitude of resources. This paper constructs intra-city travel itineraries automatically by tapping a latent source reflecting geo-temporal breadcrumbs left by millions of tourists. For example, the popular rich media sharing site, Flickr, allows photos to be stamped by the time of when they were taken and be mapped to Points Of Interests (POIs) by geographical (i.e. latitude-longitude) and semantic (e.g., tags) metadata.Leveraging this information, we construct itineraries following a two-step approach. Given a city, we first extract photo streams of individual users. Each photo stream provides estimates on where the user was, how long he stayed at each place, and what was the transit time between places. In the second step, we aggregate all user photo streams into a POI graph. Itineraries are then automatically constructed from the graph based on the popularity of the POIs and subject to the user's time and destination constraints.We evaluate our approach by constructing itineraries for several major cities and comparing them, through a "crowd-sourcing" marketplace (Amazon Mechanical Turk), against itineraries constructed from popular bus tours that are professionally generated. Our extensive survey-based user studies over about 450 workers on AMT indicate that high quality itineraries can be automatically constructed from Flickr data.},

To fully explore the structure of this graph, we exploit the methodology of random-walk computation of similarities between all the objects. We develop a personalized collaborative filtering algorithm that combines both the collaborative information and the personalized tag preferences.

abstract = {Tags are an important information source in Web 2.0. They can be used to describe users' topic preferences as well as the content of items to make personalized recommendations. However, since tags are arbitrary words given by users, they contain a lot of noise such as tag synonyms, semantic ambiguities and personal tags. Such noise brings difficulties to improve the accuracy of item recommendations. To eliminate the noise of tags, in this paper we propose to use the multiple relationships among users, items and tags to find the semantic meaning of each tag for each user individually. With the proposed approach, the relevant tags of each item and the tag preferences of each user are determined. In addition, the user and item-based collaborative filtering combined with the content filtering approach are explored. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated in the experiments conducted on real world datasets collected from Amazon.com and citeULike website.},

abstract = {Collaborative tagging has become a very popular way to share, annotate, and discover online resources in Web 2.0. Yet as the number of resources in Collaborative tagging system grows over time, sifting through the large amounts of resources and finding the right resources to recommend to the right user is becoming a challenging problem. In this paper, we investigate a probabilistic generative model for collaborative tagging, explore the implicit semantic connections in the sparse and noisy information space of heterogeneous users and unsupervised tagging. First, a modified Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to cluster the tags and users simultaneously. The generalization of resource description and user could alleviate the tag noise and data sparseness of recommendation effectively. And then, considering that topic-based recommendation only takes the users' global interest into consideration without the capability of distinguishing users' interest in detail, we combine the global interests with the individual interest and community interest. Experimental results demonstrate the topic-based personalized recommendation method, which integrate both the commonality factor among users and the specialties of individuals, could alleviate data sparsity and provide a more flexible and effective recommendation than previous methods.},

abstract = {Approaches to Web application adaptation can be classified based on whether the application is aware of the adaptation or not. In the latter case, adaptation is referred to as external. External adaptation requires the use of addressing patterns that locate the target portion/data on the application pages to be adapted. Unfortunately, changes on the application normally also require updates to the addressing patterns. This raises pattern robustness as a main concern. This papers focuses on the (semi) automatic generation of change-resilience XPath patterns. Two different categories of changes are addressed, i.e. in space (e.g., different personalizations of a page) and in time (e.g., site upgrades), by exploiting two different techniques: induction and simulated annealing. These techniques permit to obtain XPath patterns "resilient-enough" to a "controlled set of page designs". SiSy, a tool that assists the user in obtaining resilient XPath expressions, was born out of this approach. The approach is tested for two websites (www.yahoo.com and www.elmundo.es), identifying 23 updates to which XPath expressions were resilient to 62% of the undertaken changes.},

Mapping Assistant has been designed to overcome the problem arising due to the difficulty of users in generating an initial two-way mapping for VITE. We have developed VITE to allow users to interact with information in a semi-formal workspace. Creating two-way mapping profiles is a vital step for projecting structured information into a spatial hypermedia system. A previous study of VITE indicated that users spent much of their time developing an initial mapping before working on the information task. We designed the Mapping Assistant to assist users by generating a quick initial mapping from the data entered by the user and reduce the cognitive and mental load on the user. This research studies users' impression of the Mapping Assistant. The results indicate that the users liked the Mapping Assistant and found it useful, but comments from users also reveal possible directions for further improvement of the tool and its design.},

We attack the classic Erdos --- Renyi random, Barab\'{a}si and Albert power law, Watts --- Strogatz small world and our Unsupervise. Small World (USW) graphs using different attacker strategies and report their respective robustness. Using different attacker profiles, we construct a game where the attacker is allowed to use a strategy of his choice to remove a percentage of each graph's elements. The graph is then allowed to repair some portion of its self. We report on the number of alternating attack and repair turns until either the graph is disconnected, or the game exceeds the number of permitted turns. Based on our analysis, an attack strategy that focuses on removing the vertices with the highest betweenness value is most advantageous to the attacker. Power law graphs can become disconnected with the removal of a single edge; random graphs with the removal of as few as 1% of their vertices, small-world graphs with the removal of 14% vertices, and USW with the removal of 17% vertices. Watts --- Strogatz small-world graphs are more robust and resilient than random or power law graphs. USW graphs are more robust and resilient than small world graphs. A graph of USW connected WOs filled with date could outlive the individuals and institutions that created the data in an environment where WOs are lost due to random failures or directed attacks.},

abstract = {We present iMapping, a zooming based approach for visually organizing information objects. It was developed on top of semantic desktop technologies and especially targets the support of personal knowledge management. iMapping has been designed to combine the advantages of spatial hypertext and other proven visual mapping approaches like mind-mapping and concept mapping, which are incompatible in their original form. We describe the design and prototypical implementation of iMapping -- which is fundamentally based on deep zooming and nesting. iMapping bridges the gap between unstructured content like informal text notes and semantic models by allowing annotations with the whole range from vague associations to formal relations. First experimental evaluation of the iMapping user-interface approach indicates favorable user experience and functionality, compared with state-of-the-art Mind-Mapping software.},

abstract = {Online social media such as delicious and digg are represented as tripartite networks whose vertices are users, tags, and resources. Detecting communities from such tripartite networks is practically important. Modularity is often used as the criteria for evaluating the goodness of network divisions into communities. Although Newman-Girvan modularity is popular for unipartite networks, it is not suitable for n-partite networks. For bipartite networks, Barber, Guimera, Murata and Suzuki define bipartite modularities. For tripartite networks, Neubauer defines tripartite modularity which extends Murata's bipartite modularity. However, Neubauer's tripartite modularity still uses projections and it will lose information that original tripartite networks have. This paper proposes new tripartite modularity for tripartite networks that do not use projections. Experimental results show that better community structures can be detected by optimizing our tripartite modularity.},

We rely on metrics that are strictly topological, making use of one previously identified metric and one of our own. We directly address the open nature of the network through a study of the linking dynamics over time between users and the effect the openness of the network (i.e. users entering/leaving the network) has on our ability to predict new friendship links. We follow users from the time they enter the network to 10 months after joining and examine the effect of applying link prediction at different points. Analysis shows that prediction results are best shortly after users have entered the network and that the precision and recall of link prediction results diminish the longer users have been members of the network. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis is the most comprehensive in terms of analyzing link prediction in an open large-scale online social network.},

To that end, we propose a generative community-based probabilistic tagging model that can automatically uncover communities of users and their associated tags. We experimentally validate the quality of the discovered communities over the social bookmarking system Delicious. In comparison to an alternative generative model (Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we find that the proposed community-based model improves the empirical likelihood of held-out test data and discovers more coherent interest-based communities. Based on the community-based probabilistic tagging model, we develop a novel community-based ranking model for effective community-based exploration of socially-tagged Web resources. We compare community-based ranking to three state-of-the-art retrieval models: (i) BM25; (ii) Cluster-based retrieval using K-means clustering; and (iii) LDA-based retrieval. We find that the proposed ranking model results in a significant improvement over these alternatives (from 7% to 22%) in the quality of retrieved pages.},

abstract = {In collaborative filtering recommender systems, there is little room for users to get involved in the choice of their peer group. It leaves users defenseless against various spamming or ''shilling'' attacks. Other social Web-based systems, however, allow users to self-select peers and build a social network. We argue that users' self-defined social networks could be valuable to increase the quality of recommendation in CF systems. To prove the feasibility of this idea we examined how similar are interests of users connected by self-defined relationships in a collaborative tagging systems Citeulike. Interest similarity was measured by similarity of items and meta-data they share and tags they use. Our study shows that users connected by social networks exhibit significantly higher similarity on all explored levels (items, meta-data, and tags) than non-connected users. This similarity is the highest for directly connected users and decreases with the increase of distance between users. Among other interesting properties of information sharing is the finding that between-user similarity in social connections on the level of metadata and tags is much larger than similarity on the level of items. Overall, our findings support the feasibility of social network based recommender systems and offer some good hints to the prospective authors of these systems.},

abstract = {While recent research has advanced our understanding about the structure and dynamics of social tagging systems, we know little about (i) the underlying motivations for tagging (why users tag), and (ii) how they influence the properties of resulting tags and folksonomies. In this paper, we focus on problem (i) based on a distinction between two types of user motivations that we have identified in earlier work: Categorizers vs. Describers. To that end, we systematically define and evaluate a number of measures designed to discriminate between describers, i.e. users who use tags for describing resources as opposed to categorizers, i.e. users who use tags for categorizing resources. Subsequently, we present empirical findings from qualitative and quantitative evaluations of the measures on real world tagging behavior. In addition, we conducted a recommender evaluation in which we study the effectiveness of each of the presented measures and found the measure based on the tag content to be the most accurate in predicting the user behavior closely followed by a content independent measure. The overall contribution of this paper is the presentation of empirical evidence that tagging motivation can be approximated with simple statistical measures. Our research is relevant for (a) designers of tagging systems aiming to better understand the motivations of their users and (b) researchers interested in studying the effects of users' tagging motivation on the properties of resulting tags and emergent structures in social tagging systems},

abstract = {Users on Twitter, a microblogging service, started the phenomenon of adding tags to their messages sometime around February 2008. These tags are distinct from those in other Web 2.0 systems because users are less likely to index messages for later retrieval. We compare tagging patterns in Twitter with those in Delicious to show that tagging behavior in Twitter is different because of its conversational, rather than organizational nature. We use a mixed method of statistical analysis and an interpretive approach to study the phenomenon. We find that tagging in Twitter is more about filtering and directing content so that it appears in certain streams. The most illustrative example of how tagging in Twitter differs is the phenomenon of the Twitter micro-meme: emergent topics for which a tag is created, used widely for a few days, then disappears. We describe the micro-meme phenomenon and discuss the importance of this new tagging practice for the larger real-time search context.},

abstract = {Collaborative tagging systems are popular tools for organization, sharing and retrieval of web resources. Their success is due to their freedom and simplicity of use. To post a resource, the user should only define a set of tags that would position the resource in the system's data structure -- folksonomy. This data structure can serve as a rich source of information about relations between tags and concepts they represent. To make use of information collaboratively added to folksonomies, we need to understand how users make tagging decisions. Three factors that are believed to influence user tagging decisions are: the tags used by other users, the organization of user's personal repository and the knowledge model shared between users. In our work we examine the role of another potential factor -- resource title. Despite all the advantages of tags, tagging is a tedious process. To minimize the effort, users are likely to tag with keywords that are easily available. We show that resource title, as a source of useful tags, is easy to access and comprehend. Given a choice of two tags with the same meaning, users are likely to be influenced by their presence in the title. However, a factor that seems to have stronger impact on users' tagging decisions is maintaining the consistency of the personal profile of tags. The results of our study reveal a new, less idealistic picture of collaborative tagging systems, in which the collaborative aspect seems to be less important than personal gains and convenience.},

abstract = {The enormous dissemination of multimedia information over the past few years has led to mechanisms to support its organization, cataloging and search through descriptions or keywords. A popular way of associating such descriptions to content is tagging as can be found in popular sites such as Flickr (for images) or Delicious (bookmarks). This method allows users to associate tags to media, richly describing its content and may help in its retrieval at a later time. However, the process is mostly unstructured, leading to several problems. Nothing guarantees that the tags used are the most appropriate or the same tags are used in similar situations, making retrieval difficult..Our approach relies on narrative-based interfaces which use stories as an organizing principle for tagging media. Given that humans have used stories to communicate since the dawn of time, narrative is a natural form of interaction. By inter-relating bits of information into a coherent whole, stories convey data in a rich, structured way. A study carried out with 40 users over a period of three months shows that users convey almost six times more information when using narratives to describe their media than what is typical of traditional methods. Furthermore, our pilot study saw narratives increasing tag reuse to 94%. Finally, other problems found in tagging such as synonyms and polysemy were notably absent from story-generated tags},

abstract = {ZigZag is a unique hyperstructural paradigm designed by the hypertext pioneer Ted Nelson. It has piqued a lot of interest in the hypertext community in recent years because of its aim of revolutionizing electronic access to information and knowledge bases. In ZigZag information is stored in cells that are arranged into lists organized along unlimited numbers of intersecting sets of associations called dimensions. To this infrastructure a mechanism of transclusion is added, allowing the data stored in cells to span, and hence be utilized, in different contexts. Proponents of ZigZag claim that it is a flexible and universal structure for information representation, and yet the system has not been widely adopted and has been implemented even more rarely. In this paper we address the question of whether there are intrinsic theoretical reasons as to why this is the case.While the basic features and specifications of ZigZag are well known, we delve in to the less understood area of its theoretical underpinnings to tackle this question. By modeling ZigZag within the framework of set theory we reveal a new class of hyperstructure that contains no referencable link objects whatsoever, instead grouping non-referencable binary associations into disjunct but parallel sets of common semantics (dimensions). We go on to further specialize these "dimensional models" into sets of finite partial functions, which are closed over a single domain, isolating the new class of hyperstructures we are calling hyperorders. This analysis not only sheds light on the benefits and limitations of the ZigZag hypermedia system, but also provides a framework to describe and understand a wider family of possible hyperstructure models of which it is an early example. Characteristics of Zigzag's transclusion mechanisms are also investigated, highlighting a previously unrecognized distinction, and potential irrevocable conflict, between two distinct uses of content reuse: instance and identity transclusion.},

Video can enhance the realism and authenticity of a learning environment. By adding structure and interactivity to video, hypervideo allows to navigate video and to explore other related media to complement it. Hypervideo might then support the creation of a rich and realistic learning environment, through the interactive access, construction and communication of knowledge on veterinary surgery. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of Hvet, a hypervideo environment to support learning of veterinary surgery. Design was based on cognitive and media theories, and evaluation was based on the use of Hvet by veterinary students, in order to test its efficacy in substitution of learning and training with live animals. Results support the hypothesis, showing the potential of hypervideo as a valuable and effective tool to support learning of surgery techniques and revealing the most appreciated design options.},

It has been widely studied and demonstrated its ability to help students to acquire knowledge faster, improve learning outcomes, reduce navigation overhead, increase motivation, and encourage the beneficial non-sequential navigation. However, almost all studies of adaptive link annotation have been performed in the context of dedicated adaptive educational hypermedia systems. The role of this technique in the context of widely popular learning portals has not yet been demonstrated. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by investigating the value of adaptive navigation support embedded into the learning portal. We compare the effect of portal-based adaptive navigation support to both the effect of the adaptive navigation support in adaptive educational hypermedia systems and to non-adaptive learning portals.},

abstract = {Analysis has shown that the standard Markovian model of Web navigation is a poor predictor of actual Web traffic. Using empirical data, we characterize several properties of Web traffic that cannot be reproduced with Markovian models but can be explained by an agent-based model that adds several realistic browsing behaviors. First, agents maintain bookmark lists used as teleportation targets. Second, agents can retreat along visited links, a branching mechanism that can reproduce behavior such the back button and tabbed browsing. Finally, agents are sustained by visiting pages of topical interest, with adjacent pages being related. This modulates the production of new sessions, recreating heterogeneous session lengths. The resulting model reproduces individual behaviors from empirical data, reconciling the narrowly focused browsing patterns of individual users with the extreme heterogeneity of aggregate traffic measurements, and leading the way to more sophisticated, realistic, and effective ranking and crawling algorithms.},

abstract = {Online social sharing sites are becoming very popular nowadays among Web users, who use these sites to share their favourite items and to discover interesting and useful items from other users. While an explicit social network is not necessarily present in these sites, it is still possible that users influence one another in the process of item adoption through various implicit mechanisms. In this paper, we study how we can capture the implicit influences among the users in a social sharing site. We propose a probabilistic model for user adoption behaviour, where we assume that when user adopts an item, he would pick a user and choose from the set of items that this user has adopted. By using the model, we estimate the probability that one user influences another user in the course of item adoption, based on the temporal adoption pattern of the users. We carry out empirical studies of the model on Delicious, a popular social bookmarking site. Experiments show that our model can be used to predict item adoption more accurately than using collaborative filtering techniques. We find that the strength of implicit influence various across different topics. We also show that our method is able to identify the influential users who are more likely to possess items interested by other users. Our model can be used to study the dynamics in a social sharing site and to complement collaborative filtering in recommendation systems.},

To support comprehension of the history, we describe automatic history clustering to group low-level system events into a more human-level representation of activity and the extraction of information for summarizing these groups of events. To further support navigation and comprehension of history, the mechanism includes multiple visualization techniques to match diverse uses of history. The new history mechanism is integrated into VKB 3.},

abstract = {The ongoing spread of online social networking and sharing sites has reshaped the way how people interact with each other. Analyzing the relatedness of different users within the resulting large populations of these systems plays an important role for tasks like user recommendation or community detection. Algorithms in these fields typically face the problem that explicit user relationships (like friend lists) are often very sparse. Surprisingly, implicit evidences (like click logs) of user relations have hardly been considered to this end.Based on our long-time experience with running BibSonomy [4], we identify in this paper different evidence networks of user relationships in our system. We broadly classify each network based on whether the links are explicitly established by the users (e.g., friendship or group membership) or accrue implicitly in the running system (e.g., when user u copies an entry of user v). We systematically analyze structural properties of these networks and whether topological closeness (in terms of the length of shortest paths) coincides with semantic similarity between users.Our results exhibit different characteristics and. provide preparatory work for the inclusion of new (and less sparse) information into the process of optimizing community detection or user recommendation algorithms.},

In this paper Bush proposed MEMEX, a device where information and records could be stored and linked together through 'trails' and 'associations' rather than 'artificial' indexing mechanisms. This idea is credited with being the inspiration, and precursor, for the modern World Wide Web (WWW) invented by Tim Berners-Lee, but as Harper notes, for most of the article, Bush was not concerned solely with the technical aspects of his MEMEX system. Instead, as with most computer visionaries, he was more concerned with how the computer system and its interfaces could help humanity [3]. We must therefore consider if, as a research field, we are still trying to build MEMEX as Bush envisioned it, or are we more influenced by a vision of information storage and presentation, of which Bush's paper was one of many?},

abstract = {We live in a world where networks of people mingle with networks of documents, creating networks of ideas that are linked to the people and documents that subscribe to them. New tools are being created that facilitate the interactions between these networks, greatly expanding the role of hypertext as a social media tool. Interactive visualization is a particularly powerful tool that capitalizes on the immense visual processing power of the human brain. With Web 2.0 and related technologies the world of ideas is being shaped by the wisdom of crowds. People understand data better when we scale up the audience. While one can learn a lot simply watching visual displays of information, there is also a pent up desire to analyze. People want their own controls, so that they can see data in their own way by looking at it differently. ManyEyes is a system that features a range of visualizations, where people can upload data and see that data in a variety of ways. When people find interesting views of the data they can annotate them and share their comments with others, thus building a community around visualization and interpretation. Sharing visualizations and interpretations lets people have deeper discussions in the communities that they belong to, facilitating conversations on politics, economics, health, and a host of other issues. We have found that visualizations are particularly powerful when used to analyze words. Dynamic visualizations draw people in and lead to interesting new conclusions. Scalable real world deployments let research keep up with the wisdom of crowds, and this keynote will explore some of the emerging research in this area.

Although this approach allows in many cases the detection of plagiarized work that could not be detected automatically with the traditional approaches, it should be considered as an extension rather than a substitute. Whereas the known text analysis methods can detect copied or, to a certain degree, modified passages, the proposed approach requires longer passages with at least two citations in order to create a digital fingerprint.},

This can have a particular impact when the contextualization is used in the process of assessing student learning. This study investigates the types of words that cause difficulty for students. The assessment shows that there are terms used on engineering tests that present possible barriers for students, such that the test may in part be assessing the student's cultural knowledge or vocabulary rather than engineering competency. We propose a number of strategies for remediating this situation including the use of hypertext to mitigate this type of accessibility barrier.},

In this paper, we investigate the discovery of two roles that define information dissipation: disseminators and receptors.

abstract = {The vast amounts of video that need to be tagged preclude the exclusive use of professional indexers. Thus a significant amount of video will need to be tagged by non-experts. Are the tags created by experts demonstrably superior to those of non-experts, and when non-experts have to be used for tagging, is it better to rely on tags created by those who upload videos or on others who watch the videos? Two related studies were carried out, the first where domain experts and others tagged videos, and the second where experts and others rated the relevance of tags that had been assigned to videos in the first study. Expert tags were judged to be more relevant by both experts and non-experts, with non-expert viewers also creating significantly better tags than did owners (i.e., the people who uploaded the videos). While significant differences were observed, the mean overall judged relevance of tags was relatively low, even for experts. Thus there seems to be considerable scope for the use of tag recommendation systems and other tools that can make the tagging process more consistent.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a method that can extract user interests from the user's Web browsing history. Our method allows easy access to multiple content domains such as blogs, movies, QA sites, etc. since the user does not need to input a separate search query in each domain/site. To extract user interests, the method first extracts candidate keyphrases from the user's web browsed documents. Second, important keyphrases obtained from a link structure analysis of Wikipedia content is extracted from the main contents of web documents. This technique is based on the idea that important keyphrases in Wikipedia are important keyphrases in the real world. Finally, keyphrases contained in the documents important to the user are set in order as user interests. An experiment shows that our method offers improvements over a conventional method and can recommend interests attractive to the user.},

The scope is to use the developed multi-thread web crawler as a tool to automatically extract from web pages data that are associated with each one of those three axes in order afterwards to compute several useful descriptive statistics and apply advanced mathematical and statistical methods.

The emerging era of lifelong learning is calling for flexible environments. Interactive television (iTV) holds a great potential in this scenario, but there is still limited research in terms of cognitive and interaction aspects. With the aim to link these opportunities, in flexible, adequate and effective learning contexts, a new paradigm to generate crossmedia personalized learning contexts from iTV, based on cognitive and affective aspects, is being studied. This paper presents the results obtained from the use of the e-iTV system, designed to illustrate and explore this paradigm.},
