abstract = {Philadelphia Fullerine, a geodesic hypermedia sculpture designed by the author, is about ethnic and lower class life in mid-19th century Philadelphia. Each of the 60 faces presents primary image material and a short audio documentary. Adjacent faces are linked conceptually. This geodesic sphere has full rotational freedom. Viewers are encouraged to begin anywhere and follow any path of adjacency. This paper examines the underlying theory, design methods, and structure of the sculpture as a case study in the applications and challenges of creating, storing, and navigating three-dimensional hyperstructures with spatial hypertext software and GZigZag.},

abstract = {The dissemination of information available through the World Wide Web makes universal access more and more important and supports visually disabled people in their everyday life. In this paper we present a new approach for visually disabled people to browse and interact with web pages. Up to now graphical information is mostly ignored in transformations for visually disabled people. We propose a web browser, which uses a transformation schema to render web pages on a tactile graphics display. Bitmap images and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) can be explored in a special mode, in which filters can be applied and zooming is possible. Mathematical expressions encoded in the Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) are transformed into LaTeX or into a notation for visually disabled people. The web browser supports voice output to read text paragraphs and to provide feedback on interactions to the users.},

abstract = {Many organizations, particularly in the heritage sector, have large archives of digital content that they could make available to the general public or special interest groups if they had the appropriate mechanisms. Currently, these organizations can develop pre-crafted web sites, simple database-driven web sites or search facilities for accessing the content. However, none of these can be expected to appropriately present this content or scaffold its effective use.Our proposed solution is an approach to navigation that we term spotlight browsing. It has the following key features: (i) Users can select a collection of resources from the archive, shining a spotlight on this area of the archive; (ii) The collection is structured in a number of ways to support its exploration and convey interesting properties of the collection; (iii) Users can see what is on the periphery of their current collection in order to encourage further exploration; (iv) Users can redefine the collection in order to move their spotlight to another area of the archive; (v) Any item viewed while browsing can be bookmarked into a personal collection that can be built up using resources from many different spotlights. The approach has been implemented and tested using an archive of content from a heritage institution.},

Unfortunately, information seeking in this complex hypermedia environment is generally not an easy task. The potentially complex task of information seeking in the WWW is further complicated when the end-user is blind or visually impaired (VI). Usually, web pages are created without taken accessibility into account and without using HTML markup correctly to express the functional structure of documents. Both facts pose a lot of problems to VI during information seeking in the web. In this paper we discuss problems related to this issue and how the information seeking process in the WWW could become more effective and efficient for the VI. We also present an ongoing research effort, inspired from the idea of Semantic Web, aiming to enhance browsing efficiency as a result of rationalizing the way VI browse the WWW.},

Although tools that support an easy approach to web writing, such as blogs and wikis, are becoming increasingly important and mainstream, they still lack in terms of layout and typographical sophistication, and, most importantly, only allow local editing (on the pages that are stored by the application itself). In this paper we re-propose an old paradigm for writing content on the net, directly derived from the Xanadu vision by Ted Nelson: global editability foresees that all documents on the web can be accessed for editing and modified on line, very much as in a global wiki. Global editability needs to address a number of issues, including correct support for intellectual property and legal issues, before it can be accepted as an idea. We provide some considerations on technical issues of global editability, and describe the architecture and implementation of a system, called IsaWiki, that is being developed at the University of Bologna.},

abstract = {Hypertext can be seen as a logic representation, where semantics are encoded in both the textual nodes and the graph of links. Systems that have a very formal representation of these semantics are able to manipulate the hypertexts in a sophisticated way; for example by adapting them or sculpting them at run-time. However, hypertext systems which require the author to write in terms of structures with explicit semantics are difficult/costly to write in, and can be seen as too restrictive by certain authors because they do not allow the playful ambiguity often associated with literary hypertext.In this paper we present a vector-based model of the formality of semantics in hypertext systems, where the vectors represent the translation of semantics from author to system and from system to reader. We categorise a variety of existing systems and draw out some general conclusions about the profiles they share. We believe that our model will help hypertext system designers analyse how their own systems formalise semantics, and will warn them when they need to mind the Semantic Gap between authors and readers.},

These include segments of web pages or aggregation of web pages into web communities. Such logical information units improve a variety of web algorithms and provide the building blocks for the construction of organized information spaces such as digital libraries. In this paper, we focus on a type of logical information units called "compound documents". We argue that the ability to identify compound documents can improve information retrieval, automatic metadata generation, and navigation on the Web. We propose a unified framework for identifying the boundaries of compound documents, which combines both structural and content features of constituent web pages. The framework is based on a combination of machine learning and clustering algorithms, with the former algorithm supervising the latter one. We also propose a new method for evaluating quality of clusterings, based on a user behavior model. Experiments on a collection of educational web sites show that our approach can reliably identify most of the compound documents on these sites.},

A method for detecting unusual structures would be useful for identifying such structures so that their impact can be studied and ways to improve Web site effectiveness developed.We viewed the Web as a directed graph, and introduced a higher-order rank based on the non-well-founded set theory. We then developed higher-order rank analysis for detecting irregularities, defined as structures which differ from the typical structure of a target site. To test the effectiveness of our method, we applied it to several Web sites in actual use, and succeeded in identifying irregular structures in the sites.},

This paper describes the two main purposes of spatial parsers in spatial hypermedia systems and how particular parsing approaches and features influence their effectiveness and responsiveness. An alternative approach that provides better support for ambiguity and adaptability is instantiated in FLAPS, an adaptive spatial parser that uses fuzzy-logic in order to infer the implicit structure of spatial hypermedia. The comparison of FLAPS to other parsers reveals benefits of supporting ambiguous structures by computing multiple possible interpretations and identifies limitations that provide goals for future spatial parsers.},

abstract = {Hyperlinks are an essential feature of the World Wide Web, highly responsible for its success. XLink improves on HTML's linking capabilities in several ways. In particular, links after XLink can be "out-of-line" (i.e., not defined at a link source) and collected in (possibly several) linkbases, which considerably ease building complex link structures.Regarding its architecture as a distributed and open system, the Web differs significantly from traditional hypermedia systems. Modeling of link structures and processing of linkbases under the Web's "open world linking" require rethinking the traditional approaches. This, unfortunately, has been rather neglected in the design of XLink.Adding a notion of "interface" to XLink, as suggested in this work, can considerably improve modeling of link structures. When a link structure is traversed, the relevant linkbase(s) might become ambiguous. We suggest three linkbase management modes governing the binding of a linkbase to a document to resolve this ambiguity.},

abstract = {We propose WebRelievo, a system for visualizing and analyzing the evolution of the web structure based on a large Web archive with a series of snapshots. It visualizes the evolution with a time series of graphs, in which nodes are web pages, and edges are relationships between pages. Graphs can be clustered to show the overview of changes in graphs. WebRelievo aligns these graphs according to their time, and automatically determines their layout keeping positions of nodes synchronized over time, so that the user can keep track pages and clusters. This visualization enables us to understand when pages appeared, how their relationships have evolved, and how clusters are merged and split over time. Current implementation of WebRelievo is based on six Japanese web archives crawled from 1999 to 2003. The user can interactively browse those graphs by changing the focused page and by changing layouts of graphs. Using WebRelievo we can answer historical questions, and to investigate changes in trends on the Web. We show the feasibility of WebRelievo by applying it to tracking trends in P2P systems and search engines for mobile phones, and to investigating link spamming.},

Considering different behavior and preferences of each user it may be hard to generalize and construct all appropriate rules in advance. This problem is more noticeable in educational adaptive hypermedia systems, where adaptation to individual learning style of a student is important for the student to effectively assess particular domain. In this paper we present techniques for data mining, which can be used to discover knowledge about students' behavior during learning, as well as techniques, which take advantage of such knowledge to recommend students lessons they should study next. We also describe a process of recommendation based on knowledge discovery and present an architecture of a web-based system, which uses proposed approach to improve adaptation. Proposed architecture is independent of actual adaptive hypermedia system used.},

Our method is shown to reduce the time spent searching the index, reduce the need to reformulate queries, and also increase the proportion of queries which fulfill the user's information need.

The DynamOnt project has set out to develop a methodology for collaboratively creating group ontologies which evolve over time as well as in space and internal complexity. The project also seeks to identify requirements and specifications for tools which will support the construction of such dynamically evolving ontologies. Major issues are the guidance of knowledge workers towards soundly constructed ontologies with the help of upper level ontologies and an exploration into language issues - in our case the scenario for constructing ontologies, if German is the language of choice for the domain experts. We also investigate the relationship between terminology and ontology, which we view as a bridge between linguistically motivated and IT motivated standardisation of conceptual models. We envisage knowledge workers' environments of the future to be tightly integrated systems with their hypertextual capabilities being controlled by ontologically sound interaction and navigation models.},

We present a proposal for fragment identifiers for plain text files, which makes it possible to identify character or line ranges, or subresources identified by regular expressions. Using these fragment identifiers, it is possible to create more specific hyperlinks, by not only linking to a complete plain text resource, but only the relevant part of it.

abstract = {Sonification is the technique of generating sounds from complex data in order to represent that data to a human being. With 3d audio it is possible to place these sounds in a 3d soundscape around a listener. In this paper we investigate the possibility of using 3d sonification in physical hypermedia environments. We present our early experiences of developing a 3d sonification simulator based on Open Hypermedia technology.},

HyperHistory attempts to mend the rift between the user's mental model and the context-less representation the browser's history provides. Furthermore, the extension lessens the affordance necessary to efficiently gather and retrieve information by preserving the semantic context based on visited hyperlinks and estimating the value a single page has to the user.},

abstract = {Hypertext is a paradigm for user-driven access to information, and the task of the user is to navigate hypertext. This poster suggests to treat navigation as an independent dimension by explicitly describing the navigation space in a dedicated navigation language.The language has three major applications: (1) Describing paths through hypertext. Those paths can be used as recommendations or prescriptions that users may or must follow. (2) Building specialized information access paths to cope with specific information needs. (3) Enabling the automation of recurring navigation patterns.All three cases are related by the notion of a path. We introduce an abstraction that captures the idea of a "path through hypertext", so-called hypertracks, which are concise, quick to author, and easy to communicate (e.g. via e-mail or Web).This poster motivates the navigation language and introduces the concepts behind it (hypertracks, stateful navigation situations, navigation context, navigation actions, navigation history, predicates for conditional navigation, and an event-based processing model). The concrete syntax of the language and its integration into a browser are under development.},
