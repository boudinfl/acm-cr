abstract = {This paper is a "call to arms" for the community to take up Van Bush's original challenge of effecting a transformation of scholarly communications and record keeping. It argues for the necessity of an interactive scholarly communication research agenda by briefly reviewing the rapid development of alternative authoring and publishing models. Seven dimensions of interactive communication that delineate a design space for the area are described. Previous work and existing new media are used to initially populate the design space and show opportunities for new research directions. VKB spaces, Synchrony PADLs, and Walden's paths are used as foils for describing new media for interactive scholarly communication. This leads to a brief discussion of uncovered areas in the design space and open research questions. A community developed framework for future interactive scholarly communications would be a major contribution and is put forth as the overall goal.},

abstract = {A digital library, together with its users and its contents, does not exist in isolated splendour; nor in hypertext terms is it merely the intertextual relationships between its texts. There is a cycle of activities which provides the context for the library's existence, and which the library supports through its various roles of information access, discovery, storage, dissemination and preservation. This paper describes the role of digital library systems in the undertaking of science, and in particular in the context of the recent developments of the Grid for computer-supported scientific collaboration and Virtual Universities for computer-supported education. This paper focuses on a specific framework, the Dynamic Review Journal, which supports the development and dissemination of documents by assisting authors in collating and analysing experimental results, organising internal project discussions, and producing papers. By bridging the gap between the undertaking of experimental work and the dissemination of its results through electronic publication, this work addresses the cycle of activity in which a digital library rests.},

abstract = {The Transparent Video Facetop is a novel user interface concept that supports not only single-user interactions with a PC, but also close pair collaborations, such as that found in collaborative Web browsing, in distributed pair programming and in remote medicine. We recently demonstrated the Vis-a-Vid Facetop prototype as a single-user GUI for manipulating the elements of a traditional WIMP desktop [21]. In this paper we introduce FaceSpace, a Facetop-based hypermedia system that combines structure and functionality of both spatial and ubiquitous hypertext. FaceSpace eliminates camera registration errors due to dynamic object tracking and user self-image feedback. FaceSpace had two forms of linking that combine spatial hypermedia with ubiquitous hypermedia: Like an exo-skeleton provides an organism with structure from without, exo-spatial hypertext has the spatial structure applied over the ubiquity of the user's real-world environment. Endo-spatial hypertext has the spatial structure derived from and attached to the elements of the user's domain. Endo-spatial hypertext is an integral concept in systems that have been classified as ubiquitous hypertext; exo-spatial is unique to FaceSpace in current hypertext systems.},

While this removes impediments to collaboration, it often deters participants who would rather incubate ideas before bringing them to the group. This is especially the case where creative ideas are at stake. Creating additional wikis with restricted access is a costly solution: it requires participants to distinguish between and navigate between wikis; it requires administrators to construct wikis and their access rules; and it does not account for the movement of content from private to public. In this paper, we describe a system that augments the hypertext in order to solve these problems. This system automatically creates and maintains access rules in response to browsing and editing of the wiki hypertext. In doing so, it improves the targeting of documents in the hypertext, and identifies significant collections of documents and participants.},

The HyCon framework encompasses annotations, links, and guided tours associating locations and RFID- or Bluetooth-tagged objects with maps, Web pages, and collections of resources. The user-created annotations, links and guided tours, are represented as XLink structures, and HyCon introduces the use of XLink for the representation of recorded geographical paths with annotations and links. The HyCon architecture extends upon earlier location based hypermedia systems by supporting authoring in the field and by providing access to browsing and searching information through a novel geo-based search (GBS) interface for the Web. Interface-wise, the HyCon prototype utilizes SVG on an interface level, for graphics as well as for user interface widgets on tablet PCs and mobile phones.},

abstract = {A high quality of free movement, or mobility, is key to the accessibility, design, and usability of many 'common-use' hypermedia resources (Web sites) and key to good mobility is context and preview. This is especially the case when a hypertext anchor is inaccurately described or is described out of context as confusion and disorientation can ensue. Mobility is similarly reduced when the link target of the anchor has no relationship to the expected information present on the hypertext node (Web page). Confident movement with purpose, ease, and accuracy can only be achieved when complete contextual information and an accurate description of the proposed destination (preview) are available. We suggest that sighted people can benefit from additional context and preview information included in hyperlinks and disprove the empirical evidence that suggests these users do not benefit from link descriptions which have this enhanced information. We briefly describe a middleware system to automatically expand context and preview in link descriptions thereby 'fixing' terse links, links out of context, and inaccurate or inadequate preview information. Finally, we conduct a formative evaluation which shows us that a system to expand context and preview would be useful in different ways depending on the type of link.},

abstract = {Over the past couple decades, as the term "hypertext" has gained a certain popular currency, a question has been raised repeatedly: "What is hypertext?" Our most respected scholars offer a range of different, at times incompatible, answers. This paper argues that our best response to this situation is to adopt the approach taken with other terms that are central to intellectual communities (such as "natural selection," "communism," and "psychoanalysis"), a historical approach. In the case of "hypertext" the term began with Theodor Holm ("Ted") Nelson, and in this paper two of his early publications of "hypertext" are used to determine its initial meaning: the 1965 "A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate" and the 1970 "No More Teachers' Dirty Looks." It is concluded that hypertext began as a term for forms of hypermedia (human-authored media that "branch or perform on request") that operate textually. This runs counter to definitions of hypertext in the literary community that focus solely on the link. It also runs counter to definitions in the research community that privilege tools for knowledge work over media. An inclusive future is envisioned.},

Not only does such an effort involve standard digital preservation problems of representing and refreshing metadata, any constituent media types, and structure; hypertext preservation poses additional dimensions that arise from the work's on-screen appearance, its interactive behavior, and the ways a reader's interaction with the work is recorded. In this paper, we describe aspects of preservation introduced by literary hypertexts such as the need to reproduce their modes of interactivity and their means of capturing and using records of reading. We then suggest strategies for addressing the pragmatic dimensions of hypertext preservation and discuss their status within existing digital preservation schemes. Finally, we examine the possible roles various stakeholders within and outside of the hypertext community might assume, including several social and legal issues that stem from preservation.},

The system presents the ongoing generation of the composition to the user in an interactive information space. In this space, the user can directly manipulate the composition through interactive design operations, and affect the model by expressing positive or negative interest in each sample.We are developing mechanisms for manipulating the time-based medium of the evolving information space. Interaction design affords linear timeline traversal and non-linear time travel. Extended tape recorder metaphor controls, including jog-shuttle based navigation, provide the user with flexible means for operating the system's generative functionalities, and linearly traversing session history. We introduce a door-latch metaphor that enables one of several considered forms of non-linear time travel. Users can change history by retroactively locking an information sample in position across time.},

In this paper, we consider zzstructures, mSpaces, and polyarchies from the perspective of graph theory, and compare these models formally. The novel aspects of this work include: providing a sound, graph-theoretic analysis of zzstructures; the identification of a new class of polyarchies associated with mSpaces; and the comparison and classification of these and other structures within a taxonomy. The taxonomy that results from our comparison allows us to consider, first; what the distinct characteristics of each model are at a fundamental level, and second; what model or attributes of a model may be most appropriate for the design goals of a given hypermedia application.},

To apply Chrysant for a specific hypertext system, we require the containment model for this system's data model, the containment model of the version repository for this system, the hypertext role definition, the versioning role definition, and the filesystem mapping definition. Additionally, a specific parser that retrieves the link targets from the hypertext resources is needed. Hypertext versioning is different from versioning an individual resource in the traditional way, in that both the content of a hypertext resource and the relationships between it and other resources related by hypertext links are versioned. In Chrysant, the structure container and the content of a hypertext resource are versioned separately. We describe the architecture of Chrysant, and explain the procedure of the check-in and check-out functions. An AF-BTU algorithm is introduced in the paper to check in the hypertext network of a hypertext resource. As a case study, the application of Chrysant for HTML content is introduced. We create necessary definition specifications for the HTML system and a parser to retrieve link targets from a HTML document. Some examples of HTML versioning with Chrysant are shown.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a model-driven methodology and toolset for automatic generation of hypertext system repositories. Our code generator, called Bamboo, is based on a Containment Modeling Framework (CMF) that uniformly describes data models for hypertext systems. CMF employs a lightweight modeling approach in which entities (system abstractions) and containment relationships are used to model hypertext system repositories. Given a description of a system repository data model using CMF, as well as a specification of the mapping between the domain specific roles (link, version history, etc.) and the entity definitions, Bamboo can generate an open hypertext repository that matches the specification. The benefits of this approach include a shorter development cycle, lower design and implementation costs, fewer design faults, a standard repository API, and extensibility for adding new features. We validate our approach by automatically generating repositories in accordance with the models of five existing hypertext systems. We also demonstrate the extensibility of our approach by quickly building a GUI client on top of a repository, and then subsequently adding version control capabilities by altering the containment model and regenerating the system.},

abstract = {This paper proposes the paradigm of 'Cinematic' Hypertext (CH), in which discourse form is represented following principles that underpin the expression of narrative patterns in cinema. Primarily tackling hypertext discourse coherence in the non-linear medium, CH is conceived as a way of thinking the hypertext medium that is consistent with its characteristics. CH envisages the consistent and concurrent use of the medium's formal features, grounded in structuring principles, in order to allow the emergence of a local language. Relational primitives based on Cognitive Coherence Relations are proposed as a structuring principle to define hypertext links, while the use the medium's graphic features is proposed to render these relational primitives as patterns that will take shape during navigation. Taking scholarly hypertext as a domain, this paper articulates the theoretical basis for cinematic hypertext, presents the elements of a prototype visual language to express a sub-set of CCR, provides experimental evidence of its significance, and finally envisages the realisation of a cinematic hypertext environment.},

Garnet supports both information structuring - via spatial hypertext - and traditional information seeking - via a digital library. A user study of Garnet is reported, together with an analysis of how the organizing work done by users in a spatial hypertext workspace could support later information seeking. The use of Garnet during the study is related to both digital library and spatial hypertext research. Spatial hypertexts support the detection of implicit document groups in a user's workspace. The study also investigates the degree of similarity found in the full text of documents within such document groups.},

abstract = {Structural computing asserts the primacy of structure over data. This has often been understood to mean that all levels of a structural computing system architecture should exhibit structure awareness, leading to data models centered around so-called "structural atoms." While systems based upon structural atoms do provide ubiquitous first-class structural abstractions, they also freeze the "granularity" of the structuring process throughout their architectures at design-time. That is, decisions regarding representations of structures in structural computing architectures based upon atoms cannot be recast at run-time. In this paper, we examine an alternative to atom-based models for structural computing systems that allows exactly such recasting. We demonstrate how this alternative model, which we call EAD, is superior to atom-based models for certain important applications, and describe our initial prototypical implementations.},

abstract = {One of the most visible and significant effects of the introduction and use of hypermedia technology has been to substantially increase the variety of structures available in computing environments. As research in the hypermedia field has progressed, the pace at which structure evolves has increased. While the rise in diversity of hypermedia structure has generally been regarded as a positive development, as with many phenomena, it is important to examine structural diversity carefully to avoid the problems that excessive diversity can bring, and to ensure the complete spectrum of potentially beneficial forms of diversity is considered.This paper introduces a diversity space that can serve as an important tool in the study of structural diversity in hypermedia. The purposes of the diversity space are manifold including: to serve as a description space in which the structural diversity of a specific computing environment can be completely and concisely described, to highlight and assist in reconciling differences in structural diversity between computing environments, and to serve as a useful design space in which important diversity related decisions can be considered. To demonstrate the usage of the diversity space, it is first used as a tool to examine the way in which structural diversity developed within the hypermedia field. It is then used to characterize and consider the levels of structural diversity found in the class of computing environments that currently exhibit the highest levels of structural diversity: structural computing systems.},

abstract = {Structural computing evolved from work on open hypermedia to aid in the creation of software infrastructure. Open hypermedia had produced software that provided applications with access to hypermedia structures and services. The question was asked if these results could be generalized to create similar tools for other domains. Initial work focused on the development of structure servers that can create and manipulate domain-specific structures, but little work focused on allowing those structures to provide a rich set of behaviors. Indeed, this forced developers to place behaviors on the client rather than having behaviors live within a structure server. This paper presents research on the addition of a type system to the Themis structure server and how these types interact with Themis's template mechanism to provide a single interface that unifies structure, behavior, and data. This new mechanism lets behaviors live within a structure server allowing them to be shared by client applications. To demonstrate its power, Themis is being used to re-implement the Chimera open hypermedia system.},
