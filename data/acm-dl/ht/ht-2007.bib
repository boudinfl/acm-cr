abstract = {Multi-headed reverse linking (incoming links) is a fundamental concept of Open Hypermedia Systems. However, this bi-directionality has been lost in the move to the World Wide Web (Web). Here, we suggest a Web based solution for rediscovering these reverse links, and develop a series of experiments to demonstrate our approach. Simply our algorithm involves parsing a Web server's log file, identifying each Web page viewed and saving an ordered list of referrers within a 'name-matched' XML file. This file is then used as a link point within a standard XHTML Web-page using a freely available Javascript library. While we have not performed any comprehensive user evaluation initial qualitative results suggest users are positive regarding our additions and that widespread adoption would increase user satisfaction due to constancy of the browsing experience.},

abstract = {To utilize the similarity information hidden in the Web graph, we investigate the problem of adaptively retrieving related Web pages with user assistance. Given a definition of similarities between pages, it is intuitive to estimate that any similarity will propagate from page to page, inducing an implicit topical relatedness between pages. In this paper, we extract connected subgraphs from the whole graph that consists of all pairs of pages whose similarity scores are above a given threshold, and then sort the candidates of related pages by a novel rank measure which is based on the combination distances of a flexible hierarchical clustering. Moreover, due to the subjectivity of similarity values, we dynamically supply the ordering list of related pages according to a parameter adjusted by users. We show our approach effectively handles a set of pages originating from three related categories of Web hierarchies, such as Google Directory. The experiments with three similarity measures demonstrate that using in-link information is favorable while using a combination measure of in-links and out-links lowers the precision of identifying similar pages.},

abstract = {The design and maintenance of an aero-engine generates a significant amount of documentation. When designing new engines, engineers must obtain knowledge gained from maintenance of existing engines to identify possible areas of concern. We developed a Semantic Web based document repository for transferring front-line maintenance knowledge to design. The Semantic Web is an ideal candidate for this application because of the size and distributed nature of an aerospace manufacturer's operation. The Semantic Web allows us to dynamically cross reference documents with the use of an ontology. However, during the design and implementation of this project, we found deficiencies in the W3C1 recommended Semantic Web query language SPARQL. It is difficult to answer questions our users sought from the document repository using SPARQL. The problem is that SPARQL is designed for handling textual queries. In industrial applications, many common textual and semantic questions also contain a numerical element, be it data summarization or arithmetic operations. In this paper, we generalize the problems we found with SPARQL, and extend it to cover web applications in non-aerospace domains. Based on this analysis, we recommend that SQL-styled grouping, aggregation and variable operations be added to SPARQL, as they are necessary for industrial applications of the Semantic Web. At the moment, to answer the non-textual questions we identified with an RDF store, custom written software is needed to process the results returned by SPARQL. We incorporated the suggested numerical functionalities from SQL for an example query, and achieved a 21.7% improvement to the speed of execution. More importantly, we eliminate the need of extra processing in software, and thus make it easier and quicker to develop Semantic Web applications.},

abstract = {HTTP provides a mechanism to connect web sites. Almost all sites have a large amount of hypertext content that provides connection to other sites in the World Wide Web. The success of the WWW can be partly attributed to the seamlessly browsable web that is formed through this connectivity. However, navigation of hypermedia content through non-visual interfaces has not received as much attention. Specifically, telephony voice applications offer immense usability and penetration benefits and can act as alternate information access and delivery mechanisms. Connectivity across voice applications poses interesting and novel challenges. In this paper, we define Hyperspeech as a voice fragment in a voice application that is a hyperlink to a voice fragment in another voice application. Further, we present Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol (HSTP) - a protocol to seamlessly connect telephony voice applications. HSTP enables the users to browse across voice applications by navigating the Hyperspeech content in a voice application. HSTP can also be used for developing cross-enterprise applications that allow a user to transact across two or more voice applications.},

abstract = {Manual hypertext construction is labour intensive and prone to error. Robust systems capable of automatic hypertext generation (AHG) could be of direct benefit to those individuals responsible for hypertext authoring. In this paper we propose a novel technique for the autonomous creation of hypertext which is dependent upon language models. This work is strongly influenced by those algorithms which process the hyperlinked structure of a corpus in an attempt to find authoritative sources. The algorithm was evaluated by experimental comparison with human hypertext authors, and we found that both approaches produced broadly similar results.},

An evaluation tool capable of understanding these specifications generates evaluation reports that are tailored to the user's individual needs. Quantitative accessibility measures resulting from personalized evaluation reports can be used to improve the web browsing experience for users with disabilities, such as through adaptive navigation support and by sorting the results of search engines according to users' personal requirements.

The system is extensible in that the inefficiencies that it finds and eliminates are not predetermined; to search for a new kind of inefficiency, web site admininstrators can provide a pattern (in a language designed specifically for this) that finds and eliminates the new inefficiency.},

While the Web has been represented as a Page + Links, the paper presents the argument that the Semantic Web can be conceptualized as a Notebook + Memex. The argument considers how this model also presents new challenges for fundamental human interaction with computing, and that hypertext models have much to contribute to this new understanding for distributed information systems.},

But authorship is more than just selection and organization; it is a complex construct incorporating concepts of originality, authority, intertextuality, and attribution. In this paper we explore these concepts and ask how they are changing in light of modes of collaborative authorship in remix culture. We present a qualitative case study of an online video remixing site, illustrating how the constraints of that environment are impacting authorial constructs. We discuss users' self-conceptions as authors, and how values related to authorship are reflected to users through the interface and design of the site's tools. We also present some implications for the design of online communities for collaborative media creation and remixing.},

TBW deviates from - and thereby reconfirms metagenerically - the rules of the conventional thriller by leaving the solution of the mystery not only to the reader's intention-driven, cognitive engagement with the plot, but chiefly to his or her very physical condition. Drawing on Aarseth's (1997) 'text/machine' and notions of intentionality and physical situatedness, I introduce the concept of 'cybertextual retro-intentionalization'.},

Unlike most current methods, which use the information structure as the basis for building the navigational structure, we start from a workflow-like process model to create a two-level navigational model. On one hand, the strong navigational schema is composed of nodes called activity views and links derived from control flow relationships of the process model. On the other hand, a weak navigational schema is developed for each activity view based on the information a given actor has to use to perform the associated activity. Our approach allows designers to solve in a natural way the problems where the business processes prevail over the information structure.},

While Bitmapping fosters an interesting roadmap of images, it is limited by physical location and the linear stories that it seeks to create. Image Seeds is a global communal hypermedia art experiment that extends Bitmapping. Rather than receiving a single image, participants are invited to navigate a web of images, all of which can act as seeds of inspiration. If participants stumble across an image that inspires, they are invited to add their own image to the hypermedia and create a link from the image that instigated the inspiration. Images can have multiple links to create an evolving story that unfolds into a unique and diverse narrative as participants follow paths through the pictures.},

The problem is more apparent for Malaysian older adults who are not only struggling with their age-related difficulties but at the same time need to use a user-interface which has been designed out of their culture. As localization is not well-practised in Malaysia, the English user-interface is one of the biggest barriers for older adults who could not read the language.

Thereafter, the user guides the learning process in a hyperlinked environment, by selecting a target concept, exploring the associated learning graph, learning pre-requisite concepts, and repeating this process till her learning goal is reached. To measure usefulness and correctness of our approach, we conducted a user study with 25 users using precision and recall measures. Overall, the feedback from users was encouraging. We believe this is a positive step toward building user driven interactive learning systems.},

The German Wikipedia has the nice property that it has two types of featured articles: excellent and worth reading. We explore on the German Wikipedia whether only the mere number of contributors makes the difference or whether the high quality of featured articles results from having experienced authors contributing with a reputation for high quality contributions. Our results indicate that it does matter who contributes.},

In this paper, we describe a novel methodology and framework for identifying subcommunities as cohesive subgroups of n-cliques and k-plexes within social hypertext. We apply our methodology to a group of computer technologists in Toronto called TorCamp who communicate using a Google group. K-plex analysis is then used to identify a group of people that forms a subcommunity within the larger community. The results are then validated against the experienced sense of community of people inside and outside the subcommunity. Statistically significant differences in experienced sense of community are found, with people within the subcommunity showing higher levels of perceived influence and emotional connection.},

In this setting, they expect the application to user-tailor and personalize content access upon their particular needs. Exhibiting some kind of user- and context-dependency is thus crucial in Web Engineering. In this research, we focus on separating the adaptation engineering process from regular Web engineering by applying aspect-oriented techniques. We show how semantic information and metadata associated with the content can be exploited in our aspect-oriented approach. Furthermore, the approach allows the use of global (structural) properties of the Web application in adaptation specification. We thus obtain several advantages, which are demonstrated in this paper: to control adaptation specification) separate from (regular) Web Engineering oncerns in a richer, more consistent, robust and flexible way.},

abstract = {Finding relevant information in a hyperspace has been a much studied problem for many years. With the emergence of so called Web 2.0 technologies we have seen the use of social systems for retrieval tasks increasing dramatically. Each system collects and exploits its own pool of community wisdom for the benefit of its users. In this paper we suggest a form of retrieval which exploits the pools of wisdom of multiple social technologies, specifically social search and social navigation. The paper details the added user benefits of merging several sources of social wisdom. We present details of the ASSIST engine developed to integrate social support mechanisms for the users of information repositories. The goal of this paper is to present the main features of the integrated community-based personalization engine that we have developed in order to improve retrieval in the hyperspace of information resources. It also reports the results of an empirical study of this technology.},

We found that readers exhibit a high degree of overlap in the passages they annotate, that these passages account for a small but significant fraction of the total document, and that such passages are distributed throughout a document rather than concentrated in the same few sections in each paper (e.g., the results section).

This development has led to the emergence of video search engines providing hosting, indexing and access to large, online video repositories. A key question in this new context is whether users search for media in the same way that they search for text. This paper presents a first step towards answering this question by providing novel analyses of people's linking and search behavior using a leading video search engine. Initial results show that page views in the video context deviate from the typical power-law relationships seen on the Web. However, more positively, there are clear indications that tagging and textual descriptions play a key role in making some video-pages more popular than others. This shows that many techniques based on text analysis could apply in the video context.},
