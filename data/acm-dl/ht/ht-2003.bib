abstract = {This paper describes a generic hypermedia model that is used as a framework for building context aware and mixed reality applications. It can handle different media elements, and it defines a presentation scheme that abstracts several relevant navigation concepts, including link awareness. The model specifies a base structure for the relation between spaces, either real or virtual, and supports contextual mechanisms. Additionally, it establishes a way to correlate real/virtual world objects with information present in the hypermedia graph. It also includes store/replay mechanisms that can be used to repurpose the content in new ways, including storytelling applications. The proposed model is being tested in a gaming and storytelling environment that integrates the real world, media elements and virtual 3D worlds. The paper presents the overall framework, the current implementation and evaluates its usage in the prototype application.},

It presents empirical examples of how people use collectional artefacts and organize physical material such as paper, samples, models, mock-ups, plans, etc. in the real world. Based on this material, we propose concepts for collectional actions and meta-data actions, and present prototypes combining principles from augmented reality and hypermedia to support organising and managing mixtures of digital and physical materials. The prototype of the tagging system is running on digital desks and walls utilizing Radio Frequency IDentifier (RFID) tags and tag-readers. It allows users to tag important physical materials, and have these tracked by antennas that may become pervasive in our work environments. We work with three categories of tags: simple object tags, collectional tags, and tooltags invoking operations such as grouping and linking of physical material. Our primary application domain is architecture and design, thus we discuss use of augmented collectional artefacts primarily for this domain.},

In this paper, we propose a method for observing evolution of web communities. A web community is a set of web pages created by individuals or associations with a common interest on a topic. So far, various link analysis techniques have been developed to extract web communities. We analyze evolution of web communities by comparing four Japanese web archives crawled from 1999 to 2002. Statistics of these archives and community evolution are examined, and the global behavior of evolution is described. Several metrics are introduced to measure the degree of web community evolution, such as growth rate, novelty, and stability. We developed a system for extracting detailed evolution of communities using these metrics. It allows us to understand when and how communities emerged and evolved. Some evolution examples are shown using our system.},

abstract = {Web sites today serve many different functions, such as corporate sites, search engines, e-stores, and so forth. As sites are created for different purposes, their structure and connectivity characteristics vary. However, this research argues that sites of similar role exhibit similar structural patterns, as the functionality of a site naturally induces a typical hyperlinked structure and typical connectivity patterns to and from the rest of the Web. Thus, the functionality of Web sites is reflected in a set of structural and connectivity-based features that form a typical signature. In this paper, we automatically categorize sites into eight distinct functional classes, and highlight several search-engine related applications that could make immediate use of such technology. We purposely limit our categorization algorithms by tapping connectivity and structural data alone, making no use of any content analysis whatsoever. When applying two classification algorithms to a set of 202 sites of the eight defined functional categories, the algorithms correctly classified between 54.5% and 59% of the sites. On some categories, the precision of the classification exceeded 85%. An additional result of this work indicates that the structural signature can be used to detect spam rings and mirror sites, by clustering sites with almost identical signatures.},

abstract = {As an approach that applies not only to support user navigation on the Web, recommender systems have been built to assist and augment the natural social process of asking for recommendations from other people. In a typical recommender system, people provide suggestions as inputs, which the system aggregates and directs to appropriate recipients. In some cases, the primary computation is in the aggregation; in others, the value of the system lies in its ability to make good matches between the recommenders and those seeking recommendations.In this paper, we discuss the architectural and design features of WebMemex, a system that (a) provides recommended information based on the captured history of navigation from a list of people well-known to the users --- including the users themselves, (b) allows users to have access from any networked machine, (c) demands user authentication to access the repository of recommendations and (d) allows users to specify when the capture of their history should be performed.},

abstract = {Through scenarios in the popular press and technical papers in the research literature, the promise of the Semantic Web has raised a number of different expectations. These expectations can be traced to three different perspectives on the Semantic Web. The Semantic Web is portrayed as: (1) a universal library, to be readily accessed and used by humans in a variety of information use contexts; (2) the backdrop for the work of computational agents completing sophisticated activities on behalf of their human counterparts; and (3) a method for federating particular knowledge bases and databases to perform anticipated tasks for humans and their agents. Each of these perspectives has both theoretical and pragmatic entailments, and a wealth of past experiences to guide and temper our expectations. In this paper, we examine all three perspectives from rhetorical, theoretical, and pragmatic viewpoints with an eye toward possible outcomes as Semantic Web efforts move forward.},

abstract = {Generating hypermedia presentations requires processing constituent material into coherent, unified presentations. One large challenge is creating a generic process for producing hypermedia presentations from the semantics of potentially unfamiliar domains. The resulting presentations must both respect the underlying semantics and appear as coherent, plausible and, if possible, pleasant to the user. Among the related unsolved problems is the inclusion of discourse knowledge in the generation process. One potential approach is generating a discourse structure derived from generic processing of the underlying domain semantics, transforming this to a structured progression and then using this to steer the choice of hypermedia communicative devices used to convey the actual information in the resulting presentation.This paper presents the results of the first phase of the Topia project, which explored this approach. These results include an architecture for this more domain-independent processing of semantics and discourse into hypermedia presentations. We demonstrate this architecture with an implementation using Web standards and freely available technologies.},

The primary motivation for this work stems from the fact that information retrieval techniques are better suited to working on documents than individual hypertext nodes.},

Paths have long been recognized as an effective medium for aggregating and communicating information and have been included in various hypermedia systems as alternate metaphors or supporting tools. The Walden's Paths project promotes path-centric traversal as the primary browsing mechanism over Web-based materials. This paper expands the notion of our paths to include more generalized structures and interconnections across paths. We present an architecture for describing complex networks of such paths. Finally, we discuss the design and present a prototype implementation of the Path Engine, a tool that provides a linear interface for browsing intricately interconnected paths.},

Our active browsing web visualization tool generates an evolving series of navigable metadocument snapshots over time. The granularity of browsing is shifted, from documents to the finer grained information elements, which are metadocument constituents. The program conducts expression-directed automatic retrieval of information from the web. It performs procedural visual composition of the information elements to form spatial hypertext. The user can express interest and design intentions through direct manipulation interactions with the visualized information elements. As prior versions of the tool lacked the capabilities of save and load, they were entirely process-oriented. The metadocuments existed only as transient states. This paper is an early report on our new metadocument authoring and publishing capability, and its potential uses. Saved metadocuments can be published on the web. Once published, they can serve both as static navigable metadocuments, and as the jumping off point from which the information space represented by the collected elements can continue to evolve.},

It hopes to show a convergence of the two into a working system for analysing dance in a network of people, institutions and information. The Associative Writing Framework (AWF) project seeks to explore how writers could best be supported in representing and exploring hypertextuality in a Web environment, and in producing new hypertexts which integrate or "glue together" existing Web resources (ideas, concepts, data, descriptions, experiences, claims, theories, suggestions, reports, etc.). Following the combining of the two projects we report on some initial evaluation of the AWF system by dance experts, and discuss where the relationship might lead and potential future outcomes of the collaboration.},

abstract = {Existing hypertext systems have emphasized either the navigational or spatial expression of relationships between objects. We are exploring the combination of these modes of expression in Hyper-Hitchcock, a hypervideo editor. Hyper-Hitchcock supports a form of hypervideo called "detail-on-demand video" due to its applicability to situations where viewers need to take a link to view more details on the content currently being presented. Authors of detail-on-demand video select, group, and spatially arrange video clips into linear sequences in a two-dimensional workspace. Hyper-Hitchcock uses a simple spatial parser to determine the temporal order of selected video clips. Authors add navigational links between the elements in those sequences. This combination of navigational and spatial hypertext modes of expression separates the clip sequence from the navigational structure of the hypervideo. Such a combination can be useful in cases where multiple forms of inter-object relationships must be expressed on the same content.},

By using their physical movement and location in the real world's space the players navigate in the virtual paper chase game and solve riddles on their way. The game is realized as a hypermedia document in which geo-referenced hyperlinks on a map lead to the hypermedia documents that form the riddles that are to be solved at the different physical checkpoints. Traversal of the document is carried out by physical movement/approaching of the GPS-located player achieving a spatial navigation to the checkpoints of the game. The current state of the players is tracked and monitored by the game server.

abstract = {This paper discusses a new hypermedia-based model known as IUHM (Information Unit Hypermedia Model). IUHM emerged as a result of the development of the OPALES system, a collaborative environment for exploring and indexing video archives in a digital library. A basic design requirement of OPALES is that it must permit and support the integration of new services throughout its life cycle. Thus, IUHM depends heavily upon the notions of extensibility and openness.Support for openness, extensibility and late binding of services is provided in the IUHM model by a single reflexive mechanism. This uniform mechanism is used for describing all relationships between arbitrary system entities, including services, data and metadata. The mechanism in question consists of a generic, computable hypertext structure with typed links, known as the Information Unit (IU), and is the minimal structural scheme to which all encapsulated entities comply.We describe and justify the design of the Information Unit, as well as the semantics of its four link types, namely role, type, owner, relative. We further describe the minimal kernel of the runtime layer responsible for the dynamic behaviour specified by the IUHM compliant hypertext network. We discuss the mechanisms involved in the dynamic binding of services and service composition. We illustrate these notions by real-world examples of the integration of metadata services within the OPALES system.},

abstract = {Structural computing provides techniques and tools to ease the task of developing application infrastructure; infrastructure that provides common services such as persistence, naming, distribution, navigational hypermedia, etc., over a set of application-specific or domain-specific structures. Within structural computing, "structure" refers to a combination of data together with relationships pertaining to that data. Structure servers support the specification and manipulation of structures. One important aspect of structural computing is the power and flexibility it provides application developers constructing new applications. A large part of this power is due to structural computing's ability to provide awareness services for both structure and behavior. We define this concept and describe the awareness services provided by the Themis structural computing environment. The utility of these services are demonstrated by presenting the impact they have had on the InfiniTe information integration environment. In particular, these services help to increase the efficiency and reduce the size of domain-specific applications built using structural computing technology. We conclude by discussing how these services might influence the open hypermedia field and the development of new hypermedia services.},

This approach suggests that the combination of direct manipulation with automated link annotation affords greater user control over page adaptation. In turn, this direct control better supports user focus in information discovery tasks. Unlike adaptive-only systems, our approach lets users both define multiple topics of interest and then manipulate how these topics' associated links are presented in a page. We discuss how the approach can be applied both to pages viewed as well as to the user's history list, thereby relieving users from the task of either adding to or organizing bookmarks. We describe the prototype developed to support these manipulations, as well as the adaptive architecture developed to support these controls.},

abstract = {Analogy-based estimation has, over the last 15 years, and particularly over the last 7 years, emerged as a promising approach with comparable accuracy to, or better than, algorithmic methods in some studies. In addition, it is potentially easier to understand and apply; these two important factors can contribute to the successful adoption of estimation methods within Web development companies. We believe therefore, analogy-based estimation should be examined further.This paper compares several methods of analogy-based effort estimation. In particular, it investigates the use of adaptation rules as a contributing factor to better estimation accuracy. Two datasets are used in the analysis; results show that the best predictions are obtained for the dataset that first, presents a continuous "cost" function, translated as a strong linear relationship between size and effort, and second, is more "unspoiled" in terms of outliers and collinearity. Only one of the two types of adaptation rules employed generated good predictions.},

However, it is difficult for end-users to compose new integrated tools of both existing Web applications and legacy local applications such as spreadsheets, chart tools and database. In this paper, the authors propose a new framework where end-users can wrap remote Web applications into visual components called pads, and functionally combine them together through drag &amp; drop-paste operations. The authors use, as the basis, a meme media architecture IntelligentPad that was proposed by the second author. In the IntelligentPad architecture, each visual component called a pad has slots as data I/O ports. By pasting a pad onto another pad users can integrate their functionalities. The framework presented in this paper allows users to visually create a wrapper pad for any Web application by defining HTML nodes within the Web application to work as slots. Examples of such a node include input-forms and text strings on Web pages. Users can directly manipulate both wrapped Web applications and wrapped local legacy tools on their desktop screen to define application linkages among them. Since no programming expertise is required to wrap Web applications or to functionally combine them together, end-users can build new integrated tools of both wrapped Web applications and local legacy applications.},

However, existing hypermedia-based SDEs have only limited support for the evolutionary aspects of software projects. On the other hand, commercial software configuration management systems (SCMs) have had noticeable success in helping developers manage system evolution. While researchers in the hypermedia community acknowledged the need for strong version control support in their systems, they are still far from achieving this goal. The Software Concordance (SC) project is developing a SDE to experiment with the use of versioned hypermedia services for managing software documents and their logical relationships.

In this paper, we first propose several approaches to refining the TF-IDF scheme for a target Web page by using the contents of its hyperlinked neighboring pages, and then compare the retrieval accuracy of our proposed approaches. Experimental results show that, generally, more accurate feature vectors of a target Web page can be generated in the case of utilizing the contents of its hyperlinked neighboring pages at levels up to second in the backward direction from the target page.},

As textual content of Web documents is often scarce or irrelevant and existing summarization techniques are based on it, many Web pages and websites cannot be suitably summarized. We consider the context of a Web document by the textual content of all the documents linking to it. To summarize a target Web document, a context-based summarizer has to perform a preprocessing task, during which it will be decided which pieces of information in the source documents are relevant to the content of the target. Then a context-based summarizer faces two issues: first, the selected elements may partially deal with the topic of the target, second they may be related to the target and yet not contain any clues about the content of the target.In this paper we put forward two new summarization by context algorithms. The first one uses both the content and the context of the document and the second one is based only on the elements of the context. It is shown that summaries taking into account the context are usually much more relevant than those made only from the content of the target document. Optimal conditions of the proposed algorithms with respect to the sizes of the content and the context of the document to summarize are studied.},
