abstract = {KMS is a commercial hypermedia system developed by Knowledge Systems for networks of heterogeneous workstations. It is designed to support organization-wide collaboration for a broad range of applications, such as electronic publishing, software engineering, project management, computer-aided design and on-line documentation. KMS is a successor to the ZOG system developed at Carnegie Mellon University from 1972 to 1985.A KMS database consists of screen-sized WYSIWYG workspaces called frames that contain text, graphics and image items. Single items in frames can be linked to other frames. They may also be used to invoke programs. The database can be distributed across an indefinite number of file servers and be as large as available disk space permits. Independently developed KMS databases can be linked together.The KMS user interface uses an extreme form of direct manipulation. A single browser/editor is used to traverse the database and manipulate its contents. Over 85% of the user's interaction is direct—a single point-and-click designates both object and operation. Running on Sun and Apollo workstations, KMS accesses and displays frames in less than one second, on average.This paper describes KMS and how it addresses a number of hypermedia design issues.},

abstract = {By studying the structure of written discourse and the processes by which readers acquire information from texts, we have learned a great deal about how to design texts that facilitate learning. However, recent advances in computer technology have enabled the development of new forms of text that violate standard assumptions of what texts are like. These new forms may pose serious problems for learning because they lack discourse features that readers rely on for assimilating new information. In particular, readers traditionally rely on the writer to determine the sequence of topics and to employ conventional cues that signal relationships among topics, such as relative importance or chronology. However, on-line hypertext systems present texts non-linearly, requiring readers to decide what information to read and in what order. This paper assesses the potential impact of non-linear texts on theories of discourse and on current cognitive theories of text processing. It also describes research in progress on readers' sequencing strategies in hypertext. Research on the effect of hypertext on reading will have important practical implications for designing hypertext systems that satisfy readers' needs.},

abstract = {A common feature of various recently developed information systems is the decomposition of linear document structures which are enforced by conventional print media. Instead, a network organization of information units of different forms (textual, graphical, pictorial and even auditive presentation modes may be combined) is provided. Documents organized this way are called “hypertexts”. However, two questions arise immediately when an effort is made to build information systems on the basis of this conception:
What are the “units” constituting a hypertext?What sort of links between the units will be provided?Most approaches to hypertext systems impose the task of deciding these questions on the authors of hypertexts, thus the systems are hypertext management devices (e.g. CHRISTODOULAKlS ET AL. 86, WOELK ET AL. 86). The approach taken in this paper leaves a more active role to the software by applying knowledge based techniques.The starting point is the automatic content analysis of machine-readable full-text documents which may be downloaded from a full-text data base. The analysis process results in a partitioning of the document into thematically coherent text passages, which are one kind of node of the hypertextual version of this document. Other nodes contain graphics, tables and summarizations. The content analysis is accomplished by a semantic parser, which has access to an explicit model of the discourse domain. The TOPIC-System (HAHN/REIMER 86) comprises prototypical implementations of these components. Due to the semantic modeling relations between the nodes may be formally defined in order to provide content oriented browsing facilities. The graphical retrieval system TOPOGRAPHIC (THIEL/HAMMW\"{O}HNER 87) employs an already implemented subset of them to guide users to relevant text parts.In this paper we outline a structure model for hypertexts based on partial representations of the meaning of text parts. Formal definitions of content oriented relations between such text units are given in terms of a logic specification language.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a hypertext system we are developing for the support of reasoned argumentation: the EUCLID project. We use the project to address two general problems arising with hypertext: the problems of controlling user/document interaction, and the problem of controlling the screen. We suggest that guiding users' interaction with hypertext is difficult because of the unique form of discourse that hypertext represents, and that structuring user/document interaction can be achieved through specializing to a particular type of material and designing the hypertext system to respect the particular discourse structure characteristic of that material. EUCLID's design is tuned to the structure of reasoned discourse. The problem of screen management in EUCLID is a serious one, because our presentation of complex arguments requires mapping the complex logical relations between parts of realistic arguments onto complex spatial relations between items in the display. We describe a general system we are developing which provides this high degree of control for hypertext screen management. This system represents a constraint-based approach to hypertext, in which the items from the underlying database that are to be displayed may each contribute a number of constraints on the layout; a general constraint-satisfier then computes a screen layout that simultaneously satisfies these constraints. Each time an item is to be added to or deleted from the screen, the constraint set is adjusted and the screen layout is recomputed; thus the spatial relationships on the screen provide at all times a veridical representation of the underlying relations between displayed database items. This kind of strong screen control is demanded by hypertext applications which, like ours, are fine grained: the number of nodes and links being displayed number in the hundreds.},

abstract = {Hypertext is a technology well-suited to exploring different kinds of representational problems. It can be used first as an informal mechanism to describe the attributes of objects and to capture relationships between the objects. Then hypertext structures can be constrained into a more formal representation of a domain, model, or analytic technique. A range of strategies for using hypertext can be employed to describe a problem and converge on an appropriate representation; competing representations can be informally evaluated to compare their relative expressive power.This paper discusses several applications that have used NoteCards, a hypertext idea processing system, to tackle representation problems. Examples from each problem domain have been collected using the hypertext system as the initial acquisition vehicle. Subsequent analysis using hypertext structuring tools has revealed the semantics of each problem domain enabling the development of competing representations. Abstraction of the structure and form of these representations can be used to guide system extensions. These tailored extensions support the evaluation of a representation's relative merits; the representation that has been developed in response to a particular problem can be applied to analogous problems to determine the limits of its scope.The first application described in this paper models a type of policy decision-making process; the second looks at approaches to representing the logical structure of an argument; and the third suggests some methods for capturing the structure of a political organization as an alternative to a conventional database design. The applications are discussed in terms of the issues they raise and the trade-offs they involve, how hypertext-based tools have been used to exploit the representations, and the solutions and techniques that have been developed in the process of creating each representation.},

abstract = {This paper describes the user interface strategy of Document Examiner, a delivery interface for commercial hypertext documents. Unlike many hypertext interfaces, Document Examiner does not adopt the directed graph as its fundamental user-visible navigation model. Instead it offers context evaluation and content-based searching capabilities that are based on consideration of the strategies that people use in interacting with paper documents.},

abstract = {NoteCards is a general hypermedia environment designed to help people work with ideas. Its intended users are authors, designers, and other intellectual laborers engaged in analyzing information, designing artifacts, and generally processing ideas. The system provides these users with a variety of hypermedia-based tools for collecting, representing, managing, interrelating, and communicating ideas.This paper presents the NoteCards system as a foil against which to explore some of the major limitations of the current generation of hypermedia systems. In doing so, this paper highlights seven of the major issues that must be addressed in the next generation of hypermedia systems. These seven issues are: search and query, composite nodes, virtual structures, computational engines, versioning, collaborative work, and tailorability. For each of these issues, the papers describes the limitations inherent in NoteCards and the prospects for doing improving the situation in future systems.},

abstract = {Abstraction is the means by which information can be stored and retrieved from an information structure at different levels of detail and from different perspectives. As such, abstraction mechanisms in hypertext are interesting to study and evaluate. In this paper we study the abstraction mechanisms in hypertext from a theoretical perspective. Abstractions then become various first-order logic formulae. Specifically we consider abstractions: sets, sequences, aggregations, generalizations, revisions, and information structures. Interesting results of this work are the definition of level of generality of a hypertext node, the demonstration of revision histories as a partial order, and the notion of compatible-similar nodes. Also defined in this paper is the notion of primitive hypertexts versus application hypertexts, and the usage of attributes of nodes (illustrated by the use of keywords) across various abstractions. An illustration of the concepts is given using the contexts mechanism suggested by Delisle and Schwartz [DS87].},

This paper discusses the DynamicDesign facilities that deal with the source code, sourceBrowser, and source tree builder utilities.GraphBuild is a utility used to convert C source code into a hypertext source graph, based on the program's call tree. A data dictionary is constructed for the program that contains its local and global variables.The source browser allows the user to traverse, view, and edit a source code tree. Additional facilities for understanding and maintaining the source code and its auxiliary documentation are provided by the browser.},

abstract = {Information management in large scale software engineering is a challenging problem. Hypertext systems are best suited for this purpose because of the diversity in information types that is permitted in the nodes of a hypertext. The integration of a hypertext system with software engineering tools results in a software hypertext system. We describe the design of such a system called DIF. Based on our experiences in using DIF, we recognized the need and the potential for developing a hypertext system that could utilize knowledge about its users and their software tasks and products. Such a system might then be able to act as an active participant in the software process, rather than being just a passive, albeit useful storage facility. As such, we define an Intelligent Software Hypertext System (I-SHYS1) as a software hypertext system which is knowledgeable about its environment and can use such knowledge to assist in the software process. This knowledge is partly embedded in the design of an I-SHYS (in terms of the 'agents' that I-SHYS supports) and partly defined during the use of I-SHYS (in terms of tasks that agents perform). We present a framework GOT defining and organizing this knowledge, describe potential uses of such knowledge, identify limits of our approach, and suggest methods for circumventing them.},
