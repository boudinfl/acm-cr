abstract = {When processing massive data sets, a core task is to construct synopses of the data. To be useful, a synopsis data structure should be easy to construct while also yielding good approximations of the relevant properties of the data set. A particularly useful class of synopses are sketches, i.e., those based on linear projections of the data. These are applicable in many models including various parallel, stream, and compressed sensing settings. A rich body of analytic and empirical work exists for sketching numerical data such as the frequencies of a set of entities. Our work investigates graph sketching where the graphs of interest encode the relationships between these entities. The main challenge is to capture this richer structure and build the necessary synopses with only linear measurements.In this paper we consider properties of graphs including the size of the cuts, the distances between nodes, and the prevalence of dense sub-graphs. Our main result is a sketch-based sparsifier construction: we show that \~{O}(nε-2) random linear projections of a graph on n nodes suffice to (1+ε) approximate all cut values. Similarly, we show that \~{O}(ε-2) linear projections suffice for (additively) approximating the fraction of induced sub-graphs that match a given pattern such as a small clique. Finally, for distance estimation we present sketch-based spanner constructions. In this last result the sketches are adaptive, i.e., the linear projections are performed in a small number of batches where each projection may be chosen dependent on the outcome of earlier sketches. All of the above results immediately give rise to data stream algorithms that also apply to dynamic graph streams where edges are both inserted and deleted. The non-adaptive sketches, such as those for sparsification and subgraphs, give us single-pass algorithms for distributed data streams with insertion and deletions. The adaptive sketches can be used to analyze MapReduce algorithms that use a small number of rounds.},

abstract = {We study the mergeability of data summaries. Informally speaking, mergeability requires that, given two summaries on two data sets, there is a way to merge the two summaries into a single summary on the union of the two data sets, while preserving the error and size guarantees. This property means that the summaries can be merged in a way like other algebraic operators such as sum and max, which is especially useful for computing summaries on massive distributed data. Several data summaries are trivially mergeable by construction, most notably all the sketches that are linear functions of the data sets. But some other fundamental ones like those for heavy hitters and quantiles, are not (known to be) mergeable. In this paper, we demonstrate that these summaries are indeed mergeable or can be made mergeable after appropriate modifications. Specifically, we show that for ε-approximate heavy hitters, there is a deterministic mergeable summary of size O(1/ε) for ε-approximate quantiles, there is a deterministic summary of size O(1 over ε log(εn))that has a restricted form of mergeability, and a randomized one of size O(1 over ε log 3/21 over ε) with full mergeability. We also extend our results to geometric summaries such as ε-approximations and εkernels.We also achieve two results of independent interest: (1) we provide the best known randomized streaming bound for ε-approximate quantiles that depends only on ε, of size O(1 over ε log 3/21 over ε, and (2) we demonstrate that the MG and the SpaceSaving summaries for heavy hitters are isomorphic.},

abstract = {Efficient join processing is one of the most fundamental and well-studied tasks in database research. In this work, we examine algorithms for natural join queries over many relations and describe a novel algorithm to process these queries optimally in terms of worst-case data complexity. Our result builds on recent work by Atserias, Grohe, and Marx, who gave bounds on the size of a full conjunctive query in terms of the sizes of the individual relations in the body of the query. These bounds, however, are not constructive: they rely on Shearer's entropy inequality which is information-theoretic. Thus, the previous results leave open the question of whether there exist algorithms whose running time achieve these optimal bounds. An answer to this question may be interesting to database practice, as we show in this paper that any project-join plan is polynomially slower than the optimal bound for some queries. We construct an algorithm whose running time is worst-case optimal for all natural join queries. Our result may be of independent interest, as our algorithm also yields a constructive proof of the general fractional cover bound by Atserias, Grohe, and Marx without using Shearer's inequality. In addition, we show that this bound is equivalent to a geometric inequality by Bollob\'{a}s and Thomason, one of whose special cases is the famous Loomis-Whitney inequality. Hence, our results algorithmically prove these inequalities as well. Finally, we discuss how our algorithm can be used to compute a relaxed notion of joins.},

In this paper we show that determinism of a regular expression e can be tested in linear time. The best known algorithms, based on the Glushkov automaton, require O(σ|e|) time, where σ is the number of distinct symbols in e. We further show that matching a word w against an expression e can be achieved in combined linear time O(|e|+|w|), for a wide range of deterministic regular expressions: (i) star-free (for multiple input words), (ii) bounded-occurrence, i.e., expressions in which each symbol appears a bounded number of times, and (iii) bounded plus-depth, i.e., expressions in which the nesting depth of alternating plus (union) and concatenation symbols is bounded. Our algorithms use a new structural decomposition of the parse tree of e. For matching arbitrary deterministic regular expressions we present an O(|e| + |w|log log|e|) time algorithm.},

abstract = {Computing is full of situations where two different structures must be "connected" in such a way that updates to each can be propagated to the other. This is a generalization of the classical view update problem, which has been studied for decades in the database community [11, 2, 22]; more recently, related problems have attracted considerable interest in other areas, including programming languages [42, 28, 34, 39, 4, 7, 33, 16, 1, 37, 35, 47, 49] software model transformation [43, 50, 44, 45, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 10, 51], user interfaces [38] and system configuration [36]. See [18, 17, 10, 30] for recent surveys.Among the fruits of this cross-pollination has been the development of a linguistic perspective on the problem. Rather than taking some view definition language as fixed (e.g., choosing some subset of relational algebra) and looking for tractable ways of "inverting" view definitions to propagate updates from view to source [9], we can directly design new bidirectional programming languages in which every expression defines a pair of functions mapping updates on one structure to updates on the other. Such structures are often called lenses [18].The foundational theory of lenses has been studied extensively [20, 47, 26, 32, 48, 40, 15, 31, 46, 41, 21, 27], and lens-based language designs have been developed in several domains, including strings [5, 19, 3, 36], trees [18, 28, 39, 35, 29], relations [6], graphs [23], and software models [43, 50, 44, 12, 13, 14, 24, 25, 8]. These languages share some common elements with modern functional languages---in particular, they come with very expressive type systems. In other respects, they are rather novel and surprising.This tutorial surveys recent developments in the theory of lenses and the practice of bidirectional programming languages.},

abstract = {A few years ago, Dinur and Nissim (PODS, 2003) proposed an algorithm for breaking database privacy when statistical queries are answered with a perturbation error of magnitude o(√n) for a database of size n. This negative result is very strong in the sense that it completely reconstructs Ω(n) data bits with an algorithm that is simple, uses random queries, and does not put any restriction on the perturbation other than its magnitude. Their algorithm works for a model where the database consists of bits, and the statistical queries asked by the adversary are sum queries for a subset of locations.In this paper we extend the attack to work for much more general settings in terms of the type of statistical query allowed, the database domain, and the general tradeoff between perturbation and privacy. Specifically, we prove: For queries of the type ∑in=1 φixi; where φ_{i} are i.i.d. and with a finite third moment and positive variance (this includes as a special case the sum queries of Dinur-Nissim and several subsequent extensions), we prove that the quadratic relation between the perturbation and what the adversary can reconstruct holds even for smaller perturbations, and even for a larger data domain. If φi is Gaussian, Poissonian, or bounded and of positive variance, this holds for arbitrary data domains and perturbation; for other φi this holds as long as the domain is not too large and the perturbation is not too small.A positive result showing that for a sum query the negative result mentioned above is tight. Specifically, we build a distribution on bit databases and an answering algorithm such that any adversary who wants to recover a little more than the negative result above allows, will not succeed except with negligible probability.We consider a richer class of summation queries, focusing on databases representing graphs, where each entry is an edge, and the query is a structural function of a subgraph. We show an attack that recovers a big portion of the graph edges, as long as the graph and the function satisfy certain properties.The attacking algorithms in both our negative results are straight-forward extensions of the Dinur-Nissim attack, based on asking φ-weighted queries or queries choosing a subgraph uniformly at random. The novelty of our work is in the analysis, showing that this simple attack is much more powerful than was previously known, as well as pointing to possible limits of this approach and putting forth new application domains such as graph problems (which may occur in social networks, Internet graphs, etc). These results may find applications not only for breaking privacy, but also in the positive direction, for recovering complicated structure information using inaccurate estimates about its substructures.},

In addition to this, the Pufferfish framework can also be used to study existing privacy definitions.We illustrate the benefits with several applications of this privacy framework: we use it to formalize and prove the statement that differential privacy assumes independence between records, we use it to define and study the notion of composition in a broader context than before, we show how to apply it to protect unbounded continuous attributes and aggregate information, and we show how to use it to rigorously account for prior data releases.},

In this paper we study static analysis and optimization techniques for SPARQL, which is the standard language for querying Semantic Web data. Of particular interest for us is the optionality feature in SPARQL. It is crucial in Semantic Web data management, where data sources are inherently incomplete and the user is usually interested in partial answers to queries. This feature is one of the most complicated constructors in SPARQL and also the one that makes this language depart from classical query languages such as relational conjunctive queries. We focus on the class of well-designed SPARQL queries, which has been proposed in the literature as a fragment of the language with good properties regarding query evaluation. We first propose a tree representation for SPARQL queries, called pattern trees, which captures the class of well-designed SPARQL graph patterns and which can be considered as a query execution plan. Among other results, we propose several transformation rules for pattern trees, a simple normal form, and study equivalence and containment. We also study the enumeration and counting problems for this class of queries.},

abstract = {The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recently introduced property paths in SPARQL 1.1, a query language for RDF data. Property paths allow SPARQL queries to evaluate regular expressions over graph data. However, they differ from standard regular expressions in several notable aspects. For example, they have a limited form of negation, they have numerical occurrence indicators as syntactic sugar, and their semantics on graphs is defined in a non-standard manner. We formalize the W3C semantics of property paths and investigate various query evaluation problems on graphs. More specifically, let x and y be two nodes in an edge-labeled graph and r be an expression. We study the complexities of (1) deciding whether there exists a path from x to y that matches r and (2) counting how many paths from x to y match r. Our main results show that, compared to an alternative semantics of regular expressions on graphs, the complexity of (1) and (2) under W3C semantics is significantly higher. Whereas the alternative semantics remains in polynomial time for large fragments of expressions, the W3C semantics makes problems (1) and (2) intractable almost immediately.As a side-result, we prove that the membership problem for regular expressions with numerical occurrence indicators and negation is in polynomial time.},

Given an interval x1,x2 in ℜ and an integer K≤ N, a query returns the K points in x1,x2 having the smallest scores. We want to store the dataset in a structure so that queries can be answered efficiently. In the external memory model, the state of the art is a static structure that consumes O(N/B) space, answers a query in O(logB N + K/B) time, and can be constructed in O(N + (N log N / B) log M/B (N/B)) time, where B is the size of a disk block, and M the size of memory. We present a fully-dynamic structure that retains the same space and query bounds, and can be updated in O(log2B N) amortized time per insertion and deletion. Our structure can be constructed in O((N/B) log M/B (N/B)) time.},

abstract = {In the 2D orthogonal range search problem, we want to preprocess a set of 2D points so that, given any axis-parallel query rectangle, we can report all the data points in the rectangle efficiently. This paper presents a lower bound on the query time that can be achieved by any external memory structure that stores a point at most r times, where r is a constant integer. Previous research has resolved the bound at two extremes: r = 1, and r being arbitrarily large. We, on the other hand, derive the explicit tradeoff at every specific r. A premise that lingers in existing studies is the so-called indivisibility assumption: all the information bits of a point are treated as an atom, i.e., they are always stored together in the same block. We partially remove this assumption by allowing a data structure to freely divide a point into individual bits stored in different blocks. The only assumption is that, those bits must be retrieved for reporting, as opposed to being computed -- we refer to this requirement as the weak indivisibility assumption. We also describe structures to show that our lower bound is tight up to only a small factor.},

abstract = {Database theory and database practice are typically the domain of computer scientists who adopt what may be termed an algorithmic perspective on their data. This perspective is very different than the more statistical perspective adopted by statisticians, scientific computers, machine learners, and other who work on what may be broadly termed statistical data analysis. In this article, I will address fundamental aspects of this algorithmic-statistical disconnect, with an eye to bridging the gap between these two very different approaches. A concept that lies at the heart of this disconnect is that of statistical regularization, a notion that has to do with how robust is the output of an algorithm to the noise properties of the input data. Although it is nearly completely absent from computer science, which historically has taken the input data as given and modeled algorithms discretely, regularization in one form or another is central to nearly every application domain that applies algorithms to noisy data. By using several case studies, I will illustrate, both theoretically and empirically, the nonobvious fact that approximate computation, in and of itself, can implicitly lead to statistical regularization. This and other recent work suggests that, by exploiting in a more principled way the statistical properties implicit in worst-case algorithms, one can in many cases satisfy the bicriteria of having algorithms that are scalable to very large-scale databases and that also have good inferential or predictive properties.},

abstract = {Result diversification has many important applications in databases, operations research, information retrieval, and finance. In this paper, we study and extend a particular version of result diversification, known as max-sum diversification. More specifically, we consider the setting where we are given a set of elements in a metric space and a set valuation function f defined on every subset. For any given subset S, the overall objective is a linear combination of f(S) and the sum of the distances induced by S. The goal is to find a subset S satisfying some constraints that maximizes the overall objective.This problem is first studied by Gollapudi and Sharma in [17] for modular set functions and for sets satisfying a cardinality constraint (uniform matroids). In their paper, they give a 2-approximation algorithm by reducing to an earlier result in [20]. The first part of this paper considers an extension of the modular case to the monotone submodular case, for which the algorithm in [17] no longer applies. Interestingly, we are able to maintain the same 2-approximation using a natural, but different greedy algorithm. We then further extend the problem by considering any matroid constraint and show that a natural single swap local search algorithm provides a 2-approximation in this more general setting. This extends the Nemhauser, Wolsey and Fisher approximation result [20] for the problem of submodular function maximization subject to a matroid constraint (without the distance function component).The second part of the paper focuses on dynamic updates for the modular case. Suppose we have a good initial approximate solution and then there is a single weight-perturbation either on the valuation of an element or on the distance between two elements. Given that users expect some stability in the results they see, we ask how easy is it to maintain a good approximation without significantly changing the initial set. We measure this by the number of updates, where each update is a swap of a single element in the current solution with a single element outside the current solution. We show that we can maintain an approximation ratio of 3 by just a single update if the perturbation is not too large.},

abstract = {Data is increasingly being bought and sold online, and Web-based marketplace services have emerged to facilitate these activities. However, current mechanisms for pricing data are very simple: buyers can choose only from a set of explicit views, each with a specific price. In this paper, we propose a framework for pricing data on the Internet that, given the price of a few views, allows the price of any query to be derived automatically. We call this capability "query-based pricing." We first identify two important properties that the pricing function must satisfy, called arbitrage-free and discount-free. Then, we prove that there exists a unique function that satisfies these properties and extends the seller's explicit prices to all queries. When both the views and the query are Unions of Conjunctive Queries, the complexity of computing the price is high. To ensure tractability, we restrict the explicit prices to be defined only on selection views (which is the common practice today). We give an algorithm with polynomial time data complexity for computing the price of any chain query by reducing the problem to network flow. Furthermore, we completely characterize the class of Conjunctive Queries without self-joins that have PTIME data complexity (this class is slightly larger than chain queries), and prove that pricing all other queries is NP-complete, thus establishing a dichotomy on the complexity of the pricing problem when all views are selection queries.},

abstract = {Over the past several decades, the study of conjunctive queries has occupied a central place in the theory and practice of database systems. In recent years, conjunctive queries have played a prominent role in the design and use of schema mappings for data integration and data exchange tasks. In this paper, we investigate several different aspects of conjunctive-query equivalence in the context of schema mappings and data exchange.In the first part of the paper, we introduce and study a notion of a local transformation between database instances that is based on conjunctive-query equivalence. We show that the chase procedure for GLAV mappings (that is, schema mappings specified by source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies) is a local transformation with respect to conjunctive-query equivalence. This means that the chase procedure preserves bounded conjunctive-query equivalence, that is, if two source instances are indistinguishable using conjunctive queries of a sufficiently large size, then the target instances obtained by chasing these two source instances are also indistinguishable using conjunctive queries of a given size. Moreover, we obtain polynomial bounds on the level of indistinguishability between source instances needed to guarantee indistinguishability between the target instances produced by the chase. The locality of the chase extends to schema mappings specified by a second-order tuple-generating dependency (SO tgd), but does not hold for schema mappings whose specification includes target constraints.In the second part of the paper, we take a closer look at the composition of two GLAV mappings. In particular, we break GLAV mappings into a small number of well-studied classes (including LAV and GAV), and complete the picture as to when the composition of schema mappings from these various classes can be guaranteed to be a GLAV mapping, and when they can be guaranteed to be conjunctive-query equivalent to a GLAV mapping.We also show that the following problem is decidable: given a schema mapping specified by an SO tgd and a GLAV mapping, are they conjunctive-query equivalent? In contrast, the following problem is known to be undecidable: given a schema mapping specified by an SO tgd and a GLAV mapping, are they logically equivalent?},

abstract = {A classical variant of the view-update problem is deletion propagation, where tuples from the database are deleted in order to realize a desired deletion of a tuple from the view. This operation may cause a (sometimes necessary) side effect---deletion of additional tuples from the view, besides the intentionally deleted one. The goal is to propagate deletion so as to maximize the number of tuples that remain in the view. In this paper, a view is defined by a self-join-free conjunctive query (sjf-CQ) over a schema with functional dependencies. A condition is formulated on the schema and view definition at hand, and the following dichotomy in complexity is established. If the condition is met, then deletion propagation is solvable in polynomial time by an extremely simple algorithm (very similar to the one observed by Buneman et al.). If the condition is violated, then the problem is NP-hard, and it is even hard to realize an approximation ratio that is better than some constant; moreover, deciding whether there is a side-effect-free solution is NP-complete. This result generalizes a recent result by Kimelfeld et al., who ignore functional dependencies. For the class of sjf-CQs, it also generalizes a result by Cong et al., stating that deletion propagation is in polynomial time if keys are preserved by the view.},

abstract = {An indexed sequence of strings is a data structure for storing a string sequence that supports random access, searching, range counting and analytics operations, both for exact matches and prefix search. String sequences lie at the core of column-oriented databases, log processing, and other storage and query tasks. In these applications each string can appear several times and the order of the strings in the sequence is relevant. The prefix structure of the strings is relevant as well: common prefixes are sought in strings to extract interesting features from the sequence. Moreover, space-efficiency is highly desirable as it translates directly into higher performance, since more data can fit in fast memory.We introduce and study the problem of compressed indexed sequence of strings, representing indexed sequences of strings in nearly-optimal compressed space, both in the static and dynamic settings, while preserving provably good performance for the supported operations.We present a new data structure for this problem, the Wavelet Trie, which combines the classical Patricia Trie with the Wavelet Tree, a succinct data structure for storing a compressed sequence. The resulting Wavelet Trie smoothly adapts to a sequence of strings that changes over time. It improves on the state-of-the-art compressed data structures by supporting a dynamic alphabet (i.e. the set of distinct strings) and prefix queries, both crucial requirements in the aforementioned applications, and on traditional indexes by reducing space occupancy to close to the entropy of the sequence.},

In many of these applications, such as sensor databases, location based services, face recognition, and mobile data, the location of data is imprecise. We therefore study nearest neighbor queries in a probabilistic framework in which the location of each input point and/or query point is specified as a probability density function and the goal is to return the point that minimizes the expected distance, which we refer to as the expected nearest neighbor (ENN). We present methods for computing an exact ENN or an ε-approximate ENN, for a given error parameter 0 &lt; ε 0 &lt; 1, under different distance functions. These methods build an index of near-linear size and answer ENN queries in polylogarithmic or sublinear time, depending on the underlying function. As far as we know, these are the first nontrivial methods for answering exact or ε-approximate ENN queries with provable performance guarantees.},

Annotations are typically attached to tuples and represent metadata such as probability, multiplicity, comments, or provenance. It is usually assumed that annotations are drawn from a commutative semiring. Such databases pose new challenges in query optimization, since many related fundamental tasks, such as query containment, have to be reconsidered in the presence of propagation of annotations.We axiomatize several classes of semirings for each of which containment of conjunctive queries is equivalent to existence of a particular type of homomorphism. For each of these types we also specify all semirings for which existence of a corresponding homomorphism is a sufficient (or necessary) condition for the containment. We exploit these techniques to develop new decision procedures for containment of unions of conjunctive queries and axiomatize corresponding classes of semirings. This generalizes previous approaches and allows us to improve known complexity bounds.},

In this paper we study such approximations for conjunctive queries. These queries are of special importance in databases, and we have a very good understanding of the classes that admit fast query evaluation, such as acyclic, or bounded (hyper)treewidth queries.We define approximations of a given query Q as queries from one of those classes that disagree with Q as little as possible. We mostly concentrate on approximations that are guaranteed to return correct answers. We prove that for the above classes of tractable conjunctive queries, approximations always exist, and are at most polynomial in the size of the original query. This follows from general results we establish that relate closure properties of classes of conjunctive queries to the existence of approximations. We also show that in many cases, the size of approximations is bounded by the size of the query they approximate. We establish a number of results showing how combinatorial properties of queries affect properties of their approximations, study bounds on the number of approximations, as well as the complexity of finding and identifying approximations. We also look at approximations that return all correct answers and study their properties.},

We use queries to specify multi-criteria for item selections and express compatibility constraints on items in a package, and use functions to compute the cost and usefulness of items to a user.We study recommendations of points of interest, to suggest top-k packages. We also investigate recommendations of top-k items, as a special case. In addition, when sensible suggestions cannot be found, we propose query relaxation recommendations to help users revise their selection criteria, or adjustment recommendations to guide vendors to modify their item collections.We identify several problems, to decide whether a set of packages makes a top-k recommendation, whether a rating bound is maximum for selecting top-k packages, whether we can relax the selection query to find packages that users want, and whether we can update a bounded number of items such that the users' requirements can be satisfied. We also study function problems for computing top-k packages, and counting problems to find how many packages meet the user's criteria.We establish the upper and lower bounds of these problems, all matching, for combined and data complexity. These results reveal the impact of variable sizes of packages, the presence of compatibility constraints, as well as a variety of query languages for specifying selection criteria and compatibility constraints, on the analyses of these problems.},

abstract = {In many stream monitoring situations, the data arrival rate is so high that it is not even possible to observe each element of the stream. The most common solution is to sample a small fraction of the data stream and use the sample to infer properties and estimate aggregates of the original stream. However, the quantities that need to be computed on the sampled stream are often different from the original quantities of interest and their estimation requires new algorithms. We present upper and lower bounds (often matching) for estimating frequency moments, support size, entropy, and heavy hitters of the original stream from the data observed in the sampled stream.},

abstract = {We consider the estimation of aggregates over a data stream of multidimensional axis-aligned rectangles. Rectangles are a basic primitive object in spatial databases, and efficient aggregation of rectangles is a fundamental task. The data stream model has emerged as a de facto model for processing massive databases in which the data resides in external memory or the cloud and is streamed through main memory. For a point p, let n(p) denote the sum of the weights of all rectangles in the stream that contain p. We give near-optimal solutions for basic problems, including (1) the k-th frequency moment Fk = ∑ points p|n(p)|k, (2)~the counting version of stabbing queries, which seeks an estimate of n(p) given p, and (3) identification of heavy-hitters, i.e., points p for which n(p) is large. An important special case of Fk is F0, which corresponds to the volume of the union of the rectangles. This is a celebrated problem in computational geometry known as "Klee's measure problem", and our work yields the first solution in the streaming model for dimensions greater than one.},

abstract = {We show that randomization can lead to significant improvements for a few fundamental problems in distributed tracking. Our basis is the count-tracking problem, where there are k players, each holding a counter ni that gets incremented over time, and the goal is to track an ∑-approximation of their sum n=∑ini continuously at all times, using minimum communication. While the deterministic communication complexity of the problem is θ(k/ε • log N), where N is the final value of n when the tracking finishes, we show that with randomization, the communication cost can be reduced to θ(√k/ε • log N). Our algorithm is simple and uses only O(1) space at each player, while the lower bound holds even assuming each player has infinite computing power. Then, we extend our techniques to two related distributed tracking problems: frequency-tracking and rank-tracking, and obtain similar improvements over previous deterministic algorithms. Both problems are of central importance in large data monitoring and analysis, and have been extensively studied in the literature.},

abstract = {We consider the continual count tracking problem in a distributed environment where the input is an aggregate stream that originates from k distinct sites and the updates are allowed to be non-monotonic, i.e. both increments and decrements are allowed. The goal is to continually track the count within a prescribed relative accuracy ε at the lowest possible communication cost. Specifically, we consider an adversarial setting where the input values are selected and assigned to sites by an adversary but the order is according to a random permutation or is a random i.i.d process. The input stream of values is allowed to be non-monotonic with an unknown drift -1≤μ=1 where the case μ = 1 corresponds to the special case of a monotonic stream of only non-negative updates. We show that a randomized algorithm guarantees to track the count accurately with high probability and has the expected communication cost \~{O}(min√k/(|#956;|ε), √k n/ε, n), for an input stream of length n, and establish matching lower bounds. This improves upon previously best known algorithm whose expected communication cost is Θ(min√k/ε,n]) that applies only to an important but more restrictive class of monotonic input streams, and our results are substantially more positive than the communication complexity of Ω(n) under fully adversarial input. We also show how our framework can also accommodate other types of random input streams, including fractional Brownian motion that has been widely used to model temporal long-range dependencies observed in many natural phenomena. Last but not least, we show how our non-monotonic counter can be applied to track the second frequency moment and to a Bayesian linear regression problem.},
