abstract = {Many results in relational database theory on the structure of dependencies, query languages, and databases in general have now been established. However, neither (a) the reliance of these results on various assumptions, nor (b) the desirability or reasonableness of these assumptions themselves have been closely examined. These assumptions are nontrivial: examples include the universal relation assumption and the lossless join assumption.The purpose of the present paper is to clarify many of the existing assumptions, and point out weaknesses. This is desirable both to harden the statements of previous results, and to evaluate recent suggestions that certain assumptions (such as the acyclic JD assumption) may be useful for modeling "real world" databases. Specifically, studies are made of assumptions made for (1) universal relations, (2) functional dependency inference, and (3) decomposition theory. We show that:• Some assumptions (such as uniqueness of relationships among attributes) can be more powerful than they appear;• common treatment of FDs is sometimes inappropriate, and for example FD inferences such as {A → B, B → C} |= A → C can be incorrect;• the 'decomposition' approach to design may be hard to justify in real terms; and• Acyclic JDs may have drawbacks in eliminating ambiguity in queries and in modeling real enterprises.It is hoped that this exposition will help clarify some confusing issues in this field, and will lead to a better understanding of which assumptions are reasonable and useful in modeling the "real world".},

First, we shall taxonomize the varieties of ideas that are sometimes called the "universal relation assumption." Then, we consider some of the arguments pro and con. In some cases, the arguments against were expressed prematurely, and solutions to the problems they expose have since been found. In other cases, the arguments against are simply fallacious. In still other cases, the problems pointed out are real, but simply serve to point out that the advantages of the universal relation are not gotten for free. We shall conclude the paper with a description of the algorithm used to interpret queries in System/U, and the reasoning behind it.},

We also exhibit a relationship between the process of Graham reduction [6] of hypergraphs and the process of tableau reduction [1] that holds only for acyclic hypergraphs.},

In this paper we examine query processing implications of the partitioning; other areas impacted include dependency theory, schema design and graph theory.We consider a class of queries that compute the join of all relations in the database projected onto a prescribed set of attributes. We show that solving such queries (using the join, project and semijoin operators) is tantamount to creating an "embedded" tree schema which we call a tree projection. This lends further credibility to the pivotal nature of the tree/cyclic partitioning.Using the tree projection concept we analyze the problem of determining how many joins are needed to solve a query.},

It does not require transaction logs, synchronized clocks, or other complicated mechanisms for its operation. It achieves consistency contraints which are considerably weaker than serial consistency but nonetheless are adequate for many dictionary applications such as electronic appointment calendars and mail systems. The degree of consistency achieved depends on the particular history of operation of the system in a way that is intuitive and easily understood. The algorithm implements a "best effort" approximation to full serial consistency, relative to whatever internode communication has successfully taken place, so the semantics are fully specified even under partial failure of the system. Both the correctness of the algorithm and the utility of such weak semantics depend heavily on special properties of the dictionary operations.},

abstract = {In many large database applications there are certain elements mostly containing aggregate information, which are very frequently referred to (read and modified) by many transactions. If access to such fields has to obey to conventional two-phase lock protocols (1,2), transactions will be serialized in front of these "hot spots", i.e. the degree of parallelism is reduced. To avoid this kind of lock contention some improved lock protocols have been proposed, the most interesting of which is the one implemented in IMS Fast Path (3,4), where add and subtract may be performed concurrently on numerical fields, since backout is always possible with the unique inverse of each operand. A similar scheme is proposed in (10). We expand this idea to parallel readers and writers on numerical data types, proving that under certain conditions the result of such concurrent operations is consistent in the sense that it is equal to some serial schedule (2,5).},

It considers three formalisms for expressing queries in this model: extended relational algebra, tableaux, and DAPLEX. It shows that, as in the original algebra, the equivalence problem for conjunctive expressions in the extended algebra can be solved using tableaux, and is NP-complete. Finally, it demonstrates that the extended algebra and DAPLEX have essentially the same expressiveness relative to conjunctive expressions.},

Presently, a broader class of data base applications like office information systems is considered where this restriction is not convenient. Therefore, an extension of the relational model is proposed consisting of Non First Normal Form (NF2) relations. The relational algebra is enriched mainly by so called nest and unnest operations which transform between NF2 relations and the usual ones. We state some properties of these operations and some rules which occur in combination with the operations of the usual relational algebra. Since we propose to use the NF2 model also for the internal data model these rules are important not only for theoretical reasons but also for a practical implementation.},

We give two algorithms for translating a relational query to a network application program. The first algorithm is confined to relational queries that express selections and projections over the universal relation scheme. The second algorithm includes all relational queries over select, project and (natural) join. Optimization techniques are discussed for both types of translation.},

We show that the problem of containment (and hence those of equivalence and non-minimality) is in NP when either (a) there are no functional dependencies or (b) the set of dependencies is what we call key-based. These results assume that infinite databases are allowed. If only finite databases are allowed, new containments may arise, as we illustrate by an example. We also prove a "compactness" theorem that shows that no such examples can exist for case (b).},

abstract = {Inclusion dependencies, or INDs (which can say, for example, that every manager is an employee) are studied, including their interaction with functional dependencies, or FDs. A simple complete axiomatization for INDs is presented, and the decision problem for INDs is shown to be PSPACE-complete. (The decision problem for INDs is the problem of determining whether or not Σ logically implies σ, given a set Σ of INDs and a single IND σ). It is shown that finite implication (implication over databases with a finite number of tuples) is the same as unrestricted implications for INDs, although finite implication and unrestricted implication are distinct for FDs and INDs taken together. It is shown that, although there are simple complete axiomatizations for FDs alone and for INDs alone, there is no complete axiomatization for FDs and INDs taken together, in which every rule is k-ary for some fixed k (and in particular, there is no finite complete axiomatization.) This is true whether we consider finite implication or unrestricted implication, and is true even if no relation scheme has more than three attributes. The nonexistence of a k-ary complete axiomatization for FDs and INDs taken together is proven by giving a condition which is necessary and sufficient in general for the existence of a k-ary complete axiomatization.},

abstract = {Two notions of dependency satisfaction, consistency and completeness, are introduced. Consistency is the natural generalization of weak satisfaction and seems appropriate when only equality-generating dependencies are given, but disagrees with the standard notion in the presence of tuple-generating dependencies. Completeness is based on the intuitive semantics of tuple-generating dependencies but appears unnatural for equality-generating dependencies. It is argued that neither approach is the correct one, but rather that they correspond to different policies on constraint enforcement, and each one is appropriate in different circumstances. Consistency and completeness of a state are characterized in terms of the tableau associated with the state and in terms of logical properties of a set of first-order sentences associated with the state. A close relation between the problems of testing for consistency and completeness and of testing implication of dependencies is established. The possibility of formalizing dependency satisfaction without using a universal relation scheme is examined.},

abstract = {Research on concurrency control mechanisms for database systems has had as a primary goal the discovery of techniques for allowing increased levels of concurrent execution of transactions. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of non-two-phase locking protocols which are defined for data bases in which a directed acyclic graph structure is superimposed on the data items. We introduce a new lock mode, called INV, with properties fundamentally different from locking modes previously studied and show how this allows increased concurrency. Through the introduction of the INV mode of locking we have enunciated a new principle of the theory of data base concurrency control. This principle involves the separation of the effects of the commutativity and compatibility of data manipulation operations. We then examine how the introduction of such a lock mode affects the occurrence of deadlocks in a system. Certain conditions under which deadlock-freedom is maintained are identified, and simple methods for removing deadlocks in other situations are presented.},

We define two classes of serializable executions, and for each class we discuss two problems: recognition and scheduling. It is shown that the results for the recognition and online scheduling problems for the sequential model generalize to the parallel model. But it is argued that online scheduling is not suitable for a parallel execution environment. Therefore, batch schedulers are defined and a minimal set of precedence constraints is derived. Finally, it is shown that any optimal batch scheduler that uses syntactic information alone cannot be efficient.},
