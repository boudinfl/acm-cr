abstract = {Interaction designers have developed a number of techniques that are commonly used to nudge users, for example, to click on ads, stay on a site, keep playing a game and come back for more. In addition, a proliferation of books and guidelines have been published that explain how to change users' behaviour through designing persuasive interventions at the interface. Many of these are intended to be for personal improvement or social good, such as to help people get fitter, improve their work productivity, be more motivated, reduce energy consumption and so on. However, the same techniques can also be used for more nefarious ends. Sometimes, referred to as dark patterns, they have become essentially tricks that websites and apps use to make users do things they didn't intend doing, such as buying or signing up for something. At the same time, a backlash against interaction design is beginning to appear; criticizing us for our role in the rise in digital addiction, fake news, social media abuse, etc. Are we to blame for letting the genie out of the bottle?One response has been to change direction. For example, B.J. Fogg, who set up the much acclaimed Persuasive Tech Lab, has now renamed it as the Behavior Design Lab. Instead of persuading or nudging, the new agenda is to find ways of helping people take control of their lives again. For example, acknowledging that people have become compulsively glued to their phones, apps are now popping up intended to help them overcome their addictions, such as reducing screen time. But is it too little and too late? More generally, should HCI become more responsible for the new interaction techniques it develops, and prescriptive advice it offers, and, if so, how?},

abstract = {Wine is an experience. It engages all of our senses. Before we even taste wine we hold the bottle, admire the label, listen to it being poured in the glass, assess the colour and texture of the wine, swirl it around the glass, smell it and finally taste it. However, human pleasure in the experience can be designed to go far beyond the value of simply drinking the wine. What about the journey the wine has taken to reach you? Who made it, and why? Who else is drinking it now? Why does it taste the way it does?The social, cultural and scientific aspects of wine making, marketing and drinking offer opportunities for designers and HCI researchers to enhance the user experience of wine. This workshop offers academics and practitioners interested in designing wine futures, to chance to envision new experiences, products and services. Through participative design activities we will explore ways for design and technology to push our knowledge and craft into this unexplored applied research area.},

With the ongoing investments of state and private companies in space exploration, these interactions and their design are becoming increasingly crucial for the unfolding of our futures on and beyond the globe. Yet outside the Earth, our relations with technologies necessitate situational adjustments, requiring a range of adaptive strategies designed to negotiate the extreme extra-terrestrial. While the domain of human-computer-interaction adopted methods from spaceflight -- the NASA Task Load Index (TLX), for example, in this workshop we especially consider ways in which the setting of outer space provides a testing ground for new forms of designing and performing human-computer interactions. Through a range of examples, we will explore the nuances emerging amidst exchanges between humans, technologies and space environments, and address them from a range of different research perspectives.},

abstract = {This study examines the possible services a social robot can provide in a hotel room. This area of research falls under the relatively unexplored domain of social robot services. This paper proposes and tests the proactive services rendered by a soliloquising social robot that has three core functions: responding to a customer's request, soliloquising about the hotel service, and proactively expressing goodwill (e.g. greetings and farewells), according to the context. We expect that, through its proactive interaction (in this case, soliloquising and expressing goodwill), a soliloquising social robot can become an essential room companion for customers. Rather than being a mere tool, the soliloquising robot can relieve a customer's feeling of loneliness and provide him or her some interpersonal warmth. However, the proactive social robot may appear to be intrusive. Thus, a field experiment was conducted at a hotel on the expectations and risks associated with using such a robot. The results reveal that although social robots can make potential room companions in hotels, it is necessary to resolve a few issues to enable them gain wider acceptance.},

We use program theory to illuminate how participatory design works and how it may be understood as more than a collection of methods or a matter of configuring user participation. Program theory operates by formulating the causal relations between the planned inputs, the process and the effects in terms of output, outcome and impact. While participatory design might appear similar to co-design or user-centered design on the level of design activities, PD differs in terms of the mechanisms employed and how effects and their sustainment are conceived. Looking at participatory design through the lens of program theory highlights how particular mechanisms work towards not only the designed product but also towards generating gains and lasting effects for participants.},

abstract = {Studies show that people find meanings such as freedom and independence in driving. However, the transition towards electric vehicles (EV's) challenges these meanings as they present different driving experiences such as shorter driving range and missing supportive infrastructures. This suggests that people find other meaning in EV driving. This paper presents a qualitative study with 11 Danish participants who reflect on their experiences of driving EV's in everyday life. As driving is embedded in many practices along with being a practice in itself, we draw on social practice theory as a framework to unfold how participants make use of technology to make EV driving a meaningful and desirable practice. We report on how participants facilitate their driving practices using interactive technology and charging infrastructure. We discuss these findings under three headings with ideas to inspire future HCI research and design for meaningful, sustainable EV driving practice.},

abstract = {Food security is a global concern, but achieving it faces no shortage of challenges. With the world continuing to urbanise, traditional forms of agriculture are diminishing, driving exploration into alternatives methods of food production. Urban farming is becoming a growing phenomenon with individuals investing in methods, such as WindowFarms, Aquafarms and vertical farms as a means of supplementing their food supply. Applications of alternative growing methods have centred on domestic settings or localised communities, and limited research has explored urban farming methods used in workplaces. This paper presents the findings of four alternative food growing applications within a workplace, to explore the viability of future implementations within similar workplace contexts. The findings from this study can be used to better understand the sociotechnical challenges of growing food in unique urban environments, presenting opportunities for urban farming to occur in a variety of settings that are not limited to domestic applications.},

abstract = {The recent failure of several much-hyped companion robots raises questions about the ability of robot design to foster long-term engagement and attachment, and the consumer receptiveness to this application of technology. To better understand where the limitations lie in designing robots as companions, we explore the the psychosocial role of 'cute' embodiment in human-robot interaction (HRI), and in particular its capacity encourage meaningful relationships. To do so, we apply the Emotionally Durable Design framework to recently failed companion robots, assessing how elements of the cute robot design could support or discourage sustained emotional investment from a human user. We find that, although the companion robots studied have the potential to meet much of the Emotionally Durable Design framework, the execution of their social and assistive features did not support natural or easy interactions, and that their material embodiment does not allow for unique customisation or growth. More tellingly, we highlight that the usefulness of companion robots in everyday life is, as yet, unclear. We conclude by suggesting a multi-disciplinary, design-led approach to companion robots in order to develop emotionally durable and meaningful relationships in HRI.},

In this paper, we contribute to current discussions by describing a participatory study situated within the "child-led nature-play contexts" of nine children (7-11 years). By adapting the role of "least-adult" originally described in the childhood studies literature, we describe how this role can be established to access these exclusive play places and maintained through co-inquiry into each child's unique play practice. This research contributes to current discussions of child participation in CCI by (i) introducing the role of least-adult as an approach to engaging with children through participatory research, (ii) recognising the influence of place in shaping child participation, and (iii) pointing to spatial-temporal contextual factors as an important factor for enabling and shaping participatory research.},

abstract = {When workspaces for commercial music production are digitized they are generally configured based on existing analogue music production environments, using the "channel strip" metaphor to organize the multiplicity of devices involved in the process. The channel strip metaphor is derived from the traditional design of mixing consoles with parallel sliders acting as separate channels. An alternative to this is the "stage" metaphor, which visually represents sound elements as discrete actors on a stage for manipulating settings. To study cross-device interactions in music mixing, we designed the Spatial Mixer, an app that uses the stage metaphor, to work in concert with Ableton Live, an existing music composition program. A study of Spatial Mixer in use showed that the stage metaphor and spatial visualizations of music tracks and effects was intuitive for users to interact with and helped them work across both pieces of software to effectively create their musical composition.},

abstract = {Weightlifting is easy to learn, but difficult to master. People who do weightlifting do it to improve their health, strengthen their muscles and build their physique. However, due to the complex and precise body positioning required, even experienced weightlifters require assistance in perfecting their technique. At the same time, the training requirements of the individual change over time, as they perfect and hone their craft. To help weightlifters achieve optimum personal performance, we designed Weight-Mate, a prototype wearable system for giving weightlifters of different skill levels personalized, precise and non-distracting immediate feedback on how to correct their current body positioning during deadlift training. By iterating Weight-Mate using cooperative usability testing (CUT) with weightlifters of different competencies with their coaches we designed a system that could adapt to individual physiology and training needs. The Weight-Mate sensor suit maps the lifter's body configuration against the ideal deadlift position throughout all stages of the life, as defined by their coach, and provides non-intrusive feedback to the lifter to correct their body position. Our formative evaluation with ten weightlifters shows that an adaptive approach to digital weight training offers great promise in assisting weight lifters of all levels to improve their technique, and hence improve the safety of the sport.},

In this work, we conducted seven co-design workshops with six adolescents with ASD over eight months. The team exchanged ideas and communicated through group discussion and drawings. Our findings suggest that: (1) parents, community group and fellow participants play a pivotal role in supporting a longitudinal ASD co-design study and (2) adolescents with ASD are also able to make better design decision over an iterative software design process. These findings should to be considered when engaging adolescents with ASD as co-designers in a software design process.},

There is also a lack of actionable guidance on designing and using probes. This lack may have contributed to some concerns that the method has been misinterpreted and misunderstood. We reviewed HCI literature surrounding probes and found one of the few papers that offers a nascent framework for probe design and use. We used it to guide the design of a collection of probes and reflected on the framework's usefulness. We extend this framework by offering a more useful way of visualizing and working with probe design properties. We also provide further clarity and advice on how others may think and approach the design and use of probes more effectively, especially those turning to probes for the first time.},

Yet the scale of undergraduate class sizes and limited teaching resources makes the incorporation of traditional studio-based learning challenging. This paper details our deployment of the Design Jam (DJ); a single-day pedagogical exercise for introducing design thinking to two undergraduate classes of &gt;175 computer science undergraduates. Based on thematic analysis of 77 reflective essays and an online survey, we find evidence that the DJ helped to legitimise the design thinking process, engaged students with designerly activities and fostered transferable skills which were later applied to coursework. Yet difficulties emerged with peer learning between DJ attendees and non-attendees. The paper offers suggestions to prospective DJ facilitators for how the DJ may be leveraged as a means of legitimising design thinking and motivating student engagement and learning among non-designers.

abstract = {Accurately eliciting long-term procedural knowledge continues to be a non-trivial challenge. In this project, we continued an exploration into a novel approach that provides users with virtual stimuli during the elicitation process. Specifically, users were placed into a virtual reality (VR) environment, representing a real-world location, and asked to role-play a familiar task while verbally describing each action they were simulating. This approach has previously shown promise when compared with context-devoid methods, but no research has yet considered whether the detail of the provided virtual stimuli may meaningfully affect recall performance.To explore this possibility, two virtual environments with identical spatial characteristics and object placement were developed. One of these environments had high visual detail while the other had minimal visual detail. An A/B lab-based study was then conducted, in which 30 participants were assigned to each of the two environments (N=60). The results of this study showed that, despite major visual differences between the two environments, both treatment groups described a similar amount of information. Practically, this suggests that even minimally detailed environments may be sufficient to provide appropriate context to users for effective memory recall in an elicitation setting.},

abstract = {From ageing to education, from tourism to shopping, many systems and applications have been proposed that aim to free users from the nuisance of depending on others. In this paper, we problematise independence and argue that when closely scrutinised, the purported aim to independence of many works in the literature appears to be a proxy for a broad range of related values, including agency, dignity, autonomy, freedom of choice, and participation. We unpack and reflect on the tensions and trade-offs that come with the quest for independent life. We explore these issues through two case studies: one on democratising IoT design for older adults; the other on digitally enabling person-centred approaches with people with intellectual disability. We propose that many design and research initiatives would be better served by a focus on the interdependent network of social relations, from family to friends, and the broader community, and on Relational Technologies capable of supporting a fulfilling participation in those networks.},

abstract = {Australia has a rich array of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander languages, but they face decline along with many valued aspects of culture unless they are passed down to, and used by, younger generations. Prior work on designing technologies for language learning has often taken particular language skills, learning theories, and technologies as their starting point. Our empirical work with a remote Aboriginal community illustrates four ways in which this community's language practices intersect with family relations and are deeply enmeshed with family histories and stories, Indigenous Knowledges, and activities on and about country. Thus, we argue for a relational approach that instead takes family communication and social activities as the basis for designing technologies that foster everyday language use. We outline the guiding principles of this design orientation, and illustrate how they have been taken up in the co-design of a talking soft toy called the 'Crocodile Language Friend.' Finally, we identify opportunities and open issues in taking a relational approach to designing technologies for language communities with similar needs and aspirations.},

abstract = {Making often involves creating, repurposing, handiwork and shared knowledge. Making is beneficial to its participants, with craft groups for older adults becoming more popular. In order to engage with older makers and explore their approach to ageing through their making, we created yarn probes: a method of enquiry to gain rich insight into a person's lived experience by building on their passions, creativity, the reflective and tactile nature of crafting, and storytelling. The yarn probes method involves eliciting stories and insights from participants as they craft artifacts in yarn and reflect on their making practices. We reflect on the use of yarn probes with three participants from two making communities, over a period of 2 months. Yarn probes led to a nuanced understanding of the experience of ageing through making, the ways in which it supports health (meditative, healing, remaining active), participation (altruism, teaching, social interaction, learning) and security (family, sharing, home). We discuss three considerations that make yarn probes effective in generating design insight: the meaning that materials and artifacts hold, opportunities for active engagement and reflection through the making of an artifact, and dialogue between makers and HCI researchers.},

Despite these advancements, we have found that adults with severe intellectual disabilities and their families still face many challenges when learning about and using traditional AAC technologies. The majority of adult individuals with severe disabilities in our study have prior experiences with using various AAC devices, yet a high rate of abandonment is noted. Under such circumstances and in order to support more effective design and increased use of AAC, it is important to look beyond the interaction with dedicated AAC devices, and gain a better understanding of AAC use, practices and care support. In a six-month study that comprised participating in speech therapy sessions and working together with families, support workers and adults with severe disabilities, we lay out the foundations for a design framework that needs to consider a) current AAC cultural status b) modelling of AAC use c) creation of AAC user-friendly environments and d) personalization of AAC dedicated devices and the potential for AAC tangible (mid-tech) alternatives. We conclude with implications for design.},

However, spatial politics compromise diverse inclusion in these benefits by rendering women invisible when the wireless technologies used by CNs are designed, deployed and referred to in discussions about regulation. I support this claim by drawing together insights from multiple case research of rural CNs in India, Indonesia, Argentina Mexico, South Africa and Uganda, and my engagement with activists advocating for CNs. The spatial politics shaping debates about spectrum regulation, and the wireless technologies to which they apply, are at different scales than women in rural villages experience. Gendered spatial politics perform orthogonally across all scales and dimensions to constrain women's proximal access to WiFi, capacity to learn about and undertake technical tasks and involvement in decisions about CNs; however, advocacy for CNs works across vast geographies.},

Technology has often been found to be a contributing factor to heightened engagement in learning activities, including for people with intellectual disability. This research proposes to build on these two opportunities by exploring the potential of social robots to elicit social interaction, cooperation and engagement among groups of adults with intellectual disability. The study presented here involved observation, semi structured interviews and video analysis of six participants with intellectual disability interacting with a social robot in a series of five weekly workshops. The robot used for this study was Cozmo ©, a small AI toy robot with a vehicular appearance and movement, and animated eyes that it uses to display human emotions. Participants played games with Cozmo and took turns in controlling its movements in small groups. Through an inductive thematic analysis we identified themes of collaboration, competition, positive affect and attitudes of participants as well as the factors that affected their engagement with Cozmo. We detail characteristic behaviours within each theme. The study found that interacting with Cozmo resulted in positive affect, high engagement and collaboration. The aspects of Cozmo that had the most positive impact were the ability to play games with it and its humanlike relatable behaviour.},

abstract = {There is a high demand for physical rehabilitation therapies: More than 475,000 Australian citizens are living with the effects of stroke and are engaged in physical therapies. Developing effective physical rehabilitation programs for these individuals is important both for their health outcomes and for the medical field. Virtual Reality (VR) technologies provide opportunities for improvements in this area. One of the opportunities is to create motivational rehabilitation processes for patients' persistence with their therapies. Using the theoretical framework of Self Determination Theory, this paper reports results from an experimental study (N=60) that tested a motivational design principle (i.e., functional and aesthetic customisation) on participants' player experiences in a VR game. The VR game has simple mechanics that share similarities with a type of upper body rehabilitation exercise; which has been validated as effective for the optimal restoration of scapular muscle imbalances. Findings from the study showed that customisation has a positive effect on players' experiences of autonomy need satisfaction and enjoyment in the VR game setting. These findings have implications that aid designers when designing motivational VR physical rehabilitation applications.},

Through an interview study, we investigate how various archives systematically inform design work and govern the way design processes are represented and reflected upon. The study provides insights into an abundance of tools used to access, record, store and share information. We highlight the difference between personal, shared, and public archives, different archival barriers for sharing, how prototypes act as (an)archival conduits of design potentials, and how information (and people) tend to get lost in the archives. Finally, we discuss how a design archival approach might help identify power relations in design while also facilitating a move from 'dead' to 'living' archives in design work.},

The results indicate that mobile platforms hold a multitude of opportunities related to making Namibian government services more efficient and approachable.

abstract = {Knee arthroscopy is a very common elective surgery, which is performed globally. Research has stated that there are currently several issues surrounding this surgery which reveal surgeons are frustrated with their instruments, cause unintended damage, and have high levels of cognitive and physical demands. The aim of this research is to explore in greater detail what is actually occurring during surgery and gain insights from the knee surgeons to illuminate the current frailties entangled with knee arthroscopy. This research consists of a field study observing four consultant orthopaedic knee surgeons performing knee arthroscopies, of which a total of 15 surgeries were video-recorded. Cards were created based on the analysis of the videos, which were then used to prompt further reflection in interviews with two of the four knee surgeons. From this study we endeavour to explore how knee surgeons currently employ instruments during knee surgery and the challenges that they experience. Our findings focus on a surgeon's perspective on the following challenges: (1) instrument limitations, (2) limited visibility, and (3) physical and cognitive pressures. Based on these limitations, we explore how current robotic surgical platforms could be introduced as a first step towards designing surgical robots for knee arthroscopy, that will result in more desirable patient outcomes as well as greater satisfaction for the knee surgeons.},

To address this, traditional interaction concepts are being extended. While Peripheral Interaction was previously introduced, it still remains as a rather broad concept, intersecting with others, and thus creating space for further definitions. Therefore, this paper introduces the concept of Reflexive Interaction, which can be viewed as a specific manifestation of Peripheral Interaction. In contrast, Reflexive Interaction is envisioned to be executed at a secondary task without involving substantial cognitive effort. It allows the user to perform very short interactions, shorter than Microinteractions, without straining the user's main interaction channels occupied with the primary task. To clearly classify Reflexive Interaction in respect to previous interaction concepts, we use a taxonomy relying on an attention-based HCI model.},

A number of strategies, such as distraction and focus shifting, are commonly used in medical practice to help paediatric patients manage their anxiety. In recent years, Virtual Reality (VR) has been investigated as a promising tool in hospital settings, particularly through mediating distraction. In this paper, we present the findings from a focus group with four clinicians and attempt to explore key elements inherent in their practice that can be leveraged for designing impactful VR applications for managing periprocedural anxiety in paediatric hospitals. Our contribution is a set of insights relevant to patients, their needs, tailoring of strategies, and future design directions. We benchmark three existing VR applications against our findings to generate potential design opportunities for VR applications.},

The second prototype represents the information with position, height, and color of bar graphs around the video. The system can solve a problem in previous systems, which were unable to display an important area in a frame of a video and can be useful for video creators or analyzers to estimate and analyze viewers' responses to a video. Additionally, we conducted an experiment to verify the effectiveness of the system. The results demonstrate that the fixation areas that the system calculated from the eye-tracking generally overlapped with the subjective reported attention points. However, the subjective arousal values varied slightly from the estimated arousal values from the SC data.},

This paper explores how well mental models of the general public align with the standing definitions of AR from an academic perspective. We also seek to understand whether individual experience with augmented reality technologies, or self-rated willingness to adopt new technologies, correlate with the accuracy of an individual's understanding of AR. A pilot survey asking participants to describe augmented reality revealed a variety of mental models, some of which aligned with academically defined characteristics of AR. The accuracy of the responses decreased in participants with no hands-on AR experience, and willingness to adopt new technology proved to have little to no influence on response accuracy. This paper presents some initial trends in public perceptions of augmented reality technologies, but also highlights the need for more research to establish a better understanding of mental models of AR.},

abstract = {Developing countries may have strong indigenous cultural practices that are not accommodated by western education and its associated technologies. This study investigated university students' perspectives of Learning Management Systems (LMS) when the interface design considers the culture of its intended users. An LMS prototype was designed incorporating rich media into a learning module with cultural elements of Papua New Guinea (PNG), namely local language option, cultural icons and cultural motifs into a learning user interface. A user study was conducted on university students from PNG, Pacific Islands and other nations with English as a second language (EASL) evaluated the prototype. The findings suggested a strong preference for an appreciation of the cultural components of the interface.},

Together, the creators tried out all of these IoT design methods and located them on a design process model. A visual analysis of this landscaping exercise reveals large discrepancies between the application area the original creators of each IoT design method had in mind, and the understanding of most other experts. We subsequently argue that the design research community can benefit from collaborative approaches towards understanding each other's methods. We conclude that the design research community can benefit from more appropriate mappings when choosing the most appropriate IoT design method for a particular task within a specific context.},

In the bounded swipe, which extends the commonly used swipe action, the start and end points are inside a target. To test the feasibility of this gesture, we first investigated whether a bounded swipe is ever performed accidentally when a user swipes normally on a target; in 99.2% of swipes performed, the end point of the swipe was outside the target. Under the bounded swipe, the success rate was 96.7%. Therefore, the bounded swipe is a touch gesture that does not conflict with the conventional swipe.},

Although GameFlow has been used as a basis for many surveys, no formal operationalisation has been proposed or validated. This raises the question of whether the development of a GameFlow measure is a worthwhile endeavour. In this paper, we report findings of a study in which GameFlow was used as an evaluation tool for an online strategy game, in conjunction with player experience measures. Expert reviews, using the GameFlow criteria, were conducted by 12 stakeholders (developers, players, researchers, and journalists) in the game Neptune's Pride 2: Triton. Player experience surveys, incorporating the Flow State Scale and Player Experience of Need Satisfaction, were also completed by 351 players. We reflect on the interaction, conceptual constructs, and value of each instrument, and where future development of the GameFlow model should focus.},

abstract = {Maintenance work, executed by mechanics, electricians, welders and other tradespeople, is imperative for industrial equipment to operate as planned. To ensure high standards of work and safety, maintainers are required to comply with procedures that specify how tasks should be executed. In the past these procedures were paper-based but they are increasingly available digitally in the field on tablets and other devices. Maintainers work in variable and often challenging environmental contexts. The same work can be done inside a shop or in the field, day or night, cramped or open conditions. Often there is just one version of a procedure although one maintainer may have 30 years experience and another only 3 years. Additionally, maintainers themselves have individual differences resulting in different aptitudes for technology. Therefore, maintenance procedures are a suitable use-case for Adaptive User Interfaces (AUI). In this paper, we define six high-level requirements for an AUI for maintenance procedures and discuss opportunities for future research, particularly in the space of multi-target AUIs. This work is in its preliminary stages and could benefit from early discussion with the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community.},

To exchange electronic information using e-mail or social network services a sender needs to know the recipient's contact information. However, if the recipient is a newly-encountered person or an ad hoc partner, a significant number of them are reluctant to exchange contact details. To address this issue, we propose an interaction method for transferring electronic information by tearing a sheet of paper. This is an approach that utilizes the fact that when a piece of paper is torn into two pieces, the features of the torn edges of the two pieces match.},

This is especially true in Japanese culture, given that the importance of not expressing emotions openly, and respecting other people's privacy creates personal distance. However, communication plays an important role in maintaining familial relationships and ascertaining family members' health by sharing daily life information. In this paper, we design "Buzz-Buzz Chat," an asynchronous communication system that encourages children and their parents to communicate about the children's cooking by using multiple-agent chats. Through a case study on a university student and his mother using Buzz-Buzz Chat, we find a novel method of remote communication with less burden, combining asynchronous dialogue about meals triggered by sharing cooking activities with dialogue about daily life and family in short intervals.},

This paper examines whether this intensified access to recorded music has afforded new ways of shaping emotion. We studied the practices of international university students, a cohort who face significant stresses and make significant use of digital technology. We found that students actively and routinely use music streaming services to manage their emotional responses to the challenges of studying abroad.},

We also report a strong relationship between the sentiment of a tweet and its appropriateness to appear in public media. Our analysis on worker responses further reveals several key factors that affect the judgement of crowd moderators when deciding on the suitability of text content. Our findings contribute towards the development of future robust moderation systems that utilise crowdsourcing.},

To answer this question, we systematically reviewed 232 HCI research articles on trust in automation and AVs to identify a) key aspects of contemporary trust research theories and methodologies, and b) what dimensions of trust are in need of further investigation in relation to UX perspectives on trust. Based on the review, we discuss methodological implications of focusing on the experience of trust in future research.},

Most individuals can benefit from a social robot when they interact with it over multiple sessions or a prolonged period. However, this can run well beyond the initial novelty period with a robot, signifying a challenging area for sustainable long-term user interest and engagement. Gamification is a key domain that holds promise to overcome uptake and retention concerns. Grounded in gamification theory in combination with the 'Computers As Social Actors' (CASA) paradigm, this paper presents a set of guidelines for recommended practice on creating and implementing social robot interactions for long-term human-robot interactions.},

However, SNS use can also have detrimental effects, exposing queer people to harm and victimisation. To date, there is not much effort in HCI to understand the experiences of queer people with SNS.

abstract = {This short paper explores the role of technology in improving tensioned relationships between older adults and park managers in residential retirement parks and villages. In Australia, residential retirement parks and villages are gated communities complete with demountable homes and community recreational facilities. Typically, a park manager oversees the maintenance and general liveability of the village, however issues about residents' agency and wellbeing often arises. Consequently, residents blame park managers for poor practices resulting in a simplistic 'us versus them' dichotomy. An opportunity arose to work with these older adults to co-design solutions to mitigate these tensions. Our co-design project revealed that residents do not feel they have control or agency over their lifestyle choices in residential villages, thus leading to undesirable experiences and tensioned relationships. Further, while residents prefer to communicate openly and efficiently with their park managers to resolve maintenance and dispute resolution issues promptly, this direct line of communication is rarely accommodated. In response, the introduction of technology is explored to augment the means of improving the relationships between residents and managers in residential parks and villages.},

abstract = {This paper describes the creation of a set of dementia friendly instruction cards for participants engaged in a technology research project. The cards were designed to provide support after the research project was completed, so that participants could maintain continued and independent use of the technologies left with them. A literature review of guidelines for creating text, instructions and graphics for people with dementia is almost nonexistent. The iterative process of designing and refining easy to understand instructions, given both a lack of guidelines and the significant cognitive challenges presented by dementia, is described. We conclude that the creation of the cards themselves, and the insights we discovered in creating them are of significant value to assisting people in the uptake of technology. With clear, colourful, easily accessible and visually stimulating instructions, these cards act as a bridge between the technologies and their use, greatly enhancing the ability to support people with dementia in technology use.},

abstract = {Existing approaches to human-robot collaboration typically focus on how to build robots that can work safely and fluently with humans on collaborative tasks. Less is known about how people interpret the boundary between movement-based collaboration and non-collaboration when interacting with robots. By applying a microsociological theory to analysing the process of interaction as it unfolds, we propose and identify points of breakdown in the collaborative task of a human and a robot carrying an object to a destination. In designing the experiment, Kinetography Laban is used to enable a precise description of the intended normative and disruptive motion paths of the robot. The contribution of the paper is the theoretical understanding of collaboration from sociology, and a method for designing and evaluating collaborative motion between humans and robots that combines microsociology and Kinetography Laban. The proposed method accounts for the contingent meaning construction performed by people in recognising behavioural motion cues of robots as part of an ongoing interaction process, and enables the boundary between collaborative and non-collaborative robot motion to be defined.},

Yet 2D image segmentation is used to distinguish some parts of the volume and make them more understandable. Many studies have proposed haptic feedbacks to find organs inside the body, but it is not easy to feel the shape of the part with using those devices. We realised that better results can be achieved via devices with more than one-point feedback. We describe a method that makes a user feel the shape in the same way we perceive the shape of an object in a dark room with the help of our tactile sense. Hence modern haptic devices such as "HaptX" and "Manus VR" gloves help us to imagine organ shapes by controlling the amount of forces on each fingertip. Another method is also proposed that guides a user to select intended parts of a volume, which is a fast manual segmentation tool but in an immersive VR or AR environment with a much more convenient interface.},

abstract = {Trust in automation is an essential precursor to system adoption and use. Given the emerging wave of autonomous systems available for public consumption and the resources devoted to this trend, it's important to understand trust, and how to measure it. Further, the level of performance demonstrated by a system can affect trust in that system. As such, proper design of an autonomous system can be facilitated by measuring trust in such systems. Rather than relying only on traditional methods of measuring trust, such as pen and paper, or behavioural markers, this work extends previous research by investigating psycho-physiological markers for trust, using Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) and machine learning. We induced high vs. low trust states in amateur unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) operators, and manipulated the automation level of the UAV. We collected workload and trust ratings during and after flying a UAV. Despite moderate results with traditional metrics (NASA TLX, and the System Trust Scale), we were able to classify trust states based on the GSR data with 80% accuracy. This research forms part of our ongoing work on developing a model for the relation between automation, and user trust and cognitive load.},

The online tool was developed through an iterative user-centred design process to ensure that it supported the needs and goals of academics. However, findings from a semester-long evaluation study showed that it found relatively little uptake despite participants' positive feedback in post-study interviews. This prompted us to conduct a further analysis of our results, which revealed that our process had failed to capture some of the more nuanced factors emerging from the users' work environment relating to time and timing. Drawing on those insights, the paper highlights the need to capture temporal factors during the design process and offers three design considerations to better support the adoption of online tools into daily work practices.},

abstract = {Players are sometimes understood to hold an 'amoral' stance in games, morally disengaging from game content and in-game player behaviours because 'it's just a game'. This amorality is often seen as problematic and in need of refuting or amendment, particularly if we wish to encourage more ethical play online. However, few studies have approached a theory of player amorality from the player's perspective in multiplayer games. This study aims to address this gap by conducting 20 in-depth interviews with a wide range of multiplayer game-players, exploring players' ethical views towards problematic or disruptive in-game behaviours. Preliminary results show that while players do exhibit a certain amorality regarding in-game actions, players express, justify and explain this amorality in a variety of considered ways that go beyond notions of 'it's just a game' and the 'sociopathic griefer', and step outside the framework of moral disengagement. This paper puts forward a preliminary framework of player amorality termed 'Apathetic Villager Theory', encapsulated by six key attitudes/themes that highlight the nuances involved in the (un)ethical standpoints of a range of players. It is hoped that this framework will be useful in approaching and responding to player amorality in a way that gives due recognition of the various voices and understandings involved in multiplayer digital gameplay.},

abstract = {Future human computing research could be enriched by enabling the computer to recognize emotional states from observers' physiological activities. In this paper, observers' electrodermal activities (EDA) are analyzed to recognize 7 emotional categories while watching total of 80 emotional videos. Twenty participants participated as observers and 16 features were extracted from each video's respective EDA signal after a few processing steps. Mean analysis shows that a few emotions are significantly different from each other, but not all of them. Our generated arousal model on this dataset with these participants using their EDA responses also differs a little from the abstract models proposed in the literature. Finally, leave-one-observer-out approach and neural network classifier were employed to measure the performance, and the classifier reaches up to 94.8% correctness at the seven-class problem. The high accuracy inspires the potential of this system to use in future for recognizing emotions from observers' physiology in human computer interaction settings. Our generation of an arousal model for a specific setting has potential for investigating potential bias in dataset selection via measuring participant responses to that dataset.},

abstract = {It is not widely known that visual illusions that cause misrecognition with regard to the perception of length or width of figures affect human behavior. Thus, we investigate the influence of the Delboeuf illusion on pointing performance in this study. If the control circle of the Delboeuf illusion, which is the central circle of the Delboeuf illusion figure, is surrounded by a slightly larger circle, it is perceived to be larger than its actual size. On the contrary, if the control circle is surrounded by a much larger circle, it is perceived to be smaller than its actual size. Therefore, the Delboeuf illusion figure affects the perception of circle sizes and can also affect the movement time of pointing movements. The result indicates that there is no significant difference in the movement time and the error rate among three tasks---two tasks with the Delboeuf illusion and the other task without the Delboeuf illusion. Moreover, Fitts' law showed sufficient fits for all conditions. From these results, it can be said that the participants conducted the trials with the Delboeuf illusion as same as the trial without the Delboeuf illusion. This is because the participants saw the circles of the Delboeuf illusion at once in the questionnaire, but they saw the circles one by one during the trials so the illusion magnitude was difference between trials and a questionnaire.},

While the visible public technologies within them commonly consist of public interactive displays and media fa\c{c}ades, personal technologies, such as smartphones and wearables, have also proliferated. The rise of personal technology usage in particular has caused society to shift towards a new paradigm of hyperconnectedness, where people are constantly connected to the internet through their personal devices. Considering this, the role of digital urban interventions (DUI) and their relevance to citizens in hyperconnected societies has become questionable. In this paper, we reflect on traditional forms of DUIs and discuss how they fit into a hyperconnected society, exploring challenges and opportunities. The primary aim of this work is to contribute a roadmap for urban HCI, highlighting the key topics that should see more focus moving forward.},

abstract = {For childcare service providers and parenting welfare agencies understanding user-experiences of services, and quantifying the magnitude of their impact on promoting children's health and wellbeing across the life course is increasingly important. The current surveying systems for capturing user feedback primarily enable measuring outcomes against pre-built metrics or tracking goals around business profit. There is a need for greater flexibility in generation and evaluation of child-focused data that facilitates drilling down to more granular information. To address this challenge, we partnered with parenting research industry representatives to codesign and develop an innovative social evaluation platform. PRISE is an easy-to-use, flexible and aesthetically pleasing system, specifically designed to support the capture and reporting of childcare data and parenting experiences from diverse communities. We present the PRISE prototype and highlight unique features including parent-child demographic illustrations, granular access permissions and dedicated security features. Finally, we propose caring-through-data and continuous quality improvement as analytical-lens for future research and development with parenting industry partners.},

abstract = {As we move firmly into the digital age, navigation through cyberspace has become an increasingly ubiquitous form of human-computer interaction. Whether the application we use is geospatial, flight simulation, virtual reality, augmented reality, simulation or game; we rely on sophisticated computation to paint data into views we can understand. 3D images and video with moving perspectives allow rapid navigation and assimilation of information. However, despite all the sophistication of modern technology, we have inadvertently programmed random cracks into cyberspace leading to positional jitter. Positional jitter can present as: random motion, rendering errors, physics errors and imprecise interaction. This unintended numerical error, and its mitigation, has been a focus of research and development over that past 2 decades. A review of mitigation methods has revealed differences in the quality, complexity and performance of implementations and some ad-hoc approaches to designing for sufficient quality. To help move research and development towards a consensus solution, this paper reviews and evaluates different approaches. New metrics to estimate error and quality are presented. A simple and efficient method to minimising positional jitter, that will benefit scientific and engineering calculations sensitive to error and achieve the best performance and quality for general applications, is recommended.},

abstract = {Robots are starting to share our social space and will continue to do so in the future. These interactive devices have the capability of facilitating various interaction modalities which could go beyond voice and screen based interactions. When developing interaction technologies, theories such as psychobiological and media compensation suggest to replicate natural ways of human interactions such as face to face. As a result, it is vital to study how people interpret robot's physical appearance and actions. According to previous studies, designing acceptable humanoid robots is far more challenging than designing robots with less human qualities. This paper emphasizes the importance of human non-verbal communication in emotional interactions and analyzes how people use full body expression to communicate basic emotions, in particular happiness, surprise, and anger. Furthermore, this paper presents a list of emotion specific movement behaviors that can be used and applied to better design forms and movements for both humanoid or non-humanoid robots.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR)-based wheelchair simulators have been used for rehabilitation and training, since a VR-based approach is more feasible than constructing physical courses for wheelchairs. However, existing VR-based wheelchair simulators have difficulty providing both visual and motion feedback at low cost. To address this issue, we propose a VR-based wheelchair simulator using a combination of motions attainable by an electric-powered wheelchair and vection-inducing movies displayed on a head-mounted display. This approach enables the user to have a richer simulation experience, because the scenes of the movie change as if the wheelchair performs motions that are not actually performable. Also, this system can be implemented only consumer products so as to keep cost low. We developed a proof of concept and conducted precise evaluation tasks, confirming that our approach can provide a richer experience for barrier simulations.},

Assembling and repairing such an enormous variety of components means that workers are cognitively challenged, take longer to search for the relevant information and are prone to making mistakes. Although in recent years deep learning approaches to object recognition have seen rapid advances, the combined potential of deep learning and augmented reality in the industrial domain remains relatively under explored. In this paper we introduce AR-ProMO, a combined hardware/software solution that provides a generalizable assistance system for identifying mistakes during product assembly and repair.},

abstract = {In the rehabilitation of burns patients, remedial exercises are an important part of maintaining and regaining range-of-motion. To encourage patient rehabilitation and reduce discomfort, this paper presents the preliminary stages of a project which makes use of both vision based sensors and virtual reality technologies to create an immersive environment. The goal of our research is to design and develop effective vague gesture control. Hand gesture detection may lack clarity/resolution or otherwise be vague due to various reasons including patients' difficulty to enact gestures fully due to injuries, interference with the visual detection of gestures due to bandages, and the difficulty that vision based sensors have detecting small details like fingers at range. Extra environmental and situational information can enhance gesture recognition and provide better gestural classification. To achieve this, temporal machine learning is used to develop an application which uses past environmental interactions to help clarify present vague gestures. A gesture recognition system that can handle imperfect gestures in an intuitive way contributes towards naturalistic computer human interactions, in particular for gamified burns rehabilitation systems.},

Because by touch typing users can keep looking at the screen, they can concentrate on what the screen shows and edit text. However, learning touch typing is difficult because it requires the memorization of all key placements. In this paper, we propose a passive haptics based learning support method for touch typing. Because the user is given a stimulus to the finger to be used for the next keystroke, our method encourages users to keep looking at the screen, helping them memorize all key placements. To investigate the effect of using our method, we conducted a pilot study with the users typing English phrases. As a result, our method has a possibility that the users can take less time to acquire touch typing.},

Lithium Hindsight 360 (LH360) is a virtual reality prototype intended to help bipolar disorder patients envision an alternative way of communicating their illness narrative to other individuals. Dance and somatic movement are used instead of text as a communication method to help non-patients understand the physical experience of having a mental illness. The creation process for the prototype will then lead to a set of design guidelines for patients interested in creating their own movement-based VR illness narrative. These guidelines are intended to help simplify a potentially complex and expensive process. In this demonstration, participants will be able to both view the prototype and walkthrough part of the design process.},

However, initiatives that are more citizen-centric have difficulties contending with the prevalent technology-driven discourse. From a design perspective, this points towards a delicate balance between an approach that is critical enough to resist assimilation yet constructive enough to have a sustainable impact. This paper aims to explore and articulate this balance through the discussion of shanzhai, a Chinese phenomenon on the fringe of the global market economy. More particularly, we highlight three qualities of shanzhai by linking these to the case study of a smart bicycle lock, followed by a discussion in terms of their agonistic qualities. These three qualities of shanzhai, the marginalised people it caters, its hybrid aesthetic and its position in the market, could inform a design practice that critically yet constructively engages with technology in the context of smart cities.},

abstract = {New interaction modalities in human computer interaction often explore common sensory inputs including touch, voice, gesture or motion. However, these modalities are not inclusive of the entire population type, and cannot be utilized by a group of people who suffer from any limitation of that sensory input. Here we propose BreathIn: an interface tool for enabling interaction with computer applications by using discreet exhalation patterns. The intent is that such patterns can be issued by anyone who can breathe. Our concept is based on detecting a user's forced exhalation patterns in a time duration using a MEMS microphone placed below the user's nose. We breakdown the signal into FFT components and identify peak frequencies for forced voluntary "breath events" and use that in real-time to distinguish between "exhalation events" and noise. We show two major applications of such an interaction tool: a) adaptation of computer applications using breath, b) using the breath interface as a discreet, emergency signal for prospective victims of crime.},

abstract = {This paper presents an input method to expand one-handed touch input vocabulary for smartphones using the index finger. To this end, our method combines thumb-based touch input and postures or gestures of the index finger on and above back-of-device. These postures and gestures are detected by three-dimensional directions or movements of the index finger. To enable this detection, users wear a ring-like device on the index finger. Moreover, our method includes a one-handed use detection system. Using this system, our method provides common input vocabulary for two-handed use and expands input vocabulary for one-handed use.},

abstract = {This paper presents research on the potential application of Tangible and Augmented Reality (AR) technology to computer science education and the teaching of programming in tertiary settings. An approach to an AR-supported debugging-teaching prototype is outlined, focusing on the design of an AR workspace that uses physical markers to interact with content (code). We describe a prototype which has been designed to actively scaffold the student's development of the two primary abilities necessary for effective debugging: (1) the ability to read not just the code syntax, but to understand the overall program structure behind the code; and (2) the ability to independently recall and apply the new knowledge to produce new, working code structures.},

abstract = {While digital tools are more and more used in classrooms, teachers' common practice remains to use photocopied paper documents to share and collect learning exercises from their students. With the Tangible e-Ink Paper (TIP) system, we aim to explore the use of tangible manipulatives interacting with paper sheets as a bridge between digital and paper traces of learning. Featuring an e-Ink display, a paper-based localisation system and a wireless connection, TIPs are envisioned to be used as a versatile tool across various curriculum activities. In this paper, we present the design principles of TIPs and a first functional prototype. We conclude by presenting future works in the evaluation of TIPs as a distributed sensor for teachers in their classroom, including learning scenario examples to illustrate our statements.},

abstract = {Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for post-natal depression (PND), a depressive disorder experienced in the post-partum period. Virtual reality (VR) has never been used for the treatment of PND. This pilot study investigated the feasibility of combining CBT and VR for the treatment of PND. It tests the entire treatment protocol, including the VR system. The results show that the combination of CBT and VR is feasible. The study identifies limitations and technical difficulties. It provides recommendations for the better implementation of VR within the treatment protocol based on the participants' feedback.},
