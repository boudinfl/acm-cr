abstract = {A growing body of HCI research explores designs to support rehabilitation after stroke. While rehabilitation is a major part of a stroke survivor's recovery, it is not the only part that could benefit from HCI work. This paper aims to provide a rich understanding of the work required by stroke survivors and their caregivers when they leave hospital and transition back to the home environment. We conducted a thematic analysis of 318 posts in an Australian online community. The findings highlight the breadth of work on top of rehabilitation and other efforts to manage the impact of their stroke. The outcome of stroke can affect everyday life work, from household chores to transportation to managing relationships. Stroke survivors also engage in biographical work in an attempt to reconstruct their personal narrative. Based on these findings we discuss opportunities for design: managing fatigue, intimate relationships, reflection, and forming a narrative. We hope that these opportunities will encourage HCI work to support people with chronic conditions in their transition back home.},

abstract = {Passwords still represent an annoying burden for millions of Internet users. Helping people create memorable and secure credentials is therefore an important goal for web-service providers to satisfy user needs. Due to the good memorability of pictures, emojis may be a suitable tool to create memorable and secure passwords. These small pictograms have seen an enormous rise in recent years, but their usage in regular passwords has not been explored for the Web. In a two-part user study with 40 participants we investigated if and how emojis are suitable in this context. We asked users to create passwords that contained both regular alphanumeric characters and emojis. The study shows that users' primary selection strategy was to create meaningful relationships between the emoji and the rest of the password. We also found that platform dependent renderings of emojis do not necessarily reduce usability, if the object represented by the emoji is distinctive enough. As websites are already starting to allow emojis in passwords, it is important to evaluate this step carefully. Our results can inform this decision and provide pointers to the usability implications.},

abstract = {Increasingly people use mobile phones many times daily. This makes the phone's lockscreen almost ambient, part of everyday life. This work explores how to use that valuable ambience of the lock-screen to help people maintain awareness of, and to track an important goal, such as improving nutrition. We describe the design of FIT, a lockscreen app for ultra-lite logging of vegetable serves consumed each day. Our 4-week field study of FIT, with 19 young adults indicates it is quick and easy to use. The 973 log events took an average of 1.03 seconds, compared with 0.72 seconds for the 25,530 unlocks. The study demonstrated that most people found FIT to be an ambient reminder to eat vegetables and track intake. Our contributions are the definition of lock-screen ambience and the design and evaluation of FIT, an app that harnesses lockscreen ambience to raise awareness of, and support ultra-lite logging of, an important nutrition goal.},

abstract = {A growing body of research is exploring the benefits of using digital media to engage people with difficulties due to ageing, including dementia. A simple, tablet-based game was developed with inputs from over 440 stakeholders including occupational therapists, doctors, geriatric psychiatrists and seniors in Singapore. In order to produce effective game concepts, the design team explored domain experts' fundamental definitions of dementia and how to promote well-being, and also discussed and brainstormed ideas with the geriatric care specialist team. The developed prototype, Piece by Piece, is a game that was crafted to offer a light cognitive challenge through non-competitive, difficulty-adjusted tangram-style puzzles, and promotes well-being through nostalgic content that inspires reminiscence. The voices of our users, both healthy seniors as well as seniors with dementia, along with our observations, led us to implement design decisions that resulted in a more seamless, intuitive gameplay experience. We believe that our experiences in developing the game hold insights for other designers looking to build more inclusive applications to support people with physical/cognitive disabilities, using today's ubiquitous interactive devices, such as tablets and smartphones.},

abstract = {Basic human needs are a valuable source for creating meaningful products. Hence, designing for a positive User Experience requires an extensive understanding of those. Instead of just analysing abstract data, designers should also gather implicit information based on their own perception to gain holistic insights on the users' emotional perspectives. Inevitably there exists an influence of the designers' individual perspective on the accumulated insights during user research activities. However, if the designers are aware of their own and multiple other perspectives on needs, there is a good chance that they value relevant observations in user research.The NEEDS PROFILE (NP) is an approach to sensitise for diverse human needs and their characteristics. As designers often tend to find basic needs abstract, the NP enables them to explore basic needs as vivid personifications and encourages them to engage in a creative and playful manner first. Then these insights are confronted in guided discussions in order to enable sustainable learning. Evaluation results are positive, but further investigation needs to be done on long-term effects.},

Grounding on foundations of small-group collaboration, open learner modelling and brainstorming at large interactive displays, we designed a set of models from behavioural data that can be visually presented to students. We validated the effectiveness of our dashboard in provoking group reflection by addressing two questions: (1) What do group members gain from studying measures of egalitarian contribution? and (2) What do group members gain from modelling how they sparked ideas off each other? We report on outcomes from a study with higher education students performing brainstorming. We present evidence from i) descriptive quantitative usage patterns; and ii) qualitative experiential descriptions reported by the students. We conclude the paper with a discussion that can be useful for the community in the design of collective reflection systems.},

The study used a sample of Saudi Arabian users to also understand the role of their culture in this process. The findings of the study indicate that senders were selective about presenting themselves and forming positive impressions but very religious users were less selective. As receivers, the important criteria used to form an impression about senders was the extent to which the senders' online behaviours were in line with Saudi social norms. These findings suggest that the study participants did not totally challenge their social norms when searching for a future spouse through an MS. With regards to the channel, the study participants thought the MS was effective for finding a spouse, supporting the argument that within a gender-segregated society an online setting would carry more information than a face-to-face setting.},

abstract = {1Using a mixture of physical gestures and one's smartphone is a convenient way for people to engage and interact with large displays in public. Yet, one of the challenges of cross-device interactions is to design techniques that encourage participation. This paper presents a study of people using four different cross-device interaction techniques in a public setting, to identify how both users and observers feel about the device actions and bodily gestures required to interact with a large display using smartphones. We collected both direct feedback and observational data of users' and observers' attitudes and reactions to using these techniques in public. We identified five key factors influencing people's experience of interacting while being observed by others: Familiarity, Social Acceptability, Purpose, Easiness and Playfulness. We argue that it is important to consider observer attitudes when designing cross-device interactions for large displays in public, to encourage the participation of passers-by.},

Through a within-subjects study, and using subjective measurements, we found that participants enjoyed seeing their heart rate feedback when experiencing VR environments. From the different types of heart-rate representations, audio-haptic feedback was the most preferred while visual feedback was reported as being distracting.

In this paper, we present an online game that helps quantifying the perception of password strength. Players score points by rating the strength of passwords accurately under time pressure. We analyzed the usage logs from the first four months after rollout. We found that users underestimate passphrases by 1.4 points on a 5-point strength scale, while their other ratings are fairly consistent with our estimates. Although we used a different methodology, we were able to corroborate related findings and narrow down the features that users think contribute to password strength. We highlight how the data collected through PASDJO can help designing better password feedback and boost user experience during account creation.},

We present a case study of one of the workshops, the Community Garden, designed in the format of a hackathon. We report on how teachers adopted the workshop concept, appropriated the technologies and, more interestingly, how six months later they appropriated the design process as a pedagogy to engage students in their learning.},

Digital approaches to food customisation are starting to emerge, however, the majority is currently limited to the ingredient level thus excluding consumption drivers such as people's practices and values around food. Using the approach of cultural probes, we identified four distinct narratives around bread consumption: the healthy bread, the fresh bread, the ethical bread, and the exceptional bread. These themes encapsulate drivers of bread consumption, which we argue can inform the design of digital food innovation platforms.},

Nowadays, applications increasingly become various and complex, they aim at multiple, heterogeneous and dynamic contexts of use examined according three facets: the end-users of the interactive system, the platform with which users have to perform their interactive tasks and the physical environment where they are interacting Nevertheless, users no longer wish to adapt themselves to this heterogeneity of the interaction situations; they yet want their systems to be adapted. Thus, with regard to the requirements to which the multiplicity of technologies is added, providing User Interfaces (UIs) with adaptation capabilities is becoming more and more an important issue. We address these issues by proposing a Model-Driven Engineering approach for semi-automatic generation of context-dependent UIs based on a Business Rules Management System (BRMS) as an adaptation engine. Our approach is supported by a conceptual framework and a graphical tool for modeling context situations, editing adaptation rules and launching the adaptation process.},

abstract = {Many projects seek to engage urban dwellers to learn about local birds. However, many of these projects require some background knowledge that can be difficult to obtain independently. Our project explores how to make engaging with and learning about local birds easier. To do this, we designed and developed BirdSound, a device that engages people to record nature sounds and learn to identify bird species by sight and sound. We conducted contextual interviews with six people living in an urban environment, who were curious but not experienced in birdwatching. These interviews aided in attaining present frame of knowledge held by each participant. Then, we explored how these participants interacted with BirdSound in their homes. BirdSound sparked participants to recount experiences with the device, social interactions and knowledge of birds. BirdSound use required intense focus, and we can envisage more ambient approaches that also support more social forms of learning.},

While most platforms defer judgment and separate it from the idea generation phase, we hypothesized that asking participants to rate ideas in the idea generation phase, the increased exposure to other people's ideas would serve as a source of inspiration and motivation and would therefore be preferred to a separate feedback phase.In an explorative study with 26 participants we found that preference on immediate versus deferred judgment of ideas very much diverged. The results of our study suggest that participants that feel already motivated and able are distracted by the integration of feedback, while to others it is highly beneficial in terms of facilitating their idea generation and motivating them further.},

abstract = {This paper1 presents a study in which a mobile visual calendar application, `MyCalendar' was used to try to support communication and interaction of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder. This paper reports findings on how the App was used in school classrooms. MyCalendar was evaluated with 11 children in an Australian Autism Special Education Unit over six months and was found to stimulate excitement with video and photo sharing as well as interaction in specific classroom activities. Our previous work examined interactions between home and school, and interactions at home supported by MyCalendar. This analysis focuses entirely on interactions at school by examining data from classroom activities. Three findings revealed: (1) the MyCalendar application supports learning activities in the classroom and facilitates the inclusion of children with ASD who have limited verbal skills. The sharing of each child's personal experience enabled the teachers and children to form a common basis for communication and adding vocabulary, as well as allowing the teacher to model language so as to identify children's emotions; (2) MyCalendar allowed children with limited verbal skills to better communicate their real interests through photos and videos. This enabled the teacher to better identify each child's interest and thereby scaffold more relevant and meaningful learning; (3) Understanding interests enabled teachers to successfully motivate children to interact more in formal learning activities. While it was initially expected the activities would better support communication between teacher and children, the larger and unanticipated effect has been to create opportunities for structuring and scaffolding communication and social interaction in the classroom.},

Multiplayer games are particularly promising, since they add a social (competitive or collaborative) component. However, exercising together can become frustrating if users have vastly different abilities. In this paper, we review existing approaches for balancing differing physical abilities of players in competitive exergames, and based on this, we propose a novel exertion-based balancing formula. In contrast to previous work, we evaluate exertion-based balancing formulas with a moderately complex gameplay and show that it results in closer competitive gameplay and a more enjoyable game experience. The proposed formula can be applied to a wide variety of exergames and has the potential to increase compliance and long-term use of exergames.},

abstract = {Virtual Avatars can bring opportunities for enjoyment, social participation and exploration of identities. However, the configuration of avatar creation software may marginalise some groups of users due to them reinforcing social stereotypes that privilege youth and beauty, rather than representing the broader variety of human identities. Older adults are one group who may be disadvantaged with respect to avatars as avatar studies have typically focused on younger users. Considering that older populations are growing and that their participation in virtual environments is increasing, it is timely to investigate older adults' preferences in relation to avatars. We conducted a study with 23 participants (70+ years old) to understand the representational requirements of older adults when creating a humanoid virtual avatar. Our findings demonstrate that older adults are negotiating ageing stereotypes when creating a virtual body. These negotiations of body appearances range from: the Actual Avatar that by mirroring the self suggests an acceptance of the ageing body; the Vibrant Avatar that is idealising the physical condition of the self; the Other Avatar, that aims to explore other identities; and the Companion Avatar that creates another persona as company. These findings highlight that older adults have specific representational requirements when designing virtual avatars.},

abstract = {Situated technologies have become a common feature in the 21st century city, ranging from small-scale temporary interventions to permanent embedded large-scale media displays. At the same time, the increasing pervasiveness of social media and web platforms has fostered a culture of digital self-representation in the form of `selfies' as a means of sharing thoughts, emotions and opinions. In this paper, we examine how the selfie culture can be appropriated to encourage more creative, open and participatory approaches for engaging communities through situated technologies. We first review examples of social, spatial and technical aspects of community interactions with situated technologies, such as digital art installations, situated self-representations for sharing with others and social interactions with situated technologies. We then present observations from four field studies in which combinations of urban screens and tablet devices were used for community engagement. Based on an analysis of our observations we outline strategies for using self-representation in interactive urban applications to amplify and encourage engagement with situated technologies in cities.},

A new penalty function is proposed to change the orientation of each leader line in the penalty elements and a modified search space method is integrated to improve the quality of labelling layout. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the labelling layout optimized by different penalty functions under different experiment conditions and the comparison of experimental results between different penalty functions shows that the proposed method represents the best results in terms of avoiding occlusion and efficiency to get the optimal layout.},

Strive continuously collects physiological data and uses haptic feedback to provide real-time assistance during runs. As communicating technique-related information in the dynamic and complex context of a run is challenging, we present two studies. The first study investigates how runners adapt to two different vibration patterns; and the second study explores the temporality of the assistance through three different approaches: Continuous, periodical, and self-serviced.

However, its ability to improve wellbeing in people without pre-existing mental health conditions is less well understood. To explore use in this population, an 8-week long user trial of a CCBT programme was conducted. Results provided insight into CCBT's ability to; increase subjective wellbeing; increase empathy for individuals who do experience mental health conditions; enhance self-reflection; increase positive behaviour change; and increase motivation to action. In lieu of perpetually creating new health technologies, we suggest a design approach which explores the extension and repurposing of existing evidence-based technologies to support and enhance the wellbeing of previously unintended populations.

However, getting people to change behavior when it comes to energy consumption is difficult. This is one of the major challenges ahead for future energy systems, in particular if resources are renewable and plentiful. We developed the ClockCast prototypes (web and clock forecast) to explore demand response and the flexibility potential of everyday practices. We wanted to reframe the conversation on demand response: from highlighting when not to use energy to highlighting when to use it. The ClockCast prototypes display the best times to use electricity, and they were complemented by proactive and positive suggestions. We conducted a pilot study with five different households to uncover the socio-technical challenges around shifting consumption and the participants' experiences with the prototypes. While the participants increased their awareness of the environmental implications of their actions, shifted some electricity use, and found the forecasts useful, some participants also reported newfound guilt when they did not follow the forecasts.},

This research utilizes a mix-methods approach to examine gender differences in one of the most popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, League of Legends (LoL). The results show that gender stereotypes affect the in-game character design, players' perception of abilities, and social convention in LoL, which makes the gender differences of in-game character choice and playing style more obvious.

As part of the framework, they stress the importance of the design of the technology to be deployed. However, they do not detail how researchers should go about this.

Results show that the effects of person-centeredness in support messages are the same as reported elsewhere for Face-to-Face (FtF) or text-based computer-mediated scenarios: high person-centered messages led to higher perceptions of support quality than low person-centered messages regardless of perceptions of initial trust in the support provider. Results also show that participants perceived the support provider's quality to be higher if personal information (affective trust) about the support provider was available over expertise information (cognitive trust). Ethnicity of participants also had a significant effect on perceptions of support provider's quality. Caucasians reacted much more positively to the message with high person-centeredness and much more negatively to the message with low person-centeredness than other ethnic groups. Asians perceived support provider's quality highly regardless of person-centeredness. Hispanics and African Americans fell somewhere in between. This study demonstrates important implications in message delivery for video-mediated social support.},

As part of a larger project to provide prenatal resources for culturally and linguistically diverse groups, this study focused on the design and reception of an app with the local Vietnamese community and health professionals of a particular hospital. Our study had three stages: an initial design workshop with the hospital; prototype design and development; prototype-based interviews with health professionals and focus groups with Vietnamese women. We explore how an app of this sort must be designed for a range of different use scenarios, considering its use by consumers with a multiplicity of differing viewpoints about its nature and purpose in relation to pregnancy care.},

abstract = {Data science is now impacting the educational sector, with a growing number of commercial products and research prototypes providing learning dashboards as feedback for both educators and students. From a human-centred computing perspective, the end-user's interpretation of these visualisations is a critical challenge to design for, with empirical evidence already showing that `usable' visualisations are not necessarily effective from a teaching and learning perspective. Since an educator's interpretation of visualised data is essentially the construction of a narrative about that student's progress, we draw on the growing body of work on `Data Storytelling' (DS) as the inspiration for a set of enhancements that could be applied to data visualisations to improve their communicative power. We present a pilot study that explores the effectiveness of these DS elements based on educators' responses to paper prototypes. The dual purpose is understanding the contribution of each visual element for data storytelling, and the effectiveness of the enhancements when combined. The results suggest that DS elements could add clarity, especially when there are multiple possible stories in a complex visualisation.},

When it comes to the use of digital devices in treatments the protocols from the field of medicine is adopted. The question is whether or not this evidence based approach is useful when dealing with digital devices and whether the understanding of the efficiency of a treatment can be obtained without also looking at usability and lifestyle issues.Based on a case study of epilepsy, a literature study of protocols for investigating treatments using digital medical devices, the set-up of studies, the design of a current protocol for clinical trials, and finally preliminary results, we discuss if clinical trials have to include usability studies to determine if a treatment is effective.},

A consecutive two-hour trial in daily life showed that the information generated was easy to understand but that the accuracy and accessibility need to be improved. We discuss the trade-offs between accessibility, accuracy, and the significance of information generated to track arm movement. The paper closes with considerations for future work to refine the system and to engage with patients and clinicians involved in rehabilitation.},

While previous work has shown that privacy nudges are effective in encouraging users to adjust their privacy settings, current privacy nudges are considered to be annoying. Previous research found that modalities influence the effectiveness of responses to system messages. Hence, with the aim of improving the usability of privacy nudges, we conducted both a lab and a 3-day field study to empirically investigate how users perceive receiving privacy nudges using different modalities (combinations of visual, vibration, audio and speech). Our results suggest that app designers should implement privacy nudges which cede the decision of their delivery time to the users themselves. Most importantly, our findings reveal that to minimize annoyance, intrusiveness and interruption, while still being read, low priority notifications should not be delivered using salient modalities (i.e., audio or speech).1},

We argue that recognizing the whole family as a target group implicitly improves game enjoyment due to its friendly social context, provides an excellent opportunity to improve social relatedness experiences through family bonding and intergenerational interactions, and contributes to individuals' wellbeing in terms of both physical thriving and social relatedness. Three design concepts were proposed using cooperative and/or competitive game modes. We propose considering family members with limited gaming experience as audience players and recognising their autonomy in the exergame design. We believe that through an enhanced understanding of family exergames, designers and developers can build new experiences that accommodate various capabilities and social dynamics of the family.},

A face showing emotion reflects the internal mental state of the displayer of the emotion and is arguably also an attempt to influence the internal mental state of the observer of the displayed emotion.We found that pupillary response patterns can predict the veracity of anger better than the verbal response of the same individual participants. This supports the previous claim for such a result for smiles, from the results on another emotion, anger.Given the significant differences in behavioural responses expected from the literature on smiles versus anger, the unexpected similarity of results suggests that this method could be used in general for detecting the veracity of many emotions. Even using just smiles and anger, we propose that virtual reality or screen avatars expressing such emotions to cajole, brow beat or otherwise enveigle co-operation in settings such as chronic condition management or aged care, could be substantially improved if we can measure the actual perception of the veracity of emotion felt by human beings.},

Out of 22 identified common migraine triggers, 11 were found to increase cybersickness, 1 was found to have no effect and 6 had only limited research and the effects could not be determined. The other 4 triggers were found to be not relevant to a virtual reality situation. Based on these results, future research is suggested to determine the effects of these triggers as they may have a currently unknown negative affect on cybersickness.1},

While measures of competence and autonomy are relatively straightforward, there are still questions about how we measure the connectedness that players achieve in and through videogame play. Relatedness is most often studied in dyadic relationships, despite broader definitional origins.The present work therefore approaches the conceptual application of relatedness need satisfaction to videogame play, with a view towards facilitating its empirical study. As a result, this research proposes avenues from which even single-player videogames can support relatedness needs --- arising from parasocial relationships, culture, and the videogame itself.},

Due to the relatively small size of the severely motor impaired community and the large fixed costs of developing accessibility software, commercial accessibility software solutions are often relatively expensive, with price ranges between 500-10,000 USD, which renders them unaffordable for a sizable proportion of the motor impaired population. Furthermore, due to the modest potential for profit of the accessibility software market, certain technologically feasible accessibility software solutions are often not even developed by commercial companies. Until recently, open source accessibility software solutions have been relatively scarce and the existing ones do not cover the entire range of available commercial software solutions. In this work, we present an initiative created by scholars at Otago Polytechnic to address this mismatch. We have leveraged capstone projects of our Information Technology degree program to guide students towards the creation of a range of open source accessibility software solutions that are made widely available through an online repository. Thereby, motor impaired users with limited financial means can use our software for free to interact with computers. The open source nature of our projects makes it possible for computationally skilled software developers to extend our software solutions by adding new features or improving existing functionality. We present here the first applications created by our initiative and the corresponding online repository where we make them available to address the needs of the financially constrained motor impaired community.},

MindMax is an mHealth wellbeing app, designed and championed by the Australian Football League Players Association (AFLPA), which aims to harness the high levels of engagement with video games and widespread interest in sports to connect with users. Our qualitative research uses MindMax as a case study to understand the initial experiences of seven users. Our findings suggest that mHealth apps like MindMax can engage people in wellbeing training and goal setting; and video games and connections with sports stars and fellow fans can draw people back to the app to foster engagement and support wellbeing goals.},

Self-care is a critical component of care for people with a diabetic foot ulcer as most of their ulcer care is provided away from the clinic. To promote better self-care, we designed a mobile application 'MyFootCare' that harnesses visual analytics and self-report to provide feedback about the healing process. MyFootCare encourages people to take a photo of their ulcer with their mobile phone each time they change their wound dressing. Based on computer vision techniques, users receive graphical feedback on changes in ulcer size over time to objectively track the healing progress. Additionally, MyFootCare seeks to foster self-care through personal goals, diaries, and reminders to enact care. Feedback from three people with chronic ulcers shows that the app builds on existing practices of taking wound photos and that it is seen as useful to track progress and to facilitate dialogue with clinicians. More work is underway to evaluate the use of MyFootCare in a deeper field study.},

Our observations with 3 users with intellectual disability engaging in an hour-long co-design workshop with a carer confirm the benefits of digital prototypes and non-finito features in this context, contribute a better understanding of the role of proxies, and suggest a longer engagement to potentially take advantage of co-development.},

In the method, a small workspace ("carbon copy area") that corresponds in a one-to-one manner to a trackpad surface is displayed on a computer screen. While working on this virtual carbon copy paper, a user can operate in absolute coordinates; outside the paper, relative coordinates are used to move it anywhere and resize it. Therefore, our technique allows for the appropriate use of relative and absolute coordinate modes with arbitrary timing. This paper discusses the design of the technique, implementation of prototype applications, and a user study in which the technique received positive feedback and was shown to achieve a significantly higher input speed than that of a conventional pointing method.},

Recent research suggests that older adults are increasingly playing digital games. These factors, combined with the rapidly ageing population, means it is vital that avatar creation software responds to the needs of older adults. Our study seeks to address these needs, by better understanding older adult opinions about virtual avatars that are photorealistic, i.e. bearing likeness to their physical appearances. In our exploratory study, we interviewed six older adults aged between 70 and 80 years and asked them to evaluate 18 photorealistic avatars created with three different commercial avatar creation tools. Results showed that participants were not satisfied with their custom-made avatars due to them missing characteristic features. The results also showed that there was major consensus towards using photorealistic avatars across a range of virtual environments.},

Additionally, the system employs text analytics using Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), to extract topics from the comments, and aggregate sentiments for each topic using AFINN-165 wordlist. The instructors can view: (1) top-ranked 'm' topics discussed in 'n' lectures; (2) sentiment trends for 'm' topics, and 'n' lectures, including positive and negative words; (3) popular questions asked in 'n' lectures. A user-study was conducted with 40 students and 10 academics were interviewed to understand their perception towards the system. Additionally, a crowdsource study examined the effectiveness of aggregation techniques. We believe that Interact will help to improve teaching and develop effective learning, with the aid of automatic processing, summarization and visualization of student feedback obtained through comments, questions and rating concepts.},

This paper offers a critical overview of the blockchain technology for an interaction design audience, in three parts: (1) The principles making block-chain technology possible are briefly explained using examples. (2) Specific cases such as food provenance and supply chain tracing, are used to illustrate both the wide array of possible applications and the profound implications of blockchain technology.

abstract = {There is an increasing interest in social robotics. However, there is a paucity of methods for understanding successful human-robot interactions and identifying the factors that influence success. This paper describes the planning and running of a pilot study conducted to inform the research design for an empirical study on helpfulness in children. The research question was whether and how children would help an inanimate robot recipient as they are known to help a human being. The multidisciplinary research team discussed before the pilot study and after each pilot session whether the research design would enable them to investigate this research question from a psychological point of view while taking into account the capabilities of the robot. The planning process shows that when conducting a study to systematically investigate the effect of robots on human beings many detailed considerations need to take place. As well, there is often not enough detail in studies published to set up a sufficiently detailed research design. This research is relevant for Human-Computer Interaction researchers as well as psychologists in order to better understand the effects of introducing robots into people's lives, and the implications when technology takes on a human role.},

abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) games offer potential as a fun and immersive way to get enough physical activity to gain significant health benefits. Currently, there is no established way to describe the type and level of physical activity a person can expect to gain when playing a VR game. Nor is there a way of reporting to a person about the exercise they actually did. To address this, we have designed a visual overview that depicts the nature of exercise an individual actually did. To assess the visualisation, we selected four VR games with very different exercise profiles. We used them in a qualitative study with 7 people, so that we could demonstrate how our visualisation could represent the individual differences in the nature and level of physical activity for each game. Our contribution is the design of the first visualisation to represent the nature of exercise gained in VR games, as a personalised, compact summary of the exertion an individual had in a game.},

abstract = {As learning analytics (LA) systems become more common, teachers and students are often required to not only make sense of the user interface (UI) elements of a system, but also to make meaning that is pedagogically appropriate to the learning context. However, we suggest that the dominant way of thinking about the relationship between representation and meaning results in an overemphasis on the UI, and that re-thinking this relationship is necessary to create systems that can facilitate deeper meaning making. We propose a conceptual view as a basis for discussion among the LA and HCI communities around a different way of thinking about meaning making, specifically that it should be explicit in the design process, provoking greater consideration of system level elements such as algorithms, data structures and information flow. We illustrate the application of the conceptualisation with two cases of LA design in the areas of Writing Analytics and Multi-modal Dashboards.},

Observers were shown smiling face videos, either in single or paired, to rate each of them on a number of scales intended to assess perceived real and posed smiles. We implemented four experiments where single smiles were shown in most cases, and paired smiles were shown in the third experiment. We found that observers are more accurate in response to paired videos (72.9%) compared to single videos (61.7% and 60.2%). Performance is increased when voting is introduced, but we need 11 to 13 observers in single smiles and 13 to 15 in paired smile discrimination. We found that female observers are more accurate compared to male observers. On testing with 8 'smiling' virtual avatars we found only one was rated a real smile. This work will have significant impact on judgement of genuineness of smiles from avatars / automated virtual assistants, in that untrained individuals using normal human abilities can estimate how real the virtual smiles will seem for the human users to whom they are directed.},

Yet, there seems to be little consensus as to where the agency or responsibility lies in technological systems. In this paper, we argue that morality is a significant aspect of the design process, requiring deliberate attention and consideration in the design and development of new technologies and systems. We aim to address the issue of morality, starting from the perspective of altruism. In support of our argument, we present a theoretical analytical design schema - referred to as the Mediated Tendency Towards Altruism (MeTTA). The MeTTA classifies various aspects of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) systems. Through this approach, we propose to evaluate the 'altruistic tendency' of a design solution, to gauge how HCI can materialise the conditions to embody altruism in design artefacts and posit that this approach could serve as a model for other moral perspectives. We conclude by discussing how the MeTTA design schema could be used as a basis for further inquiry towards understanding and taxonomy of a moral continuum in HCI.},

abstract = {Online Collectible Card Games (OCCGs) are enormously popular worldwide. Previous studies found that the social aspects of physical CCGs are crucial for players' motivation and engagement. We know little about the different types of sociability that OCCGs afford. This study aims to identify social design features that may affect players' sense of social presence and motivation. It will also investigate how these features and social structures impact players' wellness and sense of community in an eSport center on a university campus. We will:1) identify social design features of popular OCCGs and organize them into different categories of sociability; 2) conduct a large scale online survey on OCCG forums to investigate their effects on players' motivation; 3) periodically survey and interview Hearthstone players at QUT eSports for six months to examine the role of social features of OCCGs on participants' wellbeing and community formation on campus. The results of this study will not only help us understand why OCCGs are very popular but also can be used to inform best practices and principles in OCCGs, as well as investigate community building benefits of OCCGs at a university campus1.},

abstract = {This paper attempts to look at sharing from three angles - community, environment and technology. Sharing is approached as co-production where what is shared is not simply material goods but rather ideas, creativity, pleasure and experience. The paper outlines making as an intrinsic attribute of human nature and how sharing and making can complement each other. Further, it discusses the creation of waste and upcycling as a way of uniting sustainability with making. The paper proposes a solution in the form of an online collaborative community for upcycling products, called Regen. The details of the interaction with the solution are outlined and the solution is analyzed using Triandis' Theory of Interpersonal Behaviors (TIB).},

abstract = {An emerging strategy to solve world problems is designing for sharing. Sharing can be defined as contributing or pooling resources to give to another individual or group. One problem that can be solved by using digital technologies to create innovative sharing solutions is food waste. Addressing this issue in a creative way can open opportunities to not only advance resource conservation but also improve social aspects of society.A modified design thinking approach was employed. Research on existing literatures on design for sharing was performed and the problem statement was defined. Personas, a storyboard and user interfaces were then created, and the possible outlook and challenges to confront were discussed. The end result is AirShare; a food sharing service concept that allows people to offer leftovers or unused food to others in need. The food is delivered by drones with smart technology. If properly adopted, this service could support a society that wastes less of the planet's resources, while bettering community life.},

abstract = {In today's age, the virtual presence of an individual outweighs the physical presence by an alarming margin. It is therefore the responsibility of future innovators, to leverage technology to help people advance in social and environmental systems. In this design intervention, a solution is provided to challenge the lack of physical participation and instill a sense of responsibility towards constructing a better environment. A participatory platform has been conceptualized where people can come together and collectively take care of a plant, building a community in the long run. The human nature of willingness to help and take action is taken into account, which is often hindered by the lack of time and skill acting as a hindrance to the motivation.},

abstract = {Digital participation is fast becoming a core issue for researchers, designers, educators, industry and the government. Yet, academic research, industry practices and government policies still tend to focus predominantly on mainstream communities of highly urbanized settlements, often neglecting smaller cities, regional areas, suburbia and disadvantaged segments of society lacking digital literacy. Likewise, people from diverse and marginalised backgrounds, or who are socially excluded, such as people living with disability, the elderly, disadvantaged youth and women, people identifying as LGBTI, refugees and migrants, Indigenous people and others, are particularly vulnerable to digital under-participation. This workshop proposes to shift the discourse back into the discussion of: (a) design practices relevant to those communities; (b) identify shared challenges and opportunities; (c) uncover strategies for co-design with a wider range of demographics; and (d) devise a roadmap for a more inclusive research agenda around communities and technologies.},

Prospective participants are to submit proposals discussing either a new project, enhancements to an existing project, or an HCI topic relevant to citizen science engagement (e.g. interaction designs, methods, theories). Accepted proposals will be discussed and interactively explored to develop a rich understanding of how design and citizen science communities can improve citizen science technologies for conservation into the future. This workshop will afford networking opportunities between members of HCI and citizen science communities as well. We anticipate drafting design recommendations to improve both technology interaction for citizen scientists and species conservation.},

We ask what are the best practice methods being used in the OzCHI community to address the complexities inherent in applying triangulation processes? If you already work with or are considering, researching, or working with both quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods (in academia or industry), join us in this workshop. In particular, we look at adding quantitative to qualitative methods to build a whole picture of user experience. We see a need to discuss both quantitative and qualitative research because there is often a perceived lack of understanding of the rigor involved in each. The workshop will result in a White Paper on the latest developments in this field, within Australia and comparative with international work. We anticipate sharing submissions and workshop outcomes with the HCI community.},
