abstract = {Emerging technologies increasingly provide opportunities for creating and maintaining social relations with people even though separated by time or distance. However, it is still unclear how such technologies can support these social relations and what kind of interface awareness cues such technologies should provide. Based on an ethnographic study of social awareness in families, we identified four awareness cues namely activity, status, relation, and vicinity. From these cues, we designed a prototype called iSocialize to explore the identified awareness cues. Based on a laboratory-based evaluation, we assessed our solution and identified five issues of social awareness cues including that imprecise awareness cues are requested to ensure privacy issues and that users found it difficult to maintain a continuously peripheral awareness of their contacts.},

The system was conceived as a technology probe and serves as a tool in investigating related issues such as awareness and intimacy between home inhabitants. It supplements existing communication methods by providing a highly expressive and always-available messaging method. We present some findings and initial results from a preliminary analysis of messages sent through the system during four deployments, identifying emerging themes in message content. In addition, we also present some of the issues that have surfaced through these deployments in a domestic environment.},

Some focus on the moment to moment changes of one's state and thoughts, others describe stable and long-lasting traits. To handle this diversity, we created Transient Life: a system that lets a person gather personal 'transient' information tidbits on the fly and share this collected information with others. Transient Life is designed as a modular sidebar located on the display's periphery. A person uses its modules to: update momentary personal state (feelings, location, happenings, and thoughts), record activity milestones done over the day as well as a 'to do' list of things left to do, collect interesting URLs and photos seen, and compose text essays of whatever has captured their interest. A person can selectively post this information as a 'today message' to one's community, and the essay to one's personal blog. Information is kept in a History Calendar, which allows one to view the information recorded on a past date.},

The evaluation materials include preliminary design and preparation records, recordings of the two-way video data and of the surgical video, exit questionnaires, debriefing discussion notes and follow-up interviews with the participants. Prior work in this area is surveyed and the demonstration is positioned with respect to this work. Conclusions are drawn about the effectiveness of the two key aspects of the demonstration and about possibilities for future work.},

abstract = {The Virtual Critical Care Unit, (ViCCU®) is a telemedicine system that allows a specialist at a major referral hospital to direct a team in a rural hospital. ViCC® allows remote consultation to take place based on the transmission of multiple channels of real-time video/audio information of the patient, the clinical team, x-ray/paper documents and patient vital signs from the remote site to the specialist. This paper explores clinicians' experience of presence in a telemedicine application. In this study we used a modified version of the Slater-Usoh-Steed (SUS) presence questionnaire to measure clinicians' sense of presence when using ViCC®. We also explored the relationship between presence felt when using ViCCU® and personal, usability and media factors. Initial results indicate that in this context, personal factors influenced clinicians experience of presence and that there was a positive relationship between presence and both usability and media factors. Reflection on some of the challenges in conducting this study in an emergency department and the appropriateness of the SUS presence measure in this real setting are also included.},

In order to gain an insight into the information transfer that occurs between shifts of senior staff in an emergency department, we observed handovers, interviewed practitioners and distributed questionnaires. We found that merely considering the transfer of "hard data", such as patients' heart rate, blood pressure, etc. can be insufficient: the transfer of "soft data" such as the ambiguity of intuition is also a central aspect in this type of work environment and vital for successful crosscoverage. We describe design concepts that address capture, visualization and transfer of intuition for the handover process. Addressing the issue of intuition support can be a challenge but also a rewarding opportunity for human-computer interaction research in supporting health care handovers.},

The project aims at creating a theoretical foundation for future research into interaction design with context-aware mobile computer systems and to develop the concept of indexicality as an interaction design principle for such systems. Achieving this, we are conducting a theoretical as well as a technical stream of research involving field studies into the context of mobile computer system use and experimental design, implementation and evaluation of prototype systems.},

As human navigation and orientation in different environments depend on both visual and auditory information, sound plays a very important role in AR applications.

The results not only confirm several previous findings on sound localization, but also point out some important new visual-audio cues which should be taken into consideration for effective localization and orientation in AR environment. Finally, this paper provides tentative guidelines for adding spatial sound to AR environments.},

Results show that the use of eye input is 111% faster than the mouse, 75% faster than function keys, and 37% faster than the use of multiple keyboards. A user satisfaction questionnaire showed that participants also preferred the use of eye input over other three techniques.

We designed and implemented a number of interaction techniques based on two sets of different tiles, which either directly represent digital objects or function as tools for data manipulation. To discover the strengths and weaknesses of our current prototype, we conducted a user study that compared simple interaction with digital imagery in three conditions: 1) our Tangible Tiles system, 2) a commercial touch screen, and 3) a control condition using real paper prints. Although we discovered some conceptual problems, the results show potential benefits of Tangible Tiles for supporting collaboration and natural interaction.},

abstract = {One of the problems with notification appliances is that they can be distracting when providing information not of immediate interest to the user. In this paper, we present AuraOrb, an ambient notification appliance that deploys progressive turn taking techniques to minimize notification disruptions. AuraOrb uses social awareness cues, such as eye contact to detect user interest in an initially ambient light notification. Once detected, it displays a text message with a notification heading visible from 360 degrees. Touching the orb causes the associated message to be displayed on the user's computer screen. When user interest is lost, AuraOrb automatically reverts back to its idle state.We performed an initial evaluation of AuraOrb's functionality using a set of heuristics tailored to ambient displays. We compared progressive notification with the use of persistent ticker tape notifications and Outlook Express system tray messages for notifying the user of incoming emails. Results of our evaluation suggest that progressive turn taking techniques allowed AuraOrb users to access notification headings with minimal impact on their focus task.},

The first prototype assists an author to construct such a scenario, while the second prototype allows the scenario to be delivered to physically distributed groups who communicate with each other using video-conferencing. This exploratory investigation demonstrates how the scenario must be represented with extensive additional data and meta-data to render the authors' intentions visibile and meaningful. In this way, the scenario can be re-played in a way that allows for re-discovery of the issues contained within.},

abstract = {Participatory design is an essential element of the skill set of professional interface developers and therefore is a significant component of HCI courses at universities. The PICTIVE technique is a 'low-fidelity' collaborative design technique that encourages participatory design. Significant challenges arise when attempting to introduce participatory design techniques such as PICTIVE to students who may not be studying on campus.This paper is a case-study in the design, evolution and refinement of an educational software tool designed to provide off-campus students with experience in collaborative user-centred software design.This paper investigates the origins and value of participatory design and its implementation using the PICTIVE technique. The paper describes the process of creating PICTIOL, a web-delivered solution to provide experience in problem-based learning, emulating the PICTIVE technique. Stages in development of the new software are described, including various HCI testing techniques and the iterative design/implementation/feedback loop. The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential of the PICTIOL in education and industry.Whilst the focus of the project was on the development of the PICTIOL tool, the very process of creating PICTIOL is itself an example of collaborative user-centred software design.},

Through this paper the framework is developed, justified and explained. The framework is then demonstrated using three cases. Since the conception of CTP in the late 1990s it has attracted interest from various areas, and through research is helping to yield new ways forward for problem areas, design and products in HCI. However the application of CTP has always been up to individuals and their own interpretation. The proposed framework tries to add structure through a series of easy to follow steps that the CTP adopter can use to apply CTP to their problem area, design or product. The framework is motivated by the need to provide the adopter with a straight forward way to critically think about his/her HCI arena. Ways to enable this are provided and areas for future work are discussed. The use cases presented help to demonstrate how the framework can be applied to each of these different areas.},

The two data sets we present (patterns of use of the QC and emails sent to the site) illustrate some broad requirements for interactive support programs, operating through several channels of communication, for smokers trying to quit.},

abstract = {First order authentication of the privacy and security of Internet banking rests mainly on distinctive user names and passwords. Our qualitative study of banking, security and privacy shows it is common for married and de facto couples in Australia to access each other's individual Internet and phone banking accounts through shared user names and PINs. This sharing happens when the couple has joint accounts, and both persons also have individual accounts, but only one person manages the money. Individual accounts appear to remain important for their symbolic meanings in a marriage, even though online money management may negate access and privacy boundaries between individual and joint accounts. This study thus finds that first order authentication policies go against social practice in some important domestic contexts. Our work points to the importance of sociological empirical user centred security study in order that security design can be built on social practice.},

Since requirements elicitation techniques are often determined by the modeling scheme used, we chose the most apparently appropriate modeling scheme for social contexts, the Agent Oriented Software Engineering (AOSE) methodology, ROADMAP. We believe to have contributed the ability to include AOSE in the cycle from cultural probe observation to production of informed technology, reflecting designer motivation and intention, for re-immersion into the situational context. The method facilitates the transition from data collection in social environments via cultural probes to socially oriented requirements analysis for informed technology production.},

Many studies have examined usability impact factors of mobile phones on the basis of software usability concepts. However, considering mobile phones as multi-media and information appliances, a new usability concept and associated factors should be developed. This paper proposes a conceptual framework which has five views to reflect different aspect of interactions between users and mobile phones, and from which various usability impact factor models can be derived. Five views include user view, product view, interaction view, dynamic view, and execution view. Furthermore, we developed a hierarchical model which organizes usability factors in terms of goal-means relations. Through two case studies, we could verify the usefulness of the framework and model. Lastly, we developed a set of checklists that are helpful to measure the usability of mobile phones, thereby increasing the practicality of the framework and model.},

abstract = {There are various situations where a distinction needs to be made between group members and outsiders. For example, to protect students in chat groups from unpleasant incidents caused by intruders; or to provide access to common domains such as computer labs. In some of these situations the implications of unauthorized access are negligible. Thus, using an expensive authentication technique, in terms of equipment and maintenance, or requiring significant effort from the user, is wasteful and unjustified. Passwords are the cheapest access control mechanism but have memorability issues. As a result, various alternatives have been proposed. These solutions are often either insecure or expensive in terms of data collection and maintenance. In this paper we present a solution that is less costly since it is built on the data produced by user-system interactions. The mechanism relies on a dynamic (and unpredictable) shared secret. We report on our investigation into differentiating between group members and outsiders by means of their group characteristics. We also present an original analytical framework to facilitate the automatic generation of questions from group characteristics. Finally, we introduce a prototype of the mechanism.},

abstract = {While apart, couples can verbally and visually communicate through existing technologies such as mobile phones, text messaging, videoconferencing and email. Yet, other important means of communication, such as holding hands, can only happen when couples are co-located. We investigated if geographically distant handholding in a mobile context is important for young-adult couples by deploying a simple technology probe. Unfortunately, the design of our probe fell short in encouraging participants to engage with it. While it is important for technology probes to be simple, they need to be well designed. Our current and future work incorporates form design into the technology probe method to better support intimate, mobile contexts.},

abstract = {This paper proposes the design rationale of a wearable display that is able to convey the behavioral typology of its wearers by merging insights from wearable computing, aesthetic visualization, and electronic fashion. This display acts as an electronically enhanced and dynamically changing form of self-expression, which can be integrated with daily clothing. The data mapping approach is based on historical behavior data retrieved via built-in accelerometer, microphone and infrared sensors. By aesthetical encrypting this personal data, the actual meaning of the display can only be interpreted by people that are intrinsically motivated to learn it, and have had a long-term exposure to it. Conceptually, the display is based on the dynamic folding of consecutive layers of fabric, which creates emergent visual patterns that subtly change over time. A first prototype has been implemented which will ultimately lead to a deployment of several interconnected devices in a real social context, to evaluate its social acceptance and its effectiveness in augmenting human self-expression and promoting social networking.},

abstract = {Most of the commercialized wearable text input devices are wrist-worn keyboards that have adopted the minimization method of reducing keys. Generally, a drastic key reduction in order to achieve sufficient wearability increases KSPC (Keystrokes per Character), decreases text entry performance, and requires additional effort to learn a new typing method. We are faced with wearability-usability tradeoff problems in designing a good wearable keyboard. To address this problem, we adopted a new keyboard minimization method of reducing key pitch and have developed the One-key Keyboard. The traditional desktop keyboard has one key per character, but One-key Keyboard has only one key (70mmX35mm) on which a 10*5 QWERTY key array is printed. One-key Keyboard detects the position of the fingertip at the time of the keying event and figures out the character entered. We conducted a text entry performance test comprised of 5 sessions. The participants typed 18.9WPM with a 6.7% error rate over all sessions and achieved up to 24.5WPM. From the experiment's results, the One-key Keyboard was evaluated as a potential text input device for wearable computing, balancing wearability, social acceptance, input speed, and learnability.},

abstract = {Federated identity management is often viewed by corporations as a solution to support secure online commerce by synthesising complex and fragmented user information into a single entity. However previous research (Satchell et al 2006) has revealed a new set of end user needs for the design of identity management systems. This paper explores these needs from an identity management provider perspective, finds both alignment and divergence in needs and identifies a generational shift as a major cause of the differing needs. Whilst X and Y generations do not react strongly to concerns about digital identity theft or misappropriation of information, they seek to create and control their digital representations to be streamlined, portable across domains and revealing elements of their real life identity. There is still a considerable challenge for providers who must look beyond 'security' and 'authentication' to include 'user control', 'synthesis', 'portability' and 'personalisation' in the design of their systems.},

However, players have to be collocated to play, and three players cannot usually play at the same time in fair or equitable manner. We have developed a networked table tennis like game called Table Tennis for Three (TTT). TTT is a game played with bat and ball by three people on three physically separated table tennis tables. The players of TTT can interact with one another through the use of augmented virtuality - the augmentation of virtual systems with elements of physical game play. TTT uses the physicality of table tennis combined with the communicative media typically associated with videoconferencing. TTT has been developed with the aim of achieving similar benefits to those of co-located table tennis such as exercise, enjoyment and bringing people together to socialize.},

Five aspects of a conceptual tool, body-thing dialogue, potential for action, withinreach, out-of-reach and movement expression are introduced. We discuss the role this tool can play in our thinking about, further exploration and eventually our design for movement enabled technology interactions. The idea is that it can help us consider, not just how a design or a technology might look but also how it might feel to use.},

In the creative environment that we examined, interactions between people are of great importance in the synthesis of an atmosphere of fun and trust that enables creativity. We observed the importance of spontaneous casual interactions, awareness and engagement with other people for encouraging an atmosphere of creativity. In our design reflections for a virtual office, where the lack of physical proximity is being overcome by communication technologies, we give recommendations to model these interactions.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the application of information and interaction design principles to the design of iTV (Interactive TV) applications. It details the authors' experiences of teaching a subject in Digital Information &amp; Interaction Design as part of a postgraduate program in Interactive Multimedia. Students worked on a design project for a common client - Austar, a Subscription TV and iTV service provider in rural and regional Australia - in which they developed the information architecture and interaction for proposed new iTV applications.The paper begins by defining iTV in relation to the Subscription TV service offered by Austar. It will also contextualise this against other forms of iTV which exist but are not yet possible within the infrastructure available in Australia.iTV was chosen as a novel alternative to designing web interfaces. The students were more than familiar with designing for web environments. iTV presented students with a new technology which many had never experienced directly, as well as new challenges in learning about its constraints and possibilities.Finally, the paper details the design process undertaken by the students, and the difficulties faced in their attempts to translate and apply their knowledge of HCI and web design to the development of iTV interfaces.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present InfoScent Evaluator, a tool that automatically evaluates the semantic appropriateness of the descriptions of hyperlinks in web pages. The tool is based on a theoretical model of users' behavior when engaged in information search tasks, called Information Foraging theory. A textual description of the user's search goal is compared with the textual description of each probable hyperlink, using Latent Semantic Analysis, a statistical technique that evaluates the distance between the two texts. Through this approach the most probable path that the user will follow in order to access the sought web page can be predicted. Thus, the tool can be used to evaluate the web site in terms of appropriateness of hyperlink text and of information architecture. We argue that the presented tool could substantially aid design and evaluation of a web site.},

In the frame of Baddeley's Theory of Working Memory, we present some of the results from an empirical study conducted with users of a multimodal interface, under varying levels of cognitive load. In particular, we examine how multimodal behavioural features are sensitive to cognitive load variations. We report significant decreases in multimodal redundancy (33.6%) and trends of increased multimodal complementarity, as cognitive load increases.},

This paper explores the context of direct manipulation user interfaces for large horizontal interactive displays. Knowledge of users' reach provides direct manipulation user interfaces with a powerful tool for contextualizing and predicting user action. This paper introduces users' reach as a formal way to predict the previously observed phenomena of workspace segmentation and territoriality. By creating models of "reach-ability", reach probability surfaces can be generated which further explain the impact on workspace usage of the shape, height, and position of the workspace. As the presented techniques build on formal qualitative and mathematical models of reach, they lend themselves particularly well to an algorithmic implementation suited to driving complex user interface behaviour. This paper presents the results of an initial user study to determine the accuracy of these predictions and their underlying hypotheses about reaches role in shaping workspace usage.},

We propose a new approach for fingertip interaction with large display systems using monocular computer vision. By taking into account the location of the user and the interaction area available, we can estimate an interaction surface - virtual touchscreen - between the display and the user. Users can use their pointing finger to interact with the display as if it was brought forward and presented directly in front of them, while preserving viewing angle. An interaction model is presented to describe the interaction with the virtual touchscreen, using the head-hand line method. Initial results, in the form of a work-in-progress prototype, demonstrate the feasibility of this concept.},

This paper presents a novel approach to multi-sensory data fusion based on speech and manual deictic gesture inputs.

It enables transmission of high quality audio/video information and has a seamless interface to the complex clinical working environment. The technical design team took an iterative participatory design approach towards the system design. The combination of expert user evaluations and scenariobased user testing methods ensured users' needs were designed into the system and verified.

Usability issues are still identified late in the software development process, during testing and deployment. One of the reasons these issues arise late in the process is that current requirements engineering practice does not incorporate usability perspectives effectively into software requirements specifications. The main strength of usability-focused software requirements is the clear visibility of usability aspects for both developers and testers. The explicit expression of these aspects of human-computer systems can be built for optimal usability and also evaluated effectively to uncover usability issues. This paper presents a design science-oriented research design to test the proposition that incorporating user modelling and usability modelling in software requirements specifications improves design. The proposal and the research design are expected to make a contribution to knowledge by theory testing and to practice with effective techniques to produce usable human computer systems.},
