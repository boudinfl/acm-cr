abstract = {A desktop Virtual Reality (VR) application of a skim milk powder process has been developed. The goal was to use this application as a learning resource to expose students to processing plant environments, which are becoming increasingly difficult to visit due to availability and safety reasons. The VR application comprises 360° panorama images of the milk powder process plant, process flow diagrams (PFD), piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&amp;ID), 3D drawings and additional materials such as supplemental text, videos and animations. This paper describes the VR application as well as an evaluation of the application. The results of this study show that the application was easy to use and the users were satisfied with it. The design recommendations for the development of similar VR learning applications are also discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {This paper reports the influence of website design and brand on users' experience; it also explores the effect of users' cultures and values (health awareness) on their judgement of health websites. Eighty-six respondents from Jordan and the UK viewed three health-related websites with different designs and brand names. Content, usability, aesthetics, pleasurable interaction, service quality, and overall judgement were assessed through questionnaires; interviews were conducted to support the questionnaire results. Results demonstrated that a familiar website brand, comprehensive content and interactive features had the strongest effect on users' judgement; respondents were more positive to a website with a familiar brand, comprehensive content and interactive features, while there were minor effects of health awareness and culture on users' overall preferences.},

Many secondary tasks, such as giving turns or encouraging children to work silently, could be supported by interactive systems, which may lighten the teacher's busy everyday routine. Such systems however, should afford being interacted with while performing another primary task. We call this type of design peripheral interaction design. In this paper we present FireFlies, an open-ended peripheral interaction design developed for primary schools. Preliminary results of a six week deployment of FireFlies in four classrooms, reveal that teachers used FireFlies to perform secondary tasks and saw it as a valuable addition to the classroom. Though different interactions with FireFlies required different levels of effort, teachers could successfully interact with FireFlies during or in between other tasks.},

Also they do not prioritize fixing the problems identified by specialists. This barrier is denoted "developer mindset" and this paper empirically explores whether the barrier can be overcome by training software development practitioners to conduct usability testing. Findings show that the practitioners obtained considerable abilities in identifying usability problems as they managed to uncover 80.5% of these after 30 hours of training, which shows a high level of acceptance. Findings also reveal that the practitioners prioritized fixing 61% of the problems and we found that they successfully removed 64% in a new interface design. We conclude that this approach may pose a viable solution to overcome the barrier of developer mindset.},

These tasks included both macro- and micro-navigation aspects. Our findings suggest that while GPS-enabled navigation maps are preferred for moving over larger distances (macro-navigation), their inability to support micro navigation resulted in a notable decrease in the ability of users to locate their desired points of interest. In contrast to this the egocentric navigation system performs well in micro-navigation but relatively weaker in macro-navigation. We conclude that a better system would allow users to switch between map-based and egocentric views in order to use a GPS system for the macro-navigation, and an egocentric system for micro-navigation.},

abstract = {This paper describes an exploration into factors influencing the interaction of cognitive processing with visual and motor skills during website use by older adults. Twenty-eight older adults and 18 younger adults completed an on-line air-ticketing search task. Quantitative and qualitative data was captured from multiple sources, and analysed from the perspective of cognitive load. Compared with the younger control group, older adults took significantly longer and made significantly more errors in reporting the results of the task. Although the mean duration of gaze down at the keyboard and notes was similar for both age groups, the mean duration of screen gaze was significantly longer for older than for younger participants. Older adults also logged a significantly higher number of gazes from keyboard to screen. Their longer task times were associated with actions that increase cognitive load by decreasing spatial and temporal contiguity of information. Unlike their younger counterparts, they did not glance rapidly between screen and keyboard, but focussed their gaze on the keyboard, checking their typing only when they had completed a form field. Accordingly, they typed into autocomplete combo boxes, ignoring preset options, with the unexpected consequence of more expensive fares and a smaller range of results. When participant background information was analysed, task time was correlated with less Internet experience as well as with age. Supported by observation and self-report which did not signal pronounced vision or motor problems, these results suggest that task times could be reduced through automation of repeatable user interface actions with practice, especially with training in screen glancing rather than gazing. Although the number of search reporting errors was correlated with age group and not experience, greater proficiency with the interface could possibly free cognitive resources for improved problem-solving.},

In this paper we present a framework for creating educational Augmented Reality (AR) books that overlay virtual content over real book pages. The framework features support for certain types of user interaction, model and texture animations, and an enhanced marker design suitable for educational books. Three books teaching electromagnetism concepts were created with this framework. To evaluate the effectiveness in helping students learn, we conducted a small pilot study with ten secondary school students, studying electromagnetism concepts using the three books. Half of the group used the books with the diagrams augmented, while the other half used the books without augmentation. Participants completed a pre-test, a test after the learning session and a retention test administered 1 month later. Results suggest that AR has potential to be effective in teaching complex 3D concepts.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the first iteration of a study aimed at grouping similar food types together in a refrigerator to increase the awareness of available foods for consumers in a domestic environment. The goals of the project are twofold: i) Raise the awareness of available foods for all members of a household; ii) Reduce the amount of expired food waste in the household. The project implemented a paper-based colour scheme in refrigerators in households, assigning colours to particular food types (e.g. green to fruit and vegetables, red to meat, etc.). The findings show that the colour coding raised participants' awareness of available food items in the fridge, particularly for those participants who were not directly involved in the shopping and initial storage of each food item. The findings also indicate that such awareness led to a reduction in expiration of food and thus general food waste in the household. These preliminary findings suggest that raising awareness of food availability through categorisation and efficient communication of this information may lead to a reduction in food waste in domestic environments.},

abstract = {Students undertaking summative and formative assessment are very much aware of the imperative of the outcome and often find themselves in a stressful situation with a high level of required concentration. Usability testing of assessment tool interfaces is hindered by the ability to sufficiently replicate the exam environment or to disrupt, watch or monitor a student while they are undertaking an exam or rely on their memories to reproduce their concerns at a later stage. This research demonstrates how a set of heuristics is adapted and redefined to enable an iterative approach to the improvement of a computer aided online assessment tool. The revised set of heuristics offers a tool for future developers to assist in the development of online assessment interfaces.},

abstract = {Medical procedures are often associated with discomfort, pain and anxiety. Previous studies have shown that one way to reduce pain during treatment is to watch nature scenes and listen to nature sounds or escape into immersive virtual environments. This not only benefits the patients' well-being but also effectively reduces costs for governments, health care providers and patients themselves. Previous studies show that high levels of immersion into virtual environments significantly reduce pain that is experienced during medical procedures. However, large-scale immersive display systems are inherently expensive and pixel resolution and field of view in smaller and more affordable Head-Mounted Displays has increased only very slowly over the past 40 years. In this paper we consider a Low-Cost 3 Projector Display System as an alternative display method for restorative virtual environments until high quality, highly immersive Head-Mounted Displays have been developed and are available at a reasonable price.},

It is proposed that this is often because the recipients fail to be engaged as a result of being ascribed with belonging to a community without the perceived power or ability to participate. It is also proposed that this is an area for further study with a bias towards using Participatory Design Techniques in conjunction with the model suggested in this paper. The researchers believe that this could provide an area of investigation for an Action Research project.},

This paper describes changes to the application made after an initial field study was undertaken and provides an evaluation of the impact of the redesign. Survey responses were collected from thirteen students and usage data was captured from 105 students. Results indicate three levels of user engagement and suggest that there is value in adding game elements to the experience in this way.

The research explores how smartphone technology can be used to deliver an engaging and educational experience. The game aims to provide a fun and interactive way to guide participants through a multi-leveled library building, to search for unique QR codes to unlock clues, answer quiz questions and progress further up a leaderboard. This paper outlines the design and initial deployment of the game, reporting on results from a usability study and discussing initial observations made by librarians. Findings indicate that the mobile platform is suitable for delivering such experiences but consideration is needed when embedding games in such large environments so as not to confuse players as they play.},

Stomp is a suite of educational games that use such a technology, allowing young children to use their whole body to interact with a digital environment projected on the floor. To maximise the effectiveness of this technology, tenets of self-determination theory (SDT) are applied to the design of Stomp experiences. By meeting user needs for competence, autonomy, and relatedness our aim is to increase children's engagement with the Stomp learning platform. Analysis of Stomp's design suggests that these tenets are met. Observations from a case study of Stomp being used by young children show that they were highly engaged and motivated by Stomp. This analysis demonstrates that continued application of SDT to Stomp will further enhance user engagement. It also is suggested that SDT, when applied more widely to other whole-body multi-user interfaces, could instil similar positive effects.},

Some instructors and teachers see them as a distraction and regularly ban their usage. Others who see their potential to enhance learning have started to explore ways to integrate them into their teaching in an attempt to improve student engagement. In this paper we report on a pilot study that forms part of a university-wide project reconceptualising its approach to the student evaluation of learning and teaching. In a progressive decision to embrace mobile technology, the university decided to trial a smart phone app designed for students to check-in to class and leave feedback on the spot. Our preliminary findings from trialling the app indicate that the application establishes a more immediate feedback loop between students and teachers. However, the app's impact depends on how feedback is shared with students and how the teaching team responds.},

In this paper we will analyse the basic properties that are required by an application and its user interface to achieve such growth. We propose a model that describes the lifecycle of a meme. Furthermore we support this model with a framework, which identifies user interface elements and application features that are the foundation to the meme propagation and classify these based on the stage of the lifecycle they belong to. The goal of this framework is to assist software developers in selecting these elements early on in the application design lifecycle, in order to improve the user experience.},

Offering new ways for communities to share contextually specific information, it presents the opportunity to expand social media's current focus on micro self-publishing with applications that support communities to actively address areas of local need. This paper details the design and development of a prototype application that illustrates this potential. Entitled PetSearch, it was designed in collaboration with the Animal Welfare League of Queensland to support communities to map and locate lost, found and injured pets, and to build community engagement in animal welfare issues. We argue that, while established approaches to social and locative media provide a useful foundation for designing applications to harness social capital, they must be re-envisaged if they are to effectively facilitate community collaboration. We conclude by arguing that the principles of user engagement and co-operation employed in this project can be extrapolated to other online approaches that aim to facilitate co-operative problem solving for social benefit.},

The results of a user study, including a think-aloud walkthrough and an adapted technology probe, suggest that the social engagement with friends is a strong motivator but that the content of information chunks need to be carefully tailored to the participant.

Traditionally, the focus of serious games in a health context is on the rehabilitation of motor function, neglecting the often-absent or impaired sensory function of the patient. This paper discusses a series of approaches used to develop appropriate serious games for children with cerebral palsy targeted at the impaired sensory system, taking into consideration longevity of play experience, requirements from therapists or researchers, and the interface requirements of the participants themselves. Two of the games that were developed are provided as examples, including data and feedback from one child with cerebral palsy who evaluated the games for entertainment, engagement and replay value.},

abstract = {Human beings continuously adapt their way of communication to their surroundings and their communication partner. Although context-aware ubiquitous systems gather a lot of information to maximize their functionality, they predominantly use static ways to communicate. In order to fulfill the user's communication needs and demands, the sensor's diverse and sometimes uncertain information must also be used to dynamically adapt the user interface. In this article we present ProFi, a system for Probabilistic Fission, designed to reason on adaptive and multimodal output based on uncertain or ambiguous data. In addition, we present a system architecture as well as a new meta model for multimodal interactive systems. Based on this meta model we describe ProFi's process of multimodal fission along with our current implementation.},

It is therefore significant to investigate the factors that affect immersion so that virtual environments can be tailored to provide an immersive experience. This study explored mechanisms underlying the relationship between avatar similarity and immersion. Specifically, we examined the effects of avatar appearance similarity, homophily and private self-awareness on immersion. Data from 196 users of Second Life were collected through a web-based survey. The results revealed an important role of self-awareness in mediating the effect of avatar similarity on immersion. More specifically, appearance similarity was found to affect homophily, which heightened self-awareness. Self-awareness, in turn, influenced immersion. Implications for research and practical applications are discussed.},

abstract = {The advent of online software distribution channels like Apple Inc.'s App Store and Google Inc.'s Google Play has offered developers a single, low cost, and powerful distribution mechanism. These online stores help users discover apps as well as leave a review. Ratings and reviews add value to both the developer and potential new users by providing a crowd-sourced indicator of app quality. Hence, for developers it is important to get positive reviews and high ratings to ensure that an app has a viable future. But, what exactly do users say on these app stores? And more importantly, what is the experience that compels a user to leave either a positive or a negative rating? Our analysis of 8.7 million reviews from 17,330 apps shows that users tend to leave short, yet informative reviews, and the rating as well as the category influences the length of a review. In this preliminary study, we found that users will leave longer messages when they rate an app poorly, and the depth of feedback in certain categories is significantly higher than for other.},

abstract = {Online software distribution channels such as Apple Inc.'s App Store and Google Inc.'s Google Play provide a platform for third-party app distribution. These online stores feature a public review system, allowing users to express opinions regarding purchased apps. These reviews can influence product-purchasing decisions via polarised sentiment (1 to 5 stars) and user expressed opinion. For developers, reviews are a user-facing crowd-sourced indicator of app quality. Hence, high ratings and positive reviews affect the viability of an app's commercial feasibility. However, it is less clear what information is contained within these reviews, and more importantly, if an analysis of these reviews can inform developers of design priorities as opposed to just influencing purchasing decisions. We analysed 8.7 million reviews from 17,330 apps on the App Store and found that the most frequently used words in user reviews lean toward expressions of sentiment despite employment of only approximately 37% of the words within the English language dictionary. Furthermore, the range of words used to express negative opinions is significantly higher than when positive sentiments are expressed.},

The aspects have emerged through a grounded theory approach where two workshops have been analysed with respect to how the physicality of dolls supported the representation of users through Doll based design: one workshop utilised ludo pieces to represent users and the other used paper silhouettes of human bodies. Based on the identified physical qualities of dolls, the paper offers practitioners' a guide of how to take the physicality of dolls into consideration during the planning and conduct of Doll based design, in order to support the representation of users via dolls in design sessions.},

After two years of usage the system was still not considered to be as supportive as the old system. The users that were required to use the system felt unsure and stressed about whether all information was consulted or not. The users that were less dependent on the system solved the problems by not doing the tasks; instead they let the clerks continue to do the PAS tasks as they did before the deployment. The results indicate that time will not heal usability problems; instead they need to be addressed in other ways.},

Especially, when augmented reality is used in the learning process, a learner can manipulate objects in one's perspective in addition to obtaining knowledge that cannot be experienced in the real world or traditional learning environment. In this case, the learner can directly control objects by using one's creativity or keeping up one's learning pace in accordance with the user's abilities, thus aiding one's learning process rather than merely providing fragmentary knowledge. This paper deals with a prototype application of augmented reality which is intended to improve the learning effect by letting users directly interact with augmented content during the learning process.},

abstract = {Recognition based graphical passwords are inherently vulnerable to shoulder surfing attacks because of their visual mode of interaction. In this paper, we propose and evaluate two novel shoulder-surfing defense techniques for recognition based graphical passwords. These techniques are based on WYSWYE (Where You See is What You Enter) strategy, where the user identifies a pattern of password images within a presented grid of images and replicates it onto another grid. We conducted controlled laboratory experiments to evaluate the usability and security of the proposed techniques. Both the schemes had high login success rates with no failures in authentication. More than seventy percent of participants successfully logged on to the system in their first attempt in both the schemes. The participants were satisfied with the schemes and were willing to use it in public places. In addition, both the schemes were significantly secure against shoulder surfing than normal unprotected recognition based graphical passwords. The login efficiency improved with practice in one of the proposed scheme. We believe, WYSWYE strategy has considerable potential and can easily be extended to other types of authentication systems such as text passwords and PINS.},

abstract = {This paper discusses users' query reformulation behaviour while searching information on the Web. Query reformulations have emerged as an important component of Web search behaviour and human-computer interaction (HCI) because a user's success of information retrieval (IR) depends on how he or she formulates queries. There are various factors, such as cognitive styles, that influence users' query reformulation behaviour. Understanding how users with different cognitive styles formulate their queries while performing Web searches can help HCI researchers and information systems (IS) developers to provide assistance to the users. This paper aims to examine the effects of users' cognitive styles on their query reformation behaviour. To achieve the goal of the study, a user study was conducted in which a total of 3613 search terms and 872 search queries were submitted by 50 users who engaged in 150 scenario-based search tasks. Riding's (1991) Cognitive Style Analysis (CSA) test was used to assess users' cognitive style as wholist or analytic, and verbaliser or imager. The study findings show that users' query reformulation behaviour is affected by their cognitive styles. The results reveal that analytic users tended to prefer Add queries while all other users preferred New queries. A significant difference was found among wholists and analytics in the manner they performed Remove query reformulations. Future HCI researchers and IS developers can utilize the study results to develop interactive and personalised search model, and to provide context-based query suggestions for users.},

Each of the ten interactions was video recorded and analysed to understand the interaction and collaboration between the doctor and nurse. The video recordings were coded and transformed into maps of interaction that were analysed for patterns of activity. The analysis showed that as doctors and nurses became more experienced at using the telehealth stethoscope their collaboration was more effective. The main measure of effectiveness was the number of corrections in stethoscope placement required by the doctor. In early collaborations, the doctors gave many corrections. After several trials, each doctor and nurse had reduced corrections and all pairs reduced their corrections. The significance of this research is the identification of the qualities of effective collaboration in the use of the telehealth stethoscope and telehealth systems more generally.},

A usability inspection of the devices' user interfaces has been performed and integrated with user feedback collected via an online survey taken by 55 totally blind users. Results confirm that VoiceOver makes the Apple devices basically accessible to blind users, but there are still some issues related to usability. Users normally believe that accessibility integrated with VoiceOver is an important innovation, but some operations, such as the writing of long text, take too long or are not comfortable. Results suggest that a multimodal approach on mobile touchscreen devices does not offer a simple and satisfactory interaction paradigm for all and it deserves further investigation. Three possible solutions for improving user interface interaction and offering a simpler and more comfortable experience for blind individuals were proposed to the survey participants, gathering their positive feedback.},

abstract = {Prior works on treemaps have mainly focused on developing the new layouts. The existing treemaps generated from various algorithms require careful examination on design parameter. However, current research does not provide usability studies of treemap guidelines on effectiveness of design parameters. Hence, selecting the most effective parameter for certain type of task is primarily based on intuition preference of visualization designer. For example, in the existing research, there is insufficient guidance on orientation for treemap design yet. Therefore, the impact of orientation remains unclear in visual analysis tasks performance. The contribution of this paper is to assess the effect of orientation in visual data analysis process so that we will further investigate treemap design guidance.},

abstract = {User experience (UX) research has received increasing importance in the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The CHI community has recently recognized a need for a complementary conceptual-theoretical discussion about UX (Obrist et al., 2011). This paper introduces conceptual development work of the notion of UX that aims at understanding the holistic nature of the phenomenon by connecting the temporal and long-term UX to each other. Activity theory by Leontjev, combined with Dewey's concept of an aesthetic experience, provided the theoretical framework for defining the concept of expanded UX (eUX). The concept of eUX is an analytical tool for design of interactive high-tech products. The concept of eUX can be utilized to reach a deeper understanding of UX in the HCI research and practice. This article concentrates on the theoretical exploration of the concept of user experience, excluding empirical studies of phenomenon.},

However, we also record many of our daily life events in a textual form on popular platforms like Facebook or using our smartphones. Such primarily textual lifelogs can also potentially help us in reliving our past memories and sharing them with friends. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of LifeView, a tool for visualizing such primarily textual lifelogs for the purposes of Sentimental Recall and Sharing. We propose to depict life events using cartoons, and claim that it will result in a better recall experience. We also propose that linking the various life interactions based on appropriate context will be useful when people browse their lifelogs. Two within-subject user experiments are presented to validate our design -- results show that a) users prefer cartoon abstractions over the actual lifelog data, and b) contextual linking of life events is useful for goal-oriented navigation and sharing.},

Recent technology developments in smart phones have now made it possible to gather ethnographic data in the field to contribute to different stages of the design process. The combination of smart-phone ethnography and design practice raises new questions about the nature and quality of this hybrid approach. To examine this question, this paper reports on an evaluation of teaching practical workshops to staff and students at RWTH Aachen HCI Center during a funded research exchange by one of the authors. Participants were introduced to the (Stanford) design thinking approach and then smart-phone ethnography with a view to exploring the relationship between both approaches. Follow up surveys examined what potential and challenges these developments offer are explored through evaluative comments by participants.},

Interest within the HCI community surrounding death exists with a growing number of projects focused on innovative technologies and design considerations for online spaces particularly for the bereaved. Limited however, are empirical studies across different website architectures over a longer period of time rather than directly after death. In this study we look at the affordances of three online platforms and analyse the comments made on them in response to the murder of American teenager Anna Svidersky in 2006. The platforms include Anna's MySpace page, a memorial video on YouTube and an online condolence book. We show how the affordances of online environments affect participation by not only friends and family, but also strangers. Based on our study we outline nine design considerations that address issues relating to death and memorialisation online.},

Visiting sites of historical significance is not limited to the cultural experience itself, but can be seen as an opportunity for learning and exploring a place as it is now and as it has been in past times. By investigating the two design dimensions place and time, our application was conceived as a treasure hunt, where users activate content by moving between places and pointing the mobile device in different directions or at different markers. The application was field tested with mixed groups of children and adults. The evaluation indicates that the prototype did encourage both learning and exploring, which also was the design objective.},

A user study has been carried out to investigate the outcome of this adaptation. An adaptive personalized training has been provided to MS patients according to their own individual training progress, which was appreciated by the patients and the therapist. The automatic adjustment of difficulty levels is considered to provide more variety in the training and minimize the therapist's involvement in setting up the training.},

Although research has examined how the use of different representations in computer-mediated environments can either change participants' behavior towards or perceptions of others, there does not seem to be work to see whether behavior towards (or the first-person experience of) an artificial team-mate game can be influenced by differences in the information presented to players. In a 2x2 experiment, 73 participants played two variations of a cooperative game that involved the possibility of team-mate sacrifice -- with either a computer team-mate or human team-mate. In one variation, different scoring information was visible to players, in the other there was no such information. Participant performance/behavior was logged -- and participants were asked to report on the emotional difficulty of the sacrifice situations. Results show that there were differences in how often participants protected their AI team-mates under the different conditions. However, the different conditions did not seem to impact the amount of emotional difficulty players felt in deciding whether to sacrfice their artificial team-mate, suggesting that while behavior was moderated, first-person experience was not.},

abstract = {When playing computer games with team-mates, players obviously place a lot of emphasis on achieving the team's goal and performing well. However, an additional issue is that team-members also care (to varying degrees) about how their team-mates feel about their involvement in the team's activities. What are factors that impact player decisions in team-mate games? The related work falls broadly into attempts to identify behaviors that contribute to better or optimal team performance -- and work that has studied emotional, cultural, and social factors that may cause players to make non-optimal choices or behaviors. This paper reports on work to identify some of the choices that team-mates make out of concern for the experience of their team-mate -- and to identify game features that correlate with these. Specifically, the paper analyzes six team-mate games in terms of team-mate concerns that appeared in the course of empirical studies involving the games. The paper identifies several team-mate concerns that players have, several game factors that correlate with these concerns, and shows how this explains differences in the presence of these concerns for different kinds of team-mate games.},

We attempt to expose the implications of divided attention via a pedestrian simulation that accounts for mobile device use. Of particular interest is the awareness of users in the pedestrian environment, as this may affect the traffic scenario. Our simulation shows that even a small number of users interacting with a mobile device can destabilise pedestrian flow. The proportion of attention loss correlates to the degree of disruption. This has implications for the design of pedestrian-focused applications, as our results suggest pervasive mobile use is changing the nature of pedestrian crowd behaviour.},

We focus on the most natural selection method, i.e. the dwell, with which a user can select an on-screen object by just gazing at it for a pre-defined dwell time.We have looked at three design parameters of the dwell click alternative, namely dwell time, button size and placement of content. Two experiments, with similar user interfaces, were designed and conducted with 21 and 15 participants, respectively. Different combinations of dwell times and button sizes were tested in each experiment for each participant. One experiment had content placed on the buttons to be gazed at, while the other had content placed above the buttons.One important finding is that moving the content outside the clickable areas avoids accidental clicking, i.e. the Midas Touch problem. In such a design, a combination of big buttons and short dwell times are most suited for maximizing accuracy and ease of use, due to a phenomenon identified as the 'gaze-hold' problem.},

abstract = {Technologies that facilitate the collection and sharing of personal information can feed people's desire for enhanced self-knowledge and help them to change their behaviour, yet for various reasons people can also be reluctant to use such technologies. This paper explores this tension through an interview study in the context of smoking cessation. Our findings show that smokers and recent ex-smokers were ambivalent about their behaviour change as well as about collecting personal information through technology and sharing it with other users. We close with a summary of three challenges emerging from such ambivalence and directions to address them.},

abstract = {Touch-based interactions with computing technologies have become commonplace in the last few years, from mobile phones to tabletop surfaces. The sense of touch however is not limited to the hand; the entire skin surface of the body is available for tactile interaction. In architecture, researchers are now investigating the potential of interactive surfaces for future architectonic elements, such as walls, floors and ceilings. Apart from the traditional focus on the visual and spatial design considerations of such elements, tactile interaction with interactive surfaces is of growing interest. We present an interactive folded surface as a prototype of future interactive architectural surfaces. We explain how physiological understandings of touch and tactile interaction informed the design choices of the prototype. Our work contributes to understandings of how the material properties and interactive behaviours of these new surfaces will afford new kinds of human experience centred on the sense of touch.},

We created a test scenario with an object manipulation task and measured the completion times of a combined gaze tracking and non-touch gesture interaction method, with a touch screen only input method. Short interviews were conducted with 13 test subjects and data was gathered through questionnaires. The touch screen method was generally faster than or as fast as the combined gaze and non-touch gesture method. The users thought, however, that gaze tracking was more interesting and showed potential. The gaze tracking would however require more stability to be suitable for use with mobile devices.},

We speculate on the centrality of the sensory and perceptual differences of AS and HFA people as contributing to a better understanding of the role of embodied imagination and creativity as essential aspects of their 'difference' and their distinct patterns of social and cultural relations.},

The study was initiated by the realisation that discussions surrounding the improvement of building performances tend to be about top-down technological solutions rather than to help and encourage bottom-up involvement of building-users. While users are the ultimate beneficiaries and their feedback is always appreciated, their direct involvements in managing buildings would often be regarded as obstruction or distraction. This is largely because casual interventions by uninformed building-users tend to disrupt the system. Some earlier researches showed however that direct and active participation of users could improve the building performance if appropriate training and/or systems were introduced. We also speculate this in long run would also make the built environment more sustainable. With this in mind, we looked for opportunities to retrofit our own office with an interactive layer to study how we could introduce ad-hoc systems for building-users. The aim of this paper is to describe our vision and initial attempts followed by discussion.},

The negative adjective selections made by users related to usability aspects such as uncontrollable, unclear and time-consuming. Also, users did not see the benefit of using an autostereoscopic 3D for the user interface under evaluation.

Or do they actually obstruct communication? To answer these questions, this paper quantitatively compares discussion processes involving paper, an iPad2, and a laptop PC. We performed an experiment where 12 groups of two participants each (24 participants in total) worked collaboratively by referring to documents and using paper, an iPad2, or a laptop PC as presentation media. We observed verbal and non-verbal interaction between participants. First, we investigated the total amount of speech between two participants and found they spoke more when using paper than when using the electronic media. Next, we observed that participants used more demonstrative pronouns when using paper than when using the iPad2 but used more demonstrative pronouns when using the iPad2 than when using the laptop PC. Also, they made more eye contact when using paper than when using the other media. These results suggest that tablets may not currently be the best media to use when ideas should be actively exchanged, sensitivity is required toward other participants in the discussion, or work progress needs to be shared.},

This study shows that gender of the participants, task, and initial body language availability (determined by the field of view) affect perceptions of trust, social presence, dominance/persuasion, impression management, and user-defined body language availability.

We used a questionnaire, rapid prototypes, and a co-design workshop to retrieve user data and to develop the concepts. The goal of the study was to form design drivers for a functional prototype that would be evaluated in a real world context. The main determinants affecting the service design in our case were Design base, Concept/Product, Domain/Context, Users, Company, and Resources.

Designers are able to learn from these "new" digital experiences in order to reinterpret and apply new methods and theories to traditional print based information technologies for the benefit of the user. This research endeavours to develop an enhanced method of presenting and navigating statistical information in a printed medium through the use of interactive methods. The fields of print, hypertext and information visualisation inform the development, with a view to create cognitive awareness in readers, as well as their ability to build information relationships. In both hypertext environments and information visualisations the clarity of context and structure play key roles in the successful presentation of the relationships between aspects of information. Through the process of a Design-Analyse-Refine methodology, a range of designs for unifying these forms of media were explored and analysed. This produced a single design solution where the strengths of print are being interwoven with those of hypertext and data visualisation.},

This study analyses three current evidence presentation applications for the iPad for their individual usability qualities, and against the requirements established. The study identified deficiencies in the three applications tested, particularly in the area of document annotation. As a result we propose a number of design principles that will ideally improve the usability of evidence presentation applications for iPads and other tablet technologies. This study will be extended to include different tablet operating systems, and focus on the changes in the design principles that are dependent on available tablet work area size.},

The project explored how to raise consciousness about distressing technology development through dialogue with old and young people. When reviewing our work it struck us that we had overlooked that some of the prototypes designed by the young participants called for embodied participation. We had naively expected to see sheer technology innovations of the future. Here we reflect on sensitivities for the bodily/physical will to interact.We also discuss everyday life situations that could allow for natural physical engagement as a health benefit. Physical aspects are typically of little consideration in design projects, apart from projects that has body-movement as specific focus. We seek ways to adequately include a critical perspective in future design and to consider physical aspects more broadly in ICT projects for a human sustainable future. In many cases, the young participants showed us their concern for sustainability and well-being of both the environment and themselves and demonstrated through their prototypes a willingness to contribute through physical interaction.},

abstract = {The development and adoption of technology for the classroom is changing the way education is delivered and perceived by students. The availability of Interactive Whiteboard (IWB) technology in New Zealand classrooms is increasing. With this change in technology comes a change in the way educational resource material is presented to students. Significantly, there is a paucity of scholarly research regarding the presentation of typographic information that is efficient and effective for children's' reading and learning on screen. This research assisted in gaining an overview of the types of material and resources being used on IWB in New Zealand classrooms and the quality, readability and legibility of the typographic content of this material. This paper seeks to propose cursory considerations for typographic presentation on IWB as discovered through both interviews with students and the observations of the researcher. This experiment seeks to identify whether typographic factors are being used effectively when displaying text for children's reading on IWB's and to investigate children's preferences and issues with typographic elements.},

abstract = {Cross-cultural design has become an area in HCI that needs more research in order to be able to respond to the demands of globalization and emerging markets. Agile ways of gathering local user data are needed to help designers to create better products and services and minimize the risk of failing in the target market areas. The aim of this paper is to introduce approaches related to cross-cultural design focusing on the advantages and challenges of web-surveys in international UX evaluation. Web-surveys allow quickly reaching remotely a vast amount of users in different corners of the world. We looked at two case studies where web-surveys were used to collect UX data about online services in different countries. We found that UX web-surveys were fast to implement and very suitable for a cross-cultural user sample that has access to Internet. We argue that UX web-surveys have potential to gather user data even from larger areas than now, as ubiquitous technology products and services are getting accessible for wider user groups.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a multi-faceted approach for engaging older adults in the design and evaluation of a tablet application. Our approach consisted of five key elements: 1) involving care providers in the research, 2) conducting social events, 3) supporting use of the technology through scaffolding, 4) providing multiple channels of communication between participants and researchers, and 5) progressively revealing the technology functions. We explored this approach with seven participants (aged 71-92) who used a prototype iPad application to engage in peer-to-peer communication. We found that each of the five elements contributed to successfully engaging older people in the development and evaluation process. This paper provides insights into suitable approaches for designing technologies with older users, illustrating the importance of creating a supportive environment and employing strategies that help to build participants' confidence, both in using the technology and in participating in the design and evaluation process.},

To investigate this, a system (called Emotishare) was built to facilitate this type of communication and track the emotion sharing behaviours of participants when using the system.Emotishare is a web and mobile platform that allows its users to track, share and respond to the emotional states of their friends. The system has been trialled with both large and small groups to explore the possibility for support of emotion communication using this type of service. It was found that small groups were most effective for supporting the sharing of emotional state and that mobile devices were best suited to support the sharing of personal information such as emotional state.},

User's ability to remember the different meanings represented by the visual cues as well as discriminating those cues from each other determine their ability to better manage categorical notifications. We explored two types of each spatial, colour and shape cues to eliminate the differences of those cues. Findings suggest superior results by spatial cues while better selection of colour/shape cues is influenced by linguistic associations of the cues. Visual cues' ability to represent categories indicates the control of interruptive notifications as well as potential replacement of textual representations.},

abstract = {Graphical password authentication was developed based on the premise that humans are better at recognizing visual data than text-based information. Most recognition-based graphical password algorithms (e.g. Passface) possess adequate usability features but are prone to password guessing and shoulder surfing attacks. The recall-based algorithms on the other hand contain fewer number of usability features but provide a set of strong security features for authentication. The proposed algorithm developed in this research integrates the usability attributes of the Passface recognition based and security features of a recognition-based (i.e. WIW (Man et al. 2003)) and Passpoint recall-based algorithms to overcome the drawbacks of existing designs. The security of the proposed algorithm was evaluated by carrying out shoulder-surfing and password guessing attacks. Usability features such as simplicity to learn, memorize and remember the password were evaluated by measuring the number of forgotten, mistyped passwords and login time for each individual user. A questionnaire was also designed and distributed to test subjects to gather feedback on several usability aspects of the proposed algorithm. The results of the security test and survey illustrate that the proposed algorithm has strong security measures against shoulder surfing and password guessing.},

abstract = {While the usability of GUI design methods has been studied in general, the usability of layout specification methods is largely unexplored.In this paper we provide an empirical comparison of two popular GUI layout models, grid-bag layout and constraint-based layout. While the grid-bag layout is a powerful layout model, the constraint-based layout is able to generate even more general and flexible layout configurations. We performed a controlled experiment with postgraduate students of Computer Science and Software Engineering, measuring efficiency, accuracy and preference for typical layout specification and editing tasks.The results show significant differences between both layout models: the initial specification of GUIs is faster with a grid-bag layout whereas editing of existing complex layouts is faster and more accurate with a constraint-based layout. The study shows that constraint-based layout, although it may seem more complicated at first glance, can compete with and in some cases even outperform more conventional techniques in terms of their usability.},
