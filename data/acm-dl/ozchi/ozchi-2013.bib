abstract = {University campuses have thousands of new students, staff and visitors every year. For those who are unfamiliar with the campus environment, an effective pedestrian navigation system is essential to orientate and guide them around the campus. Compared to traditional navigation systems, such as physical signposts and digital map kiosks, a mobile pedestrian navigation system provides advantages in terms of mobility, sensing capabilities, weather-awareness when the user is on the go. However, how best to design a mobile pedestrian navigation system for university campuses is still vague due to limited research in understanding how pedestrians interact with the system, and what information is required for traveling in a complex environment such as university campus. In this paper, we present a mobile pedestrian navigation system called QUT Nav. A field study with eight participants was run in a university campus context, aiming to identify key information required in a mobile pedestrian navigation system for user traveling in university campuses. It also investigated user's interactions and behaviours while they were navigating in the campus environment. Based on the results from the field study, a recommendation for designing mobile pedestrian navigation systems for university campuses is stated.},

While large-scale studies have identified different types of pedestrian navigation behaviour, far less data exists for classifying navigators by the technology they use. We report on a study that presented pedestrian users with multiple navigation interfaces in order to gain insight on usage preferences. We create a classification of users based on observed usage behavior that would be helpful for designing pedestrian navigation aids.},

abstract = {Even though web security protocols are designed to make computer communication secure, it is widely known that there is potential for security breakdowns at the human-machine interface. This paper examines findings from a qualitative study investigating the identification of security decisions used on the web. The study was designed to uncover how security is perceived in an individual user's context. Study participants were tertiary qualified individuals, with a focus on HCI designers, security professionals and the general population. The study identifies that security frameworks for the web are inadequate from an interaction perspective, with even tertiary qualified users having a poor or partial understanding of security, of which they themselves are acutely aware. The result is that individuals feel they must protect themselves on the web. The findings contribute a significant mapping of the ways in which individuals reason and act to protect themselves on the web. We use these findings to highlight the need to design for trust at three levels, and the need to ensure that HCI design does not impact on the users' main identified protection mechanism: separation.},

This paper aims to provide a better understanding on cool as a concept from a theoretical and a practical perspective. From the theoretical perspective, we selected the HCI papers that focus on cool and we present their core findings. Then we performed a literature review on the concept of cool and we have identified its fundamental characteristics, through cool personalities and cool styles. From a practical perspective, we have studied how other domains have managed to successfully produce cool objects and we provide four suggestions on how to design cool digital artifacts. Finally, in this paper we also identify possible research directions in relation to cool, which if we manage to address we can increase our understanding on what is user experience and this can lead to the creation of better digital artifacts. Overall, this paper is a contribution towards researching and designing for cool, a research topic, which we believe it will initiate fruitful discussions in the HCI field.},

abstract = {We investigated the effect of language in answering qualitative questions in user experience (UX) evaluation web-surveys. Two cross-cultural case studies of high tech sports watches with altogether 176 participants were carried out. Comparisons in answers were made among 72 native English speakers and 104 non-native English speakers. In the first study native Italian and native English speaking users were compared. Half of the Italians answered in Italian and half of them in English. We found that the response rate for participating to the survey among Italians answering in their native language was 64 % compared to only 38% among Italians answering in English. The results of our case studies indicate that translating a UX web-survey into participants' native language would motivate users to participate in the study, especially if the user sample needs to include more varied users. It is easier to describe more in details and give examples of experiences, express emotions, feelings and ideas in one's own native language. The results suggest that if more descriptive qualitative data is needed from users, they are able to answer better in their own native language.},

abstract = {A novel framework is proposed to capture the variability in end user designed gestures and extract archetypal patterns from a pool of gestures sourced from multiple participants. The primary objective is to identify a gesture library that is preferred by the end user population so as to control a human avatar in a 3D virtual environment using whole-of-body gestures. By adapting a group based user centric study, different gesture designs from 36 participants were elicited. Analysis shows that the existing techniques are incapable of extracting archetypal patterns in gestures from such an unconstrained gesture space. As such, a formal notation, followed by hierarchical clustering, is used to provide an abstract representation of gesture designs and then to distil the archetypal gesture patterns from the pool of highly variable gestures. User acceptance of the extracted gestures was performed for validation and common motion patterns were identified from the provided user ratings. The gesture library selected by the framework is compared against the gesture library extracted based on the user ranking, and the similarities and differences between two gesture libraries are presented.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel interactive method that handles the 4-D viewing direction via the pick and move operation of principal vanishing points displayed in 3-D space. The principal vanishing points are represented by projecting the points at infinity in the directions of the 4-D principal coordinate axes onto 3-D space. Since the principal vanishing points are associated with the 4-D visual axis, they act as a landmark when users move in 4-D space. We utilize them as an interface of the 4-D viewing direction control to achieve intuitive 4-D interaction. Using the proposed method, we construct an interactive system that enables users to observe 3-D perspective drawings of 4-D data from an arbitrary 4-D viewing direction at an arbitrary 4-D position. Moreover, translating the 4-D eye-point along the 4-D viewing direction, the proposed system provides the 4-D first-person fly-through. The results of the user experiments show that the proposed system has a sufficient usability and an efficiency for 4-D interaction.},

abstract = {3D output is no longer limited to large screens in cinemas or living rooms. Nowadays more and more mobile devices are equipped with autostereoscopic 3D (S3D) touchscreens. As a consequence interaction with 3D content now also happens whilst users are on the move. In this paper we carried out a user study with 27 participants to assess how mobile interaction, i.e. whilst walking, with mobile S3D devices, differs from interaction with 2D mobile touchscreens. We investigate the difference in touch accuracy between 2D touchscreens and mobile S3D touchscreens and evaluate the minimum touch target size for mobile S3D touchscreens. The contributions of this paper are twofold: Firstly, we found the increase in minimum touch target size caused by walking was larger for a mobile S3D UI than for a 2D UI. Secondly, we present touch target sizes and aspect ratios required for reliable user interaction in each case. Additionally we examined differences in the angle at which users held the mobile S3D device compared to a 2D mobile device. We found that mobile S3D caused users to hold the device at a different angle when walking, compared to the 2D case. This first study of its kind provides valuable information to developers of the next generation of UIs and applications for mobile S3D displays and devices.},

Though mouse dynamics is generally being explored as a biometric technology, we intend to adapt and enhance this usage for detecting pattern changes in user behaviour as cognitive load is varied. The scope of this paper is limited to analysing mouse interaction data generated during a larger multitier experiment (aimed at investigating effects of cognitive load on organisational trust). Mouse events data is from 88 subjects, each of which completed two different tasks (labelled T1 &amp; T3) twice (under randomized order of high and low cognitive load levels). High cognitive load was induced using standard dual-task design. This paper brings forth core issues in mouse activity analysis and focuses on pause/break activity as possible indicator of cognitive load (in the context of performed experiment). Significant differences were found in extracted features from contemplation and hesitation type pause categories and future course of study charted.},

Selection of targets was split into rounds of 20 (separated by a short break) in order to evaluate whether fatigue affected performance or whether performance improved/declined over time. The results found that gestural interaction performed much worse than touch and mouse interaction and recorded 3 times as many miss-selections. The poor results for gestural interaction were attributed to participant unfamiliarity and inaccuracies of the gesture-sensing device (Microsoft Kinect). Touch interaction performed comparably with mouse interaction although suffered with smaller targets due to occlusion and the impreciseness of a finger compared to a mouse cursor. Overall, performance remained fairly consistent over subsequent rounds. Fatigue did not have any effect.},

The findings have been placed into a taxonomy of needs, which can feed into the design of tools that aim to assist creative coders. The paper concludes by discussing the implications the taxonomy of needs has on defining requirements for a creativity support tool in the Processing environment.},

abstract = {In recent years we have seen a growing interest in proxemic interaction within HCI. In order to explore proxemic interaction that spans across separate locations, we have developed a functional prototype of a multi-room music system, called AirPlayer, and performed a field evaluation. The system implements proxemic interactions on top of an existing Apple AirPlay based platform. The added features allow music to follow the user around the house and provide a smartphone app which can adapt to the current location of the user. The prototype was deployed in two households over a three week period, where data was collected through logging, user-written diaries and interviews. What the field evaluation has revealed is a number of interesting findings specifically regarding the importance of a simple interaction, the power of discrete zones to provide a local interaction, the importance and challenge of understanding background interactions and challenges in designing interaction with music in discrete zones.},

Various gestures allow interaction with the scene to adjust brush size, augment the virtual form and orient the user's view. Several verbal commands offer system-wide commands to return the scene to its initial state, reset the camera position, and undo interactions.Test participants use these interactions to transform a spherical "blob" into a teapot by extruding the spout and handle and flattening the top. A survey completed by the participants has indicated that this action is enjoyable and immersive.},

Since mobile devices are typically always-on and often in peripheral vision, they are candidate ambient displays that might convey presence. We tested a MAP app for tablet computers, finding that it sustained connection in two settings where high-fidelity communication media were considered intrusive. In this paper we discuss the advantages and challenges of mobile ambient presence and the contexts in which it could be put to use.},

Devices for in-air gestural recognition are also increasing in commercial availability. Appropriate attributes that make up natural in-air gestures have yet to be uniformly established, especially in relation to their use in the comfort of the home environment. Three studies were conducted, each informing the focus and construction of a gesture-recognition prototype for the following study. The preferred attributes of in-air gestures were examined; their use in conjunction with other modalities, the motion of in-air gestures, and feedback delay and transition time of an action as instigated by an in-air gesture. Our findings indicate natural actions that precede in-air gestures, topographical correlations between gesture and system response, and a desire for minimal effort. These results can be used as guidelines for the design of in-air gestures and systems for their recognition in environments within and beyond the home.},

Testing showed that the controller is able to provide accurate tracking of hands and fingers, and to track movement. This detection loses accuracy when the hand moves into a position that obstructs the controller's ability to view, such as when the hand rotates and is perpendicular to the controller. The detection also fails when individual elements of the hands are brought together, such as finger to finger. In both of these circumstances, the controller is unable to read or track the hand. There is potential for the use of this technology for recognising Auslan, however further development of the Leap Motion API is required.},

They provide students with natural ways to interact with collaborators, and can help teachers create and manage learning tasks that can be carried out both in the classroom and at a distance. But how can these emerging technologies be successfully integrated into current teaching practice? This paper proposes an approach to integrate, from the technological perspective, collaborative learning activities using these kinds of devices. Our approach is based on the concept of orchestration, which tackles the critical task for teachers to coordinate student's learning activities within the constraints of authentic educational settings. Our studies within authentic learning settings enabled us to identify three main elements that are important for ubiquitous and pervasive learning settings. These are i) regulation mechanisms, ii) interconnection with existing web-based learning environments, and iii) awareness tools.},

This application contains a fictional story about a zombie apocalypse and provides runners with various quests (in the form of missions) to complete during their run. We investigated different aspects of participants' experience with the application and how it changed their running. Our findings show how the app changed running in three major ways. Firstly, it changed the way runs were organised. Secondly, it shook up established running routines. And lastly, it shaped the meanings associated with running.},

Current research into mobile app reviews has provided an insight into the statistical distributions, but there is minimal knowledge about the content in these reviews. In particular, we do not know if the aggregated numerical rating is a reliable indicator of the information within a review. This work reports on an analysis of reviews to determine how closely aligned the numerical ratings are to the textual description.

We no longer see it as solely the responsibility of governments or large corporations, but we are asking ourselves how we as individuals can contribute to the well-being and maintenance of the world we live in. This paper explores the use of mobile persuasive technology to promote pro-environmental behaviour in the home. We have designed, implemented, deployed and evaluated two mobile systems in two different domains, in two different countries. The novelty in this research is that the theoretical outcomes from two different but related studies are analysed together. From this we have discovered eight overarching persuaders to sustainable domestic resource consumption. The fact that these concepts are common to both studies strengthens the generalisability of our findings. The contribution of this paper to HCI is a set of eight key concepts to consider when designing mobile persuasive technology to promote pro-environmental behaviour.},

Contributing towards four important knowledge gaps in the research, we explore eco-feedback over longer time scales, focusing on instances where the feedback was not of lasting benefit to users rather than when it was. Drawing from 23 semi-structured interviews with Australian householders, we found that an initially high level of engagement gave way over time to disinterest, neglect and in certain cases, technical malfunction. Additionally, preconceptions concerned with the "purpose" of the feedback were found to affect use. We propose expanding the scope of enquiry for eco-feedback in several ways, and describe how eco-feedback that better supports decision-making in the "maintenance phase", i.e. once the initial novelty has worn off, may be key to longer term engagement.},

abstract = {Mainstream food growing practices around the world call in to question our future food security, and in particular the sustainability of food consumption in urban centres. At the same time there has been a dramatic recent increase in grassroots urban food-growing communities in the UK and beyond. This paper looks at how research in sustainable human-computer interaction (HCI) can support better social and environmental practices through a focus on urban food-growing communities. In this paper we respond to recent work within sustainable HCI. We report on a field study at an urban city farm in inner London which took a participatory research approach with staff and volunteers. We discuss the values, needs and practices of the farm community which have emerged from the fieldwork. We conclude with a discussion of the implications and opportunities for designing with computational technology to help inform the conceptualisation of sustainable HCI and to serve as a resource for designers engaging with urban food-growing communities.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the use of volumetric shadows for enhancing three-dimensional perception and action in third-person motion games. They offer an alternative to previously studied cues and visual guides. Our preliminary survey revealed that from the games that require Kinect, 37% rely primarily on a third-person view and 9% on a first-person view. We conducted a user study where 30 participants performed object reaching, interception, and aiming tasks in six different graphical modes of a video game that was controlled using a Kinect sensor and PlayStation Move controllers. The study results indicate that different volumetric shadow cues can affect both the user experience and the gameplay performance positively or negatively, depending on the lighting setup. Qualitative user experience analysis shows that playing was found to be most easy and fluent in a typical virtual reality setting with stereo rendering and flat surface shadows.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are becoming more and more important in our daily life, with larger and larger screens. It seems to be no doubt that the larger the screen, the better readability we can achieve. However, there is no sufficient research about how screen size affects readability. We aim at doing such a thorough study. In this paper, we conduct an experiment with twenty-four participants to investigate the relationship between screen size and the Chinese reading effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction. The results indicate that, although reading seems to be easier on larger screen, screen size has no definitely influences on reading effectiveness or efficiency, except that reading on larger screens are definitely easier. Moreover, mobility, price and usability of the mobile devices are the key issues that customers treasure most. Therefore, according to our experiment results, we conclude that screen size smaller than 7 inch for mobile phones and about 10.1 inches for Tabs are preferable for mobile users.},

We assumed that people do not want to be disturbed of their watching experience by a large graphic user interface (GUI), which occludes TV contents. In this paper, we propose a new concept of interface called One-line GUI, a compressed GUI placed at the bottom of the TV screen, and which is manipulated with optimized physical user interface (PUI). Minimized GUI will not occlude the TV contents and support necessary task of ITV simultaneously with integrated manipulation system. To evaluate usability, we conducted user study to compare interface between the conventional ITV and One-line GUI. The result shows that the participants could perform the task better without difficulty with One-line GUI.},

abstract = {Many graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are customizable. While there are many approaches to user interface customization, most of them are fairly simplistic, e.g., they only allow users to customize menus and toolbars. However, one can think of more advanced customization approaches that allow more complex GUI layout customizations and even functional customization. Functional customization goes deeper into the application logic and makes it possible to change the behavior of an application. In this paper we target two open questions: (1) Are technical users able to use such advanced customization approaches? (2) Would technical users apply such approaches in practice?We introduce prototypical systems for layout and functional customization of GUIs. In a user study, these systems were evaluated to address the research questions mentioned above. 18 technical users were given customization tasks for three layout and two functional customization scenarios. The participants were observed during the tasks and were asked to complete questionnaires. The results indicate that users are able to use the proposed customization systems, and would also employ them in practice. This suggests that it would be beneficial to include such customization facilities into current and future applications.},

With the simple tools, people still perform variety of tasks. This paper analyzes the tasks performed in remote conference tools running on general purpose PCs or tablets, and categorizes them into different types based on their characteristics. We performed a controlled user experiment to discover behavioral differences observed from each type of the tasks using eye trackers. The study revealed that users showed different behavioral patterns for different task types in both subjective reporting and the eye gaze data. Based on the results, we also provide a general guideline for the screen configuration of a remote conference tool.},

Physical interfaces suffer from interaction complexities leading to usage difficulty and poor acceptance by the end-users. Meanwhile, the usability techniques focus on the overall usability issues while overlooking the in-depth physicality aspects of the interface and interaction. This study proposes a physicality-focused quantitative evaluation method to assist the embedded system developers in managing the interaction complexities of their products. The acceptance of the embedded system developers towards the proposed method was assessed by means of a user study. The results suggested their strong acceptance. The aim of this study is to re-emphasise the natural physical aspects of embedded system interfaces leading to intuitive interaction.},

Traditionally, such displays have been static and non-interactive, and past research has shown that users of such displays (both non-interactive and interactive) are often oblivious to them; a term commonly known as 'display blindness'.In this paper, we describe the results from a field study that was conducted on a gesture-based PID, to observe interactivity with the display over a number of different experiment conditions. Over a period of 120 days, a total of 2,468 people approached the display. Results show that 71% proceeded to face the display, and from this, 62% of these people proceeded to interact with the display, with average interaction sessions lasting 28 seconds. Results from this study provide valuable insight into interaction sessions with interactive PIDs, as well as an essential baseline for future studies into PID interactivity.},

Through this, we are able to provide a snapshot of the types, extent and foci of both research and commercial efforts. It has also revealed trends, opportunities, as well as gaps for how HCI could proceed when engaging more deeply with the IoT.

With the techniques of multimodal behavior observation and knowledge science, we propose a method of location-based activity analysis to extract the explicit or tacit roles of location in human activities and to express the spatial contexts of the world. We confirmed that location-based estimation of real-world spatial contexts enables a close approximation of the contexts of real-world people. We also showed that spatial contexts can be multidi-rectionally understood by accumulating, comparing, and integrating the results of spatial interpretations made by people with different attributes and different viewpoints. The estimated spatial contexts can be used for onsite and offsite support services that consider the inherent characteristics of each location and potential human needs arising at each location.},

We go on the notion that this information can be used as a kind of extended memory to support insights into our past and our present lives. However, as we argue in this paper, the psychological processes and consequences underlying the interpretation of this data can be significantly more complex and less predictable than has generally been acknowledged.Specifically we look at two phenomena: first, that of re-interpretation (that events are reinterpreted every time we recall them) and second, that humans participate in ironic processes such that even self-control goals can become obstacles to behavior change. In this paper we put forward that as we design life-logging systems, personal informatics or quantified-self technologies in future, will need to better find ways to take into account this psychological complexity in order to be effective and avoid inadvertent harm. We also briefly review theoretical frameworks and psychological evidence that may inform the way we design such systems going forward.},

abstract = {Key functionality for interactive tabletops to provide effective collaboration affordances requires touch identification, where each touch is matched to the right user. This can be valuable to provide adaptive functions, personalisation of content, collaborative gestures and capture of differentiated interaction for real-time or further analysis. While there is increased attention on touch-identification mechanisms, currently there is no developed solution to readily enhance available tabletop hardware to include such functionality. This paper proposes a plug-in system that adds touch identification to a conventional tabletop. It also presents an analysis tool and the design of an evaluation suite to inform application designers of the effectiveness of the system to differentiate users. We illustrate its use by evaluating the solution under a number of conditions of: scalability (number of users); activity density; and multi-touch gestures.

abstract = {In this article we first present a new hybrid technique that combines existing time- and touch-point-based approaches to simulate pressure detection on standard touchscreens. Results of two user studies show that the new hybrid technique can distinguish (at least) two pressure levels, where the first requires on average 1.04 N and the second 3.24 N force on the surface. Then, we present a novel pressure-based predictive text entry technique that utilizes our hybrid pressure detection to enable users to bypass incorrect predictions by applying extra pressure on the next key. For inputting short English phrases with 10% non-dictionary words a comparison with conventional text entry in a study showed that the new technique increases entry speed by 9% and decreases error rates by 25%. Also, most users (83%) favour the new technique.},

The method can be used in real-life setups and does not assume any predefined conditions. Moreover, it does not require any additional expensive hardware. It fits well into user's environment without major changes and hence can be used in ambient intelligence paradigm. Another contribution is the interaction using glass which is a natural, yet challenging environment to interact with. We introduce the concept of "invisible information layer" embedded into normal window glass that is used as an interaction medium thereafter.},

Hence, this paper introduces our solution, TorteMail, a new email solution intended to increase the speed and improve the organization of email. TorteMail is born from first hand research and investigation in current trends of email sorting and is hence comprised of both a new sorting approach to email and a innovative email format combining traditional multimedia content with form interface elements.},

Like the telephone, it is hard to imagine a workplace without them.Email, which was designed as a simple one-to-one communication tool, is used today for everything from broadcasting communications to project, information and business process management. The resulting information overload, coupled with the availability of newer social collaboration tools, has highlighted major challenges to the current use cases for email.Despite these challenges, email use is expected to continue growing---but at a slower pace than some of the newer capabilities such as blogs, micro blogging, wikis, social file sharing, social communications and video collaboration. Email will retain relevance as a key business collaboration tool by evolving towards a more integrated approach with these newer interfaces. This evolution into a social email experience takes users to an integrated social environment in which they can switch seamlessly between the right tools for the right tasks.},

The user research in this student design challenge project revealed that there are people who receive more work related emails per hour than they can respond to. This causes stress and performance anxiety in the long run. Our hypothesis is that these individuals would prefer to receive only the relevant messages and over the most suitable communication channel (e.g. phone calls, instant messaging, etc.). We propose a playful and tangible system that makes the sender more aware of the workload the recipient is under. We postulate that this system would lower the amount of irrelevant emails being sent, as users would have to reconsider the importance of their messages.},

However, social learning, inspiration and collaboration between coworkers do not come naturally. In particular in (semi-) public spaces, the behavioural norm among unacquainted coworkers is to work in individual silos without taking advantage of social learning or collaboration opportunities. This paper presents results from a pilot study of 'Gelatine' -- a system that facilitates shared encounters between coworkers by allowing them to digitally 'check in' at a work space. Gelatine displays skills, areas of interest, and needs of currently present coworkers on a public screen. The results indicate that the system amplifies users' sense of place and awareness of other coworkers, and serves as an interface for social learning through exploratory, opportunistic and serendipitous inspirations, as well as through helping users identify like-minded peers for follow-up face-to-face encounters. We discuss how Gelatine is perceived by users with different pre-entry motivations, and discuss users' challenges as well as non-use of the system.},

The application logged the interaction of students collaborating to solve ill-defined problems. Teachers analysed recorded videos of the application trials to inform the subsequent pattern detection step. The automated interaction logs were then analysed to discover the hidden patterns of interaction that are suitable to evaluate the achievement of each student. The analysis also looked for patterns to detect students need for inter-activity feedback, besides patterns to identify leaders and free riders.},

abstract = {The design of applications for dynamic ridesharing or carpooling is often formulated as a matching problem of connecting people with an aligned set of transport needs within a reasonable interval of time and space. This problem formulation relegates social connections to being secondary factors. Technology assisted ridesharing applications that put the matching problem first have revealed that they suffer from being unable to address the factor of social comfort, even after adding friend features or piggybacking on social networking sites. This research aims to understand the fabric of social interactions through which ridesharing happens. We take an online observation approach in order to understand the fabric of social interactions for ridesharing that is happening in highly subscribed online groups of local residents. This understanding will help researchers to identify design challenges and opportunities to support ridesharing in local communities. This paper contributes a fundamental understanding of how social interactions and social comfort precede rideshare requests in local communities.},

abstract = {In this paper, we examine challenges people face in situations of disrupted network infrastructures and how people use surviving portions of technology to cope with these challenges. We show how an important aspect in crises is the disturbance of services caused by disruptions in underlying technological structures. In such situations, people resort to all possible means to "reconstruct normality" in the sense of restoring their ability to communicate. For doing so, people often make creative use of the remains of the technological landscape. Building on the analysis of interviews with crises witnesses and first responders, external reports and scientific literature, we propose and describe three categories of mechanisms involving the creative use of surviving technology in crisis situations. We argue that studying these mechanisms can provide a key source of inspiration to define qualities of resilient architectures, and use these mechanisms as creative input to propose architectural qualities that can potentially make communication systems more resilient in the face of crises.},

abstract = {We present a review of literature from the fields of gerontology, gerontechnology, HCI and government policy that deals with social and technical solutions for the ageing population. We highlight common assumptions about ageing people, which we argue are still embedded in much of the research related to the domain of ageing. This paper challenges six common assumptions across four broad themes that we identified in the literature. It aims to provide a reminder and resource for designers to eschew assumptions during designing technology for 'older' users.},

The research was conducted with a group of older adults participating in the ageing-well activity program of a local council. The project assists older adults to discover and to increase their technology use in a familiar group setting. Building on established interests such as family history, cooking and movies, the study investigates how mobile technology can further these activity groups. The project aims to explore how mobile technology can be integrated in group settings (1) and to develop games suitable for these different settings (2). The paper makes recommendations for game play in older adults' activity groups using touch tablets.},

The project aims to contribute to dementia care while addressing a significant gap in current literature. Research includes observations and two system trials exploring contrasting musical scenarios: the performance of abstract electronic music and the distributed performance of J. S. Bach's Goldberg Variations. Findings presented in this paper suggest that dementia people are able to successfully perform and engage in collaborative music performance activities with little or no scaffolded instruction.},

abstract = {Using Social Network Sites (SNS) as an information source has drawn the attention of the researchers for a while now. There have been many works that analyzed the types and topics of questions people ask in these networks and why. Topics like what motivate people to answer such queries, how to integrate the traditional search engines and SNS together are also well investigated. In this paper, we focus on a relevant but novel issue - how SNS search varies in developed and developing regions of the world and why. Analyzing 880 status messages collected from a widely used SNS, we have observed that, unavailability and inadequacy of information on web in developing countries play a significant role to motivate users using SNS for information retrieval. With established statistics of Internet usage, e-Governance, and our experimental data analysis, we have tried to emphasize the differences between social search and traditional web-search and provided insight that one might require to consider while developing any application for SNS based searching.},

It has long been posited that a single search box (like Google) that searched a range of library resources would solve these problems and make users more effective information seekers in libraries. In this paper we use log analysis to compare user search behaviour in a single search box system with that in a traditional library catalogue. We discover that behaviour varies in response to the results produced by the different systems.},

abstract = {HCI is taught as a core course in most computing programmes in universities worldwide as it is critical to the successful use of technology. The success of undergraduate HCI education can be gauged from their final year project (FYP) through their ability to reflect, integrate and apply their HCI knowledge. However, the extent of use of HCI knowledge in application development amongst students is unknown. This paper intends to fill in the gaps of HCI education and its application in practice as it attempts to uncover students' ability to apply their HCI knowledge in their FYP as an immediate outcome to evaluate the success of HCI education. The study was conducted in the context of Malaysian ICT tertiary education using IIUM as a case study. A content analysis of FYP reports was conducted to identify the use of HCI techniques in the application development including HCI evaluation. The result of the analysis indicates that most students conducted User Acceptance Testing but not HCI evaluation. The findings have implications for the need to review the teaching and learning of HCI, while attempting to strengthen the symbiotic collaboration among HCI academics, industrial partners and government agencies in the wake of increasing market demand for usability and user experience experts.},

Participatory design could improve outcomes but is difficult to pursue in the mental health context. By working with a research-focused clinic we have been able to employ participatory design methods over a period of three years to develop and test an online therapy for young people with psychosis. This paper discusses our methods and results in the light of existing design frameworks for youth mental health, and reports experiences which will be useful for other researchers in the field. We have found that participatory approaches are indeed challenging in the mental health context, but can result in technology that is efficacious and acceptable to young people.},

abstract = {A shortage in clientele at university-based psychology clinics represents a significant challenge to patient-based practical skills training. Although supplementary methods of skill development (e.g., role-plays) are embraced within these programs, it may be argued that these methods offer a relatively diluted simulation of the psychological assessment process. Recently, virtual patients have been proposed as an attractive avenue for augmenting these traditional training methods. The current paper explores the potential benefits of using critical-cue inventories in the advancement of virtual patient technologies in psychological assessment. The piece briefly details a study which aimed to elicit cue-based information from experienced mental health practitioners, which may be embedded in simulations of the initial stages of psychological assessment. Preliminary findings are presented, and future directions discussed.},

In this paper we use HCI to examine the success of a program premised on the social use of technology in safe offline spaces. Participants typically go through stages of object-centred and computer-mediated communication before engaging in face-to-face interaction. We use the concepts of third place, social distance and ticket-to-talk to explain how this hybrid space helps 'Aspies' engage comfortably in social interaction.},

abstract = {Underground mines are hazardous environments. With more and more high-tech machines being introduced in mines, mine operators are under pressure of keeping machinery running smoothly as well as maintaining safety. To address this issue we have developed a remote guiding system called ReMoTe to allow an offsite expert to guide and monitor real time an onsite mining operator. This system brings offsite expertise to operators when and where it is needed (and in doing so supporting on-the-job training) and in the same time providing operators with the ability to monitor their level of stress (self monitoring) as well as allowing shift supervisor to remotely monitor their staff stress level. In our view the combination of these two services is key to increasing the productivity of the mines while supporting operators' safety. This paper describes ReMoTe and discusses how safety concerns are addressed in the design and evaluation of it.},

However, by extracting meaningful information from audio, such as the spoken words and acoustic noise, we have created a Treemap-based interface which makes the task of finding the important information in audio simple. When applied to lecture audio, our interface allows students to easily consume lecture recordings by only listening to the parts they are interested in. A user study shows that our interface can successfully help users to find content in lecture recordings.},

Control of prosody information in synthesized speech output is based on the visual appearance of the text, which can be manipulated with touch gestures. Users could create/modify contents using their mobile phone (SpeechPlay Mobile application) and publish/share their work on a large screen (SpeechPlay Surface). Initial user reactions suggest that the correlation between the visual appearance of a text phrase and the resulting audio was intuitive. While it is possible to make the speech output more expressive, users could easily distort the naturalness of the voice in a fun manner. This could also be a useful tool for music composers and for training new musicians.},
