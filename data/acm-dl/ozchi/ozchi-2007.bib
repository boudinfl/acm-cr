abstract = {Mobile and ubiquitous computing systems are increasingly of interest to HCI researchers. Often, this has meant considering the ways in which we might migrate desktop applications and everyday usage scenarios to mobile devices and mobile contexts. However, we do not just experience technologies in situ -- we also experience everyday settings through the technologies we have at our disposal. Drawing on anthropological research, I outline an alternative way of thinking about the relationship between technology and "seeing" everyday life and everyday space.},

abstract = {Film Scoring is a creative and collaborative activity that involves several practitioners, in particular music specialists (film composers) and non specialists (filmmakers). These practitioners face recurrent challenges in communication primarily because they do not share the same musical language. In this paper we present the results of research undertaken into the communication process between filmmakers and composers, with particular focus on the challenges experienced by the two parties. We then propose and discuss an interaction design approach to progress towards appropriate computer-based solutions.},

We then reorient the discussion around Probes towards how probes work: both as interpretative fodder for social scientists and as a resource for 'designers'. Finally we discuss new possible directions for Probes as an approach and some of the challenges confronting Probes as an approach.},

abstract = {This paper explores how mobile tools are used in everyday life and investigates the issues surrounding their usage, or indeed, their lack of usage. Personal computers support us in a wide range of our desk-bound activities, but there is still relatively little use of computer-based tools in other parts of our day-to-day lives. We hypothesise that this is because certain barriers-to-use exist that discourage their use in everyday environments, namely that the tools are not readily to hand at the time of need and/or that they distract the user's attention too much from the surrounding environment or main task at hand.We briefly present our concept of a Smartwatch -- a wrist-worn form of a general-purpose wearable computer -- that aims to overcome these barriers. However, we strongly believe that a prerequisite to the successful development of this, and other types of mobile devices, is a better understanding of the use, or disuse, of mobile tools in everyday life (including traditional and paper-based solutions). To gain this understanding we conducted a diary study in which a group of twelve volunteers recorded their usage of mobile tools over a period of 2 days. With the large volume of data that was collected we performed a qualitative analysis based on grounded theory techniques, resulting in a comprehensive and detailed picture of the use of mobile tools in everyday life. From this understanding we have drawn out nine key themes which we present in some detail in this paper, including: situational versus portability strategies, the mobility of information, new behaviours derived from mobile phone usage, the importance of creative expression, concern over privacy and security issues, and the demonstrated existence of the barriers-to-use.},

Most of previous writing support systems emphasize the support of content generating activities. As for revising, some of these systems have provided automatic spell check and grammar check features. However, revising should not be confined only to these local superficial changes. In this paper, we aim to support the revising activities through providing a new visualization and interaction that encourages writers to revise globally. We have built a system called Writing Blocks to confirm the feasibility of our approach. Our preliminary user study, which was conducted with three subjects, helped us to gain a perspective on the effectiveness of our approach especially in supporting revising scenarios such as the revising of scripts for time-restricted presentations and the revising of global usage of terms in long documents according to their contexts.},

However, a permanent visualization cannot support the variety of tasks found in realistic work settings equally well. We explore interaction techniques that transiently visualize information near the user's focus of attention. Transient visualizations support specific contexts of use without permanently changing the user interface, and aim to seamlessly integrate with existing tools and to decrease distraction. Examples of transient visualizations for document search, map zoom-outs, fisheye views of source code, and thesaurus access are presented. We provide an initial validation of transient visualizations by comparing a transient overview for maps to a permanent visualization. Among 20 users of these visualizations, all but four preferred the transient visualization. However, differences in time and error rates were insignificant. On this background, we discuss the potential of transient visualizations and future directions.},

This computer music instrument is part of a system, the Mind Attention Interface, which provides an interface to a virtual reality theatre using measures of a participant's EEG, eye-gaze and head position. The theatre itself, and its spatialised sound system, closes a feedback loop through the mind of the participant.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a qualitative analysis of gestures performed during a remote collaboration in which two people are working together with physical objects. CSCW researchers have established the importance of supporting gesture when sharing and interacting from a distance. Recent work reports on a corpus of gestures phrases [3] and a set of gestures functions and roles [2] as observed in remote collaboration on physical tasks. While advances are being made in identifying these gestures, to date the design implications of remote gesture systems is still unclear. In this paper we describe a set of gestures phrases, which we have observed. These gesture phrases are composed of a number of individual gestures. We describe a specific gesture performed by the helper indicative of participant's natural/intuitive and preferred interaction practices. We also describe gestures performed by the helper going beyond pointing or showing a movement or a shape, gestures that suggest that the helper is acting as if manipulating the remote physical objects. We discuss the implications for supporting such more elaborated gesture phrases and present a set of design recommendations for designing remote gesture systems.},

The experiment involved comparing the performance of two groups of eight operators attempting to achieve the same tactical goals within the same scenario using two different, but functionally equivalent, situation awareness environments; one environment incorporated the novel visualizations outlined in this paper and one did not. The experiment showed that the novel visualizations: (1) increased operator survivability; (2) shortened mission duration; and (3) reduced the time the operator spent vulnerable to radar detection compared to the standard environment. Analysis of operator perceptions elicited via post simulation interviews showed that operators using the visualizations experienced lower workload and stress levels and had more accurate perceptions of their vulnerability to radar detection than those operators using the standard environment.},

abstract = {Physical leisure activities such as table tennis provide healthy exercise and can offer a means to connect with others socially; however, players have to be in the same physical location to play. We have developed a networked table tennis-like game that is played with a real paddle and ball, augmented with a large-scale videoconference. Unlike existing commercial console games that encourage physical activity, our system supports social interaction through an audio and video communication channel, offers a familiar gaming interface comparable to a traditional leisure game, provides non-virtual force feedback and can be enjoyed by players in three geographically separate locations simultaneously. We are presenting results from an empirical evaluation of "Table Tennis for Three" with 41 participants. The players reported that they had fun, used the game to build social rapport and experienced a sense of playing "together". Some participants did not enjoy the game, and we present informed opinions to explain their reactions. With our work, we provide other HCI researchers with a further example of an evaluation of a novel type of experience that lies in the realms of physical activity, fun and social interactions. We hope we can inspire designers to consider our results in their future game designs by looking at the characteristics of traditional physical leisure games to promote similar benefits such as exercise, enjoyment and bringing people together to socialize.},

The associated physical interactions are often of an exertion character and facilitate the use of brute force and intense physical actions. On the other hand, computer interfaces so far have mainly focused on interactions that use limited force and often ignored the existence of extreme brutal interactions that can be encountered in everyday life, in particular in contact sports. We present our initial investigations on the concept of "Brute Force" interfaces in HCI and describe work-in-progress on a prototype that aims to facilitate brute force interactions. We hope with our work we can aid designers who want to leverage the physical and mental health benefits of such physically intense behaviors that people do exhibit in their lives.},

We designed our experiment with the aim of providing a context for the collaboration that shares as many characteristics of real life as possible. Twenty-two participants were instructed to perform a shared goal task. They worked in co-located pairs on solving three sets of two jigsaw puzzles concurrently. They were allowed to use any combination of direct and indirect input device, i.e., touch and mouse, to achieve the goal. Additionally, a hidden task was imposed on the participants in the second and third puzzle task: They had to discover that pieces were mixed up between the two displayed puzzles. The role of the hidden task was to trigger spontaneous transitions from individual to collaborative work. Our observations focused on the participants' selection and usage of input devices during the task execution. Our study revealed amongst others that participants stuck to their preferred input device even when they got more engaged in coordination and communication with their partner. Our findings are based on log data, questionnaire data and video recordings.},

abstract = {This paper reports on a laboratory study into the gesture representation interface for remote collaboration on physical tasks. Measured by task performance and user's perception of interaction, the experiment assessed two gesture representations (hands vs. cursor pointer) in the context of a video mediated interface which included a view of the remote partner. We did not find any significant difference between the hands condition and the pointer condition when measuring user's task performance. However, our result showed that participants reported an overall preference of using the pointer functionality than using the hands'. We found that participants perceived higher quality of interaction in the hands condition than in the pointer condition and there was a significant difference. Additionally, majority of the participants valued the ability of being able to see each other's face during the collaboration. We conclude with a discussion on the importance of accounting for the user's perception of interaction in addition to the traditional task performance measure in evaluating gesture representation interface, and the importance of considering these two factors in recommending the most suitable interface design with gesture representation for collaboration on physical tasks.},

This paper argues that by introducing simulated emotional responses and state dynamics to future systems, they will provide a more life-like, engaging and interactive experience to their users, and provide a more effective and efficient user interaction. Further, by simulating Emotional Intelligence in a system, a developer may be able to provide a more tailored user experience, and be provided with more control over the outcome of a user's interaction with their system. Emotion theory and expression are explored, and a model is presented based upon emotional states. Implementation of this model is then presented as an intelligent back end process that utilises dynamic video stream analysis that feeds into an interactive display. The proposed system, and its hardware implementation is presented, followed by a discussion of future areas of research.},

Physiological signals were measured using 3 biometric sensors for Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), Skin Conductance (SC) and Respiration (RESP). Two emotion inducing experiments were conducted to acquire physiological data from 13 subjects. The data from 10 of these subjects were used to train the system, while the remaining 3 datasets were used to test the performance of the system. A recognition rate of 62% for valence and 67% for arousal was achieved within +/- 1 units of the valence and arousal rating.},

abstract = {Personal identification numbers (PINs) are one of the most common ways of electronic authentication these days and used in a wide variety of applications, especially in ATMs (cash machines). A non-marginal amount of tricks are used by criminals to spy on these numbers to gain access to the owners' valuables. Simply looking over the victims' shoulders to get in possession of their PINs is a common one. This effortless but effective trick is known as shoulder surfing. Thus, a less observable PIN entry method is desirable. In this work, we evaluate three different eye gaze interaction methods for PIN-entry, all resistant against these common attacks and thus providing enhanced security. Besides the classical eye input methods we also investigate a new approach of gaze gestures and compare it to the well known classical gaze-interactions. The evaluation considers both security and usability aspects. Finally we discuss possible enhancements for gaze gestures towards pattern based identification instead of number sequences.},

We enhanced our efficient unification-based multimodal parsing processor, which has the potential to achieve low polynomial computational complexity while parsing versatile multimodal inputs within a speech and gesture based MMUI, to handle multimodal inputs from more than two modalities. Its ability to disambiguate speech recognition results with gesture recognition results was verified with an experiment.

When the user is a long way from the display, it acts as a digital picture and does not attract attention. When the user comes within an appropriate range for interaction, the display shows pictures that are related to the user and provides quasi-3D navigation using the TIP (tour into the picture) method. In addition, menus can be manipulated directly on a touch-screen or remotely using an air mouse. In an emergency, LEDs around the display flash to alert the user.},

abstract = {The creation of 3D computer models is essential for many applications in science, engineering and arts and is frequently performed by untrained users. However, creating an intuitive mapping between 2D input and 3D models is a non-trivial task and is reflected in the difficulty novices have in using current 3D modelling software. Using metaphors of paper sculpture and pen sketching, our gesture based modelling tool simplifies this interaction mapping. More intuitive object manipulation means that an otherwise complex model can be rapidly created by an inexperienced, non-artistic user. To demonstrate this, we have chosen to model orchid flowers as they offer considerable challenges to the artist due to their complexity of shape and detail, especially the petal surfaces which vary a great deal in curvature.},

abstract = {Authentication today mostly means using passwords or personal identification numbers (PINs). The average user has to remember an increasing amount of PINs and passwords. But unfortunately, humans have limited capabilities in remembering abstract alphanumeric sequences. Thus, many people either forget them or use very simple ones that imply several security risks. In our previous work on PIN entry on ATMs (cash machines), we found out that many persons support their memory recalling PINs by using an imaginary shape overlaid on the number pad. In this paper, we introduce PassShape, a shape based authentication mechanism. We argue that using shapes will allow more complex and more secure authentication with a lower cognitive load. That is, it enables people to use easy to remember but complex authentication patterns.},

We describe a classification approach, the cognitive load levels were detected and output as discrete level ranges. The final system achieved a 71.1% accuracy for 3 levels classification in a speaker-independent setting. The ability to detect and manage a user's cognitive load can help us to adapt intelligent interfaces that ensure optimal user performance},

The prototype application is web-based and uses Google Maps, GPS positioning, and Web 2.0 technology to provide a lightweight dynamic and interactive representation of the work domain supporting distributed collaboration, communication, and peripheral awareness among nomadic workers.},

abstract = {Location-based services provide mobile users with information and functionality tailored to their geographical location. Within recent years these kinds of context-aware mobile systems have received increasing attention from software industry as well as from researchers within a wide range of computing disciplines. However, while a lot of research has been done into sensing, adapting and philosophizing over the complex concept of "context", little theoretically based knowledge exists about why, from a user experience perspective, some context-aware system designs work well and why others don't. Contributing to this discussion, this paper suggests the perspective of "Gestalt theory" as a potential theoretical framework for understanding the use of this class of computer systems, and argues that describing the user experience of location-based services through Gestalt theory's principles of proximity, closure, symmetry, continuity, and similarity can help explain how people make sense of small and fragmented pieces of information on mobile devices in context.},

Information technology (IT) is changing the way we perform work and providing society with a multitude of entertainment options. Unfortunately, in the past designers of many software systems have not considered the disabled as active users of technology, and thus this significant part of the world population has often been neglected. A change in this mindset has been emerging in recent years, however, as private-sector organizations and governments have started to realize that including this user group is not only profitable, but also beneficial to society as a whole. This paper introduces an alternative method to the traditional mouse input device, using a modified Lucas-Kanade optical-flow algorithm for tracking head movements, and speech recognition to activate mouse buttons.},

Among these, layout management, context switching and comparison tasks could benefit from the use of interactive shortcut views of remote areas of a wall display, presented close to the user. Such a shortcut view technique, the ScaleView portals, is evaluated against using a simple magnification lens and walking when performing these tasks. We observed that for a layout and comparison task with frequent context switching, users preferred ScaleView portals. But for simpler tasks, such as searching, regular magnification lenses and walking were preferred. General observations on how the display was used as a peripheral reference by different participants highlighted one of the benefits of using wall sized displays: users may visually refer to the large, spread out content on the wall display, even if they prefer to interact with it close to their location.},

Thus implementation of beautification techniques in computer-based sketch tools is ad hoc, with most only supporting the ends of the spectrum: hand-drawn and fully formalized. Hand-drawn diagrams are more effective for early design and review but users are more satisfied with formal designs. This suggests that there may be applications for intermediate levels of formality. By understanding the attributes of visual formality it is possible to beautify a diagram progressively, thereby achieving visually consistent intermediate levels of formality. Here we present a taxonomy of the attributes of visual formality and the implementation of this taxonomy into a sketch tool.},
