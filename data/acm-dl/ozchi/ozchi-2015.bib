abstract = {This paper presents MyCalendar; a visual calendar prototype App that was developed to support children with Autism Spectrum Disorder and language delays to communicate about their own activities and interests across the settings of home and school.MyCalendar was developed following in-depth fieldwork and participatory design sessions with parents, teachers and children from Preparatory year to year 2 of an Australian Primary School Special Education Unit catering largely for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Typically, children with ASD face difficulties in participating at school.MyCalendar was then evaluated over six months with four teachers, ten parents and eleven children. The study resulted in two key findings: (1) MyCalendar supported children who have ASD and limited verbal skills to better communicate their daily personal activities through photos and videos, encouraged by teachers and parents. (2) This deeper understanding of the children's daily lives enabled teachers to successfully model positive behaviours and to scaffold more relevant and meaningful learning opportunities by relating them to the children's lives.While it was initially expected that the activities would better support communication between teachers and parents, the MyCalendar led in fact to novel scaffolding of learning opportunities and modeling of communication in the classroom.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the challenges of delivering parent training intervention for autism over video. We conducted a qualitative field study of an intervention, which is based on a well-established training program for parents of children with autism, called Hanen More Than Words. The study was conducted with a Hanen Certified speech pathologist who delivered video based training to two mothers, each with a son having autism. We conducted observations of 14 sessions of the intervention spanning 3 months along with 3 semi-structured interviews with each participant. We identified different activities that participants performed across different sessions and analysed them based upon their implications on technology. We found that all the participants welcomed video based training but they also faced several difficulties, particularly in establishing rapport with other participants, inviting equal participation, and in observing and providing feedback on parent-child interactions. Finally, we reflect on our findings and motivate further investigations by defining three design sensitivities of Adaptation, Group Participation, and Physical Setup.},

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have paved a new wave in the education world. Rich multimedia content coupled with mobile delivery mechanisms makes the content always available and engaging. This paper proposes VibRein to enrich the student interaction with multimedia learning content by making use of different sensors that are available on a mobile device to create an intelligent video consumption experience. VibRein as a companion is even more effective for students with intellectual disabilities who require some form of continuous supervision. It provides an assistive mechanism that keeps track of the user attention using the device camera (this can be particularly useful for students with attention disorder), and uses haptic feedback to recapture attention. In course of the video consumption, VibRein evaluates the learning by asking questions about the content in the video, and automatically force-rewinds to the location where the concept was explained if the user answers incorrectly. It uses tilt in four directions for response to questions, since touch, as a modality on mobile devices requires fine motor skills. An evaluation with 18 users with intellectual disabilities of various kind (autism, intellectual disability and attention deficit hyperactive disorder) suggests that VibRein can provide better learning with less intervention.},

This paper explores the challenges in bringing together different communities with the necessary skill sets to design such technologies for and with people with a disability. A collaborative approach involving a maker community, a disability services organization, and university staff and students was investigated through the theoretical lens of infrastructuring. Maker communities can potentially provide skilled and willing volunteers, while disability services organizations possess disability sector expertise and the university can contribute design expertise through its staff and students. While these parties complement each other, tensions can arise that require resolution. Through ethnography and co-design this study identified key tensions that arise in a collaboration including differences in motivations, the importance of sensitive and accurate need finding, managing expectations, and leveraging health and safety standards. Resolution of these tensions can lead the way to more sustainable collaborative projects.},

abstract = {Children with mental disorders like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often experience challenges in school as they struggle to maintain their attention. Based on empirical studies conducted in school contexts and together with teachers and ADHD domain professionals, we identified design criteria in relation to three core components (sensing, recognizing, and assisting) for designing real time assistive technologies for children with ADHD. Based on these design criteria, we designed the Child Activity Sensing and Training Tool (CASTT), a real time assistive prototype that captures activities and assists the child in maintaining attention. From a preliminary evaluation of CASTT with 20 children in several schools, we and found that: 1) it is possible to create a wearable sensor system for children with ADHD that monitors physical and physiological activities in real time; and that 2) real time assistive technologies have potential to assist children with ADHD in regaining attention in critical school situations.},

abstract = {It has been found that the perceived appeal (or aesthetic) of an interface plays important role in determining its usability. Predictive model of interface aesthetics can thus be useful for designer to determine and improve usability. Images being an integral part of most of the interfaces contribute significantly to the overall interface aesthetics. In this paper, we propose a computational model to predict the aesthetic quality of on-screen images. We have identified a total of twenty features, divided into two broad categories, to capture image aesthetics. In order to relate the features to aesthetics, we performed a controlled user study with eighty images and hundred participants. The images were created by us and the participants were asked to rate those on a 5-point scale as per their judgment of appeal (or beauty or aesthetics) of the images. The data were used to train and test a non-linear regression model based on a SVM classifier, as the predictor of image aesthetics, with a mean square error of 0.03. The model basically predicts the likely aesthetic rating (on a 5-point scale) for a given image, given the feature values. The proposed model along with the details of the empirical data collection and analysis are discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {Computer vision-based bare-hand tracking systems have become popular as they free the users from wearing any hardware devices (e.g. gloves). However, due to the limitations in tracking methods and human body constraints, interaction methods developed for other 3D interaction devices can have problems when applied to computer vision-based bare-hand tracking systems. Therefore, there is a need to develop interaction techniques suitable for bare-hand input. In this paper we investigate a non-linear mapping technique for bare-hand input in large-scale virtual environments based on physiological constraints. This method not only enables high precision interaction with objects at both near and far distances, but also allows users to manipulate objects efficiently with significant translation and rotation. Through a user study, we show that the proposed method can be fairly effective, precise, more usable, and less stressful compared to two more traditional baseline interaction techniques},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of mastering the complexity of interacting with a large set of applications on smartphones. In one hand, number of applications increases. In the other hand, screen size reduces. To tackle this paradoxical evolution, we investigate adaptive user interfaces. We assume that it is possible to predict the applications of interest for a user in a given situation. Based on this hypothesis, our challenge is to accelerate user interaction when prediction is correct, without penalizing it when prediction is wrong. The paper proposes the concept of Evanescent Adaptation. The principle is a two-layer based representation: the predicted items (first layer) are displayed above the full list of items (second layer). The first layer is said to be evanescent in the sense that it automatically disappears progressively. The paper claims for putting this disappearing process under the control of the end-user. Thereby the user can close the first-layer as soon as s/he perceives prediction as irrelevant.},

In this study we explore how VR can be used to understand more about people's food choices. We explore how policy-based interventions such as the "sugar tax" and "nutrition labelling" to promote healthier food choices could be tested. Only limited experimental studies have been conducted about such choices due to the difficulty of trying such interventions in large retail settings. The objectives of the study were to assess how accurately the Virtual Food Court (VFC), represents a real food court. The study (27 participants) had two study conditions; a control with regular food-court prices, and an experimental condition with taxes on food and beverages. Results revealed that participants were able to imagine doing their real-life food purchases in the VFC indicating that it is a good research tool for assessing people's food choices.},

Yet it remains un-developed or overlooked with touch screens, which has recently gained popularity in both people's daily life and research studies. In this paper, we proposed an interaction technique named radial cursor, which uses a radial metaphor and functions similar to a mouse cursor. It stimulates 'mouse hover' interaction with radial hierarchical data on touch screens. Together with a level switch, radial cursor provide intuitive and effective controls of 'hover to see more detail' or 'hover to highlight' over every data node. We also applied real dataset such as Flickr taxonomy and Flare package to our design. The result shows radial cursor helps user to quickly get a general sense of an unfamiliar dataset, or review the known dataset. Meanwhile, radial cursor provides a pleasant data exploration experience.},

Going beyond this, we also identify a rich variety of spontaneous and ephemeral roles among the audience: spectators, orchestrators, managers, coaches, directors, puppeteers, commentators, hecklers, supporters, documenters, shadow players, and cheerleaders. We argue that through this richer understanding of the differentiated nature of participation in videogaming, designers might expand the reach of their games and respond to the potential for new experiences in the broad situation of domestic gaming.},

We have established that high levels of engagement for many participants is grounded in play as power and play as strategy, with play as fantasy adding to the experience. Through our study we established that conflict-based activities hold strong appeal. We subsequently investigated the context in which players talked about their experience of conflict within game. By using activities as a categorisation of gameplay we have been able to capture the play experience across a range of games and a range of gaming contexts. By examining players' individual experience we begin to understand why conflict in videogames appears to be a popular choice of activities.},

Using the cards focuses participants on the development of designs that are human-centred and on embedding values and ethics into the final design artifacts. The field of gamification is at an early stage of development and is limited by a lack of rigorous frameworks and design methods.

Unexpected results point to the challenges of operationalising flow in video game research, obstacles in experimental design for invoking flow and low-flow, concerns about flow as a construct for measuring video game enjoyment, the applicability of self-report flow scales, and the experience of flow in video game play despite substantial challenge-skill differences.},

abstract = {The design of modern digital games has become increasingly oriented towards providing players with positive experiences such as fun and flow, and reducing negative experiences such as frustration and anger. DayZ is one notable exception, where negative experiences are central to its design. When a player is killed in DayZ, they lose their character with all its advancement, often equivalent to weeks of play, which can be an enormously frustrating and demoralising experience. However, the majority of its players view this as a positive and attractive feature, and one of the keys to the game's appeal. In this paper, we draw on 1,704 responses to a player motivations survey to unpack the complex player experience of permanent character death and demonstrate how this moment of negative affect contributes to the positive experience of DayZ more broadly.},

General Practitioners (GPs) are ideally positioned to deliver preventive health and early intervention as part of young people's routine health care. A quick and effective way for GPs to identify areas of concern is through technology-based health screening tools, which are acceptable to young people and facilitate self-disclosure about sensitive topics. Despite these advantages, the rate of using this technology remains low. This is the first study that involves all end users and stakeholders in the design of a health screening technology for young people in general practice settings. Our rich findings on the design needs and concerns of young people, GPs, practice staff and parents regarding technologies for health communication will be useful to any researchers and practitioners designing health technologies in a general practice setting.},

Hence we conducted a qualitative study to examine the practices of current users of sleep tracking technologies and to identify challenges in current practice. Based on data collected from 5 online forums for users of sleep-tracking technologies, we identified 22 different challenges under the following 4 themes: tracking continuity, trust, data manipulation, and data interpretation. Based on these results, we propose 6 design opportunities to assist researchers and practitioners in designing sleep-tracking technologies.},

Photos, documents and mementos are easily lost or left behind at changes of care placement. Lack of access to such personal artefacts negatively impacts care decisions, identity construction and social relationships. Prior work identified the potential for an online repository (a 'virtual locker') to manage personal materials in this context.This research examines tensions related to privacy and control that impact on the design of the virtual locker. Through workshops conducted with young care leavers and social workers we derived design objectives and, based on these, we propose mechanisms for resolving the tensions identified. Informed by user evaluation of a 'virtual locker' prototype, we develop heuristics for design of personal content systems in shifting social contexts. In this work, we identify the need for personal control of content, balanced governance and flexible collaboration tools. These heuristics and associated insights contribute to theoretical and design work related to personal and social content systems.},

DIVE also displays a CG hand (virtual hand) on the surface instead of the unseen hand under the surface. The virtual hand seems to be joined to the user's real arm above the surface. Its appearance and motion are synchronized with that of the unseen hand. Using DIVE, we can feel as if we are manipulating 3D CG objects with our own hand.

For instance, they can use pinching gestures to select different parts of the exhibit with their fingers to view augmented text descriptions, instead of touching the mobile phone screen. The prototype combines vision-based image tracking and free-hand gesture detection via a depth camera in a client-server framework, which enables users to use their hands with the augmented exhibition without requiring special hardware (e.g. a depth sensor) on their personal devices. Results from our pilot user study shows that the prototype system is as intuitive to use as a traditional touch-based interface, and provides a more fun and engaging experience.},

abstract = {We introduce here the FaceSwitch, an accessibility software system designed to facilitate computer interaction for users who are challenged in the mobility of their upper limbs. The FaceSwitch software tracks landmark features in a user's face using a deformable face tracker. The system lets the user map specific facial gestures to customized computer control commands such as left click, right-click, page down or escape through a convenient GUI. Hence, facial gestures act as substitutes of traditional mechanical switches. When combining facial gestures with gaze interaction, the emergent multimodal interaction paradigm improves the degrees of freedom offered by alternative accessibility software such as gaze only interaction, speech interaction or mechanical single-switch assisted gaze interaction. Furthermore, the FaceSwitch software improves the efficacy of traditional gaze interaction which has been traditionally limited by a high rate of false positives due to its dependence on target acquisition via dwell time activation. The FaceSwitch also reduces the latency to achieve a computer control task when compared to traditional accessibility software. We have made the FaceSwitch widely available in order for those in need to use it without restrictions and also to allow those with the right technical skills to potentially improve the software further.},

I consider the emergence of these modes of human-computer interaction located at the extremities of our social world as a key historical moment requiring urgent reflection on the interfaces of the psyche, the social, and the digital.},

abstract = {Information and communications technology (ICT) plays an important role in facilitating information flows through fair trade supply chains. While previous research has focused on the role of ICT in providing consumers with fair trade producer information, few studies have considered the operation of feedback loops from consumers to producers, particularly in an Australian context. This qualitative study provides a novel contribution in this area through a domain exploration of the consumer-to-producer feedback loops in the fair trade system and the role of ICT in facilitating these supply chain communications. We have used ethnographic techniques through semi-structured interviews with consumer, importer, and producer links in the supply chain, analysing and refining our data using a grounded-theory approach. The discussion engages with emerging themes addressing the actual information needs of producers, attributes of existing feedback loops, and the role of ICT in fair trade handicraft supply chains. We explore the function of intermediaries in the supply chains who aggregate, filter and interpret feedback that flows from the consumers and importers through to the producer organisations and the artisans who produce the goods. Finally, we consider potential future applications of ICT to fair trade feedback loops and associated design sensitivities to ensure that feedback offered by consumers and importers satisfies producer information needs, establishing new avenues of enquiry in the field of HCI for Development (HCI4D).},

abstract = {A growing proportion of human-computer interaction research now takes place in sensitive settings with participants who might be considered vulnerable, such as the chronically ill, older adults, and people living with mental health issues. Alongside this move into complex "real life" settings there is growing interest in the ethical challenges HCI researchers encounter, the emotional impact research can have on participants and researchers, and the risk that new technologies might exacerbate, rather than ameliorate, existing vulnerabilities. Some authors have called for researchers to openly reflect about ethical challenges so we can learn from shared experiences. Others have warned that HCI researchers may not be sufficiently equipped to understand and respond to the needs of vulnerable participants. This paper documents cases of "sensitive HCI," drawing on research conducted in diverse sensitive settings. By reflecting on common challenges and discussing possible responses we contribute to growing discourse that promotes reflexive practice in sensitive HCI.},

One-size-fits-all solutions are not appropriate for everybody, and a considered, individualised approach to fall prevention is needed. A qualitative content analysis of sixty community based falls risk assessment forms and person-centered care documents was conducted. The results presented provide insights into the care goals of older adults as well as various reasons underpinning low acceptance and compliance with fall preventative home modifications and assistive technologies. These interventions are based on the goals of older adults that commonly extend beyond compensatory approaches to improve physical performance within the home environment. HCI methods and new technologies provide an opportunity to reshape person-centered fall prevention, resulting in higher satisfaction and subsequent compliance rates amongst older adults. Furthermore, a series of HCI inspired person-centered design guidelines for designing home modifications and assistive technologies solutions are presented.},

Based on observations and interviews with dancers and participants, we identified a range of tensions that arise from integrating a staged performance with participatory interaction. These tensions occurred among both participants and performers, and influenced the social and performative experience. Based on our analysis, we propose several strategies to smoothen the integration of performative and participatory interaction. These strategies reconsider the role of the interactive installation, the effect of digital cues that draw on existing conventions, and mechanisms to direct gaze. We believe our findings and strategies are valuable to HCI researchers and performative artists seeking to design for public participation in interactive experiences.},

Toward this, we suggest two ideas for future designs, including building personal histories of individual collectable items and developing a simple digital means of connecting proximate collectors with those who stand to benefit from collectors' unique and item-specific knowledge.},

When a user lights up a candle in Fyro, a heart-shaped light on a remote Fyro is turned on, and it stays on as long as the candle in the other Fyro is burning. As a precursor to deploying Fyro in domestic settings, we demonstrated it in two future technology workshops to elicit user feedback. Data were analysed using affinity diagram. Although previous research indicates that users project their own context to create meanings in phatic interactions, our results show that symbolic universal traditions may be innovated to extend its meaning into such interactions.},

Numerous works on behaviour change, both in academia and in the industry, draw strongly on motivating by utilizing interpersonal relationships. However, within this research social relationships are employed as a means of accomplishing positive behaviour. In this paper, we aim at designing a system for supporting both affective awareness and behaviour change with equal emphasis. We argue that such a system can benefit from the synergetic effects between both research concerns. Our prototype application demonstrates the concept, establishing connectedness through the shared experience of positive behaviour change (in our case study increased physical activity), enabled by both mutual motivation and a reverse rewarding strategy.},

In this paper we share findings from two years of using this approach as part of research-through-design. In our approach, hacking is inspired by play and conducted within an office as a hacker's playground environment. We have found playful hacking to generate outcomes such as improved collaboration, exploration, and discussion while also generating unanticipated outcomes such as reusable design work and pre-study findings. Above all, we found that hacking provided motivation and invigoration to do more making and research in general.},

This paper offers a review of relevant work on cryptocurrency and trust in HCI, and critically examines its value in understanding the issues of trust in Bitcoin technology. Several limitations of the current theories and models of trust are identified, and a research framework is proposed to explore the specific trust challenges raised by the Bitcoin technology.},

abstract = {We amass increasing amounts of photos on our mobile devices, primarily captured by built-in cameras. These cameras provide precious opportunities to preserve memories or serve for creative engagement. However, creating order over these vast photo collections gets more difficult as we create more and more photos and this puts these valuable resources at risk. People fail to sort their photo collections manually and automated algorithms are not yet able to identify and group images based on the features that are most relevant to the human beholder. For these reasons we present INSERT, a novel mobile phone application for supporting manual sorting of photo collections in an efficient fashion. A user study featuring 21 participants showed that the proposed interaction mechanisms were well perceived and that there is yet much research to be conducted aiming at the management of image collections on mobile device, in particular with small screens.},

abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) based decision support systems are often like a black box to non-expert users. Here user's confidence becomes critical for effective decision making and maintaining trust in the system. We find that user confidence varies significantly depending on supplementary material presented on screen. We investigate change in user confidence (in the context of ML based decision making) by varying level of uncertainty presented (in an online water-pipe failure prediction case study) and find that all 26 subjects rated higher uncertainty task to be most difficult and had lowest user confidence in predictive decisions of the same. This agrees with our expectation that increased uncertainty would reduce user confidence in predictive decision making. However, ML-researchers subgroup reported being most confident when uncertainty with known probability was presented, whereas other subgroups (viz. general staff and non-ML researchers) appeared most confident when uncertainty was not at all presented. This is an original research to improve understanding of user's decision making confidence with respect to uncertainty presented in machine learning context.},

We furthermore describe an implementation on a commercially available optical touchscreen that features real-time visualization of the underlying key classification process. The typing application, which uses support vector machine classifiers and bivariate Gaussian distributions to differentiate between keys, was evaluated in a user study with 24 participants. The adaptive keyboard performed significantly better in terms of typing speed and error rates compared to a standard onscreen keyboard (approximately 40% speedup and 25% reduced error rates). We also performed evaluations with reduced sensor resolutions and additive noise in order to verify the generalizability of the presented approach for other sensing techniques. Our approach showed high robustness in both conditions. Based on these findings, we discuss possible implications for future implementations of virtual keyboards.},

In this paper, we present a two-phase study discussing how the temporal, social, and food related features are intertwined with technology use during mealtimes. Our findings show how people differentiate technology usage during weekday meals, weekend meals, and among different meals of the day. We identify and analyse prototypical situations ranging from the use of arbitrary technologies while eating solitary, to idiosyncratic family norms and practices associated with shared technologies. We discuss the use of mealtime technology to create appropriate ambience for meals with guests and demonstrate how technology can be used to complement food in everyday meals and special occasions. Our findings make recommendation about the need for HCI research to recognize the contextual nature of technology usage during family mealtimes and to adopt appropriate design strategies.},

abstract = {Managing finances is a practice carried out daily in homes across the world. Despite this, the practice is not yet a strong focus for HCI work in the home. This paper looks specifically at the ways that families organise and manage their finances. Based on a process of in-situ qualitative interviews, we find that money management is often a collaborative process in the family and occurs in a similar way to other household tasks; as part of existing divisions of domestic labour. Participating families reflected upon the creative and often low-tech systems they used to manage their finances and ideas they had for "ideal" technologies that would better help them organise their money. This paper presents ideas for fostering collaboration around family finances. Design propositions are made towards a Family Holiday Expense Tracker and family-situated bill payment reminder, both of which aim to encourage whole-of-family collaboration around money management and better including children in what is, at-present, an activity they are largely excluded from.},

While the usual approach has been to facilitate reduced consumption, recent work has started looking at facilitating more flexible electricity use as a means of shifting consumption to more favorable times. This approach means that people may behave more sustainably without necessarily using less electricity. Exploring this emerging approach, this paper presents a study of flexibility in domestic electricity use as facilitated by an eco-feedback system with forecast information about price, availability of green energy, and grid demand. The prototype system was deployed in three households for 22 weeks. Our findings show that flexible electricity use is far from trivial to achieve in domestic households. The details of this is relevant for understanding people's ability and willingness to shift electricity consumption, and for the design of systems that facilitate doing this.},

This approach used an iterative design methodology based on contextual interview, workshops and focus groups to develop personas representing students visiting the program. Initial uses of these developed personas have included training of new personnel as well as the evaluation of the program. Overall the use of this user-centred approach and iterative persona development methodology has yielded an invaluable resource for the design of support for learning programs across the higher education industry within Australia and beyond.},

Results provide a comprehensive breakdown of frequent activities and contexts of use, highlighting key differences in smartphone and tablet use. Activities on smartphones were found to be dominated by communication needs, while tablets were frequently used for consumption and entertainment. Both devices were most often used at home, with tablets rarely leaving the home. Within the home, smartphones were used mostly in the bedroom, and tablets in the living room. Both devices were used frequently while doing something else, such as using tablets primarily while watching TV.

A twelve-week study consisting of observations and interviews with teachers and participants in short course classes was conducted, during which we investigated the specific interests of older adults. Specifically, we explored the influence of individuals' level of interest on their learning and use of technologies. The engagement of 35 participants across four short course classes was compared both with and without the use of mobile touch screen technologies. Results show that there is a close relationship between individual interest and uptake of mobile touch screen technologies. This research aims to investigate how individual interest in a domain can engender and maintain engagement with technology learning and use by older adults.},

We illustrate six cross-device interaction techniques. Using two different prototype systems that implement them for a card-playing context we evaluate them in two studies on usability and usefulness. Our findings suggest that some techniques were fast to perform (touch-and-hold and tap-tap) and some had a high number of errors (swipe). Also, our participants would sometimes mix up the techniques and make a wrong action while playing the game. Finally, we discuss and illustrate issues of cross-device interaction consistency and division of shared and personal devices.},

The survey investigated factors and motivations such as young adults' boredom proneness and their social connectedness, as well as their general mobile phone use and phone use in the car. We found, e.g., that boredom proneness plays a larger role (compared to social connectedness) in determining how much a young male uses their phone in the car (compared to young females). Despite the study's limitations, this initial understanding allows us to better design and develop innovative HCI interventions that prevent young adults, particularly males, from phone use while driving in a way that appeals to their needs.},

We believe the first step in identifying any successful solution is to develop a fine-grained understanding of the physical context of forestry work by performing large-scale data collection of the levels of physical activity the workers engage in as well as their sleep patterns over extended periods of time. Our goal is to use lightweight, wearable technology (so-called activity trackers) to collect this data. In order to do so we need a clear understanding of the capabilities and limitations of such devices, both in general and in the proposed use environment for forestry workers. In this paper we present the results of user studies and comparisons of six activity trackers and three mobile phone applications used to track activity and sleep. We also discuss our initial pilot study with forestry workers and discuss the problems encountered using the trackers in the environment.},

abstract = {Australian Courtrooms are presently under pressure to adopt suitable technologies for evidence presentation in the courtrooms. This decision is to alleviate reliance on increasing volumes of paper based evidence documentation, harness the value of streamlining evidence presentation, reduce the time of trials and consequently increase courtroom availability. This paper discusses the findings of two ethnographic studies of court trial simulation activities held in the County Courts of both NSW and Victoria, where members of the Australian judiciary, including judges, barristers, lawyers, court administrators and law academics participated in criminal trial simulations where all of the evidence was presented with the use of tablet technology. This required the professional members of the judiciary to role-play as jury members, plaintiff, judge, the witness and courtroom administration. The purpose of the study was to demonstrate the capability of tablet technologies in the courtroom to the members of the judiciary community while identifying the requirements and wants of the participants, in order to produce a series of design recommendations for future development. It was found that there were substantially more advantages than just paper saving and reduced time produced from the introduction of technology as well as areas of concern for the judiciary.},

abstract = {Scenarios are considered a useful tool for designers and HCI communities to generate detailed problem descriptions, future predictions, concept generations, requirements analysis and detailed system design surrounding a design problem. However, little is known about animated scenarios as a tool to co-evaluate and further explore early user research insights and themes with end users. In this study, previous research findings and insights concerning emergency alarm pendants were designed and presented as animated scenarios to older participants in a workshop. Emergency alarms are wearable product technologies that allow the user to alert designated contacts in the event of falls or medical emergencies and were chosen as a case study for this paper. The findings indicate, that while the animated scenarios provide a basis for participants to describe problems associated with using the emergency alarm technology, participants also used the animated scenarios to discus and evaluate the key emotions and themes that were presented. We refer to this process as co-evaluate. It is argued that animated scenarios can be used to validate the HCI designers' understanding and interpretation of early user research insights and themes.},

We compared an easy-to-read text and a hard-to-read text on both first language English (L1) readers and second language English (L2) readers. Text readability was measured using the standard readability formulas such as the Flesch-Kincaid Grade level. Results show that text readability does cause different eye movements and produce reading comprehension results that deviate from what is normally expected. Readers are affected more by the distractions when reading easy-to-read text compared to when reading hard-to-read text. Furthermore, L2 readers are affected more than L1 readers.

In two experiments conducted according to the two scenarios, participants performed tasks most quickly using a paper book or a PC. They had trouble flipping through pages with a tablet PC. Although the paper book was inferior to the PC in terms of turning over pages continuously with rapidity, participants performed flexible navigation with the paper book such as starting the navigation from various positions of the book and jumping to the target position straight away without hesitating skipping over the target. Based on these results, we provide suggestions to improve a page navigation feature in electronic media.},

We also identify workarounds devised by users in order to minimize their cognitive workload while multitasking across apps on their mobile devices.

A large body of research from the last three decades has laid the foundation for the concepts now emerging in the market. Yet, there has been little focus on the analysis of consumer user interfaces being produced for these new platforms. As technology is progressing, there is an increasing need to study current trends in user and developer communities, and to contextualise them within the ongoing evolution of human-computer interfaces. In this paper, we specifically focus on mixed reality (MR) within immersed simulations enabled through combining VR headsets with vision sensors. We present an analysis of apps on the Leap Motion market and outline suggestions for developers and designers to assist with creating more natural user interface experiences.},

Rebound tenderness is used by health practitioners to physically examine a patient's abdomen by applying and then releasing pressure with the hands. This paper demonstrates a novel technique to allow an actuated shape display to detect interactions caused by the user pressing down upon a soft surface by means of a Hall effect sensor. User evaluation of the interaction reveals that the further the user is required to press down into the surface, the more accurately the task is performed when visual cues are present, but the relationship between accuracy and depth is inverted when users are required to perform a depth recall task without the presence of visual cues. The results of this research support the continued development of ForceForm for rebound tenderness simulations and suggest that unexpected user performance patterns may occur when utilising soft interfaces.},

While most research exploring the effects of graph layout looks at a user's ability to accomplish a passive understanding task, this paper's novel contribution is looking at their ability to complete a selection task. Specifically we compare two graph layout algorithms with respect to their suitability for free-form multi-selection.The two layout algorithms are drawn from our previous work which established that they have significantly different understandability metric scores. A motivation for this choice was to explore whether graphs with significantly different metric scores will also have significantly different performance for selection tasks. We carried out our comparison by means of a user experiment that followed a within-subjects design, where 74 users were given a PlayStation Move controller to select vertices in 20 pairs of graphs. We found that while there was no difference in the speed of interaction there was a difference in the number of errors users made between the two layout algorithms.},

We present preliminary work from an ongoing study which aims to determine the effectiveness of different visual representations and large scale displays in supporting discovery. Following an iterative process of implementation and evaluation, representations were tested by potential users in the bioinformatics domain to determine their efficacy, and to understand better the range of ad hoc practices among bioinformatics literate users. Results from two rounds of small scale user studies are considered with initial findings suggesting that bioinformaticians require richly detailed views of TF data, features to compare TF layouts between organisms quickly, and ways to keep track of interesting data points.},

The children's interactions with the robot and with the adult experimenter were video recorded and analysed in order to identify some of the children's expectations of the robot's behaviour and capabilities, and to observe their strategies for interacting with a speaking and minimally animated artificial agent. We found a surprising breadth in children's reactions, expectations and strategies (as evidenced by their behaviour) and a noteworthy tolerance for the robot's occasionally awkward behaviour.},

Age, gender, the play of casual games compared to shooters, and in-game experiences of flow, autonomy and relatedness were associated with increases in dimensions of wellbeing.},

abstract = {Designing digital technologies that support children in middle childhood (8-12 years) play in nature can instil environmental values that motivate pro-environmental behaviour. However, gathering real-time and situated insights into children's independent play experiences in nature is often challenging as children of this age group are often secretive about their play activities and 'special play places'. Wearable video recorders present an opportunity for overcoming many barriers to understanding children's play experiences. Here we present a study where we provided twelve children (8-11 years) with a wearable video recorder while they played in their special place in nature. We then analysed the data to determine how these devices uniquely contribute to our understanding of the children's play experience. Our analysis found that wearable audio-video recorders provide a unique and rich perspective on children's play from the point of view of the child. The data captured was situated, naturalistic, spatial-temporal, social and visceral.},

abstract = {This paper presents an essay aimed at prompting broad discussion crucial in keeping the interaction design discourse fresh, critical, and in motion. We trace the changing role of people who have advanced from consumers to producers, from stationary office workers to mobile urban nomads, from passive members of the plebs to active instigators of change. Yet, interaction designers often still refer to them only as 'users.' We follow some of the historic developments from the information superhighway to the smart city in order to provide the backdrop in front of which we critically analyse three core areas. First, the issue of echo chambers and filter bubbles in social media results in a political polarisation that jeopardises the formation of a functioning public sphere. Second, pretty lights and colourful fa\c{c}ades in media architecture are increasingly making way for situated installations and interventions fostering community engagement. And third, civic activism is often reduced to forms of slacktivism. We synthesise our discussion to propose 'citizen-ability' as an alternative goal for interaction designers to aspire to in order to create new polities and civics for a better quality of life.},

abstract = {This paper presents findings from a series of iterative field studies on the use of interactive, situated digital technologies deployed within a pop-up style format used for the purpose of community engagement. Based on observations, participant interviews, and a focus group with representatives from the local government authority, the contribution of this research is twofold. First, we propose five elements to guide the design of digital pop-up interventions for community engagement. Second, we demonstrate the effectiveness of combining digital interfaces and a physical pop-up within a civic space equipped with a large urban screen to engage wider cross-sections of the public. From that, we derive insights about the utilisation of this approach in attracting the attention of people who do not generally attend traditional community engagement events, and provide a more seamless consultation process by enabling citizens to submit their responses on the spot.},

abstract = {Driving can be a lonely activity. While there has been a lot of research and technical inventions concerning car-to-car communication and passenger entertainment, there is still little work concerning connecting drivers. Whereas tourism is very much a social activity, drive tourists and road trippers have few options to communicate with fellow travelers. Our study is placed at the intersection of tourism and driving. It aims to enhance the trip experience during driving through social interaction. This paper explores how a mobile application that allows instant messaging between travelers sharing similar context can establish a temporary, ad hoc community and enhance the road trip experience. A prototype was developed and evaluated in various user and field studies. The study's outcomes are relevant for the design of future mobile tourist guides that benefit from community design, social encounters and recommendations.},

abstract = {By capturing our experiences we often strive to better remember them in the future. However, the act of media capturing also influences these same experiences in the present, an area which is underexplored. This paper describes a study with the aim to inform the design of novel media capturing strategies. Adopting an approach of defamiliarization based on intervention and reflection, we strive to gain insights in the influences of future capturing technologies on the experience of a day out. We conducted an exploratory study in which 28 students went on a day out and used a variety of capturing strategies. Individual and group reflections on the experience during this day identified several important aspects that media capturing influences: engagement, perception &amp; attention and social activity. The paper concludes with implications for design and proposes three potential future directions for media capturing, that instead of disturbing the moment enhance the experience.},

These centres are non-profit, often government supported organizations that rely on the help of their volunteers and social workers. This paper reports on our preliminary findings from field visits to one such centre called Communify, in the inner west of Brisbane, Australia. Communify runs an emergency food relief facility for people who find themselves in a crisis or temporarily unable to afford groceries. Over a period of five months, we did several field visits to the centre and carried out 21 short in-situ interviews, with a mix of Communify clients and volunteers. Our results shed light on people's experiences of financial hardship and their interactions with the emergency relief centre. In particular, issues related to their perceived values and stigmas associated with their experiences are highlighted in our findings. We identify opportunities for design that can empower people struggling with financial hardship.},

abstract = {Ethics is emerging as a key issue for HCI researchers working in increasingly sensitive and complex settings. New technologies are now designed and evaluated in settings with vulnerable or marginalised participants, which can be emotionally challenging for researchers and give rise to complex ethical dilemmas that are highly contextualized and difficult to plan for. Further, discrepancies may arise between the structured processes of formal ethics approval in universities and other organisations and the realities of HCI fieldwork 'in the wild'. This workshop builds on our CHI 2015 workshop, providing an opportunity for HCI researchers and others to communally reflect on ethical encounters in HCI research. We particularly focus on situational ethics, researcher wellbeing, maintaining boundaries around the research, issues of consent and participation, and ethical issues arising from the disruption that new technologies cause. We aim to develop a handbook of practical lessons arising from ethical issues encountered in HCI research in sensitive and complex settings.},
