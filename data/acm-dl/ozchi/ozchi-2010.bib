abstract = {We used an online questionnaire in the end of a case study to explore whether and how professional role - the role of a news journalist or a news photographer - affects user experience of smart phones used for mobile news making. Fifteen participants assessed the pragmatic and hedonic qualities and an overall judgment of appeal of a smart phone based mobile journalism system. We found that photographers assessed the hedonic quality identification more negatively than journalists and a similar trend was found for hedonic quality stimulation. We did not find a statistically significant difference between the user groups for the perception of pragmatic qualities or overall judgment of appeal.},

abstract = {The growth of powerful entertainment functions of mobile devices, in particular mobile video, has recently attracted much attention. Studies on mobile TV, one form of mobile video, have been conducted in many countries. However, little research focuses on the holistic usage of mobile video. To understand the features of such usage, we conducted an online survey in Brisbane, Australia, during the first half of 2010. Our findings reveal similarities and diversities between usage of mobile TV in particular and mobile video on the whole.. The results could aid in improving the design of future studies, with a view to ultimately increase user satisfaction.},

Bicycling communities have gradually shown interests in quantitative data of the bicycling experiences such as road roughness, inclination, pollution, etc. Bikers utilize these data to infer the possible stamina cost and quality of surroundings. This supports them to make a better decision. This study assumes that fitness level indexed by stamina cost could enhance a biker's sense of control. The prototype in this paper was developed to provide stamina cost information, which is inferred from the terrain patterns of a biking route. In the system evaluation, participants took a positive attitude toward this prototype and approved the importance of stamina cost feedback. This paper also concluded several key issues about designing the stamina cost feedback system for bikers.},

This is explored through results from a two-month field study that investigated the planning and decision making behaviour of people engaged in preparing for multipoint, international air travel. Planning travel is a type of ill-structured complex problem that is characterised as being temporally sporadic, sometimes synchronous, often asynchronous, frequently collaborative, and spatially varied with participants at different times co-located and in separate places. Research participants were professional travel agents and non-professional but experienced travel planners. Ancillary material collected included photographs of the planning situation and drawings and notes made by participants. In contrast to the formalised prescriptive planning models common in cognitive science and operations research, the everyday planning activity featured in this study is situated and naturalistic. This research is undertaken with a view to designing systems to support the design and decision making activity of travel planners.},

By using our system, users can manage windows in a project without having to manually group windows. We conduct an experiment to evaluate the system. The results indicate that the system can accurately identify as important windows the main files a user used for projects by clustering keyboard operation times on windows; it can also detect files associated with the main file without detection omissions by clustering window z values and visible representation ratios.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Graphical Profile Definition Language (GPDL), a language for the definition of profiles for alerting systems, and an interactive system with which users can construct and edit GPDL-based profiles. In an alerting system profiles define potentially complex conditions about which users wish to be notified. Most current approaches to supporting profile definition, such as those that require the use of XML/XPath, are unsuitable for the general user population. Others support only a limited set of possible profiles to reduce the complexity of the interface. GPDL overcomes these limitations, supporting users to graphically express arbitrarily complex profiles involving Boolean expressions and temporal constraints. The GPDL editor provides a direct manipulation environment in which profiles can be constructed in a dynamic and flexible manner.The paper also presents the findings of a user evaluation of the GPDL language and editor. With minimal training users were able to interpret and specify profiles with high levels of accuracy and had positive subjective responses to the language and user interface. Some aspects that were not readily understood by all users, such as absolute and repetitive temporal constraints, are discussed along with suggested future work.},

The finger registration process is activated whenever the user places a hand, in any orientation, anywhere on the touchscreen. Such a finger registration technique enables the design of intuitive multitouch interfaces that directly map different combinations of the user's fingers to the interface operations. In this paper, we first study the effectiveness and robustness of the finger registration process. We then demonstrate the usability of our finger registration method for two new interfaces. Specifically, we describe the Palm Menu, which is an intuitive dynamic menu interface that minimizes hand and eye movement during operations, and a virtual mouse interface that enables user to perform mouse operations in multitouch environment. We conducted controlled experiments to compare the performance of the Palm Menu against common command selection interfaces and the virtual mouse against traditional pointing devices.},

abstract = {Ethnographic video is used extensively in some industrial corporations to document field studies and to convey an understanding of what is 'out there' to HCI designers and developers of new technologies. The basic assumption is that ethnography through questioning the prevailing conceptions of 'users' and their practices can encourage development engineers to solve the right problems with socially sustainable solutions. However, engineering is solution-driven, with the currency of negotiation being requirement specifications and solution principles. While providing ethnographic insight and recommendations is surely ideal and appropriate in many cases, there are situations, in which a bolder engagement is called for to ensure an impact on the development process. In this paper we explore how video can function to initiate 'requirement specs' discussions rather than just as inspiration or field data. We investigate how video specs can support an engineering development process, and help set clear limitations for which solutions might work, and which might not, while retaining some of the richness of the field studies.},

The study shows how design ideas and concepts are managed through the phase of idea generation and conceptualization. Design decisions are really oscillations between ambiguity and temporary closures or stabilizations. They are not forking paths of decisions that lead to possibilities that lead to rhetorical situations and so on.

In the study, 21 participants reported their experiences by writing experience reports over a period of ten days. These reports were analysed with a set of playful experience categories which enabled us to articulate -- i.e., to identify and name -- the core experience in each report. We found three types of experience in the reports; interaction, context and product experiences. With regards to the playfulness, the results showed that playful experience categories can largely explain the UX of personal mobile products. Our findings will help UX research and experience-driven design to focus on the most pleasurable aspects of user experiences.},

The initial hypothesis of the design process, leading to the design experiment has been that the spectator experience is not merely an experience of receiving and consuming entertainment. It is also heavily reliant on the active participation of the spectator in creating the atmosphere of the entire event. The BannerBattle experiment provides interactive technology in sport arenas with a form of interaction based on existing behaviour in the context. The work presented also argues for a need to overcome the inclination to designing technological systems that imitate or compete with the experience of watching the television broadcast of the game. Experiments such as the presented BannerBattle are cornerstones in our exploratory research-through-design approach to designing technologies for social experiences.},

abstract = {The ability to read documents and notes is a crucial part of the education system, but for over 1200 visually impaired students in New Zealand and many more worldwide, large and clearly printed documents remain elusive. Resizing documents for visually impaired readers currently requires a mixture of time, patience and experience with word processors such as Microsoft Word. This paper describes the design and construction of an add-in to simplify the process of resizing documents so that they become more readable to the visually impaired. This paper discusses common problems with the resizing of documents, and the tools produced to help reduce or eliminate these problems. The tools were evaluated in the resizing of workbooks by staff at a visual resource centre with promising results.},

We carried out a case study in which nineteen participants used smart phones for reporting news to an online publication. We identified two sets of high-level evaluation criteria, contextual and personal. Contextual high-level criteria found are error-freeness, support for journalistic quality and speed of publishing. Personal, user-related criteria are users' needs and goals related to enabling and supporting of professional ambition, supporting user's professional goals, as well as fit with and enhancement of the user's professional image. Findings provide empirical evidence on factors that affect user experience that are relevant for evaluation of mobile technology in mobile news making. In addition, findings provide an initial insight into understanding professionals' user experience and importance of high-level goals and needs as factors linked to quality perceptions, attitudes, acceptance, affect and motivation to use mobile technologies in work context.},

It also revealed that certain aspects of cognitive decline related to aging, such as central executive function, have more impact on time, correct uses and intuitive uses than chronological age.

Rarely, have objective and subjective indicators been related to one another in order to understand what constitutes a liveable urban neighbourhood both spatially and behaviourally. This paper explores the use of qualitative (diaries, in-depth interviews) and quantitative (Global Positioning Systems, Geographical Information Systems mapping) liveability research data to examine the perceptions and behaviour of 12 older residents living in six high density urban areas of Brisbane. Older urban Australians are one of the two principal groups highly attracted to high density urban living. The strength of the relationship between the qualitative and quantitative measures was examined. Results of the research indicate a weak relationship between subjective and objective indicators. Linking the two methods (quantitative and qualitative) is important in obtaining a greater understanding of human behaviour and the lived world of older urban Australians and in providing a wider picture of the urban neighbourhood.},

From this standpoint we are developing rigourous processes to support magical thinking, with the aim of understanding how to support the conception and development of technologies that we can't yet imagine, to the point where they can be evaluated. We are approaching our problem from a number of perspectives, including the development and use of placebo objects and devices, probe-like enquiry through one on one interviews and workshops where we encourage people to make their own exploratory devices, and thereby extend and challenge the way we, as design researchers, are thinking about technology conception and design. We present here our burgeoning approach to analysing the OWL interview outcomes. New processes demand new techniques. We draw on well established methods and consider how they might be subverted to support our needs.},

abstract = {Instrumental music performance is a well-established case of real-time interaction with technology and, when extended to ensembles, of interaction with others. However, these interactions are fleeting and the opportunities to reflect on action is limited, even though audio and video recording has recently provided important opportunities in this regard. In this paper we report on research to further extend these reflective opportunities through the capture and visualization of gestural data collected during collaborative virtual performances; specifically using the digital media instrument Jam2jam AV and the specifically-developed visualization software Jam2jam AV Visualize. We discusses how such visualization may assist performance development and understanding. The discussion engages with issues of representation, authenticity of virtual experiences, intersubjectivity and wordless collaboration, and creativity support. Two usage scenarios are described showing that collaborative intent is evident in the data visualizations more clearly than in audio-visual recordings alone, indicating that the visualization of performance gestures can be an efficient way of identifying deliberate and co-operative performance behaviours.},

For the web-based tool we used a diary in form of a table distributed in digital form, which resulted in a very low number of responses. Results from follow-up interviews revealed that one of the reasons for this low response rate was a mismatch between diary form and study context. For the wearable display we designed booklets, which featured predefined sections and questions as well as space for open comments. Although previous research has identified disadvantages of paper-based diaries, this method proved to be valuable for collecting feedback in a mobile context. Based on our experiences and the results from the studies, we provide a qualitative discussion of design issues for diaries used in mobile and desktop-based contexts.},

Here we synthesize this literature into a framework, consisting of aspects such as purposes of reflection, conditions for reflection and levels of reflection (where the levels capture the behaviours and activities associated with reflection). We then show how technologies can support these different aspects and conclude with open questions that can guide a more systematic approach to how we understand and design for support of reflection.},

The key goal was to communicate to staff that excessive printing has a tangible and negative effect on their workplace and local environment. The research objective was to better understand what motivates staff towards more ecologically sustainable printing practises, whilst meeting their job's demands. The current study is built on previous research that found that one interface does not address the needs of all users when creating persuasive Human Computer Interaction (HCI) interventions targeting resource consumption. In response, the current study created and trialled software that communicates individual paper consumption in precise metrics. Based on preliminary research data different metric sets have been defined to address the different motivations and beliefs of user archetypes using descriptive and injunctive normative information.},

abstract = {The use of feedback technologies, in the form of products such as Smart Meters, is increasingly seen as the means by which 'consumers' can be made aware of their patterns of resource consumption, and to then use this enhanced awareness to change their behaviour to reduce the environmental impacts of their consumption. These technologies tend to be single-resource focused (e.g. on electricity consumption only) and their functionality defined by persons other than end-users (e.g. electricity utilities). This paper presents initial findings of end-users' experiences with a multi-resource feedback technology, within the context of sustainable housing. It proposes that an understanding of user context, supply chain management and market diffusion issues are important design considerations that contribute to technology 'success'.},

Various solutions have been proposed, from labour-intensive but accurate manual matching, to machine-learning approaches to automated matching which require little input from people, but are not perfectly accurate. Researchers have a particular interest in name management: they are often authors, and receive academic credit based on their work and need correct citation records. However they are also searchers and have an interest in finding all the works by other authors. There has been little work on the tensions between these two needs, nor on how researchers manage their own identities with their choices of name. This paper reports on a study of researchers that investigates both their relationships with their own names, and what they would like from research databases when they are searching for specific authors.},

We identify four simple security indicators that accurately represent security properties of the connection and then examine 125 popular websites to determine if the sites' designs result in correctly displayed security indicators during login. In the vast majority of cases, at least some security indicators are absent or suboptimal. This suggests users are becoming habituated to ignoring recommended security indicators.},

abstract = {The so-called creative design methods have become part of the everyday HCI-ers toolbox, however there is little discussion in the field concerning the actual value and the relative benefit of applying one method instead of another or of applying various methods in one's design efforts. These methods and techniques tend often to be applied in an unthoughtful uninformed manner.This paper discusses the issue of evaluating and comparing the design methods and presents an overview of creativity measures for idea generation together with an attempt to rationalise those measures and combine them into a single value metric. This measure is then applied to assess the results obtained while using a specific method, the BadIdeas method, under various conditions; some observations and analysis on the possible effects of those conditions are performed.Findings are surprising. Facilitated conditions positively affect participants' enjoyment of the method and the way they think about analysing products but the overall value of facilitation appears less than the overall value of unfacilitated work. The method seems to work better for groups that initially work individually, than those who start working in groups and overall results are better in a design, rather than in a redesign context.},

This paper draws upon sonification techniques used in previous implementations of audio-based 3D environments to develop a prototype of blind-accessible virtual tours specifically tailored to the needs of cultural sites. A navigable 3D world is presented using spatially positioned musical earcons, accompanied by synthesised speech descriptions and navigation aids. The worlds are read from X3D models enhanced with metadata to identify and describe the rooms and exhibits, thus enabling an audio modality for existing 3D worlds and simplifying the tour creation process. The prototype, named AUXie, was evaluated by 11 volunteers with total blindness to establish a proof of concept and identify the problematic aspects of the interface. The positive response obtained confirmed the validity of the approach and yielded valuable insight into how such tours can be further improved.},

Recent computer vision based head tracking and eye tracking technologies have expanded the possibilities of designing and developing more natural and intuitive user interfaces for a wide range of applications. In this work, we focus on common hands-busy situations in teleoperation activities, where operators often have to control multiple devices simultaneously by hand in order to accomplish operational tasks. This overloads an operator's hand control ability and also reduces productivity. We present an empirical user study comparing head motion and eye gaze as different input modalities for remote camera control when a user is carrying out a hands-busy task. Both objective measures and subjective measures were used for the study. According to the results, we demonstrate the advantages of using gaze for remote camera control in such hands-busy settings.},

In this paper we investigate informal interactions by exploring how students 'get together' when out-of-class. We establish if and when copresence is felt in physical and technological settings and what kinds of informal interactions arise as a result. The findings reveal that copresence in technological settings is associated with temporality and 'feeling connected' through synchronous and semi-synchronous mediums. This feeling includes being aware of others' availability for interaction or knowing their whereabouts. Different settings also have different implications for copresence and informal interactions.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate how boys and girls of 8 and 12 years old experience interacting with a social robot (iCat) during collaborative game play. The iCat robot and a child collaborated together to play a simple card guessing game. Post-game questionnaires revealed that 8 year old children rated their subjective gaming experience significantly more positively than the 12 year olds. All interactions were recorded, and fragments were shown to judges in a perception experiment, which showed that 8 year olds were more expressive than 12 year olds, and that 12 year old losers were more expressive than 12 year old winners. The implications of these findings for designing child-robot interaction are discussed.},

We evaluated how learner-adaptive computer programs can be successfully integrated in primary classrooms in situ, using observations, interviews and computer-based data logs. The study found participating teachers felt time poor and they did not priorities learning to use new technologies. However, if they find add-on value they use the technology to complement traditional teaching. The response to using Spelling Bug was positive from both teachers and students. Students enjoyed a new task for working with spelling and they responded positively to the individual challenge the computer program set up for them. Teachers were pleased to find their students working independently and found time to support individual needs in the classroom. Retrieving information from a computer program gave support for teachers when making decisions on how to proceed with their teaching and presenting to parents.},

This paper reports the preliminary results from a user study exploring the relationships between Web users' searching behavior and their cognitive style. The data was collected using a questionnaire, Web search logs and think-aloud strategy. The preliminary findings reveal a number of cognitive factors, such as information searching processes, results evaluations and cognitive style, having an influence on users' Web searching behavior. Among these factors, the cognitive style of the user was observed to have a greater impact. Based on the key findings, a conceptual model of Web searching and cognitive styles is presented.},

Our goal is to investigate the effects of users' cognitive styles on their Web search behavior in relation to two broad components: Information Searching and Information Processing Approaches. We use questionnaires, a measure of cognitive style, Web session logs and think-aloud as the data collection instruments. Our study findings show wholistic Web users tend to adopt a top-down approach to Web searching, where the users searched for a generic topic, and then reformulate their queries to search for specific information. They tend to prefer reading to process information. Analytic users tend to prefer a bottom-up approach to information searching and they process information by scanning search result pages.},

The extension provides the possibility of overcoming some of the limitation of a face-to-face encounter, e.g. limitations in time and participation. At the same time -- as the example shows -- the use of social media in co-design is challenging. Finally, the article will reflect on the experience with the idea of extending the social encounters with social media-platforms in relation to future work.},

Geovisualisation provides a tool with which, through the exploitation of our powerful perceptual abilities, we can uncover patterns and links between previously disparate data sources. However, in the context of sense and decision making, presenting information through the frame of location is not enough -- a holistic system, that incorporates geovisualisation, needs to be aware of the broader context in which it exists. A point represented by GPS coordinates can have different meanings to different people, and even an individuals' interpretation of a location can change over time. This paper will discuss the role of geovisualisation in knowledge discovery, with location as a context to this process.},

Managing this fear and danger represented an important user need. We found that mobile social networking systems are not only integral for bringing people together, they can help in the process of users safely dispersing as well. We conclude, however, that at a time when the average iPhone staggers under the weight of a plethora of apps that do everything from acting as a carpenter's level to a pregnancy predictor, we consider the potential for the functionality of a personal safety device to be embodied within a stand alone artifact.},

Instead they tend to refer to 'the others' or even to their own parents. Rather than using biological age, institutional categories or similar formal ways to group the people that we imagine as the future users, we suggest to talk about situated elderliness. By associating elderliness not to all encompassing life circumstances but to certain everyday contexts we can turn our attention towards what we call communities of everyday practice that defines these contexts.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Footsteps, an urban game that pairs geographically separated traffic islands, and augments them with projections of human activity coming from corresponding islands. This concept was designed and prototyped for the OZCHI 2010 24-Hour Student Design Challenge, in which we were asked to enliven an unused space in our current location, using novel or existing technologies. We chose to address this challenge by presenting a game designed to encourage playful and social interaction in the city of Sydney. Given that this concept was prototyped and evaluated within 24 hours, we believe there is potential to improve the design through further exploration and user testing.},

abstract = {Transient spaces---locations one passes through on their way to other destinations---often remain overlooked and unused. In this paper we present the design of an intervention to revitalise the unused transient space of Hobart's Salamanca Lawns at night. It would enable people to re-encounter the space through social interaction. We developed and field tested a prototype using colourful game tokens (1-bit LEDs). Scattered in and around the Lawns, the LEDs drew the attention of passers-by, enticing them onto the Lawns. Once there participants could take part in a communal game using the tokens. Our evaluation revealed this was an effective way to draw the attention of passers-by and that further prototyping and evaluation would be valuable.},

This project also seeks to discover if the introduction of nature (green plants) as the interface would encourage users to increase participation in socially responsive activities.Using plants as the interface offers an immediate sensory connection between the participants and the outcome of their chosen actions. This may generate a deeper awareness of the environment by enabling the participant to realise that their one small action in an ordinary day can contribute positively to larger global issues.},

Techniques, such as diary studies, where participants capture their activities for a period of time are routinely used in technology design and evaluation at companies like Yahoo!. Less frequently used is shadowing where ethnographers accompany or follow people as they go about their tasks. However, with the increasing penetration of mobile personal devices like cell phones and GPS-enabled, digital tablets, it is becoming more important for us to understand how technologies fit into people lives as they go about their daily business. Tools for ethnographers have changed dramatically over the decades with smaller, cheaper, and easier to use technologies allowing capture of audio, image and film data to capture people's activities for later analysis. In this demonstration, we explore how sensor-based technologies can extend this toolkit further.},

abstract = {The emergence of mobile and ubiquitous computing technology has created what is often referred to as the hybrid space -- a virtual layer of digital information and interaction opportunities that sit on top of and augment the physical environment. Embodied media materialise digital information as observable and sometimes interactive parts of the physical environment. The aim of this work is to explore ways to enhance people's situated real world experience, and to find out what the role and impact of embodied media in achieving this goal can be. The Edge, an initiative of the State Library of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, and case study of this thesis, envisions to be a physical place for people to meet, explore, experience, learn and teach each other creative practices in various areas related to digital technology and arts. Guided by an Action Research approach, this work applies Lefebvre's triad of space (1991) to investigate the Edge as a social space from a conceived, perceived and lived point of view. Based on its creators' vision and goals on the conceived level, different embodied media are iteratively designed, implemented and evaluated towards shaping and amplifying the Edge's visitor experience on the perceived and lived level.},

abstract = {This paper outlines the scope, approach and current progress of a thesis which is investigating the role that Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) plays in supporting the design process within the web design industry. Specifically, the thesis investigates designerclient communication, and explores the issues with technologies to support this communication. This research is situated within the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW).Web design businesses use a variety of CMC tools to support communication with their clients; however they must rely on general purpose tools which the client has prior knowledge of. Social Software solutions which can better support these processes have yet to become adopted within the industry. The research question for this work is how can Social Software be better designed to support designer-client communication within web design businesses?A platform that facilitates the creation of Social Software will be designed, deployed and evaluated in situ to investigate the problems and opportunities for Social Software within this space. An iterative design process will be used to develop and evaluate the platform through the use of ethnographic action research and design thinking methods. The aim of the platform is to reduce the challenges of introducing new software into web design businesses, and evaluate the platform through participatory design studies of developing new tools which better support the design process. The results of the platform will be used to inform a design framework for Social Software designers wanting to develop tools to support communication in this context.},
