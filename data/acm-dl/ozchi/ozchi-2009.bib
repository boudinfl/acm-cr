abstract = {This paper extends the analytic framework Suchman used in Plans and Situated Actions by using it as a tool in the design of interactive, immersive environments that rely on human movement as input. We describe the historical and methodological background to Suchman's framework and the impact of her analysis on the development of HCI and related fields. We provide two examples of its use to support prototype evaluation, design reflection and generative and iterative design. Suchman's recognition that computers act on the basis of resources within their situations, just as people act in accord with the resources of theirs, broadens our focus from the design of interfaces to the design of situations within which interaction between people and computers can occur. The tool, and the methodological and theoretical commitments embedded within it, contribute to the design of emerging technologies and to current discussions about approaches to design within shifting paradigms of HCI.},

abstract = {Past research asserts that patterns or claims will help capture and communicate interaction-design advice. Both structures attempt to provide advice in context along with the justifications for fit. These properties aim to make patterns or claims more concrete and comprehensible to novice designers than design guidelines. However, empirical work evaluating these promises is lacking. This research presents a controlled study that examines the value of structuring design advice as patterns or as claims. Patterns and claims seem different given their respective roots in architecture and design rationale. They also differ in their emphasis when capturing design decisions; patterns emphasize capturing a problem-solution pair in a certain context, whereas claims focus on capturing the positive and negative implications to a design decision. The findings from the study suggest it may be promising to combine the claim and pattern structures and that such a structure may facilitate discussions of design trade-offs.},

While shopping is an essential and routine type of consumer behaviour, emerging technologies posses the qualities to change our behaviour and patterns while shopping. This paper describes CAST - a context-aware shopping trolley designed to support the shopping activity in a supermarket through context-awareness and the acquiring of user attention. The design is based on understandings of supermarket shopping needs and behaviour derived from previous studies. The system supports customers in finding and purchasing products from a shopping list. A field evaluation showed that CAST affected the shopping behaviour and experience in more ways, e.g. more uniform behaviour in terms of product sequence collection, ease of finding products. However, they saved no significant time of the shopping activity.},

While research has demonstrated benefits of voice, its introduction into the popular VW Second Life (SL) was controversial, and some users have rejected it. In order to understand the benefits and problems that voice brings to virtual worlds, we used qualitative methods to gather data from SL users and analyse it. We discuss our results in the light of media-richness theory and its critiques, arguing that preferences for voice or text reflect a broader problem of managing social presence in virtual contexts.},

We present an exploration on the topic of "Brute Force" that aims to support researchers and designers who want to leverage the benefits of such forceful interactions. We present the results of a survey on this topic and describe how the salient themes could be used to inspire design work, in particular in a mediated environment, augmented with computing technology. We describe how the themes inspired certain features, and how technological limitations were overcome during this process. We hope with our work we can encourage designers to expand their range of supported interactions to include these physically intense behaviors we call Brute Force that are exhibited in many activities in people's lives.},

These concepts structure our findings in a way that may provide technology designers and researchers with a useful conceptual tool. These concepts draw attention to two aspects that have been little explored in the literature on understanding mobile practices. Firstly, the everyday uses of technologies to manage transitions between longer term durations of practices. Secondly, the integral role of stable contexts, beyond remote work spaces alone, for supporting and shaping mobile practices.},

We contribute to the literature on younger people's use of Internet banking in Australia and their perceptions of privacy, security and trust. We argue there is a need for greater transparency by service providers. We also see regulators being increasingly important in ensuring that social media, cloud computing and financial aggregation services do not lead to unrealistic expectations of security and privacy and a dilution of consumer protections},

abstract = {What does it mean when we design for accessibility, inclusivity and "dissolving boundaries" -- particularly those boundaries between the design philosophy, the software/interface actuality and the stated goals? This paper is about the principles underlying a research project called 'The Little Grey Cat engine' or greyCat. GreyCat has grown out of our experience in using commercial game engines as production environments for the transmission of culture and experience through the telling of individual stories. The key to this endeavour is the potential of the greyCat software to visualize worlds and the manner in which non-formal stories are intertwined with place. The apparently simple dictum of "show, don't tell" and the use of 3D game engines as a medium disguise an interesting nexus of problematic issues and questions, particularly in the ramifications for cultural dimensions and participatory interaction design. The engine is currently in alpha and the following paper is its background story. In this paper we discuss the problematic, thrown into sharp relief by a particular project, and we continue to unpack concepts and early designs behind the greyCat itself.},

abstract = {Large and public displays mostly provide little interactivity due to technical constraints, making it difficult for people to capture interesting information or to influence the screen's content. Through the combination of largescale visual output and the mobile phone as an input device, bidirectional interaction with large public displays can be enabled. In this paper, we propose and compare three different interaction techniques (Scroll, Tilt and Move) for continuous control of a pointer located on a remote display using a mobile phone. Since each of these techniques seemed to have arguments for and against them, we conducted a comparative evaluation and discovered their specific strengths and weaknesses. We report the implementation of the techniques, their design and results of our user study. The experiment revealed that while Move and Tilt can be faster, they also introduce higher error rates for selection tasks.},

abstract = {Moving and resizing desktop windows are frequently performed but largely unexplored interaction tasks. The standard title bar and border dragging techniques used for window manipulation have not changed much over the years. We studied three new methods to move and resize windows. The new methods are based on proxy and goal-crossing techniques to eliminate the need of long cursor movements and acquiring narrow window borders. Instead, moving and resizing actions are performed by manipulating proxy objects close to the cursor and by sweeping cursor motions across window borders. We compared these techniques with the standard techniques. The results indicate that further investigations and redesigns of window manipulation techniques are worthwhile: all new techniques were faster than the standard techniques, with task completion times improving more than 50% in some cases. Also, the new resizing techniques were found to be less error-prone than the traditional click-and-drag method.},

While previous flick-based interfaces have performed similarly to traditional scrolling for short distances, and worse for long ones, zoofing outperforms (and is preferred to) traditional scrolling, flick-based scrolling, and OrthoZoom.

One approach towards this complex endeavor is to build an understanding of these values through examining systems designed to address them. This paper focuses on an urban installation---CO2nfession/CO2mmitment---that deals with one such (societal) value: environmental sustainability. Designed to solicit personal opinions about climate change, we found the 'confessional' aspect of the installation encouraged strong reflexivity amongst 'users' with regards to this value and precipitated personal considerations about future actions. More importantly this reflexivity exposes people's lived and felt experiences about this societal value, unearthing their ambivalences, hindrances but also motivations. This installation highlights an alternate approach that can complement current efforts without taking a 'big stick' approach. Instead, urban media technologies can be harnessed to engage people with this value on their own terms, through encouraging conversations and supporting reflexivity.},

abstract = {Flick scrolling is a natural scrolling method for mobile touch devices such as the iPhone™. It is useful not only for its performance but perhaps even more so for its ease of use and user experience. Tilt scrolling instead uses the device's tilt to determine the rate of scrolling, which offers several potential interaction advantages over touch sensitive alternatives: scrolling can be achieved without occluding a large proportion of the screen with a hand, finger, or thumb; it frees drag input events for other important actions such as text selection and drag-and-drop; and it works regardless of the hand's state (e.g. moist or gloved). Although previously described, the performance of tilt scrolling has not been compared to flick scrolling, which is now the state of the art. Furthermore, it is unclear how such an empirical comparison should be conducted. To better understand interaction with mobile scrolling, we propose a new method of evaluating scrolling interfaces in the context of reading or analysis tasks. These activities typically involve slow subtle scroll movements rather than large movements typical investigated in most scrolling evaluations. We use this method to thoroughly compare flick scrolling and tilt scrolling. We show that tilt scrolling results in better performance for tasks performed while stationary while there is no significant difference while moving. However, we find that participants prefer flick scrolling and walk faster when completing moving tasks with flick scrolling than tilt scrolling.},

Two different representations have been created and compared in a user study: a diagram and a metaphor. In the diagram version the quality rating for each person is explicitly shown in charts and numbers. In the metaphorical representation feedback is implicitly visualized by changing certain characteristics of a pictorial scene. The results show that the metaphoric group mirror was not only more popular than the diagram, it also had a greater impact on the group behavior. When receiving negative feedback from the metaphoric group mirror, a correction of behavior was made significantly faster than with the diagram. Furthermore, both group mirrors had a positive effect on the self-regulation of the group compared to the baseline condition without feedback.},

This paper undertakes a review of technology assisted carpooling in order to understand the challenge of designing participation and consider how mobile social software and interface design can be brought to bear.It was found that while persuasive technology and social networking approaches have roles to play, critical factors in the design of carpooling are convenience, ease of use and fit with contingent circumstances, all of which require a use-centred approach to designing a technological system and building participation. Moreover, the reach of technology platform-based global approaches may be limited if they do not cater to local needs. An approach that focuses on iteratively designing technology to support and grow mobile social ridesharing networks in particular locales is proposed. The paper contributes an understanding of HCI approaches in the context of other designing participation approaches.},

Many individuals with disabilities enter into rehabilitation programs to improve their motor functioning and quality of life. Currently, many of the activities and exercises that are performed are monotonous, uninteresting, and do not inspire patients to perform to the best of their abilities. The usage of traditional exercises can also make it difficult for therapists to objectively measure and track patient progress. The integration of highly interactive and immersive technologies into rehabilitation programs has the potential to benefit both patients and therapists. We have developed a multi-touch tabletop system, the AIR Touch, which combines existing multi-touch technologies with a suite of new rehabilitation-centric applications.

Previous research has shown that providing social support and family support has profound roles on the weight management of individuals. However, the support provided by online health communities is outside the family context and is targeted at individuals. We are proposing SOFA (SOcial FAmily), an online social networking system aimed to engage and motivate families to adopt a healthy lifestyle through exposure to educational information on diet exercise and a range of other healthy living information. In this paper, we describe SOFA's features, the research questions that we are investigating and some preliminary results from a live deployment. The results showed that adding a social layer can considerably increase user engagement with static educational content and showed that the provision of family based profiles reduced the activity levels of individual family members when compared to those with individual profiles.},

The nature of sedentary activity is self-reinforcing, such that increasing physical and decreasing sedentary activity is difficult. Rather than trying to motivate users to reduce the time spent on sedentary activity, we focus on integrating physical activity into the sedentary activity of computer games playing through a novel game design. Our design leverages engagement with games in order to motivate users to perform physical activity, as part of the sedentary playing, by offering game rewards in return for physical activity performed. In this work we report on an initial user study of our game design applied to the open source Neverball game. We motivated users (in this case children) to perform physical activity by reducing the time allocated to perform tasks and captured their activity through accelerometers configured to recognise jumping movements. Findings showed that users performed more physical activity and decreased the amount of sedentary time when playing the active version of Neverball, while not reporting a decrease in perceived enjoyment of playing.},

Our previous studies have shown that this channel can be tapped to provide the feeling of presence of loved ones without the exchange of content. In this paper, the idea is discussed further by analysing the meaning of radio sounds at home from the perspectives of Acoustic Communication Theory. The analysis justifies the need to further explore the use of meaningful environmental sound objects in a domestic setting to negate 'social silence', by giving an example of a possible design.},

Characteristically, a select group of designers, key stakeholders and possibly end-users of a product work together to facilitate the design process. However, if understood with respect to the development of an open source project, open design projects can potentially involve any number of global participants that contribute to the online development of a product's voluntary advancement.In this paper I consider if the concept of open source development can be extended to collaborative interaction design practices. In doing so, I argue that effective open design processes for designing interactive experiences need to be developed and propose a way in which online communication tools and rationale instances can be used to share the iterative direction of open design decisions.},

The user needs to be supported in two cognitive tasks: 'representation construction', which involves finding an appropriate structure to aid sensemaking and 'encoding', which is populating that structure with meaningful information. Much work has been completed in the area of encoding, but the forms of representation construction and how they can be better supported in software requires further investigation.This paper reports on the design, implementation and evaluation of a web-based sensemaking tool called Coalesce. It tightly integrates search facilities with the representation construction task through the SenseMap -- an innovative interactive hierarchical mechanism for displaying, structuring and storing selected information. Results from controlled experiments indicate that Coalesce enhances users' searching, gathering and organizing tasks when compared to a standard browser and word processor combination, but without imposing an additional cognitive load.},

Despite its adaptation for training and fast-paced technological advancements, ways in which to evaluate efficacy of such technology are unclear. We have approached this problem by developed a new evaluation method focus on cognitive, affective and skill-based learning dimensions, based on traditional usability evaluation methods but tailored to specifically suit for the quantification of 3D VE system. We first describe the construct of the new method and then report a study utilizing the method in the context of quantifying a VE efficacy in an object assembly task. At last, we discuss the implications of such a method.},

Our contribution to the development of Isis is to perform an ethics centered consultation process with stakeholders who will contribute to the design and deployment of the end software package. To that end, we have sought to develop a "Modified Participatory Design" approach, utilizing the knowledge gained from the HCI community with regards to more traditional design projects and adapting this body of work to questions of ethics, privacy, corporate and civic responsibility, monitoring and awareness issues, etc. in an effort to create a fluid and agile communication process between stakeholders and designers, thus taking account of the ethical issues around Isis as design occurs.},

However, users have different IT competences and they are embedded within cultures. These are two central challenges that must be addressed in the development of HCI techniques and tools suitable for handling the complexity of designing for users across cultures. User-Centered Design is a first step, and for this paper we frame it specifically within the Scandinavian IS tradition to ensure direct participation by - and cooperation with - users through all phases of the design process. This approach serves as the basis for conceptual and experimental work-in-progress in our VisionLab. We describe the different techniques we are exploring, the essentials of which are to work with users in open dialogue. We point out that when working across cultures, virtually mediated cooperation with users is the next challenge, and conclude by sketching two digital techniques for virtual cooperative design using digital media and how they could be useful.},

Inspired by the benefits of persona in enhancing designer's attention through narrative and storytelling, the study reported in this paper tested persona as a communication tool in a focus group discussion with older adults in Malaysia. The study was carried out to gather Malaysian older adults' needs and requirements for the development of a prototype email application. Findings and feedbacks from the study shows that persona can be a potential technique to be applied in working with older adults.

However, good participation is hard to achieve and results linking project success and degree of participation are inconsistent. Through three case studies examining some of the challenges that different properties of knowledge -- novelty, difference, dependence -- can impose on the participatory endeavour we examine some of the consequences to the participatory process of failing to bridge across knowledge boundaries -- syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic. One pragmatic consequence, disrupting the user's feeling of involvement to the project, has been suggested as a possible explanation for the inconsistent results linking participation and project success. To aid in addressing these issues a new form of participatory research, called embedded research, is proposed and examined within the framework of the case studies and knowledge framework with a call for future research into its possibilities.},

Using observational techniques we investigated how passenger activities are mediated by artefacts, in this the bags that people carry. The relationship between passengers and their bags is shown to be complex and contingent on many factors. We report on our early research in the airport and document an emerging taxonomy of passenger activity. The significance of this research is in the contribution made to an understanding of passenger activities which could contribute to the design of future technologies for passenger facilitation and to airport terminal design.},

We first examine and discuss the existing collaboration processes and issues found in the day-to-day operations of the clothing industry. To further refine our understanding of what forms of collaboration are important when discussing design and manufacturing techniques, we conducted an ethnographic study with fashion design students. Based on this background research, we designed, developed and evaluated a multi-touch gestural prototype interface. We conclude with reflections on whether collocated natural interactions can be extended remotely via technology.},

abstract = {The OWL project is inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law of Technology Prediction: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. It consists of a series of open and speculative body-devices designed without a pre-defined function and tested as design 'probes' in order to ascertain their functionality. While the initial forms emerge from an investigation of the body, their functionality are determined through use. The project fuses fine art and contemporary design processes to arrive at ambiguous outcomes whose functionality is being ascertained 'after the fact' through interviews, or 'probing'. While not necessarily antidesign, the methodology contrasts dramatically with traditional design processes, where the purpose and broad functionality of 'that which is being designed' is usually known in advance. It calls into question the validity of a traditional approach when trying to design 'sufficiently advanced technology'. In this paper we present our process and the theoretical scaffold that supports our underlying thinking. Our field of concerns includes enchantment and ambiguity as resources for design, encouraging 'magical thinking' and 'making strange'.},

FrostWall displays provide a flexible display area between the inside of a private office workspace and the public corridor outside it. FrostWall uses "frosting" of glass windows and partitions between private and public workspaces in combination with projectors to create a display area that is effectively dual-sided: readable and operable from both sides. In addition to facilitating informal digital communication and information exchange between co-workers, this situated display area also provides a venue for playfulness and personal expression enhancing social cohesion between colleagues. FrostWall is also a unique vehicle for future research into interaction design for dual-sided interfaces.},

However, the question is, how to adapt stories in order to take advantage of the user's mobility and create an engaging and appealing experience. To address these new conditions, a Mobile Narrative was created and access to individual chapters of the story was restricted. Authors can specify constraints, such as a location or time, which need to be met by the reader if they want to read the story. This concept allows creative writers of the story to exploit the fact that the reader's context is known, by intensifying the user experience and integrating this knowledge into the writing process. Interviews with authors and creative writers and two user studies explored the effects of this way of writing on both parties. The paper presents our preliminary research findings discussing this new experience that was found to be exciting and interesting by both sides.},

abstract = {The gathering of people in everyday life is intertwined with travelling to negotiated locations. As a result, mobile phones are often used to rearrange meetings when one or more participants are late or cannot make it on time. Our research is based on the hypothesis that the provision of location data can enhance the experience of people who are meeting each other in different locations. This paper presents work-in-progress on a novel approach to share one's location data in real-time which is visualised on a web-based map in a privacy conscious way. Disposable Maps allows users to select contacts from their phone's address book who then receive up-to-date location data. The utilisation of peer-to-peer notifications and the application of unique URLs for location storage and presentation enable location sharing whilst ensuring users' location privacy. In contrast to other location sharing services like Google Latitude, Disposable Maps enables ad hoc location sharing to actively selected location receivers for a fixed period of time in a specific given situation. We present first insights from an initial application user test and show future work on the approach of disposable information allocation.},

This can take place in many forms and ways, e.g., through location-aware applications running on the individuals' portable devices, such as smart phones, or through large static devices, such as public displays, which are located within the augmented space and accessible by everyone. The hypothesis of this study is that in-place digital augmentation, in the context of civic participation, where citizens collaboratively aim at making their community or city a better place, offers significant new benefits, because it allows access to services or information that are currently inaccessible to urban dwellers where and when they are needed: in place.

Tasks are triggered by the student's proximity to field locations (using GPS coordinates). Students are directed to observe, collect, analyse and report data by utilising the features of the device, such as the in built camera, location services, text, handwriting and sketch entry, and the audio and video capabilities of the device. Data collated by students is uploaded to a secure server on completion of the tasks. All data is made available to students via the server for inclusion in reports, assessment items and for sharing and blogging on social networking sites.The project will assess changes to learning outcomes, and student attitudes and values towards the environment, comparing the experience of students using the explorer device with traditional paper-based descriptions and reporting.

abstract = {The trans-locative potential of the Internet has driven the design of many online applications. Online communities largely cluster around topics of interest, which take precedence over participants' geographical locations. The site of production is often disregarded when creative content appears online. However, for some, a sense of place is a defining aspect of creativity. Yet environments that focus on the display and sharing of regionally situated content have, so far, been largely overlooked.Recent developments in geo-technologies have precipitated the emergence of a new field of interactive media. Entitled locative media, it emphasizes the geographical context of media. This paper argues that we might combine practices of locative media (experiential mapping and geo-spatial annotation) with aspects of online participatory culture (uploading, file-sharing and search categorization) to produce online applications that support geographically 'located' communities. It discusses the design considerations and possibilities of this convergence, making reference to an example, OurPlace 3G to 3D, which has to date been developed as a prototype. It goes on to discuss the benefits and potential uses of such convergent applications, including the co-production of spatial-temporal narratives of place.},

The present work extends the study of Wiimote aiming for large displays by implementing two further techniques that consider relative movements and clutching. User testing is conducted and the results from all three techniques show that clutching performed worst while the absolute and relative techniques could not be statistically differentiated.},

These manipulations mostly aim at stealing the customers' authentication information (e.g. bank card PIN) to gain access to the victims' possessions. By relocating the input from the terminal to the users' mobile device, the system presented in this paper makes the authentication process resistant against such manipulations. In principle, this relocation makes PIN entry more complex, with a tendency to worse usability. In this paper, we present the concept as well as an evaluation that has been conducted to study the trade off between usability and security. The results show that users apparently are willing to accept a certain increase of interaction time in exchange for improved security.},

abstract = {Recent educational models of computer-based interactivity stress the important role of a learner's cognition. It has been suggested that interactive learning tasks carried out in the context of an authentic, problem-based scenario will result in deeper elaborative cognitive processing leading to greater conceptual understanding of the material presented. Research methods that have been used to investigate cognition and learning have traditionally included self-report questionnaires, focus groups, interviews and think-aloud protocols and, more recently in computer-based settings, interaction log file or 'audit trail' analysis. While all of these techniques help researchers understand students' learning processes, all are limited in that they rely either on self-report or behavioural information to speculate about the cognitive activity of users. The use of functional brain imaging techniques has the potential to address this limitation. Drawing on issues encountered during a recent study using Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), this paper discusses the methodological issues involved in the use of these techniques for exploring interactivity and cognition. Initial results comparing brain activation when exploring an interactive simulation with brain activation when using an equivalent tutorial program, for a single participant, are presented in order to provide information about the feasibility of the proposed methodological approach.},

These include the impact of an individual's weighting within the group; problems relating to inclusivity across certain user groups; and communication of appropriate user interaction to a diverse audience. These issues were explored by the authors' research using an anamorphic, anthropomorphic experimental display screen in a public location.

Expressive body movement is another interaction and communication channel in our analogue world. We know this from how a gesture can support speech in a face-to-face conversation. To this end the authors firstly observed how expressive movement is used in expressive dance. Findings from these observations informed the design of the UrK, which is a curious electronic device with a silicon skin. It communicates via Bluetooth with a network and uses multi-modal channels such as haptics, vibration and heat transfer to indicate its functional states. In use, the UrK is tracked using an accelerometer to initiate sound modulations that accompany an expressive dance movement. This paper gives an account of the design, development and initial user findings of the UrK with a dance troupe, which reveals some interesting initial insights into the expressive nature of the activity it enables, due to its design.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe a way to enhance human computer interaction using facial Electromyographic (EMG) sensors. Indeed, to know the emotional state of the user enables adaptable interaction specific to the mood of the user. This way, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) will gain in ergonomics and ecological validity. While expressions recognition systems based on video need exaggerated facial expressions to reach high recognition rates, the technique we developed using electrophysiological data enables faster detection of facial expressions and even in the presence of subtle movements. Features from 8 EMG sensors located around the face were extracted. Gaussian models for six basic facial expressions - anger, surprise, disgust, happiness, sadness and neutral - were learnt from these features and provide a mean recognition rate of 92%. Finally, a prototype of one possible application of this system was developed wherein the output of the recognizer was sent to the expressions module of a 3D avatar that then mimicked the expression.},

abstract = {For the first time OZCHI was preceded by a student design challenge this year. In line with the conference theme the challenge was organised as two 24-hour events. The first event took place online before the conference. Students from around the world were invited to create a solution for a specific design problem within 24 hours. The top two entries received a travel scholarship for attending OZCHI 2009. The second 24-hour event takes place in Melbourne. All students attending the conference are invited to participate in this challenge. Entries are exhibited during the main conference and the winners will be determined based on audience voting.},

abstract = {This paper introduces Palmap, which was designed and prototyped for the OZCHI 2009 24 Hour Design Challenge. It presents a design concept how navigation systems and maps could be used in the future. Background research and semi-structured interviews have been conducted to assess current status and to identify problems of maps and navigation. Palmap is an augmented reality (AR) based concept that focuses on gesture-based interaction. This concept is built on the assumption that, in the future, it will be possible to project rich virtual visual information directly into the eye of the user. Interactions would be possible with a virtual assistant and information projected on their palm. Three distinct interactions are described, namely selecting an option, displaying the 'next' and 'previous' options and a 'Total Immersion' function. The evaluation of the concept showed that participants were excited about the possibilities of this concept.},

We focus on individual access to stories recorded by others, and present Story Time through use of an e-paper interaction concept.},

abstract = {This paper outlines our submission to the OZCHI 2009 24-hour online design challenge. The goal of the project was to explore ways of enhancing user engagement with current maps. For the purposes of the design challenge, the concept was to be centred in the city of Melbourne. Our proposed map displays user interactions with the city in a way that constructs points of interest that are constantly changing based on these interactions. Displayed on a screen in Melbourne's CBD, this map brings together everyday flows of movement within the city and allows people to interact with the map using mobile devices.},
