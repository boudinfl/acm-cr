abstract = {This study explores the enhancement of creativity in students studying computer science at a tertiary level. It has been widely acknowledged (Blumenthal et al., 2003) that while creativity is advantageous to any form of study, the perceived lack of creativity, and its expression, in computer science students severely hampers their ability to accommodate the skills necessary to successfully perform within the IT industry. These creative skills include: innovation, intrinsic motivation, self confidence, independence of judgement, a wide range of interest and tolerance of ambiguity (Bahleda &amp; Runco, 1989; Ripple, 1989). Further, this study explores the potential of both technological and social collaborative environments to enhance and nurture these requisite creative skills. Computer science students are particularly receptive to online collaboration, thus being a focus in this study. Creativity is multifaceted with the components of person, product process and press (environment) interacting. Previous research has focussed on components of creativity such as person, process and product, yet fails to acknowledge the significance of the role of the environment, specifically online collaborative environments, as a facilitator for nurturing the creative person. Ironically, considering the apparent myth of the computer science student or "geek" who is perceived as a particularly anti-social creature, such a nurturing environment is the result of a social collaboration between the creative person and peers, mentors and teachers. In this study the creative environment is made possible through the use of computer support, or Creativity Support Systems (CSS).},

Whereas the original process of finding the resources often occurs in the public domain (e.g. WWW), the process of re-finding often uses private collection such as bookmarks. The research will investigate the experienced and novice users. We feel that these two types of users employed different strategy and approach in achieving their information target. We would like to bridge the gap between these two users by having a generic model which both users can benefit from it.},

We present one instantiation, the Spy-Resistant Keyboard, and discuss design decisions leading to the development of this keyboard. We also describe the results of a user study exploring the usability and security of our interface. Results indicate that although users took longer to enter their passwords, using the Spy-Resistant Keyboard rather than a standard soft keyboard resulted in a significant increase in their ability to protect their passwords from a watchful observer.},

These devices provide passive haptic cues that help the user to maintain position awareness and relative spatial relation during three-dimensional (3D) interaction. Active stereoscopic shutter glasses can be used to provide a 3D display, whenever necessary. We describe the differences with traditional fish tank and fully immersive virtual reality (VR) systems.

abstract = {Understanding the context of use of a computing system is an important part of designing human-centred interaction especially where that computing pervades the places and activities of daily life. The aim of this paper is to introduce two ontologies that represent understanding of 1) human perception of architectural place and 2) sociality in an urban space, gained through field studies of the physical and social layers of an urban environment. This paper demonstrates how these ontologies are used to provide an understanding of context of use of an urban space, and how to identify design opportunities for informing design of a digital layer of pervasive computing.},

abstract = {Supporting awareness plays a prominent role in facilitating natural and effective communication in Instant Messaging (IM). This paper reports our empirical study of awareness in IM, using an online survey and face-to-face interviews to identify user needs for awareness support. The study has identified three themes, including awareness of multiple concurrent conversations, presence awareness of a group conversation, and visibility of moment-to-moment listeners and viewers. The study showed that these three types of awareness are necessary but have been either ineffectively supported or ignored by current IM systems. Drawing on these findings, we have designed three awareness features to support these three categories of awareness. Conversation Dock provides awareness of multiple conversations; Group List provides presence awareness in a group chat by showing who are no longer in the group chat and who are going to join the chat; and Track View provides awareness of in-progress listeners in voice conversations and in-progress viewers in video conversations.},

We recommend that informal tools provide a mechanism to connect the use of physical tools to complement their electronic interfaces. We discuss several mechanisms and use lessons from our study to evaluate their relative strengths and weaknesses, concluding that a digital ink interface would be most effective. A realistic scenario involving a digital ink interface is evaluated. Results confirm our design rationale and suggest that a digital ink interface would benefit existing design practice.},

The traditional power structure of adult-child or teacher-student, seen by previous authors as a barrier to involving teachers in CCD, is challenged and the need for an extension of the designer-child partnership to include a significant role for teachers is proposed. The implications for the wider UCD literature relate to a broadening of stakeholder involvement in design.},

Recently, physiology has also been explored as a metric for evaluating usability. However, it is not clear how physiological measures relate to traditional usability evaluation measures. In this paper, we investigated the relationships among three kinds of data: task performance, subjective assessment and physiological measures. We found evidence that physiological data correlate with task performance data in a video game: with a decrease of the task performance level, the normalized galvanic skin response (GSR) increases. In addition, physiological data are mirrored in subjective reports assessing stress level. The research provides an initial step toward establishing a new usability method using physiology as a complementary measure for traditional HCI evaluation.},

The MLD comprises two LCD screens separated by a 14 mm thick transparent perspex layer. Data presented on the rear screen is viewable through the front LCD. By combining transparency, colour, form of the data, and motion, we can create physically distinct layers of information which affords new ways of presenting information, such as information layering, focus + context, visual linking and information foraging support. Because of the visual effects caused by overlaying information in the physical layers, some of the old rules of display design such as optimal colour combinations, are no longer applicable within this context. New techniques for visualisation and interaction are needed, not just to make such a display readable, but also to take advantage of the new display capabilities. While we are still some way from prescribing techniques for designing information in layers across physically overlapping displays, we will also discuss five early lessons learned from the process of developing such design techniques.},

We argue that sensitivity to this notion was helpful in identifying the key transitions, cycles, plans and management issues in staff's ongoing work. We present verified trajectory-informed scenarios emerging from fieldwork and show that these snapshots of work were useful for establishing current and future interactional needs among staff and residents. Finally we describe issues pertinent to new technology design emerging from these trajectory-informed scenarios and discuss the usefulness of the concept for informing socio-technical system design.},

Indeed, the current 12-button text entry keypad causes typing overhead as 26 alphabet letters are assigned to only 8 buttons (2-9). The LetterEase method uses letter-frequency data from SMS text messages collected from real situations and the moving distance between buttons with thumb use. We first discuss how to implement this LetterEase method, and then present the results of a controlled experiment comparing LetterEase to the conventional multitap method and the two-letter multitap method that was designed as a control letter assignment. The results showed that both less keystrokes and less errors using LetterEase were identified. In addition, despite slower text entry speed than that of the conventional multitap method, in effect, the users experienced LetterEase lessened the gap more readily during the course of the experiment as fast as the conventional multitap method.},

abstract = {Image stitching allows users to combine multiple regular-sized photographs into a single wide-angle picture, often referred to as a panoramic picture. To create such a panoramic picture, users traditionally first take all the photographs, then upload them to a PC and stitch. During stitching, however, users often discover that the produced panorama contains artifacts or is incomplete. Fixing these flaws requires retaking individual images, which is often difficult by this time. In this paper, we present Panoramic Viewfinder, an interactive system for panorama construction that offers a real-time preview of the panorama while shooting. As the user swipes the camera across the scene, each photo is immediately added to the preview. By making ghosting and stitching failures apparent, the system allows users to immediately retake necessary images. The system also provides a preview of the cropped panorama. When this preview includes all desired scene elements, users know that the panorama will be complete. Unlike earlier work in the field of real-time stitching, this paper focuses on the user interface aspects of real-time stitching. We describe our prototype, individual shooting modes, and an implementation overview.},

Even at this early stage in its development, the SAI has proved to be a tool with the potential to meet these requirements.

Key to this view is the assumption that by converging computer devices, and digital media, the value of technology for end users can be maximised whilst the overheads involved in purchasing, maintaining and orchestrating a variety of different technology solutions can be minimised. In contrast however, some authors have argued that convergence creates weak-general solutions, and rather we should be aiming for strong-specific technology by means of the deliberate design of multiple diverged devices. This paper contributes to the ongoing discussion of convergence and divergence. We discuss three apparently irreconcilable perspectives on the relationship between functionality and usability, and show that they are in fact complementary views of convergence. To ground this discussion we draw on the results of a recent cultural probes study of a cohort of early adopters of converged devices.},

They allow an instructor to teach a student using a shared virtual model, even if separated by distance. For these systems to be accepted within the surgical community there must be a compelling body of evidence that demonstrates that learning occurs in the training environment, and is transferable to the operating theatre. We have developed a networked multisensory virtual reality system for teaching surgery of the temporal bone and conducted a training transfer trial. To augment the quantitative analysis of the results, we have performed a qualitative analysis of the transcripts of videotapes of the learning phase of the trial, using techniques from Conversation Analysis. In this short paper we present a single case study that convincingly demonstrates that learning occurred within the instruction phase of the trial.},

Currently, Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) (and other software systems) are unable to use nonverbal cues to interpret student's responses to instructional material as can human tutors. We believe that this capability is essential to adapt teaching strategy to the needs of the learner. An experiment was performed aimed at identifying what kinds of gestures are being used by students in a human-to-human learning context. We have identified a range of gestures being used in one-to-one tutoring environments and a dependency of gesture use on students' skill level. As a result, we suggest how the student model in an ITS should reflect this dependency. These results are applicable to HCI in general.},

abstract = {In this paper we explore some of the ethical issues associated with conducting Ethnographic Action Research (Tacchi, 2004; Tacchi et al., 2003) for understanding and facilitating distributed collaboration. Ethnography and action research are increasingly popular qualitative approaches to researching computer-supported collaboration and we are applying them together in a project within a distributed research centre. We identify ethical principles applied to the conduct of research in Australia and we briefly describe a number of ethical problems that arise due to the nature of Ethnographic Action Research.},

abstract = {Subjective understanding of context attributes may cause potential usability risks when designing context-aware mobile applications. This paper presents a survey-based study of people's individual perceptions on defining and grouping context attributes. The findings demonstrate the problem areas that were found on several commonly used context attributes, such as temperature, time, noise level and movements.},

abstract = {In this paper, a novel non-contact 3D display based on motion parallax is proposed. The 3D viewpoint of the user is measured by real-time non-contact measurement system. By moving the user's head position and watching a CG image which corresponds to the measured viewpoint, the user can perceive 3D information using a normal flat display. Basic experiments for depth perception using single eye and both eyes of the user are conducted to show the feasibility of the system.},
