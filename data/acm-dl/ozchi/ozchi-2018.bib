abstract = {Fiction authors and readers have traditionally interacted through the mediation of a 3rd party (e.g. a publisher or agent), at events such as book signings or author readings. Held in physical spaces (e.g. bookshops or libraries), these events enable authors to discuss their book, and readers to ask them questions. In recent years, online social networking sites have introduced a new environment for direct, two-way interactions without this traditional mediation. Our understanding of how this change impacts authors and readers, and the role technology now plays as mediator, is currently limited. This paper describes a qualitative interview study held with six authors and six readers of Genre Fiction. The study revealed that neither party sees great benefit to interacting directly online - a finding partially explainable by the differences in how physical places and online spaces are structured to support their interactions. We drew on space and place research to develop an HCI perspective of the impact of this change. This paper contributes an enriched understanding of fiction author and reader interactions; in particular why they do not often interact directly - or wish to. We also demonstrate the usefulness of space and place theory in understanding the boundaries which divide author and reader.},

abstract = {Social media question asking (SMQA) is an interesting application where users ask factual or subjective questions through social networks, also make invitations or seek favours, among other types of queries. Topics like what we ask, what motivates us to answer, how to integrate the traditional search engines with SMQA, etc. have been well investigated. However, the effect on tagging particular people in queries is yet to be explored. In this work, we focus on targeted queries in social networking sites, where people tag some of their friends, but also remains open to others who might want to respond. We conducted a two-phase study to investigate users tagging behaviour based on question topic and type, their rationale behind tagging those particular people, and corresponding outcomes of tagging. Our result contradicts with the existing works that tried to use automated tagging in social networks and identify design opportunities that need to be considered while developing new solutions to assist in this regard.},

In complex environments, users will often support their work by using their bodies or artefacts around them to support the task at hand. When we move processes that have traditionally been performed in physical environments online, we need to consider any elements of cognition distribution, and how they might be supported in the new system. In this paper we discuss one form of external cognition during browsing: that of placemarking or context retention. We use data from an observational study to form detailed descriptions of five behaviours that constitute placemarking in some way and point to avenues for understanding how we might support these behaviours in a digital environment.},

We identified seven tablet applications suitable for children with mild to moderate ASD in the age group of 3 to 10 years and evaluated them with 18 practitioners. Our results show that the commercially available applications do not satisfy the needs of Sri Lankan practitioners to support their children with ASD. Furthermore, we identified six key functionalities, which need to be considered while developing tablet applications to improve social skills of children with ASD. They are namely, 1) embedding social elements while teaching other skills such as academic skills, 2) customisability to facilitate relevant cultural contexts, 3) progress monitoring, 4) reinforcements only upon correct answers with suitable feedbacks and cues, 5) timers, and 6) bridging day-to-day physical objects with digital platforms.},

The development of this application builds on our research and consultation with experts who identified problems in the process of early triaging of young children with potential speech problems. This paper presents our work towards the development of such a solution, focusing on the design and testing of interface concepts for adult test administrators and to engage children to actively participate in automated assessments.

Previous studies have investigated the potential of interactive technology for autism education, showing that it enhances the learning experience and reduces the need for continuous assistance. However, teaching strategies are rarely considered as direct input for designing games that educators would use in their teaching practice. We conducted ethnographic research at a school for autistic children and found that educators want digital technologies that embed their current teaching and behaviour management strategies. Our results highlight links between autism teaching strategies and game design. We then used the results to devise a game design model for supporting autism education.},

In collaboration with a Microfinance Institute (MFI), we carried out two co-design workshops involving 17 participants. We used group discussions and various design activities such as persona creation to enable participants to share their experiences related to household finances. From our findings, three central values associated with household finances came out strongly: Supporting Family, Independence, and Spiritual Beliefs. We conclude by reflecting on the values identified while providing suggestions to support those through technology.},

To date, game culturalization is under-researched, and little is known about the influence of cultural contents in digital games on players' gameplay experiences (e.g. engagement). Thus, in this study, we conducted a user study of the digital game called "The Return: Forbidden Throne" with 15 participants to understand the impact of cultural contents in the game on players' experiences. The findings show that the players' engagement in the cultural contents of the game is positively associated with their engagement in the gameplay while having no relationship with their enjoyment and motivation in the game. The participants' interests and attention towards the cultural contents of the game are relatively high. The findings suggest that integrating relevant cultural contents in digital games, especially for game localization and culturalization, can make players more engaged in the game. The findings can be insightful for game designers and developers, especially in digital game localization and culturalization.},

The paper answers the question: what are the components of an ELA? In order to answer this question, we conducted a scoping review and used assemblage theory during data analysis. This covered 12 relevant articles, out of 1,525 from Scopus and Web of Science database. The ELA have five components: experience entities, technology, media, interactivity, and encapsulated experience. The experience entities are subject, object, space, event, and hybrid experience. As there are few ELAs embodying human experience, more research needs to done and addressing this gap may bring the mobile guide and experience research closer to being societally relevant.},

The paper presents a study to understand how people with intellectual disabilities can use Voice Activated Interfaces (VAIs) to access information and assist in daily activities. The study involves observations and video analysis of 18 adults with intellectual disability using VAIs and performing 4 tasks: calibrating the VAIs, using voice assistant (Siri or Google) to search images, using voice to query Youtube, and using the voice assistant to perform a daily task (managing calendar, finding directions, etc.). 72% of participants stated that this was their preferred form of input. 50% could perform all four tasks they attempted with successful outcomes, and 55% three of the tasks. We identify the main barriers and opportunities for existing VAIs and suggest future improvements mainly around audio feedback given to participants. Notably, we found that participants' mental model of the VAIs was that of a person, implications for which include the user having to speak in long polite sentences and expecting voice responses and feedback about the state of the device. We suggest ways that VAIs can be adjusted so that they are more inclusive.},

However, the literature remains incomplete on the nature of participation across popular social media sites by YAID, and how different social media sites fulfil their participation interests. To explore this, we employed a mixed methods approach involving interviews, participant observation, training workshops, and a survey with YAID. We found that participation interests varied between platforms: all participants used YouTube for entertainment, some participated in Facebook to stay connected with family, whereas Snapchat and Instagram were used for playful interaction with strangers. Awareness of online safety emerged as a key competence, while literacy, authentication, netiquette and disruption from advertising content adversely affected participation. We discuss how to address these issues to support and sustain participation, as well as opportunities for leveraging participation in social media for skills development.},

abstract = {Acoustic sensors offer a promising new tool to detect furtive animals; however, sifting through years of audio data is fraught with challenges. Developing automatic detection software still requires a large dataset of calls that have been accurately annotated by experts. Few studies have explored how people identify species by vocalisations in the wild, and how this skill can be applied to designing technologies for locating and identifying calls in recordings. To explore how birders often find and identify animals by calls and share their observations, we conducted qualitative interviews and a visualization-review activity with nine birders, eliciting insight into their existing practices, knowledge, and visualisation interpretation. We found that visualisations evoked memories demonstrating birder expertise on the natural history, behaviours, and habitats of birds. Birders were curious and learned from exploring the abstract patterns in visualisations of acoustic data, relying on past experiences with nature to interpret acoustic visualisations. Birders often wanted to corroborate findings with other birders by reviewing acoustic recordings and local bird lists. This study demonstrates how qualitative review of visualisations can elicit a nuanced understanding of community practices, knowledge, and sensemaking, which are essential to improve design of future technologies.},

This trend towards homophily and a polarisation of like-mindedness is aggravated by algorithmic filtering and recommender systems embedded in mobile technology and social media platforms. Yet, genuine innovation thrives on social inclusion fostering a diversity of ideas.

Citizen-centricity requires a different focus in terms of purpose and outcomes such as providing benefits that cross the digital divide and supporting people's general wellbeing and happiness. It is submitted that the design of the technology that enables smartness and citizen-centricity is another consideration to achieving these aims. Through a process to design technology for a community garden with the express aims of meeting the needs of people, three design implications for design have been identified: supporting a conceptual understanding of that technology and its place in a large system; supporting people's ability to perceive technology and its functionality; and, the technology must be designed to support people's experience of the space in which it is located. To some extent these implications contradict existing design intentions for technology of this nature, such as invisibility.},

This study explores what considerations need to be taken into account when designing a pedagogical tool that helps enhance cross-cultural communication in a co-located context. We use a multi-stage approach that starts with a survey and observations to understand what are the key contextual aspects of cross-cultural groups. In the second stage, we design a technology probe Contributor, an interactive tabletop interface, which is deployed in a workshop involving university students with practical experience in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). Results show that key considerations when designing for co-located cross-cultural collaboration tools in the context of higher education are: social accountability and visibility of prompts and accessibility of devices; focus on maintaining participants' attention to enhance conversation dynamics; focus on data privacy when monitoring actions of participants; and providing a platform for participants that allows externalization of ideas through annotations and visualizations, as well as highlighting keywords relevant to the discussion.},

abstract = {Robot pets are being developed and deployed to provide companionship for older adults. While robot pets offer some therapeutic benefits, their intended use for 'companionship' often provokes ethical debate, including concern that interactions with robot pets are demeaning or lack value compared to other social interactions. Another concern is that robot pets provide no real advantages over companion animals. This conceptual paper draws on philosophy, human-animal bond research, and technology development in robotics, to consider whether robot pets provide new opportunities for companionship as opposed to just 'reinventing the wheel'. We argue that robot pets may sometimes be as beneficial as companion animals or offer something different and distinctive. The paper provides a foundation for further multidisciplinary research to advance understanding of the ethical issues and the opportunities and challenges that arise in our ongoing and changing relationships with new technologies such as robot pets.},

The project recognises that dogs and dog walking both contribute to mental and physical health and well-being, and builds on a growing awareness that companion animals and walking in urban localities also fosters community cohesion and social capital. We put these themes together in the context of designing for Queensland's growing senior population with the intent of gaining insights into connections made through place-making activities of human and animal companions.The project is currently in its exploratory design phase as 'grounded' practice-based work with on-going emerging insights to underpin the development of a design scenario and cultural probe. We begin with insights generated from personal experiences and a desire to foster age-friendly, intergenerational 'slow' urban environments. This paper offers the background and context, and then considers some of the design dilemmas. We share an early design concept that draws on lessons learned from game design and theories of place-making that has the potential to reveal experience in place (for both humans and our animal companions).},

Although HCI research has examined the design and use of technology in aged care, there is limited understanding of the role staff members play in its deployment in RACFs. We interviewed five workers from one Australian RACF about new technology use within their facility. We found that its implementation was part of a complex, decision-making hierarchy in which issues such as marketing potential and staff members' roles and capacity, created tensions about the use of new technology. Drawing on our findings, we identify issues HCI researchers should consider when introducing new technology in this complex environment.},

We predicted that whether each observer is more accurate in understanding the two visualizations from their unconscious pupillary responses or conscious verbal responses, by answering relevant questions.

While conventionally users cannot see their body while watching 360 movies, our prior work seamlessly blended a user's physical body into a 360 virtual movie scene. This paper extends this work by overlaying context-matching virtual costumes onto the user's real body. A prototype was developed using a pair of depth cameras and an HMD to capture the user's real body and embed it into a virtual 360 movie scene. Virtual costumes related to the movie scene are then overlaid on user's real body to enhance the user experience. Results from a user study showed that augmenting the user's real body with context-matching virtual costume was most preferred by users while having no significant effect on sense of presence compared to showing only user's body in a 360 movie scene. The results offer a future direction to generate enhanced 360 VR movie watching experiences.},

Through building a story world, they provide a space for prototyping and presenting new ideas and perspectives. In a workshop context, they can play a role in creating an engaging experience and insights for further use.This paper presents a case study of a co-design workshop '2030 - An Ecosystem Odyssey' that utilised design fictions as a tool. As part of the DIMECC 'Design for Value' research program, the workshop involving companies from maritime and manufacturing industries and research partners used design fictions as a tool in the business-to-business context. While the research program focused on new forms of business collaboration brought on by autonomous systems and digital disruption, the workshop aimed at exploring the societal and human values of the future that was being built. In the workshop, new autonomous systems and extreme efficiency were explored from the perspectives of data sharing, employee wellbeing and humans in it all. As a result, design fictions created discussion and speculated on scenarios and future possibilities, while also provided different perspectives into them.The findings from the study are the roles that design fictions can serve in a workshop and the whole process of planning, running and participating in it. The ten roles of design fictions are divided into three groups, providing insights on how design fiction as a tool participate in setting the scene, structuring the tasks and embedding values into the discussions in the workshop context.},

With this outset, we revisit and analyze two existing HCI projects, a shape-changing bench and digitized sticky notes, and illustrate how a postphenomenological perspective may supplement these projects. Based on this analysis, we highlight the strengths and benefits of a postphenomenological approach to HCI research. Finally, we propose strategies for applying such an approach in future research.},

abstract = {Experimental 'Wizard of Oz' (WOz) User Experience (UX) research in the context of Autonomous Driving (AD) car development is becoming more interdisciplinary, human-centric and open to innovative methodological collaborations. In this paper, we demonstrate a mixed-methodological approach to research how people engage with and make sense of automated features that do not yet exist in everyday life contexts. We present how the combination of WOz testing and ethnographic ride-alongs have been developed and how the two different approaches can benefit from each other. We selected two everyday driving examples - emerging from T-junction and changing lane on the motorway - to demonstrate the value of mixing these methodologies. We propose that by building new collaborative test practices, we can create a more everyday-life oriented approach that better attends to people's experiences, imaginaries and projections into possible futures of driving, which is particularly important to incorporate in AD vehicle design for mixed traffic environments.},

abstract = {This paper presents insights from a research study, which involved the use of a Rapid Modular Prototype (RMP) to augment user interviews. RMPs are a combination of interchangeable modules made from tangible materials and physical computing components, such as Arduinos and Raspberry Pi. In our research study, we created a prototype to inform the design of parking meter interfaces. The modular approach to designing the prototype, which led us to the concept of RMPs, was driven by the need to carefully assess and compare various input mechanisms, such as knobs versus buttons, and their efficacy, for example, for selecting the time period on a parking meter. Reflecting on our experiences developing the prototype and its role in supporting our participant interviews, we examine how RMPs can be used as a tool in interviews to gain rich insights from research participants.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new framework of perceiving affordance, based on the ecological approach and neuroscientific findings, is proposed. Although affordance has been one of the most famous concepts in the human-computer interaction (HCI) field, it has been somewhat inconsistent. In addition, the perceiving process of affordance has not been fully explained, while affordance itself has often been studied. Therefore, first, we review the original concept of affordance in the ecological approach. Second, neuroscientific findings on affordance are reviewed and associated with ecological psychology. As a result, affordance is related to three visual systems in the brain: dorso-dorsal, ventro-dorsal, and ventral systems. Based on the results, we propose three levels of perceiving affordance: possibility, specificity, and signification levels. We expect that the explanatory framework, called 'three levels of perceiving affordance,' contributes to clarifying both affordance and perceiving process. Additionally, it offers possibilities to be applied in the analysis and design of technologies in the context of HCI.},

However, GPS information quality can vary due to several factors. In this paper, we thus investigate how this affects users via a field study (N=21) that exposed pedestrians to no GPS coverage, low accuracy and delayed GPS information during navigation. We found that their navigation performance, their trust in the apps and their experience were all negatively affected. We also identified user strategies to deal with GPS-deteriorated situations and user needs. Based on our findings, we derive several design implications for pedestrian navigation app to better deal with GPS-deteriorated situations. In particular, we propose four adaptation strategies that an app can use to support users in GPS-deteriorated situations. Our findings can benefit designers and developers of pedestrian navigation apps.},

A percentage of the population of people with visual impairment are known to use echolocation -sound waves and their reflections- to better explore their surroundings. In this paper, we describe the development of an echolocation-enabled VE (Echo-House) and evaluate the feasibility of using echolocation as a novel technique to explore this environment. Results showed that echolocation gave participants an improved sense of space in the VE. However, the evaluation also identified a range of orientation and mobility issues and found that participants needed additional support to gain confidence in their use of echolocation in the VE. Our findings suggest that with proper support, echolocation has the potential to improve access to VEs for people who are blind or visually impaired by revealing features that would be otherwise inaccessible.},

abstract = {Maps have been used in different ways to facilitate travellers in wayfinding. Depending on the traveller's ability to translate the direction on the map to the real world, maps are normally read at different orientations. Some have the ability to rotate the map mentally without having to change its original orientation and some require the map to be aligned with the direction of the intended path. Blind people are not excluded from using maps. A multimodal map that combines touch and hearing has been introduced to enable blind people to learn maps. However, such maps usually enable blind people to explore maps only in a fixed orientation. This raises a question of whether they might also benefit from the ability to change the orientation. Therefore, this paper investigates 12 blind people's preferences from a study conducted in Malaysia. The participants were required to explore five maps at different orientations in static and rotatable conditions based on the directional task given before performing a pointing task. Their preferences for the conditions were acquired through a series of interviews. Results showed that the blind participants did have their own preference when exploring the maps based on various reasons.},

Instead of using commonly applied corrective feedback models, containing sounds with negative connotations, our interaction concept adopted a strategy of gently guiding and supporting the user's in-the-moment experience of practising meditation through a nature soundscape responsive to their brainwave activity recorded with a Muse EEG headset. In this paper we describe the detailed design of our prototype. We explain how we refined the interaction concept, and discuss some of the key design decisions and modifications that took place during an iterative design process, informed by user evaluations with novice meditators.},

This time is a turning point for adult children as they establish an independent life, while it marks a change in responsibilities and freedoms enjoyed by parents. We conducted interviews with 7 parents and 6 adult children to understand how they currently use technologies like Skype and WhatsApp to maintain their relationship. The findings show how parents and adult children's positions raise tensions when balancing independence and closeness, how these tensions affect technology-mediated communication, and that there is limited dialogue about the differences between their positions. Inspired by Position Exchange Theory, we discuss how design methods and technology design can enable parents and adult children to see the world through each other's eyes. This process can contribute to developing a better understanding of how they can renegotiate their new social positions and thus enrich their relationship.},

Focusing on text-based communication, we report findings from an exploratory study of three interface prototypes that probe users' reactions to the notion of revealing sender effort. We find that information about effort can foster empathy and appreciation by encouraging reflection over meaningful actions. However, designers of communication tools must address the issues of authenticity, controlled disclosure and cost in access if reflection on effort is to be valued. We consider how designers might negotiate these issues in future effort-sensitive communication technologies.},

However, we also identified how parents appropriated technology to promote physical activity, i.e., through rewarding, modelling, facilitating, participating, tracking and documenting. We hope these practices will inspire design work with families to create new exertion interfaces, games, and persuasive technologies. In framing our findings as practices, we hope to expand the focus of future design activities from narrow concerns with health, tracking, and competition, towards broader concerns with what families do in everyday life, how they socialize, and what resources and technologies they have available to flourish.},

The design process is illustrated in the InstInt case study. We detail the co-design process, from ideation to construction, of a small-scale interactive installation for public spaces. This process was conducted with Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) students. Results of the study indicate that participation reached the physical prototyping stages of design and the final artefact emerged from the materialisation of participants' different ideas and purposes, illustrating what we call a socioenactive design process. Our design process can be useful for HCI educators and practitioners seeking for new activities and approaches for open-ended scenarios.},

With ever-increasing social media contents that allow the mass consumption of video medium, our needs and uses for video comparison will only increase in the coming years. However, the interaction to support the task of comparing between videos is not well understood today, and there is very little theoretical foundation to guide future design for supporting video comparison. In this paper, we take the comparison as the primary angle to look at video-related interaction such as watching, browsing, and editing. By reinterpreting those interaction and synthesising available knowledge from HCI, visualisation and multimedia fields, we construct a theoretical structure that embeds essential conceptual components for supporting video comparison. These concepts not only help explain the existing user-interfaces of video applications as a comparison interaction, but also generate discussion and implications for novel interactive features to enhance our everyday consumption of video contents.},

The framework draws on HCI literature and our findings from a design study, which focused on designing for the intent and awareness of driverless cars when picking up passengers in a ride-sharing scenario. We designed various interaction design proposals as mockups and tested their acceptance through three rounds of user evaluations. The framework was developed after the second evaluation round and was then applied to revise our design solutions and used in the final evaluation round. The framework offers guidance for breaking down use cases into stages of interactions, specifying the information channels and the interactions between driverless cars and pedestrians, as well as reflecting on how well each solution addresses the user needs.},

abstract = {John McCarthy and Peter Wright argue that people "don't just use technology;" they "live with it," which drives their decision "to suggest an approach to viewing technology as experience," rather than theorizing people's "experience with technology" [8]. This paper takes a step back, to reconsider the potential of analyzing what people do with technology, because some technologies, in particular robots, are increasingly experienced as machine others, with which people are encouraged to collaborate, as opposed just to use. Recognizing the work of McCarthy and Wright, the paper takes the threads of experience they identify---sensual, emotional, compositional and spatiotemporal---and examines these alongside a broad communication-theoretical approach that identifies three interlocking elements in human-robot interactions: encounter, story and dance [11]. This framework is identified as one approach being developed within a new area of communication studies, Human-Machine Communication (HMC). The paper argues that attending to the detail of how humans and robots communicate in relation to encounters, stories and dances, supports recognition of the complexities of experience within human-robot interactions that support flexible modes of human-robot collaboration. In particular, this framework is open to the potential of machine-like robots in human-robot interactions for which a process of "tempered anthropomorphism" supports meaningful communication with a robot that is nonetheless clearly recognized by people as a machine other [11].},

We implemented a prototype, which authors courses for two kinds of tasks: A network cabling task and a console device configuration task to demonstrate the tool's potential. We describe the limitations of our prototype and present opportunities for evaluating the tool's usability and perceived effectiveness.},

abstract = {In GUIs, there are clickable objects that have a difference between the motor and visual widths. For example, when looking at an item on a navigation bar, users think that the text length (the visual width) means the motor width. However, when a cursor hovers over the item, the cursor shape changes or the item is highlighted, and then users understand that the actual motor width differs from the visual width. In this study, we focus on the difference between the motor and visual widths and investigate how the difference affects user performance. Experimental results showed that 1) users aim at the motor width, 2) the reaction time is a U-shaped function whose optimal point is located where the motor and visual widths are the same, and 3) the movement time depends on the motor width. We also analyze existing GUIs and discuss the implications.},

Our main contributions: (1) are a set of services that runners would want from a drone, such as taking a picture or calling the police; (2) a set of intuitive gestures for controlling flight actions and drone functions such as forming a square with both hands; and (3) insights into how runners propose gestures. We also evaluate and discuss the idea of modulating gestures on running movement as well as the tension between intuitiveness of a gesture and how much it interferes with the running movement.},

In this paper we discuss how research-through-design can be applied as an explicit strategy for teaching interaction design. RtD is productive when teaching interaction design, because it keeps students in a constant loop of doing and reflecting, as well as highlights the value of theoretical concepts for understanding practice. This means that theoretical concepts become a resource that the students can draw on to understand and transform design practice, while at the same time fostering an integrated understanding of theory and practice in design. We base our work on a master's course series teaching advanced theoretical and practical subjects in interaction design. The main contribution of the paper is a set of principles for RtD-based design teaching, as well as the identification of potential gains of using this approach for teaching interaction design.},

abstract = {There are many barriers to employment for people with visual impairments. Assistive technologies (ATs), such as computer screen readers and enlarging software, are commonly used to help overcome employment barriers and enable people with visual impairments to contribute to, and participate in, the workforce. However, recent research suggests it can be difficult for people with visual impairments to effectively adopt and implement ATs in the workplace. This paper reports insights from interviews with five professional workers with visual impairments. The interviews revealed that each participant had adopted different configurations of ATs, which they used in various ways to support their work. In addition, all participants followed a complex process to successfully select, learn, and integrate these tools into their work activities. During this process, they faced challenges, such as the need to educate colleagues to make shared documents more accessible. We conclude that despite progress in the development and use of ATs, there remains a need for future work that addresses these accessibility issues to support collaborative work between people with visual impairments and their sighted colleagues.},

abstract = {It is challenging for dance teachers to provide feedback to all students learning to dance. This is a common problem in large social dance classes, where the teacher do not have time to reflect before giving feedback. One possible way to address this is to allow dance instructors, peers, or students themselves to assess students' performance using video recordings. In this paper, we explore the use of a video annotation tool by dance teachers. We focused on a particular style of partner dance: Forr\'{o}. We followed a three-step process to design and validate the video annotation tool, which includes: 1) interviewing dance teachers to understand the context and their needs; 2) asking teachers to assess video recordings of students dancing to capture their 'vocabulary'; and 3) developing the video annotation tool. We conducted semi-structured interviews with four dance teachers to understand how the tool can support dance teaching. The contribution of this paper is the exploration of the use of video annotation as a tool to support dance teaching. The paper discusses a series of insights gained by teachers as a result of using our annotation tool which was carefully crafted based on dance education foundations and the vocabulary elicited from experienced dance teachers.},

We observed and video-recorded 15 arthroscopic knee surgeries performed by four orthopaedic surgeons and conducted interviews with two of these surgeons to gain further insight and clarification. Our findings highlight the challenges experienced by surgeons: (1) frustration with instruments, (2) visibility challenges, and (3) ergonomic, cognitive, social, and cooperative work demands. Furthermore, we identified the following needs: flexible distal end of instruments and better visualisation of instruments. With this knowledge we plan to develop a video card game, which, with the collaboration of orthopaedic surgeons, will be used to design an interface for a robotic surgical assistant to help alleviate these challenges.},

Data were gathered from 30 micro-located gamification applications between the years of 2013 and 2018. The data were analysed through relational content analysis allowing categorisation and theme identification. Various scenarios are presented where micro-location plays a significant HCI role. Examples of existing services that implement gamification are also presented. Finally, factors that impact the micro-location method are explored.

However, there is little research discussing diegesis in games and how diegetic and non-diegetic elements might influence the level of immersion. Furthermore, it is still controversial to apply the concept of diegesis originating from film theory to games. Unlike the traditional world of film, games deal with players as interactive participants in narration. This research explores the effect of diegetic and non-diegetic elements on the immersion of 2D games with respect to Galloway's theory of diegesis in games using prototypes as research base. Applying the Immersive Experience Questionnaire (IEQ) we conclude that the participants perceived the non-diegetic prototype on a higher level of immersion, notably differences in cognitive involvement and real world dissociation can be inferred.},

abstract = {Online collectible card games (OCCGs) are digital, networked contemporaries of collectible card games (CCGs) which combine the collection of trading cards with strategic deck building and competitive gameplay. Despite their popularity and unique mechanics, we know very little about OCCG players, their motivations and play habits. A survey study using the Trojan player typology[11] with 856 players from two popular OCCGs (Hearthstone and Eternal) revealed four main player motivations: immersion seeker, socializer, competition and smarty-pants. Competition and immersion seeking were main motivations to play OCCGs whereas socializing and strategizing (smarty-pants) were the least. These differ from the findings with CCGs where the main motivations were socialization and strategy development. We found Eternal players had higher satisfaction of their autonomy and competence needs than Hearthstone players. These findings contribute to our understanding of why individuals play different types of video games. It also helps game designers to target the needs and motivations of their audience.},

Using an iterative design process including user journey maps, personas, roleplaying, prototyping and more to iterate a solution which best addresses the user's needs. The result was an interactive screen embedded into the bookshelves themselves, a natural extension to the physical space that allowed users to easily access the libraries digital collection. Beyond the screens users can also curate and share content to support instead of replace libraries as community hubs. DigiView effortlessly combines the physical with the digital sphere to enhance serendipitous discovery.},

Thus, verbal and nonverbal cues in robot behaviors are critical to ease conversational closure. In this study1, human participants observed either of three types of robot nonverbal behaviors, e.g., continual gestures by robot(Condition 1), reducing gestures(Condition 2) and gesture followed by adapter(Condition 3). All the conversations were videotaped, and the participants were interviewed after the experiment. The experimental results showed that adapter behaviors of robot helped to end a conversation. Furthermore, when the robot expressed adapters, the human followed suit, indicating that the participants wanted to end the conversation. These findings will contribute to the design of robot behavior that improves human-robot communication.},

An online survey was conducted with 679 Facebook users. Data analysis reveals that age makes a significant difference in Facebook activities and levels of satisfaction with using Facebook. The findings of the present study provide insights into the role of age in using SNSs as well as implications for further research.},

abstract = {In contemporary design research and practice, food is often seen as a problem to be fixed. Designers in the corporate startup realm as well as in academic HFI (Human-Food Interaction) have proposed various techno-solutions to curb complex food system issues such as malnutrition and environmental unsustainability. Quantified diet trackers, 'smart' kitchenware, food sharing apps and similar digital food technologies present opportunities for efficient food practices but also challenges to human-food relationship and social food traditions. The Parlour of Futures project reflects on these contradictions and addresses the growing trend of food-technology innovation through the lens of Speculative and Critical Design (SCD). The project takes the form of a traditional Tarot parlour where participants explore possible food-tech futures as prophecies. Through a bespoke Food Tarot cards deck presenting speculative food practices such as Monsanta[n]ism, Gut Gardening, or Turing Foodism, the project provokes playful food-tech imaginaries and future food scenarios. We discuss the opportunities of SCD in nurturing reflective food design and research, and invite OzCHI attendees to contribute their future food ideas during the Parlour demo session.},

abstract = {This paper describes one work-in-progress finding of a larger pilot study, investigating simulator sickness in virtual reality. The investigation asked participants (n = 10) to play though a VR application, and then complete a Simulator Sickness Qestionnaire. Participants were also asked for some demographic data, including rating their level of traditional gaming experience (0 to 5). A weak Spearman correlation between gaming experience and virtual reality sickness was found (rs = 0.56) in this sample group. Two hypotheses on why this correlation may exist are also presented in this paper - one described using the postural instability theory, and the other described with the rest frame hypothesis.},

abstract = {The integration of Agile practices with User-Centered Design studies the interactions between designers and software developers, and the alignment of the design and development processes. However, designers are often required to operate within a wider business context, driven by high-level metrics, like Monthly Active Users or Net Promoter Score. Within this context, they are challenged to show how design initiatives and improvements affect the business metrics. This paper describes a case study of a large scale effort to improve the usability of Jira, a project tracking software. It outlines the process that was followed to break down business goals into actionable work streams for the product teams, and to align the metrics that product teams iterate through to the metrics that high level management cares about.},

abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly complex and ubiquitous, these systems will be responsible for making decisions that directly affect individuals and society as a whole. Such decisions will need to be justified due to ethical concerns as well as trust, but achieving this has become difficult due to the 'black-box' nature many AI models have adopted. Explainable AI (XAI) can potentially address this problem by explaining its actions, decisions and behaviours of the system to users. However, much research in XAI is done in a vacuum using only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a 'good' explanation while ignoring the interaction and the human aspect. This workshop invites researchers in the HCI community and related fields to have a discourse about human-centred approaches to XAI rooted in interaction and to shed light and spark discussion on interaction design challenges in XAI.},

On the other hand, technology-centric methods are great for designing cool new gadgets, though their outcomes often do not solve real users' needs. This full-day workshop will bring together academic researchers and industry practitioners to explore how we can bridge inquiry-led human-centred design methods with invention-led technology-centred methods. Participants will be invited to submit proposals where they answer a set of questions about this challenge for discussion during the workshop. On the day of the workshop, we will discuss challenges and opportunities in this space and work together in a practical ideation, prototyping, and evaluation activity to uncover potential solutions, guidelines, and directions for future research and practice.},

abstract = {Food and wine are an important part of our everyday lives, not just for sustenance, but for the enjoyment and human interactions it invokes. "If food is the body of good living, wine is its soul" (Clifton Faddiman, Author).In our workshop, On and Off the Table: Re-Imagining Food and Wine Interactions, we will examine the ways in which current human experiences of food and wine can be re-imagined and extended through the use of interactive technologies. HCI research has shown that food is regularly informed and shaped by digital device use. The same is happening in interactions with wine. This workshop will explore new practices in human-food interaction (HFI) and human-wine interaction (HWI), both on and off the table, including: playing with food, use of technology, digital and live storytelling, 3D food printing, DIY wine fermentation tools, music, sharing experiences. We invite contributions from researchers, designers, food and wine scientists and enthusiasts, industry partners (restaurateurs, winemakers) and other practitioners interested in working towards a complex framework for future HFI and HWI research.},

abstract = {Virtuality, often expressed via technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) or Augmented Reality (AR) has become a staple of media news, cultural artefacts (e.g. Ready Player One) and much research in universities and IT companies. Since the inception of the Oculus Rift as an accessible head mounted display (HMD) for building VR applications the industry has exploded into a potentially $108 billion industry by 2021 [1]. Australia has industry and research communities as well performing research into the use of VR in entertainment, video, cultural heritage as well as low level hardware topics such as implementations of wireless VR HMDs.Various groups in Australia are collaborating and forming a robust presence in the research and startup spheres. We wish to establish with this workshop a focus for the research community in Australia in the direction of education, in particular, to deal with issues local to Australia in areas of inclusiveness and diversity. In particular, this workshop aims to draw together a group of VR/AR researchers to explore the boundaries of immersive virtuality in education and to push into new territories identified from the workshop.},
