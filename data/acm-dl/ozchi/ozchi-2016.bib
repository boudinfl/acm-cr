abstract = {Eliciting accurate knowledge from individuals is a non-trivial challenge. In this paper, we present the evaluation of a virtual reality-based approach to knowledge elicitation informed by situated cognition theory. This approach places users into 3D virtual worlds representing real-world locations and asks them to recall information about tasks completed in those locations. Through an empirical A/B evaluation of 64 users, we investigate whether the situated context provided by these virtual environments is adequate to assist with memory recall, and explore whether the added immersion provided by a head-mounted display (HMD) may meaningfully improve user memory recall capability when compared with a desktop display experience. Results suggest that those provided with a HMD may be able to recall more information about a sequenced task than those provided with a desktop display.},

Based on these concepts, we propose an engagement model for players in playing an AR game, followed by research questions formulated by this study. We also highlight safety issues for AR game players such as Pok\'{e}mon Go in the real-world. Then, we formulate a research question about players' safety in playing this game.

abstract = {Operating forklifts in warehouses is becoming an increasingly difficult task due to higher shelves and narrower aisles. In this paper we explore how Augmented Reality (AR) can aid forklift operators in performing their pallet racking and pick up tasks by superimposing virtual depth cues over the real world camera view. We developed a prototype interface, and evaluated it using a remote controlled toy forklift and a motion tracking. We measured the participant's performance on representative pallet handling tasks, finding a significant difference in the performance of participants using AR depth cues. The results show that AR could offer a novel, simple and efficient solution for the problems faced by forklift operators while performing pallet handling.},

abstract = {Recent advances in vehicle automation have led to excitement and discourse in academia, industry, the media, and the public. Human factors such as trust and user experience are critical in terms of safety and customer acceptance. One of the main challenges in partial and conditional automation is related to drivers' situational awareness, or a lack thereof. In this paper, we critically analyse state of the art implementations in this arena and present a proactive approach to increasing situational awareness. We propose to make use of augmented reality to carefully design applications aimed at constructs such as amplification and voluntary attention. Finally, we showcase an example application, Pok\'{e}mon DRIVE, that illustrates the utility of our proposed approach.},

abstract = {Interaction with head mounted displays is predominantly through use of additional controllers or the keyboard to initiate pointing, selections, and navigation. However, most modern head mounted displays have an orientation sensor to determine how the user's view should be displayed. There is the potential to use this sensor as an input mechanism. Our research explores a method of interaction using just head movements called Periphery Menus. These are menus triggered by looking quickly in predetermined directions to reveal a contextual menu from the periphery of a user's vision. We discuss a pilot study of this interaction technique, using a serious games approach to experimental testing. Experiment results indicated the interaction provided a successful, engaging, and repeatable experience.},

abstract = {The application of virtual reality (VR) to education has been documented for over half a century. During this time studies investigating its use have demonstrated positive findings ranging from increased time on task, to enjoyment, motivation and retention. Despite this, VR systems have never achieved widespread adoption in education. This is arguably due to both limitations of the VR technologies themselves, and the overhead incurred by both content developers and users. In this paper we describe a case study of an alternative approach to creating educational VR content. Instead of using computer graphics, we used a spherical camera in conjunction with a VR head-mounted display to provide 360° educational lectures. The content creation process, as well as issues we encountered during this study are explained, before we conclude by discussing the viability of this approach.},

abstract = {Children and parents build mutual trust through voluntary disclosure, but at the same time parents are guardians who monitor and guide children as they grow up. Emerging technologies offer new opportunities for parents to monitor children while being separated. We investigated how sleep and physical activity data from a Fitbit Flex wristband worn by children (aged 9--12 years) were shared in families over a five-week period. We discovered that the children would optimize their data as they learned more about their own activities, and then started pleasing their parents as a result of being under surveillance. Interestingly, we also saw that parents used the physical activity and sleep data to question children about specific activities, and while this increased parental control, it reduced spontaneous and voluntary information disclosure from the children about their daily activities. This appeared to negatively influence the trust between the children and their parents.},

The expansion cursor was designed to make accurate movements easier to perform. For every click of the mouse, users can choose whether to zoom in on the target. This fluid and user controlled activation method is our key point of difference compared to other mouse-based zoom lenses. Surprisingly, such a method has not already been investigated for people with motor control difficulties. Modeless fluidity helps avoid the assistive technology paradox of needing to segregate users (into groups of those who need assistance, and those who do not) whilst aiming to bring them together (by improving full participation in society). In our evaluation, both participants with and without motor impairments chose to make use of the zoom, albeit for differing target sizes. This suggests participants made this choice based on the subjective difficulty of the task. It also shows there is no need to segregate users into groups of those who need the zoom, and those who do not.},

Unfortunately, these latent factors are very much present in the operation of maritime navigation systems (Rowley et al., 2006) in some cases leading to unsafe acts with consequenmtial outcomes. Lacking in usability some of these navigation systems have trapped the crew into what is sometimes referred to, but seldom investigated, as design induced errors. This paper will describe the process adopted by the international community with major input from Australia in ensuring that a research driven Human Centred Design (HCD) approach is applied in the development of future navigation systems, resulting in a dedicated guideline. Apart from describing the core elements of the new guideline, the challenges posed from a maritime regulatory perspective in developing and ensuring acceptance will also be discussed.},

On the one hand, technologies extend, mediate, and reduce the need for physical spaces for social interaction; on the other hand, there has also been a resurgence in community hubs as existing and new forms of critical resources for diverse individuals and communities. This paper provides a comparative analysis of three creative community hubs in South East Queensland, each representing a case of bottom-up, middle-out, and top-down driven initiatives. By applying the transdisciplinary lens of Urban Informatics, it explores the juxtaposed values of physical space and digital technologies for connectedness within the context of creative communities. It then opens questions about how Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) might add to tactics of connection for meaningful and impactful community engagement.},

abstract = {We present our design exploration for re-thinking underlying principles of 3D modelling activity on multi-touch tablets for novice users, identifying some of usability problems that often hinder the user interaction. We introduce "1.2 hand input," a specific interaction technique that helps novice users to gain understanding and orientation in interacting with 3D space on a 2D screen, and we derive multiple UI artefacts and techniques that take advantage of the particular characteristics afforded by this technique: a clear separation between the actions of modelling an object and of changing the viewpoint, a reduction of hand occlusion while performing multi-touch interactions by extending the touchable areas around the object model, and an improved access to the user's action history by combining the concept of viewpoint change with past interaction sequences re-shaping how traditionally the undo and redo actions have been done in the modelling activity.},

Most of the unrecognized words were compounds, names, and other words that appear of value to retrieval. Thus, the set of words describing a broadcast has to be expanded to compensate for the recognition errors. We discuss doing this by exploiting the alternative matches from the speech recognizer and by extracting words from a related corpus.},

By adopting this view, we aim to ensure that the media that is captured will be both necessary and appropriate for the intended reliving experience. We illustrate our perspective with three design concepts. Finally, in the discussion we present several topics related to media capturing and reliving.},

OptoBridge enables the remote teacher to monitor the experimental scenario as well as the detailed optical phenomena through the transmitted video captured on the local side. Meanwhile the local learner equipped with the optical see-through head-mounted display (OSTHMD) can be indicated by virtual hands and augmented annotations controlled by the teacher's gestures and follow the guidance to get their skills practiced. The implementation of OptoBridge is also presented, aimed at providing a more engaging and efficient approach for remote skill teaching.},

Engaging passers-by with this new interface becomes a challenge as posters, in general, are non-interactive. This paper also presents an initial empirical evaluation of AmPost that captures and analyses the frequency and length of user engagement, and evaluates whether user engagement improves with the integration of interactive features, in comparison to the traditional non-interactive poster. This study facilitates in building the generic approach to measure engagement that applies to any kind of posters.},

It is hoped that the ambient audio presentation of Twitter feeds will help spark informal conversations among individuals in an organisation, while also helping individuals keep up to date with events within the organisation. We have designed TOL to be placed in a staff common room, where staff already habituate, to enhance an existing practice (having meals) to foster engagement among staff. Initial deployment of TOL showed that it helped initiate conversations among individuals while providing information about events across the organization.},

Four different prototype interactions were developed that could work in a completely analogue implementation. These interactions were installed and evaluated as part of an in-the-wild deployment of a larger project, which was used as part of a community consultation process. By analysing how people used our interaction prototypes and the feedback that they left, data was collected to inform later iterations with the kinds of interaction approaches that can successfully engage participants and the most effective methods of soliciting feedback.},

abstract = {Current personal single-user devices, such as smartphones, tablets, or laptops, struggle to provide the contextual awareness and coordination capabilities required for the effective collaborative analysis of large datasets. Instead, large interactive displays offer unique opportunities for co-located collaboration in meeting room environments. However, supporting collaborative interaction across multiple large displays presents distinctive challenges for interaction designers. This paper explores and compares novel interaction techniques and visualisations for large displays, with a focus on two distinct approaches for collaborative browsing and filtering of multivariate datasets: (i) shared zoomable grid view, and (ii) multiple individual network views. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed interfaces for multi-user exploratory analysis, we applied the designs to a specific use case, namely the problem of displaying research metadata from bibliographic databases to extract and collate narratives and overarching themes for research grant proposals. Following an agile design methodology, we created two prototypes incorporating our designs. We weigh the benefits and limitations of each approach by comparing them along two key dimensions: (i) methods of interaction, and (ii) visual representation. Subsequently, we compare the two design approaches and discuss the circumstances and situations that would be beneficial for use. This research and its implications are intended to inform future research exploring the design of collaborative interfaces for large-scale interaction environments.},

abstract = {Domain experts dealing with big data are typically not familiar with advanced data mining tools. This especially holds true for domain experts within energy management. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics approach that empowers such users to visually analyze energy behavior based on consumption meters, sensors and user reported survey data. The approach is aimed at visual analysis of resource consumption data and occupant survey data (e.g. from questionnaires) from apartment buildings. We discuss the principles and architecture of the affine visualization tool, AffinityViz, that interactively maps data from real world buildings. It is an overview +detail inter-active visual analytics tool supporting both rapid ad hoc explorations and structured evaluation of hypotheses about patterns and anomalies in resource consumption data mixed with occupant survey data. We have evaluated the approach with five domain experts within energy management, and further with 10 data analytics experts and found that it was easily attainable and that it supported visual analysis of mixed consumption and survey data. Finally, we discuss future perspectives of affine visual analytics for mixed, explorative visual analysis of resource consumption and occupant survey data.},

This paper investigates the effects of correlation between features and target values on user confidence in data analytics-driven decision making. Our user study found that revealing the correlation between features and target variables affected user confidence in decision making significantly. Moreover, users felt more confident in decision making when correlation shared the same trend with the prediction model performance. These findings would help design intelligent user interfaces and evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning models in applications.},

Word-of-Mouth (WOM), such as user reviews, influences users in hotel, restaurant, movie, and many other e-commerce domains. Thus, a company's or product's reputation can alter a consumer's behaviour towards that product. Our work aimed to acquire an understanding of the effect of textual WOM on usability and visual appeal. This is a novel approach to the topic. This research was undertaken using an unfamiliar city council website to exclude the influence of one's own past experiences and to allow for greater control of the textual WOM. We found that visual appeal, objective and subjective usability were all influenced by text that established reputations.},

However, current media production tools do not support decision making through the comparison of alternative storylines. Using the conventional form of storyboards found in animation, commercial, and movie studios as a basis, we propose a novel user interaction feature that facilitates effective comparison amongst alternative storylines or variations. We review existing storyboarding practices, and then present our interaction strategy, which was informed by interviews of people in the industry. The fully-implemented system went through a series of usability tests with both professional and non-professional users. We discuss how our design can help the users with diverse backgrounds at different stages of story development in comparing the alternatives. Such a tool may be useful in other domain areas where temporal comparison of alternative solutions is beneficial.},

Responding to this concern, and in line with person-centred planning, this paper outlines the collaborative development of a mobile app to support the communication, interests and goals of young adults who attend a disability support organisation. Existing technologies focus predominantly on enhancing academic abilities, such as literacy or numeracy, disregarding the potential to support personal interests and individual goals. Through a process of Reflective Agile Iterative Design (RAID), a mobile app was developed which enabled young adults with intellectual disability to produce an image of themselves achieving a certain goal. Although the app was designed for individual use in formal goal-setting meetings, participants used the app for social activities, such as taking 'group selfies', emailing their images to proxies and 'layering' selfies. The app supported the individuals beyond the planning process, contributing more broadly to enhancing overall communication, self-expression, and socialisation.},

abstract = {The geographic separation of the generations due to globalisation decreases opportunities to maintain communication and connectedness between grandparents and adolescent grandchildren. Many studies consider the importance of social presence in relationships, ignoring how to make such relationships meaningful. Most studies in HCI that discuss technology-supported communication in fostering intergenerational relationships examine relations between grandparents and child or adult grandchildren. This paper investigates the emotions expressed by grandparents and adolescent grandchildren in online and offline interaction by examining the expression of emotions in their actual interactions. This approach provides insight into which emotions are commonly expressed and how they are expressed using Computer Mediated Communication (CMC). Such insights can inform the design of new, affective tools to foster communication and connectedness in these specific intergenerational dyads. Our method covers focus group, cultural probe and interview. In particular, we discuss the use of a Show &amp; Tell game as an instrument to investigate emotions in actual interaction. Our findings show that care, happiness and also negative perceptions were commonly communicated within the participating dyads and that CMC can assist in the transmission of feelings that were unspoken in face-to-face interaction, fostering connectedness between dyads.},

The data collection consisted of observations and focus group interviews and spanned over 20 weeks. The study investigated whether a curriculum guided only by the interests of older adults, rather than structured curriculum, would have a positive influence on their adoption of mobile touch screen technologies. The results show that when older adults are taught according to requests based on interest, they have the opportunity for deeper and long-term engagement of technology.

Four seniors (women, aged 64--74) participated. Each person received a gaming console and face-to-face instruction. At a set time each week for 6 weeks, participants logged on to take part in a 30-minute exercise class led by an instructor. On-screen, each person was represented by an avatar (Avatar Kinect software). Participants were able to see the avatars on their television screen and hear each other via headsets. Overall, we found the virtual exercise class format to be feasible and acceptable to older people. Despite some limitations with the hardware and software, participants enjoyed the experience of learning to use new technology. The use of avatars added novelty and made the program fun. The potential for a virtual exercise class, using gaming technology and avatars, to increase physical activity and enhance social connection amongst older Australians warrants further investigation.},

However, technology can also be used to encourage children to get outside and interact with the natural environment. This paper examined literature and known projects in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and related fields that aim to facilitate children's interaction with the natural world through technology. A thematic analysis was then undertaken in order to identify the different approaches to connecting children with nature through technology. We identified three major types of technology use, instructional, exploratory and contributory: (1) Instructional technology to enhance and enable structured science curriculum activities in outdoor environments; (2) Exploratory technology to encourage children to explore outdoors in nature; (3) Contributory technology to engage children in contributing to citizen science activities. We discuss ways to deepen and extend the scope of HCI research for environment, in order to entice and engage children to care about the physical environment and nature on its own terms, developing lasting connections to and knowledge about their natural environment.},

Participants were then asked to elaborate on their responses in interviews. Through a thematic analysis of these responses, we found that the emotional significance of possessions was reportedly influenced by both their relevance to selfhood and position within a life story. We use these findings to discuss how the design of new products and systems can promote emotional attachment by holding a multitude of emotionally significant meanings to their owners.},

abstract = {Digital technologies can influence the moods of their users. In some cases this is the technology's principal purpose; in others it is a commercially advantageous side-effect. HCI has long recognized the importance of the emotional response to technology: this is fundamental to the concept of user experience. But people sometimes use digital technology to manipulate mood: a phenomenon which is less explored by HCI. This paper argues that mood-enhancement is a significant motive for innovation and adoption, and proposes that HCI look to other disciplines for insight into why users manipulate mood and with what consequences. Anthropological research into drug use, for example, has found that mood enhancement is an important component of social and organizational life. The paper concludes that contemporary technology is making this social function more ubiquitously available. The paper's contribution is theoretical: proposing a new lens for understanding some human-computer interactions.},

We report the evaluation of participants' experience through a two-phase study that employed mixed methods, including the Positive and Negative Affects Schedule (PANAS) questionnaire, and semi-structured interviews followed by thematic analysis. Our evaluation revealed consistency between certain emotional responses recorded in the questionnaire and the interviews. Moreover, the data from the interviews exposed the importance of both balancing control and unpredictability in interactive art systems, and the relevance of the social relationships among participants. These results support the use of mixed methods and self-report measures when evaluating user experience with interactive art systems.},

abstract = {In Human Computer Interaction, appropriate feedback is especially important when an error occurs. This work compares implications for user's psychological reactance and acceptance of two different types of error and their representations through feedback. Reactance and acceptance levels were measured after presenting feedback that allows a conclusion on the cause of an occurred error and feedback that fails to do so. It was found that reactance levels were significantly higher and acceptance levels significantly lower in the latter case. Suggestions for appropriate system design are discussed.},

abstract = {We are currently witnessing an era where interaction with computers is no longer limited to conventional methods (i.e. keyboard and mouse). Human Computer Interaction (HCI) as a progressive field of research, has opened up alternatives to the traditional interaction techniques. Embedded Infrared (IR) sensors, Accelerometers and RGBD cameras have become common inputs for devices to recognize gestures and body movements. These sensors are vision based and as a result the devices that incorporate them will be reliant on presence of light. Ultrasonic sensors on the other hand do not suffer this limitation as they utilize properties of sound waves. These sensors however, have been mainly used for distance detection and not with HCI devices. This paper presents our approach in developing a multi-dimensional interaction input method and tool Ultrasonic Gesture-based Interaction (UGI) that utilizes ultrasonic sensors. We demonstrate how these sensors can detect object movements and recognize gestures. We present our approach in building the device and demonstrate sample interactions with it. We have also conducted a user study to evaluate our tool and its distance and micro gesture detection accuracy. This paper reports these results and outlines our future work in the area.},

One within a transitory corridor, the other in an open plan combined study area and student services space. Our results show that sensor placement and installation contexts of the display, as well as how players are introduced to the interaction techniques of the game, affect the screens' capacity to support social play. We subsequently offer concrete recommendations on how public display games can be built to encourage social play between two to four participants, limit social embarrassment, and encourage spectators to become active players. In doing so, we extend prior work that has primarily focused on single-user or crowd-based interaction.},

In this paper, we introduce Scribble Query, a novel interaction technique for fluid freehand scribbling (casual drawing) on touch-enabled devices to support interactive querying in data visualizations. Inspired by the low-entry yet rich interaction of touch drawing applications, a Scribble Query can be created with a single touch stroke yet have the expressiveness of multiple brushes (a conventionally used interaction technique). We have applied the Scribble Query interaction technique in a multivariate visualization tool, deployed the tool with domain experts from five different domains, and conducted deployment studies with these domain experts on their utilization of multivariate visualization with Scribble Query. The studies suggest that Scribble Query has a low entry barrier facilitating easy adoption, casual and infrequent usage, and in one case, enabled live dissemination of findings by the domain expert to managers in the organization.},

We conducted a user-elicitation experiment on 22 participants performing two driving scenarios with different levels of cognitive load. The participants were filmed while performing natural gestures for manipulating the air-conditioning inside the vehicle. Comparisons are drawn between the proposed approach to define a vocabulary using 9 new gestures (GestDrive) and previously suggested methods. The outcomes demonstrate that GestDrive is successful in describing the employed gestures in detail.},

We found was that while there was a difference in entry speed between virtual and physical keyboards, there was no difference in speed between physical keyboards or between software keyboards. There was limited error difference between all keyboards. However despite the Bluetooth keyboard being closest to the laptop in results, user preference was greater for the gesture keyboard.},

We describe the in-app functionality we created for supporting consent and withdrawal, our approach to privacy, our navigation of a formal ethical review, and navigation of the Apple approval process. We highlight two key issues for deployment-based research. Firstly, that it involves addressing multiple, sometimes conflicting ethical principles and guidelines. Secondly, that research ethics are not readily separable from design, but the two are enmeshed. As such, we argue that in-action and situational perspectives on research ethics are relevant to deployment-based research, even where the technology is relatively mundane. We also argue that it is desirable to produce and share relevant design knowledge and embed in-action and situational approaches in design activities.},

App reviews---some helpful, others irrelevant---can be analysed for feedback on this user experience. However, few studies have specifically examined the helpfulness of app reviews. In this paper, we surveyed users and developers to rate 167 reviews for helpfulness, obtaining a total of 2,558 helpfulness ratings captured on a 5 point Likert scale. We found only slight agreement (nominal Krippendorff's alpha = 0.039) between participants on the helpfulness of reviews. Differences between reviews become evident when we summarise all the helpfulness ratings per review. We conclude that the disagreement among users limits the potential of mobile app review recommender systems.},

The key challenge to discovering such temporal rules is identifying within a phone call log the time boundaries that delineate periods when an individual user rejects or accepts phone calls. Moreover, potential data sparsity in phone call logs imposes additional challenge in discovering applicable rules. In this paper, we address the above issues and present a hybrid approach to identify the effective time boundaries for discovering temporal behavioral rules of individual mobile phone users utilizing calendar and mobile phone data. Our preliminary experiments on real datasets show that our proposed hybrid approach dynamically identifies better time boundaries based on like behavioral patterns and outperforms the existing calendar-based approach (CBA) and log-based approach (LBA) to discovering the temporal behavior rules of individual mobile phone users.},

A callout could solve these problems by displaying a copy of the occluded area in a non-occluded area. However, callout designs for ultra-small touch screen devices have not yet been explored in depth. In this study, we chose three design factors (each factor has two levels) from various factors and conducted an experiment to examine eight callout designs in the selection task for ultra-small touch screen devices. The results of our experiment matched the results from previous research; however, we also obtained results unique to ultra-small devices. The results showed that the selection speed was higher when the content of the callout was changed continuously, the error rate decreased when the content of the callout was changed continuously and a pointer was displayed to indicate the touched position within the callout, and the workload decreased when the content was changed continuously. Further, as a design factor, the position of the callout would not affect the selection performance.},

Despite this, there is a paucity of research about the impact of ICT on the work-life balance (WLB) of construction managers. We employed an online survey and conducted three workshops with a major Australian construction company. This paper focuses specifically on the use of ICT and mobile technologies at work for work and home, and outcomes from the workshops. We offer design suggestions which highlight significant opportunities for the adaption or adoption of existing technology, and the design of novel technologies. These could reduce work repetition, workloads and work hours, as well as providing some separation from work at home, all of which could positively impact on the work life balance of managers working in site-based roles in construction.},

Afterward, three developers assessed the quality of the suggestions. We found that the cards diversified the range of system aspects that novices considered, supported ideation, and kept the discussion going. However, the cards did not compensate the limited design experience, and the participants had challenges understanding the value of the cards, and implement them in the process. Having developers assessing the subjective quality of the suggestions turned out to be challenging due to low inter-rater reliability.},

Currently most user evaluation techniques are still concerned with conscious assessment of devices and systems, ignoring that our bodily senses are constantly capturing information at an unconscious level. Based on Gendlin's Focusing technique, we introduce a method of archetype analysis that considers the importance of the body as the door to access meaning encapsulated in people's tacit dimension. Drawing on the outcomes from different somatic exercises involving the reflection on everyday objects and situations, six archetypes reflecting participant's inner connection with each scenario were generated. As a result, richer descriptions and more bodily self-aware archetypes (felt-sensers) were obtained in the reflection on everyday situations over objects. These findings make sense with the interactional process of meaning-generation experienced by the lived body.},

abstract = {This paper considers the issue of evaluation in cross-cultural contexts, where the focus on Western principles of technology quality can be problematic. We present a case study of designing a Digital Community Noticeboard with an Australian Aboriginal community, and discuss how its evaluation may be better approached in terms of 'designing futures'. Rather than viewing evaluation as the validation of a designed artefact, our approach is focused on mapping progress towards a vision for a future world that shapes, and is shaped by the noticeboard, as the two have mutually evolved. The resulting insights go beyond the technical and lead to a better understanding of how the noticeboard may fit with everyday practices, local values and social protocols, and issues of sustainability. This shift in perspective helps to foreground these socio-technical factors and research problems that may otherwise pass unnoticed.},

abstract = {Psychological reactance is well known in psychology and marketing, but has not yet been adopted in HCI-research. The authors aim at assessing the benefit of measuring psychological reactance in the context of usability and user experience evaluation in a HCI context. To date, there are no tools that are designed to evaluate psychological reactance in the context of HCI. We used an established questionnaire from personality research for an exploratory factor analysis to test, if the concept can be applied to HCI. A between-subjects study was performed that compared effects of self-adaptive vs. user-adaptable systems on users' psychological reactance while interacting with a spoken dialogue system. Results show that interaction with self-adaptive systems can increase psychological reactance, compared to interaction with user-adaptable systems. It is argued, that the concept of psychological reactance is especially relevant for HCI with regard to smart services and assistants like Apple's Siri.},

This paper describes the use of a self-reported probe kit in a marginalised community of women who are living in crisis situations. The kit contains a video camera, disposable camera and a set of task cards to prompt them to capture certain experiences. We applied this method with 13 participants from a community care centre and found the self-reported experiences to reveal both useful and insightful perspectives around the lives of women in crisis situations. Through this methodology the women shared different aspects of their lives, challenged stereotypes, and were empowered to share their stories and experiences. This methodology is useful in sensitive settings as it includes participants in the design process, and supports their privacy by enabling agency. It also allows for digital inclusion in terms of interacting with and using the camera technology.},

abstract = {Computer programming is a required skill for most STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) students. However, teaching novices programming has long been considered a big challenge by computer science educators as manifested by the observation that first-year programming topics tend to have a higher failure rate than other first-year topics. Existing studies have discovered that lack of engagement in learning programming is a key determinant of a student's poor performance. Therefore, it is beneficial to perceive a student's lack of engagement so that appropriate actions can be taken ahead of time. However, first year topics especially programming topics usually have very large enrolments, making it hard for a lecturer to keep track of each individual student's engagement level. As learning management systems (LMS) have been widely adopted by universities, in this paper we suggest using a student's voluntary participation in a programming topic's discussion forum provided by LMS as an engagement indicator so that the lecturer can constantly monitor and re-engage those who present low or no engagement. This recommendation is based on an empirical study of a first-year programming topic that reveals a positive correlation between one's voluntary participation in peer interaction through the topic's discussion forum and one's learning outcome in the topic.},

Existing design methods limit older individuals' ability to see their goals reflected in fall prevention practice and service. This inhibits compliancy with interventions, and fosters disempowerment. Augmented reality (AR) allows occupational therapists to walk-through and envision modifications with older adults, facilitating a two-way discussion according to the goals of older clients. This qualitative research assesses an AR tool with ten older adults. Results highlight that current fall prevention processes can diminish the role of older adults and discourage them from voicing their own design ideas. The use of an AR tool is promising in this process; as older adults understand the benefits when planning home modifications. The tool aids opportunities for participation and discussion. However, the balance of power between clinician and client regarding usage of the AR tool requires careful consideration.},

However, given the complexity of these movements, it is a challenge for trainees to know whether they are performing the exercise correctly.

In this paper, we present a workflow to detect performance anomalies from only observations of the correct performance of an exercise by the trainee. We evaluated our algorithm on a benchmark data set for the biceps curl exercise, and also evaluated our system with a publicly available dataset, and showed that our method detects unseen anomalies in weight lifting exercises with 98 percent accuracy.},

Technology use has been found to contribute to sleep deficits, but it offers a means to investigate sleep patterns and student workload. Hence the aim of this research is to explore how students at Australian universities manage stress, sleep and technologies throughout the semester. We combined rich qualitative insights from contextual interviews and cultural probes with quantitative insights from a student survey. The findings showed that (1) students consciously prioritise academic success over a healthy sleeping pattern; (2) students are sleeping one hour less than they think they should; (3) technologies both add to sleep deficits as well as help to wind down; and (4) students manage sleep and stress through a combination of planning ahead and pushing through stressful times with little sleep. We discuss the implications of these findings and highlight design opportunities for new technologies to support the strategies of planning and pushing through to encourage healthy sleep patterns and foster wellbeing.},

The design process builds upon previous work with stages to facilitate "conceptualisation", "formative research and pretesting activities", "pilot trials" and "evaluation trials". In "conceptualisation", we use the validated Behaviour Change Wheel framework as a means to illustrate how an innovative mHealth snacking app can be achieved through the use of evidence-based behaviour change techniques (cue monitoring and implementation intentions). We then illustrate how the Health IT Usability Evaluation Model framework can support user centred design in "formative research and pretesting activities", "pilot trials" and "evaluation trials".},

abstract = {Wearable devices like Fitbit and Apple Watch provide convenient access to personal information about sleep habits. However, it is unclear if awareness of one's sleep habits also translates into improved sleep. Hence, we conducted an interview study with 12 people who track their sleep with Fitbit devices to investigate if they have managed to improve their sleep and to examine potential barriers for improving sleep. The participants reported increased awareness of sleep habits, but none of the participants managed to improve their sleep. They faced three barriers in improving their sleep: (1) not knowing what is normal sleep, (2) not being able to diagnose the reasons for a lack of sleep, and (3) not knowing how to act. This paper discusses how to address these barriers, both conceptually as well through design considerations - reference points, connections to lifestyle data, and personalised recommendations - to help users gain improvements in wellbeing from their personal data.},

We present a field experiment (N=66) that investigates whether a shared wall display that provides real-time note-taking visualisations is able to increase student interaction and learning/information retention. We compare this first experiment condition of laptops and a shared-display (C1) to the use of just pen and paper (C2) and just a laptop (C3). Our results from a between-subjects study with high school students indicates that interaction is significantly increased in condition C1 compared to C2 and C3, and that student learning favours C2 and C1 over C3. This indicates that although technology can be used to enhance learning, personal laptops are not by themselves a precursor to increased learning, and that consideration is needed for whole-of-classroom solutions in order to enhance student interaction and learning.},

abstract = {This paper presents some lessons learnt from the co-creation, within a support organisation, of a virtual world dedicated to practicing life skills for people with intellectual disability. The progression of the project throughout successive stages has indicated what people would want to see and practice in a such a virtual world, which would not have been found after a single development iteration. These desires include the representation of public spaces, social interactions and disruptions. Based on initial trials, we propose some new design insights for further implementation of such virtual worlds in training sessions with the use of immersive headsets. While immersive headsets have been demonstrated to enhance the learning experience, they also visually isolate the person in training from the trainer. To overcome this isolation, a new design concept is presented which allows the teacher to communicate, using gestures, with the immersed student.},

In doing so, we work on constructing a conceptual design space as a practical tool to orient ourselves and systematically brainstorm design possibilities for squeezable interaction. The constructed design space abstracts essential characteristics of squeezing interaction including the intensity, frequency and areas of squeezing in a structured way, helping explain existing examples of squeezing interactions we engage in our daily lives. By offering a set of new concepts and vocabulary to express different aspects of this modality, the design space can be effectively used to help brainstorm, discuss and create novel applications and usage situations with squeezing as the main interaction modality, resulting in facilitating pioneering new lines of interactive IT applications. The construction and refinement of the design space was in part supported by instrumenting and prototyping squeezable applications and testing with twenty participants one by one.},

It consists of a 3D printed core inserted within a foam sleeve embedded with conductive foam columns. By measuring resistance changes across the columns during deformation, whole hand or individual finger flexion motions can be mapped to digital data in real-time. We conducted a user study that demonstrated the successful use of the device for game input. The results indicated that users could quickly become competent with the device and that when compared with discrete controls its supported interactions created a more engaging experience. HandLog has great potential for other application domains, including hand exercise for rehabilitation and handheld controllers for smart homes in ubiquitous computing.},

The study aims to recognise the value of participant voice, using an action research approach which is framed as "not research on people or about people, but research with people" (Heron, 2007, p. 366). But what are the participatory design challenges for working with people that are non-verbal or have difficulty communicating their feedback? Throughout the case study described here, it is argued that employing inter-disciplinary methods for opening multiple channels of communication leads to a richer picture of participatory experience. This paper also introduces 'conversational probes', a design framework used to elicit and record feedback in experimental studies with autistic children. We describe how methods used in support of this framework can encourage participants to refocus their expression; in particular, the use of 'sabotage' as a disruptive device. This new approach would benefit the developmental stages of interaction design and HCI projects, particularly those working with a population that has difficulty in communicating participatory feedback.},

These visuals supported the child to communicate and socialise and to recall activities and helped adults to better understand the child holistically. This note augments previous work on MyCalendar by focusing on interactions at home within the family. Findings revealed that routine review of activities documented in MyCalendar enabled children to participate more in family conversations, extended their time spent interacting socially, and reinforced social relationships. This gave the children on the autism spectrum greater opportunity to share and communicate within the family as well as to share their interactions at school with family members.},

The measurement of flow in this paper was motivated by action research participation at the initial field test of the "Preparing for Bushfire" touch table Tangible User Interface (TUI) (Brown et al. 2015)). It was evident that measuring engagement alone would not adequately describe and quantify the engrossed behaviour demonstrated by the general public participants. A Flow Index was constructed to measure and quantify the level of intense focus. Since no standard Flow Index exists, this paper outlines the development process of the construction of the index, including its mathematical validation. It then shows how the Flow Index was used to assess success or failure of the implemented user interface design that was strategically designed for high engagement. The flow was measured during the TUI "Preparing for Bushfire" study using 64 adult members of the general public.},

Our findings motivate the need to design privacy preserving techniques, which will automatically recommend sharing decisions which will help the lifeloggers avoid misclosure, i.e. wrongly sharing a sensitive image with one or more sharing groups.},

abstract = {Social isolation is a predictor of poor mental health outcomes while social connectedness leads to positive mental health and wellbeing outcomes. Although videogames offer the technical capabilities to play with others globally, historically limited support has been provided to connect with others who have similar goals, interests and motivations. Skill-based matchmaking is the dominant approach to connecting players, however, a number of services have emerged which seek to connect players based on factors other than skill, such as game type, play style, location, and interests. This has potential for gameplay to facilitate social connectedness and positively impact wellbeing. As part of a larger program of research, we present a review of existing matchmaking services which connect players on the basis of factors other than skill. A total of eight services were identified, two of which were strongly socially motivated.},

abstract = {This workshop will explore the relationship between HCI using tangible user interfaces (TUIs) and cognition. We see exciting opportunities for tangible interaction to address some of the cognitive challenges of concern to the HCI community, in areas such as education, healthcare, games, reminiscing and reflection, and community issues. Drawing together the Australasian community, with those from further afield, we hope to strengthen research and build a local community in this exciting and rapidly developing field. Participation is invited from researchers working in tangible user interfaces or those interested in cognition and interaction. During the workshop the majority of the time will be spent in small group discussions and brainstorming solutions.},

abstract = {As the advancement of mixed and augmented reality technologies accelerates, not only the matured, complete studies but also early results of innovative ideas and unique experiences of case studies are getting more important to the research community. Examples of such studies include those with innovative concepts, hardware, software or applications but lacking rigorous user studies, case studies in industry and education, cultural and artistic installations using AR/MR technologies, and interdisciplinary studies that do not fit well into existing conference venues. The First International Workshop on Mixed and Augmented Reality Innovations (MARI) provides an opportunity to share and discuss such innovative ideas and precious experiences with researchers from all over the world.},

abstract = {Wine and Interaction Design presents an interesting opportunity to the HCI community, as technology plays an increasing role in the many facets of wine production and consumption. People interact with technology in all phases of the wine lifecycle, including the grape growing process, harvesting the grapes, supporting the winemaking process, labelling the wine, wine selling, and wine serving.Inspired by the CHI 2012 workshop on Food and Interaction Design (Comber et al., 2012), this workshop will bring together HCI researchers and practitioners with an interest in the the role that interaction design and technology can play in wine production and consumption. The session will include discussions on issues and topics of interest raised in position papers contributed by participants. During a practical field visit the workshop will engage with local Tasmanian wine producers to understand and explore current wine-based practices using technology.The outcome of the workshop will be the identification of new opportunities for HCI researchers and practitioners to forge a synergy between technology and wine.},

abstract = {Digital participation is emerging as a key issue for HCI researchers as government and others seek to include people in decision-making about all aspects of their lives. However digital participation is still most effectively utilized by particular sections of society. Socially excluded, diverse and marginalized people, such as people living with disability, older people, disadvantaged youth and women, people identifying as LGBTI, and Indigenous people and others, are particularly vulnerable to digital non-participation, and under-participation, thereby compounding disadvantage. Further, particular communities are disadvantaged due to place or location, often due to lack of access to resources, digital technology or telecommunications infrastructure. This workshop provides an opportunity for HCI researchers and others working with diverse or disadvantaged people to identify practical, innovative, and sensitive solutions to support sustained digital participation for disadvantaged communities. We particularly focus on fostering digital skills at home and in communities; adapting and utilising digital technology to include marginalised and diverse communities; the role of proxies for digital inclusion; recognising research sensitivities when including diverse and marginalised communities; and sustaining digital inclusion beyond the life of the research project.},
