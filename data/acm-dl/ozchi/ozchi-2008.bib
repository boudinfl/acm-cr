abstract = {Eco-visualizations (EVs) are any kind of interactive device targeted at revealing energy use in order to promote sustainable behaviours or foster positive attitudes towards sustainable practices. There are some interesting, informative, highly creative, and delightful EVs now available. This paper provides a critical survey of several noteworthy EVs and classifies them in terms of scale and contexts of use. The paper attempts to provide a foundation for practitioners to design new EVs in more varied scales and contexts and for researchers to continue to refine understandings of how effective EVs can be and how EVs can be made to be more effective. The paper describes (i) feedback types and use-contexts for classifying EVs and (ii) strategies for designing effective EVs.},

abstract = {Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, field and capital, this paper outlines how smart metering demand management programs could be redesigned to bring together the competing fields of resource management and domestic life. Comfort and cleanliness expectations, which are ingrained in the habitus of householders and the field of domestic life, are often overlooked in demand management programs, which focus instead on making existing and evolving expectations more efficient. This paper draws on preliminary findings from qualitative research activities with householders who received consumption feedback through an in-home display, and/or variable price signals --- both enabled by smart meters. The paper offers insights for designers of interactive demand management strategies about how to go beyond achieving efficiency benefits in the home in order to fundamentally change expectations and norms ingrained in the habitus.},

abstract = {To date, methodologies used in the field of game studies are prolific while indistinct due to the multifaceted nature of the field. In particular, games that shape our understandings of political, social or cultural environments add a new dimension to the discussion and theorization of games and learning. As gameplay is increasingly understood as situated in cultural contexts and practices, this paper argues for a comprehensive approach to game studies by positioning games in a wider ecology of learning. The strength of an ecology approach is that it identifies the relations and heterogeneous agents that contribute to developing, shaping, and performing the learning opportunities of a game. This paper suggests a methodological approach of qualitative ethnographic participant observation. Adopting a case study approach as an appropriate research strategy, this ethnography specifically examines and participates in the simulation game SCAPE (Sustainability, Community And Planning Education), an urban sustainability education tool.},

Use statistics and user experience were collected from more than 180 users who used NFC enabled mobile phones to access Mobile Internet content by touching NFC tags embedded in the environment. The findings indicate that the users found the touch-based mobile content access easy to use. However, details such as the placement of the tags or static/dynamic nature of the content had a clear impact on the user behaviour and perceived quality. Based on these findings, we have identified a set of design principles that work as guidelines for the designers and researchers developing NFC applications.},

Content is discussed in terms of the communication bandwidth while contact is viewed from the attention requirement of both initiator and receiver. Issues and successes of each category are highlighted, and we conclude with a contact focused interaction pattern that relates to, but is not driven by, content.},

We report on our pilot study of open ended interviews which investigates the different user archetypes whose needs we consider when designing social technology for urban spaces. We propose a design to extend the sense of community in urban neighbourhoods beyond pure network sociality. Through a lens of 'suburban nostalgia' we envision how neighbourhood interactions might be retrofitted in new ways through civic engagement in the enhancement of environments.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the influence of Emotive Interface Agents on task-induced boredom. We studied the effects of two agents --- friendly and unfriendly. The results show that, like human-human interaction, emotional contagion can happen between agents and users and that it can lead to reduction in task induced boredom. As expected, the friendly agent proved to be more successful in reducing boredom and maintaining participants' focus on task than the unfriendly agent. Moreover, participants felt that the friendly agent added stimulation to the task. This indicates that the friendly agent had some influence on the perception of the task. However, the effects of the unfriendly agent should not be downplayed. Even though the unfriendly agent was perceived as irritating and annoying, a majority of the participants felt that the agent masked the boredom and the monotony of performing a simple repetitive task. More surprisingly many participants found it entertaining to interact with the unfriendly agent, implying counter contagion of emotions. Given the findings of this study, we believe that agents have great potential in regulating emotions. We believe these agents can be successfully used in everyday monotonous/boring tasks such as e-form filling and data entry. With further research we also believe that agents can be extended into learning environments to assist in regulating emotions in learners.},

This often leads to 'featuritis' with hit-and-miss success rates. Our research goal is to find a more informed point of departure for feature addition activities that will improve design and maximise return on investment. We argue that a human motivational factor focus could provide a solid grounding for judging whether features are likely to be used, or not. In this paper we address the motivational factors that underlie mobile phone use by young adults aged between 18 and 30. We consider models for motivational factors from psychology and consumer science, as well as mobile phone usage space models, including the mobile phone usage space model (MUSM). MUSM proposes linking usage spaces to motivational factors, but does not explicitly investigate the mapping of features to the identified usage spaces. In this paper we investigate the features associated with individual MUSM usage spaces as well as the ranking of the usage spaces for our specific target group.},

This case study is a component of a larger research project which explores the implications of broadband telehealth in a tertiary healthcare setting. The research question of this case study addresses how to train and prepare clinicians to do their job using the next generation of telehealth systems. This case study presents observations of twelve clinicians during the training sessions conducted for them as they prepared to use a research prototype telehealth system in a pilot trial at their hospital.The telehealth system was purpose-designed to address the range of needs of the clinicians involved and clinicians very rapidly understood the affordances of the system. Our observations show that the clinicians spent the bulk of the training sessions dealing with process change. They focused on three areas: collaborating with their remotely located clinical assistant, adapting their clinical practice in order to use the system and identifying areas where the telehealth system need to be changed to support their specific needs. Our observations also show that each of the senior surgeons amongst the clinicians (working in a different sub-specialty) dealt differently with the process changes.We conclude that for complex tertiary healthcare telehealth applications the distinction between training given to the clinicians and process change identified by the clinicians is worth considering when preparing clinicians to use the next generation of telehealth systems. We suggest that teams developing advanced telehealth systems consider these issues of process change as they develop ways to prepare clinicians to use their system.},

We identified a set of concerns around the way visibility and audibility affect the social cohesion of the group and impede communication and situation awareness between the distributed team. We also identified a parallel set of concerns around the difficulty of preparing and interacting around the medical images used in the meetings. These issues exposed a complex matrix of technical, social, procedural and organisational factors that affect the collaboration.

abstract = {This paper reports on a study that explored ways of inventing and devising movement for use in the design of movement-based interaction with video-based, motion-sensing technologies. Methods that dancers, trained in movement improvisation and performance-making, used to choreograph movement were examined as sources of potential methods for technology designers. The findings enabled us to develop methods and tools for creating and structuring new movements, based on felt experience and the creative potential of the moving body. These methods and tools contribute to the ongoing development of a design methodology underpinned by the principle of making strange. By making strange, we mean ways of unsettling habitual perceptions and conceptions of the moving body to arrive at fresh appreciations and perspectives for design that are anchored in the sensing, feeling and moving body.},

abstract = {Within the Human-Computer Interaction community there is a growing interest in designing for the whole body in interaction design. The attempts aimed at addressing the body have very different outcomes spanning from theoretical arguments for understanding the body in the design process, to more practical examples of designing for bodily potential. This paper presents Kinesthetic Interaction as a unifying concept for describing the body in motion as a foundation for designing interactive systems. Based on the theoretical foundation for Kinesthetic Interaction, a conceptual framework is introduced to reveal bodily potential in relation to three design themes --- kinesthetic development, kinesthetic means and kinesthetic disorder; and seven design parameters --- engagement, sociality, movability, explicit motivation, implicit motivation, expressive meaning and kinesthetic empathy. The framework is a tool to be utilized when analyzing existing designs, as well as developing designs exploring new ways of designing kinesthetic interactions.},

They help us move beyond our reliance on linguistics by supporting more open, dynamic and fluid forms of expression that are pre-verbal, that originate in the body. Our research suggests that they also present untapped potential for learning about how different people learn. We investigate this idea through the learning process of the hipdiskettes, a group of performers working with the hipDisk wearable musical interface. Examples from the initial rehearsal periods are presented, noting the learning affordances provided by the interface, learning supports provided by the developer, and the different needs and approaches over time of the performers. Investigating learning was not the focus of the hipDisk research yet outcomes suggest that a consideration of how different people learn through, and about, their bodies is beneficial to the development of physically engaging wearables.},

Access to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is influenced by geography, market demand and affordability at household and individual levels. This paper explores how this relationship is manifested spatially in the South African context. The result is not altogether surprising; remote peri-urban areas face bigger obstructions to ubiquitous access due to a number of reasons. Affordability and infrastructure distribution are clearly influential. The assumption is that digital divides exist but little systematic research has been done on how these differences manifest at a metropolitan scale. This paper explores the relationship between the digital divide and spatial trends in Durban, South Africa.},

The findings presented are drawn from preliminary research, involving an evaluation study of 'My Moola: Opening Financial Pathways', a non-governmentally funded financial empowerment program involving the indigenous community. While the engagement with communications technologies was minimal in the overall implementation of the program, the everyday use of mobile phones and SMS in the recruitment and retention strategy, as well as the everyday use by the participants of the program, suggest some insightful points that highlight the particular importance of communication technologies to the maintaining and reaffirming bonds of social and community relations within the indigenous context. These theoretically based readings of certain aspects of user behaviour, suggests the need for further, extensive research to gauge a better understanding of how these factors can ultimately be incorporated into technological design and service delivery.},

Inspired by this view, we report on our research into the design and user experience of a new genre of mobile location-based services, which uses peoples' physical surroundings as a backdrop for storytelling as they move around an urban environment. We present a prototype system developed to explore the user experience of location-based interactive stories, and the use of interaction designs aimed at blurring the boundary between reality and fiction.

The study looked at player progress over the eight weeks the game took to play, following their behaviours through the on-line forums, chat rooms and in-game logging of player interactions. The paper explores aspects of collective participation among players, the motivations underlying such participation and the factors that shape these contributions such as timescale of the game. It discusses too, how the narrative is produced and progressed through collective player interactions and how the experience is created through a collaborative suspension of disbelief. Different aspects of participation are also considered, in particular how a more passive spectatorship is an important experience for many players of the game. Finally the game considers how the ideal of a collective ethos among players is sometimes challenged during game play and the efforts necessary to repair this.},

abstract = {It is hoped that context-aware systems will present users with an increasing number of relevant services in an increasingly wide range of contexts. With this expansion, numerous service notifications could overwhelm users. Therefore, careful design of the notification mechanism is needed. In this paper, we investigate how semantic richness of different types of audio stimuli can be utilised to shape the intuitiveness of mobile service notifications. In order to do so, we first develop a categorisation of mobile services so that clustered services can share the same notifications. Not surprisingly, it was found that overall speech performed better than non-speech sounds, and auditory icons performed overall better than earcons. However, exceptions were observed when richer semantics were utilised in the seemingly poorer medium. We argue that success and subjective preference of auditory mobile service notifications heavily depends on the success and level of directness of the metaphors used.},

The findings are based on the subjective user experience reported by the participants, data collected with the technology probe, and ideas and needs of the participants that surfaced during the study. Results show that both cultural and environmental factors affect the needs towards the wellness application and usage of it. Differences were identified, for example, in how users defined wellness, what wellness concerns they had, attitudes towards setting goals, and how built and natural environments affected wellness activities.},

Using data obtained from two Experience Sampling Method studies, it shows how technology use permeates the flow of students' evening routines, enabling multitasking and the maintenance of social presence alongside the performance of study-related tasks. Affective dimensions of technology use in student rooms during evening hours are highlighted, and implications for the design of networked devices and information and communications services are described.},

abstract = {People with cancer have to contend with a variety of physical, emotional and social difficulties. Young people with cancer are often faced with the additional burden of isolation from their peers and social network. This paper outlines early results from a collaborative project seeking to use emerging technologies to develop and evaluate a peer-based social support system to support social connectivity amongst young people with cancer. We introduce an integrated service named MyTrac, which combines online social network applications and mobile broadband telephony. Seven young people (18--25yo) participated in the three month study. The study encompassed in-depth interview data, questionnaire data and an analysis of system audit logs, which documents participants' use and experience of the system. In this paper we highlight specific communications mediated by MyTrac, showing how they are a reflection of both the individual personalities of participants and a reflection of their cancer journey. We illustrate how these individual identities construct a collaborative identity for MyTrac, one which both encompasses and excludes particular types of interaction. We conclude by articulating some design considerations for social connectivity systems which seek to support young people with cancer.},

This paper discusses design considerations emerging from an ongoing case study that investigates how living in a diverse master-planned community influences residents' communicative ecology. The challenge of the study is to create a design intervention that can not only facilitate the collection, visualisation and analysis of data for researchers, but also promote social connectivity among residents of the Kelvin Grove Urban Village (KGUV), Brisbane, Australia. By leveraging mashups and interest in participatory culture, it may be possible to create a novel dynamic visualisation that can capture the social, discursive and technological characteristics---"the bees, the buzz and the beehive"---of urban communities. This has the potential to create a powerful analytical research tool for user-centred, participatory research that brings us one step closer to understanding the ever-changing communicative ecology of our research participants. It may also reveal innovative ways in which we can use social media to support the social sustainability of diverse urban neighbourhoods.},

Our contribution is a new approach to supporting remote hands-on training of highly graphical multimedia applications. One popular method of teaching multimedia skills is to use laboratory sessions where students gain skills by completing representative tasks exercising their knowledge of the tools. Usually a teacher will be co-located with the students and can therefore share physical access to each student's computer to collaboratively work with them to answer any questions raised during the lesson. Conducting lessons remotely removes physical co-location. This physical separation of the student from the teacher introduces considerable technical and usability issues, focused around the inability to share physical access to a common computer workspace. Therefore we developed a networked environment to facilitate the distributed educational process and ran a trial to assess the usability of the system.},

In particular, we describe a mechanism for dynamic propagation of user feedback which progressively adapts the system to different speakers and lexical contexts. Results of usability and performance evaluation trials indicate that feedback propagation, menu-based correction coupled with keyboard interaction and text-driven audio playback are positively perceived by users and result in improved transcript accuracy.},

This is especially hopeful for artists with upper limb disabilities who show remarkable endurance, patience and determination to create art with whatever means available to them. We developed a prototype 'voice art' system to investigate the potential of this form of interaction. Our first experiment showed that varying the volume of the voice is both comfortable and intuitive. However, it was ascertained the instant usability of volume based control is better suited for target acquisition tasks as opposed to drawing tasks. Nevertheless, the results indicate the potential learnability of volume control for drawing. A second experiment investigated the long-term learnability of this form of interaction. The results show that drawing using voice volume control is a skill that can be developed with time. We believe that voice volume control has implications beyond assisting artists with upper limb disabilities. Such possible implications may be: an alternative mode of interaction for disabled people to perform tasks other than creating visual art; for people whose hands are busy elsewhere; and as a voice training system for people with speech impairments.},

abstract = {Measuring a user's level of cognitive load while they are interacting with the system could offer another dimension to the development of adaptable user interfaces. High levels of cognitive load affect performance and efficiency. However, current methods of measuring cognitive load are physically intrusive and interrupt the task flow. Certain speech features have been shown to change under high levels of load and are good candidates for cognitive load indices for usability evaluation and automatic adaptation of an interface or work environment. A speech-based dual-task user study is presented in which we explore the behaviour of speech pause features in natural speech. The experiment yielded new results confirming that speech pauses are useful indicators of high load versus low load speech. We report an increase in the percentage of time spent pausing from low load to high load tasks. We interpret these results within the framework of Baddeley's modal model of working memory and detail how such a measure could be utilized in the cognitive load measurement.},

We present and discuss the use of the Design Space Explorer in two specific design cases in the domain of interactive media fa\c{c}ades, part of the emerging field of digital urban living.},

abstract = {In this paper we report on a qualitative study aiming to support online and asynchronous collaboration between stakeholders of the film scoring industry. We first describe the low-fidelity prototype we designed to facilitate the establishment of a clear scope for creative discussions. We then present evaluations conducted with two composers and a filmmaker to test the prototype's design principles. Outcomes from these evaluations stressed the need for resolving the ambiguity that occurs in remote collaboration. Feedback from participants also depicted the complex nature of the composer-filmmaker relationship and confirmed the virtues of asynchronous means of communication to support that relationship.},

abstract = {Virtual environments intended to support creative collaboration are being built without an informed consideration of the implicit interaction design choices being made. This paper proposes a set of design principles for such environments. Drawing from theory and reflective practice we suggest a conceptual focus on a Distributed Studio designed around the following five principles: Support Reconfiguration, Mix Realities, Control Access, Be A/Synchronous, and Transform Space into Inhabited Place.},

abstract = {Organisational information systems could be more effective if users' information behaviour is inscribed to information systems. This paper describes inscriptions of information behaviour to three communities of practice on an organisational intranet and explores the impact of the inscriptions on the success of these communities from users' point of view. Seventeen participants from an entertainment organisation were interviewed using particular narrative technique - episodic interviewing. The due process model, based on actor-network theory, was used to select different actors and episodes from narratives and identify interactions between them. The study found that the most successful community of practice was the one that both successfully translated user information behaviour and aligned itself to important human (managers) and nonhuman (a product catalogue application) actors. Two unsuccessful applications either fail to successfully translate user information behaviour or fail to align itself to powerful actors.},
