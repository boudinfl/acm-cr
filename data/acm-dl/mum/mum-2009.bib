abstract = {Different kinds of computing environment effect human interaction in different kinds of ways and understanding how different environments 'work', as it were, is important to their evaluation and ongoing design. Ethnographic studies of media spaces and CVEs, for example, showed that these kinds of environment introduce asymmetry and fragment the reciprocity of perspectives that is essential to human interaction. Users are therefore obliged to engage in 'compensation work' if interaction is to proceed. However, asymmetry and fragmentation are intentional features of the hybrid ubiquitous computing environments that have emerged over recent years, which is to say that they are deliberately 'built in' to the environment through the design of heterogeneous interaction mechanisms. Interaction in hybrid ubicomp environments therefore relies upon a different order of interactional work, namely 'reconciliation work'.},

abstract = {Customer reviews and recommendations for products are provided by almost all e-business platforms, supporting consumers when shopping on the web. Mobile and ubiquitous computing provide extended means to sense input data for recommendations and to make recommendations available for consumers when shopping in traditional stores. This work contributes a comprehensive design space that outlines design options for product recommendation systems using mobile and ubiquitous technologies. A visual notation for the design space is proposed, based on which existing systems are categorized. Blank spaces are identified and concrete possible extensions are proposed by the example of an existing mobile product recommendation system. Finally, general options for future research on product recommendation systems using UbiComp technologies are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper presents the results of our qualitative and exploratory study on content consumption and exchange among college students in the city of Bangalore in Karnataka, India. The purpose was to learn what specific content, like music or audio, video or movies, text, voice and pictures was consumed and exchanged among college students and also what influenced it. It was found that students' preference for content was determined by their affinity with person/s within their social network. People, who belonged to the same network had shared preferences and therefore consumed and exchanged similar content. Exchange of content was not only due to similar content preferences, but also mutual trust and reciprocity. Music consumption was common and was also the most preferred type of content among college students. Creation of content was not common and was undertaken only by so-called 'tech-savvy' students, who also disseminated content to others in the social circle. Maintaining an online presence was important, since they could consume content and also strengthen their social circle. The latter was through social networking sites and mobile phone communication.There were similarities in the way young users consumed media in emerging market like India and the western world. Some of these were preference for online privacy, usage of text messaging for coordinated meetings and predilection for content that was free of charge. Yet, there was a difference in the content that was created.},

abstract = {Near Field Communication Technology (NFC)-enabled attendance supervision trial was arranged at a primary school in Finland during the fall 2008. Total of 23 pupils between ages of 6 and 8 participated in the trial with an emphasis on security. Pupils marked their arrival at and departure from school by touching a smart card reader device or an NFC-enabled mobile phone with a contactless smart card. Teachers did not need to mark pupils' absences or delays in the backend system leaving thus more time for teaching and also enabling parents to receive real-time information on children's attendance. This paper analyzes the data related to the adoption and design process of a novel technology in a school setting. Information about user experience was obtained by using a variety of data collection methods. The findings were analyzed from the viewpoint of three end-user groups, namely children, parents and teachers. Children, as well as their teachers, became very fast familiar with the login/logout process, and the attendance supervision was soon integrated into their everyday school routines. Our analysis shows that a technology-supported attendance supervision system can bring value for all end-user groups.},

Services such as Google Maps and in-car GPS allow users to examine unknown outdoor locations in advance as well as receive guidance en-route. In contrast, there is relatively little digital technology to support users in complex building architectures, e.g. institution buildings where users are generally limited to using traditional signage or asking for directions at the reception. However, recent advances in pervasive digital display technology are enabling a new range of possibilities and are making this topic increasingly subject to study. In this paper, we describe five formative studies involving 39 participants using situated digital displays, a Person Locator Kiosk, and personal mobile devices. We report our findings by gaining insights and feedback from users in order to develop wayfinding assistance for visitors in an in-building environment.},

It is difficult for a single media sharing service to cover all variations on how people would like to present their experiences of different events; thus it is important to be able to easily create versions of these services. This paper presents in detail our platform implementation for enabling the creation of lightweight content- and context-aware mobile multimedia services. The platform supports state-of-the-art content management functionalities in order to enable easy creation of specialized multimedia services for various target groups and purposes. Our solution includes context metadata support for mobile multimedia content and creation of location-aware multimedia services. We have built example services on top of the platform using web-based technologies such as JavaScript, Media RSS feed and Java. The functionality of the platform has been tested in user evaluations with promising results.},

abstract = {Lately, the usage of mobile live video streaming for video sharing has been growing steadily. However, because of the limitations presented by the capabilities of mobile phone video capturing devices, these video streams end up having either a low resolution or a small field of view. On the other hand, the ubiquity of video capture-capable mobile phones make the probability that more than one user will be recording the same scene from different views relatively high.In this paper we introduce a system for mobile live video streaming, named Mobicast, that enables the collaboration between multiple users streaming the same event from their mobile phones to provide a better collective viewing experience of the event to end viewers. We describe architectural components of the system that can be used in enhancing the viewing experience in different ways. Thereafter, we describe the details of an implementation of the system aiming at enhancing the viewing experience by stitching the incoming mobile video streams to construct a panoramic view in real-time. We performed a number of experiments, using both real-usage data and synthetically generated data, aiming at verifying that the system fulfills its promise of enhancing the viewing experience.},

Implementing a complete model of context remains an unsolved problem, however, some contextual elements such as person, time and place are relatively easy to identify. We develop a simple context model incorporating personal, temporal and spatial dimensions and apply it to a context-aware text messaging service. We report a field study of the service, investigating how applying these fundamental contextual constraints to messages can affect the nature of communication between participants. The results suggest that although contextual constraints are not appropriate for all types of message content, they increase opportunities for situated chat in public spaces, improve group awareness between peers and facilitate conversations between people, some of whom would not otherwise communicate with each other.},

The application provides a two-way communications channel where the music producers make their creative content available to people occupying a shared social space. These people then democratically choose the music played in the shared public space and provide valuable feedback to the musicians by downloading and rating their content. We present findings from empirical user testing carried out in three separate locations, and outline directions for future work and further experiments.},

abstract = {When it comes to vehicle accidents, people are stressed out and overstrained, even if it is just a car body damage and no one is hurt. They often lack adequate and immediate assistance and may worry about the lengthy and paper-based loss report to their insurance carrier. At the same time, it is crucial for insurance companies to receive early and detailed case circumstances in order to decrease costs and assist customers with value-added services. Against this background, we propose the usage of mobile phones in order to assist people in the aftermath of an accident. We present a concept for mobile claims assistance along with a proto-typical implementation that features an asynchronous communication between mobile phones and claims management enterprise systems based on mobile Web Services. Finally, we discuss the user perspective on mobile insurance applications and present data we collected using a combination of focus groups and user surveys.},

In this paper, we advocate 'social bookmarking' as a solution, given its proven utility in enabling affinity-based discovery online. But, adapting such web-centric ideas to rich media consumption raises technical and business challenges. With TV Clips, we introduce a system that tackles these concerns for broadcast television with extensibility to 3-screen usage. We describe the initial architecture and prototype, and discuss its evolution to support product-centric requirements like scalability and rights management. A secondary goal is to share our experiences in developing this prototype for a commercial environment (i.e., TV) and motivate further research in adapting 'social search' strategies to such media-rich domains.},

Our system illustrates a way how usage barriers can be lowered and how high user involvement can be created.

A variety of solutions utilizing different mediums is being developed. Lately, a range of mobile devices have started to support outdoor pedestrian navigation, and these devices presumably keep guiding the users also when moving indoors. However, the design patterns from the outdoor world do not necessarily work indoors. In order to understand the distinctive UI requirements of indoor navigation, we conducted a user study involving 23 people using a mobile phone-based, location-sensitive service. In this paper, we reveal our findings that the visualizations and UI designs resembling conventional outdoor maps or floor layouts are not optimal for indoor navigation, and present recommendations for the future design of indoor navigation systems.},

abstract = {Classic paper-based maps provide high-resolution, large-scale information and are ubiquitous in larger cities and even outdoors. In this paper we present a combination of their advantages with a mobile camera projector unit to create a new mobile and intuitive buddy finder interface. Current friend or buddy finder systems on mobile phones such as Google Latitude suffer from the small screen estate and display size of mobile devices. To overcome this problem we use a lightweight mobile camera projector unit to augment the paper map with a projected overlay of the buddies' positions. By using digital and geo-referenced representations of public maps no extra preperation for the tracking is needed. The idea is presented by enhancing Google Latitude, which allows users to browse the positions of their friends, to project the positions directly on the paper map without the cumbersome panning and zooming of a digital map on a small display.},
