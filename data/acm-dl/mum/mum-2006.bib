abstract = {This paper presents a rhythm metadata enabled music player. The player allows the user to navigate within a music track by skipping to the next or previous measure while the playback remains continuous. The player also includes a looping functionality allowing the user to repeat the currently playing measure. The player enables the above navigation and looping in an entertaining way without breaking the sensation of beat and rhythm. We also consider an easy way of creating variations of an original music track with the help of rhythm metadata and present a data format for storing such a variation.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach to video telephony where we are able to exploit the benefits of the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol: self-configuration, discovery and control of available devices connected to the network. At the time being, UPnP does not deal with Video Voice over IP (VVoIP) applications. Integrating a signaling protocol like the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) with UPnP allows interaction between the videophone and other UPnP compliant devices, like a TV set or a media server. This interaction, for example, makes it feasible to display the caller's image on the television screen, thus allowing the user to relax on the sofa and naturally converse. Another interesting scenario is the one where the user sends to the conversation partner a set of still pictures or short video clips acquired from a UPnP media server already available in the home premises. An advantage of this distributed approach is its cost effectiveness, since it allows to reuse existing UPnP devices also in the context of video telephony. The integration between SIP and UPnP has been achieved introducing a new UPnP device, the VVoIP device, which is a SIP User Agent able to interoperate with standard UPnP MediaServers and Medi-aRenderers.},

abstract = {Mobile multimedia is still at early stages of commercialization, and pioneering solutions are currently adopted by only early-adopter-type of end-users. Accurate handset-based usage-level measurements have been implemented in several panel studies taking place both in the U.S. and Europe (France, England, Germany and Finland) in 2005-2006. These studies have included more than 1 700 Symbian smartphone users, who represent early-adopter subscribers. The results of these studies provide a lot of insights on the current coverage of mobile multimedia services among early-adopters. It seems that the camera application and various games are by far the most widely used multimedia-oriented mobile applications. The role of games reflects particularly in the 3rd party application scene. Various multimedia players were also identified. Many of them deal with offline content (e.g. offline music/movies), but there were quite a number of streaming applications evident in the data, too. 13% of all panelists had actually generated packet data with multimedia applications. People who utilize streaming packet data services usually generate the biggest chunk of their data use with these applications. In multimedia communications it was found that video call usage was very infrequent in Europe (video calls need 3G infrastructure). However, both Bluetooth and MMS messaging have attracted decent masses. Americans utilize mobile emailing and instant messaging very actively. The on-going emergence of instant messaging and other ways of multimedia communications is an observation worth follow-up studies. This empirical study contributes to the current understanding of real usage patterns of mobile multimedia services and applications, at the same time presenting a useful research platform in implementing this kind of studies on end-customer behavior also in the future.},

As increasing number of mobile devices are equipped with cameras, mobile devices can be a key tool for local and remote visual interaction and communications. In this paper we discuss our Mobile Visual Interaction system that enables pointing with mobile camera devices on larger displays, and key findings in using mobile cameras for human computer interaction. The mobile pointing software can identify and interpret camera-detectable data elements inserted on data surfaces such as computer displays or projected screens. The user can interact with this system by pointing the mobile camera device to the surface and performing gestures. In this article we share the key challenges and key results found during developing the system.},

abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate a solution to use cameras to down-load data to cell phones as an alternative to existing wireless (CDMA/GPRS, BlueTooth), infrared or cable connections. In our method the data is encoded as a sequence of images, which can be displayed on any flat display, captured by users with their camera phones, and decoded by pre-embedded software. To solve this problem we need to be able to (1) encode arbitrary data as a sequence of images, (2) process captured images under various lighting variations and perspective distortions while maintaining realtime performance, and (3) decode the processed images robustly even when partial data is lost. In the paper we address these challenges in detail and present our solution. We have implemented a prototype which allows users to successfully download various types of files, including pictures, ring tones and Java programs to the camera phones. We discuss the limitations of our solution, and future works to overcome these limitations.},

abstract = {In this paper we present MAR (Mobile Augmented Reality) Toolkit as an easy-to-use augmented reality toolset for building multi-user mobile phone games. It is built on top of MUPE - Nokia-developed open source mobile platform based on Java - which considers the special qualities of mobile technology. MAR Toolkit contains four components, map interface (MAP), physical object tagger (POT), public display (PUD) and silent communicator (SIC).We have successfully demonstrated MAR Toolkit by implementing a game named as Mupeland Yard based on classical board game Scotland Yard. In user testing we found that common usability issues related to mobile technology and MUPE-platform troubled the tests. However, especially POT component raised interest among developers. We found that using graphical 2D-tags for providing location information for augmented reality games is a simple and robust alternative for more technology intensive GPS and cell-ID information.},

abstract = {Wireless networks are becoming increasingly popular in professional environments as well as in the home. The success of IEEE 802.11 has cut down equipment costs and people are now building their own residential wireless networks, connecting PCs, MP3 players, broadband gateways and Hi-Fi systems.However, such dramatic growth is creating problems in crowded areas, as the Wi-Fi bandwidth is limited and interference effects start to limit the technology usability.This paper describes a management system for handling the quality of the overall home wireless network, so that interference or bulk noise effects can be alleviated allowing users to enjoy digital content with the reliability they expect. By means of Universal Plug 'n Play, events that may deteriorate the quality of existing services can be propagated to all interested devices so that a smart allocation of network resources can be applied. A simple Admission Control scheme is also used to regulate the admission of real-time streams.},

abstract = {IP-based Multimedia creation and consumption is becoming available on an increasing spectrum of devices ranging from low-powered portable devices like cell phones and PDA's to high powered static devices like desktops PCs and IPTVs. High-speed wireless and wire-line network access is becoming widespread. Multimedia services like IPTV, Video-on-demand and Video-conferencing are becoming main stream. These developments have paved the way for creating innovative concepts like session mobility for multimedia applications. Session mobility enables seamless transfer of an on-going multimedia session between different devices based on user preferences. We examine the motivations and use cases for session mobility. In this paper we evaluate architectural design constraints and propose architectural solutions for session mobility. We evaluate current session mobility mechanisms and propose requirements for new mechanisms.},

abstract = {Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) have just recently specified the use Raptor codes in their mobile broadcast file delivery engine. Until today, investigations of the applicability of these codes to the mentioned systems have been carried out by assuming almost exclusively quite simple loss models such as statistically independent radio packet losses. Furthermore, the combination and tradeoffs between physical layer parameters such as transmit power or physical layer for-ward error correction code rates in system design has been completely ignored. In this work we investigate the end-to-end system performance by analyzing the trade-off between physical layer parameters and application layer code. In particular we are interested in determining the optimal system operating points for optimized broadcast file delivery. Parameters such as power allocation, mobility model, physical layer Turbo code rate, raptor code expansion ratio are investigated and a single performance criteria is defined, namely the required energy to deliver a file to at least some high percentage of users. It is shown that typically considered system configurations with high transmit power and low physical layer code rates - resulting in low radio block loss rates - are in general suboptimal for efficient delivery. A careful tradeoff the system parameters can reduce the required resources in the order of a magnitude.},
