abstract = {Support for ecological sustainability is of growing interest and the over-consumption, production and disposal of foods are a major concern for sustainability, ethics and the economy. However, there is a deficit in current understandings of how technologies could be used within this area. In this paper we focus on food waste and report on a qualitative study to understand daily food practices around shopping planning, gardening, storing, cooking and throwing away food, and their relations to waste. The findings point to design-relevant factors such as losing sight and reordering; spatial, temporal and social constraints; trust and valuing food source; and busyness, unpredictability and effort. The main contribution of this paper is to understand food practices and in turn to present seven dimensions of visibility to draw out implications for designing mobile and ubiquitous technologies for this new arena for design. We also present a prototype evolving from our qualitative results, the mobile food waste diary.},

abstract = {Personal well-being is influenced by small daily decisions such as what or when to eat or whether to go jogging. The health consequences of these decisions accumulate over time. Mobile applications can be designed to support people in everyday decisions and thus help to improve well-being real-time. In this paper we propose a framework to study the influential factors for users to download and use applications from the wide selection currently available in App stores. The framework includes attractiveness, value, ease-of-use, trust, social support, diffusiveness, as well as fun and excitement. We illustrated how the framework works in practise by applying it to an online survey to assess 12 mobile Apps for well-being. The results showed that these influential factors did match the decisions on users' attitudes toward taking Apps into use. User feedback explained how people assessed the influential factors before actually using the applications.},

abstract = {In the last years 3D is getting more and more popular. Besides the increasing number of movies for 3D stereoscopic cinemas and television, serious steps have also been undertaken in the field of 3D gaming. Games with stereoscopic 3D output are now available not only for gamers with high-end PCs but also on handheld devices equipped with 3D autostereoscopic displays.Recent smartphone technology has powerful processors that allow complex tasks like image processing, e.g. used in augmented reality applications. Moreover these devices are nowadays equipped with various sensors that allow additional input modalities far beyond joystick, mouse, keyboard and other traditional input methods. In this paper we propose an approach for sensor-based interaction with stereoscopic displayed 3D data on mobile devices and present a mobile 3D game that makes use of these concepts.},

The particular requirements to a navigation user interface for a vision-based system, however, have not been investigated so far.Such mobile interfaces should adapt to localization accuracy, which strongly relies on distinctive reference images, and other factors, such as the phone's pose. If necessary, the system should motivate the user to point at distinctive regions with the smartphone to improve localization quality.We present a combined interface of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) elements with indicators that help to communicate and ensure localization accuracy. In an evaluation with 81 participants, we found that AR was preferred in case of reliable localization, but with VR, navigation instructions were perceived more accurate in case of localization and orientation errors. The additional indicators showed a potential for making users choose distinctive reference images for reliable localization.},

Now, many users are accustomed to input with a keyboard, however, there is a limitation of miniaturization because it degrades the performance of key touch. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a method to miniaturize a keyboard by excluding the half of it. In using the proposed method, one hand hits keys as usual, and the other hand hits the place outside the keyboard as if the user types with both hands. The user can input words with only one hand because the proposed system estimates the input word using keying interval, which appears also when the user inputs with both hands. From the results of user study, we confirmed that the user can input with only one hand and that it does not decrease input speed drastically.},

However, usually only one of each kind of sensor is installed in a device, and the effect of multiple homogeneous sensors on recognition accuracy has not been investigated. Moreover, the effect of the differences in the motion of a gesture has not been examined. We have investigated the use of a test mobile device with nine accelerometers and nine gyroscopes. We have captured the data for 27 kinds of gestures for a mobile tablet. We experimentally investigated the effects on recognition accuracy of changing the number and positions of the sensors and of the number and kinds of gestures. The results showed that the use of multiple homogeneous sensors has zero or negligible effect on recognition accuracy, but that using an accelerometer along with a gyroscope improves recognition accuracy. They also showed that some gestures were not consistent among test subjects and interdependent, so selecting specific gestures to use can improve recognition accuracy.},

Especially the exploration of geographical data, which until today mostly relies on mice and keyboard input, could benefit from this interaction paradigm. However, the gestures that are required to interact with complex systems like Geographic Information Systems (GIS) increase in difficulty with every additional functionality. This paper describes a novel interaction approach that allows non-expert users to easily explore geographic data using a combination of multi-touch gestures and handpostures. The use of the additional input modality -- handpose -- is supposed to avoid more complex multi-touch gestures. Furthermore the screen of a wearable device serves as another output modality that on one hand avoids occlusion and on the other hand serves as a magic lens.},

The implemented prototype monitors energy consumption and relates it to the activities of the player by measuring corresponding behavior. It provides feedback through a game application. Participants in a pilot study judged the game to be generally appropriate for the workplace, and changes in motivation were reported. Explicitly requesting feedback was preferred over immediate notifications. Sensor measurements showed that energy-saving situations occurred more often during the study.},

abstract = {Online social media services, such as Facebook and Twitter, have set new standards on how people interact with each other online, share their everyday activities, and media services. While current mobile services supporting social interaction are typically primarily for remote communication, similar services can be introduced to co-located social interactions. In such a setting, people and proactive, context sensing mobile devices form a new kind of a socio-digital system where the mobile devices are active participants and can initiate interaction among the devices and people. Physical proximity of the devices becomes a key enabler to advance users' interaction with each other and the supporting mobile services. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Social Devices and its implementation. The Social Devices Platform facilitates autonomously composed cooperative services in co-located devices where the client part is simple and easily deployable to different kinds of devices.},

Social Devices promote proxemic interactions between people and can act as enablers of users' social contacts. Various modalities are used to support natural interactions between users and Social Devices. We present an explorative study of spatial gestures that could support interactions with Social Devices. Our aim was to find out what kind of gestures users would like to use for different types of actions. Ten pairs participated in a laboratory study in which they went through three scenarios of Social Devices. The participants were asked to generate gestures that they would find suitable for user actions within the scenarios. In this paper, we present the found gesture types and their fit to various user actions. Our results show that Scan, Swing, Nod and Turn the screen down are potential spatial gestures for intuitive use of Social Devices. User feedback about their preferences of using spatial gestures indicates issues of social acceptance.},

We question if digital displays can be designed to support opportunistic search in meetings. Assuming information sharing in collocated meetings may largely come from conversation, we propose to design an ambient tabletop display that provides just-in-time conversational information to support opportunistic browsing and searching.

In a between subjects study with 80 participants, we analyzed usability and shoulder surfing susceptibility of password entry on different mobile platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Symbian, MeeGo). Our results show significant differences in the usability of password entry (required password entry time, typing accuracy) and susceptibility to shoulder surfing. Our results provide insights for security-aware design of on-screen keyboards and for password composition strategies tailored to entry on smartphones.},

The transmission of unprocessed sensor readings can, however, pose severe threats to the users' privacy. To protect their privacy, users can apply filters to eliminate privacy-sensitive elements of the sensor readings prior to transmission. The resulting privacy protection depends on the configuration of these filters, which is controlled by the users through a privacy interface. In this paper, we study interface elements for the realization of this interface in order to foster its acceptance and maximize the efficacy of the provided privacy protection. To this end, we have implemented six graphical privacy interfaces, which have been evaluated by 80 participants of our user study. The results show a preference of the users towards differently colored and sized elements to visualize the current level of privacy protection and define their preferred privacy settings.},

We propose to use them as 'light beams': Everyday objects sojourning in a beam are turned into dedicated projection surfaces and tangible interaction devices. This way, our daily surroundings get populated with interactive objects, each one temporarily chartered with a dedicated sub-issue of pervasive interaction. While interaction with objects has been studied in larger, immersive projection spaces, the affordances of pico projections are fundamentally different: they have a very small, strictly limited field of projection, and they are mobile. This paper contributes the results of an exploratory field study on how people interact with everyday objects in pico projections in nomadic settings. Based upon these results, we present novel interaction techniques that leverage the limited field of projection and trade-off between digitally augmented and traditional uses of everyday objects.},

abstract = {When using a tablet computer, sketching is a natural approach for users to annotate video scenes. However, when these annotations are done in real-time and overlaid in the video, their context can be lost due to changes in the scene being annotated. We propose an approach towards maintaining the annotations' context, by using object tracking to create anchors onto which further annotations can be attached. To this end, the annotator is capable of using different tracking methods, including a Kinect sensor and/or the TLD object tracking algorithm.The challenges involved in designing an interface to support the association of video annotations with tracked objects in real-time are also discussed. In particular, we discuss our alternative approaches to handle moving object selection on live video, which we have called "Hold and Overlay" and "Hold and Speed Up". In addition, the results of a set of preliminary tests are reported.},

However, because of increasing camera and encoding quality more and more smartphones are providing an attractive tool for creating and editing videos. The demand for smooth video browsing interfaces is challenged by the limited input and output capabilities that such mobile devices offer. This paper discusses a novel interface for fast and precise video browsing suitable for watching and editing videos. The browsing mechanism offers a simple but powerful interface for browsing videos at different levels of granularity. All interactions can be carried out with no modal changes at all. The interface is easy to understand and efficient to use. A first evaluation proves the suitability of the presented design for casual users as well as for creative professionals such as video editors.},

abstract = {When applying the Wizard of Oz (WOz) method to mobile and ubiquitous computing studies, the task of the wizard becomes more difficult as observing the user requires the wizard to be in the context. We address this problem through the ConWIZ system that allows not only to control a specific prototype but also to control parameters included in the contextual settings. In order to evaluate our approach, we setup a study with eight human wizards where we evaluated the applicability, appropriateness and usability of the ConWIZ system for mobile and UbiComp environments. Each wizard had to simulate a navigation system and control contextual parameters like simulation of wind by switching a fan on and off, and tactile feedback mechanism using the ConWIZ system. All wizards stated that the tool is definitely applicable and appropriate for supporting a mobile WOz study which allows the wizard to be hidden also if he resides in the study context. Regarding the applicability of the system, we found out that high workload may hinder the wizard from doing additional tasks such as note taking.},

An IVO application is described as a set of workflows triggered by events that are automatically generated in runtime by sensing the environment, either through the smartphone's own sensors, or using a sensor infrastructure external to the smartphone. This paper describes, in more detail, the Android client developed to validate the framework's usability and usefulness, and discusses the usability tests of an application developed with the framework.},

On the contrary, mobile devices are more easily available, but due to limited screen size and resolution, they are not suitable for sharing multimedia data interactively. In this paper we present a "Dynamic Tiling Display", an interactive display surface built from mobile devices. Our framework utilizes the integrated front facing camera of mobile devices to estimate the relative pose of multiple mobile screens arbitrarily placed on a table. Using this framework, users can create a large virtual display where multiple users can explore multimedia data interactively through separate windows (mobile screens). The major technical challenge is the calibration of individual displays, which is solved by visual object recognition using front facing camera inputs.},

The attractiveness of a landmark is based on its visual, structural and semantic properties which are used for calculating the total attractiveness of a single landmark.This model was evaluated with voluntary users conducted in laboratory environment. Test subjects were shown images of street intersections from where they selected the most attractive and prominent landmarks in the route's context. We then compared these results with the landmarks selected by the model. The results show that landmarks highlighted by the model were the same ones that were selected by the participants as most salient landmarks.},

In this paper, we analyze the differences and similarities of manual check-ins from Foursquare and automatic check-ins from Nokia's Mobile Data Challenge. Several new findings follow from our analysis: (1) While automatic checking-in overall results in more visits than manual checking-in, the check-in levels are comparable when visiting new places. (2) Daily and weekly check-in activity patterns are similar for both systems except for Saturdays -- when manual check-ins are relatively more probable. (3) A recently proposed rank distribution to describe human mobility, so far validated on manual check-in data, also holds for automatic check-in data given a slight modification to the definition of rank. (4) The patterns described by automatic check-ins are in general more predictable. We also address the question of whether it is possible to find matching places across the two check-in systems. Our analysis shows that while this is challenging in areas such as city centers, our method achieves an accuracy of 51% for places that are not homes of phone users.},

To allow concurrent interaction by multiple users beyond traditional collaborative scenarios we introduce the idea of virtually augmented public screens for creating personalized views and thus literally enabling "private public screens". We present a fully functional research prototype in form of a Video Wall application and report on first experiences gathered from a comparative user study. The results show that the proposed personalized Augmented Reality approach, which allows each user to have a private view on the public display, is preferred over a purely competitive mode, where the public display is shared between the users. Further, our study shows that social activity indicators informing about the activities of other users are well appreciated.},

For example, during user's entering key strokes. if a service cloud can recognize user-authentication by analyzing key strokes, then, it can find the optimal services based on the user preference. Our algorithm is based on a statistic probabilistic model based approach; it calculates the probability distribution of the temporal differential values of pressure by Kalman filtering. The captured sensory data is compared to predicted sensory data based on the probability distribution to judge whether the person making the key-operation is the registered owner or not. We implement the proposed system and subject it to feasibility experiments with 10 subjects; its user-authentication accuracy is quite good with a FAR-FRR error rate of only 10[%].},

Music can then be consumed from these areas by other users using three different methods. Based on the results, the concept adds novel experiences to outdoor gaming and music discovery. Populating the world with music by competing in the game was seen as a motivating way to discover and share music. Outdoor exercising combined to discovering places conquered with new music were seen as important and interesting by all the users in the interviews. Users found the different music consumption options to be novel and useful.

In the insurance business, such applications have recently gained traction as a viable alternative to the monitoring of drivers via "black boxes" installed in vehicles, which lacks interaction opportunities and is perceived as privacy intrusive by policyholders. However, pose uncertainty and other noise-inducing factors make smartphones potentially less reliable as sensor platforms. We therefore compare critical driving events generated by a smartphone with reference measurements from a vehicle-fixed IMU in a controlled field study. The study was designed to capture driver variability under real-world conditions, while minimizing the influence of external factors. We find that the mobile measurements tend to overestimate critical driving events, possibly due to deviation from the calibrated initial device pose. While weather and daytime do not appear to influence event counts, road type is a significant factor that is not considered in most current state-of-the-art implementations.},

While other papers have often focused on systems developed for urban contexts, this paper presents the initial findings of a study that focuses on a rural produce market in West Wales as a site for ubiquitous multimedia system-based intervention, digital economic considerations and co-design. The findings relate to the initial ethnographic fieldwork, digital-economic considerations for the site, the evolution of a participatory design strategy for developing a Market Portal and - importantly -- the way that these are informing the design of the ubiquitous technologies relating to the Market Portal.},

These digital natives' approach to the world and expectations of how it should operate may differ from that of the digital immigrants'. This creates a risk of a design conflict, where solutions developed by immigrants may fit poorly to the natives' way to do things. It is important to understand digital natives better in order to know what design principles hold true with them. We interviewed 6--7 year old Finnish girls, who had just started school and had gotten their first mobile phone, to understand what their experiences are on using mobile phones, what they think of mobile phone use, and how they use them. This paper reports our preliminary results and proposes possible new avenues for research of digital natives.},

Combined with indoor localization techniques, pico projectors can be used for navigation purposes to augment the environment with navigation information. In the present empirical study (n = 24) we explore users' perceptions, workload and navigation performance when navigating with a mobile projector in comparison to a mobile screen as indoor navigation interface. To capture user perceptions and to predict acceptance by applying structural equation modeling, we assessed perceived disorientation, privacy concerns, trust, ease of use, usefulness and sources of visibility problems. Moreover, the impact of user factors (spatial abilities, technical self-efficacy, familiarity) on acceptance was analyzed. The structural models exhibited adequate predictive and psychometric properties. Based on real user experience, they clearly pointed out a) similarities and device-specific differences in navigation device acceptance, b) the role of specific user experiences (visibility, trust, and disorientation) during navigation device usage and c) illuminated the underlying relationships between determinants of user acceptance. Practical implications of the results and future research questions are provided.},

For instance: door displays, floor displays, wall displays, and interactive tables. Despite recent technological advances and the commercialization of hardware required to achieve this at a relatively low cost, creating and deploying such displays remains a difficult task, even for those with the essential technical skills and experience. We assert that greater accessibility of toolkits like the one presented in this paper will reduce these barriers and allow people (not necessarily from the ubiquitous computing domain) to apply the technology to their own fields. To assess this toolkit's suitability for this role, we present a system and usability evaluation. We observed that participants were able to quickly create their own novel display deployments. Our findings offer insights for potential toolkit users and those considering how to write programs for future ubiquitous projected display environments.},

In this paper we present a study that explores the design of "interacting places" -- networked public multimedia services that foster community awareness between local members -- in the context of a student community. In order to have interacting places "fit in" with the existing communication practices of the students, we performed and analyzed a set of semi-structured interviews with n=17 students regarding their use of email, social networking services, and instant messaging to stay in touch with others. A follow-up online survey (n=76) then explored how networked public multimedia services could complement these practices. Following a "communicative ecology" approach -- a conceptual model that represents the technical, social, and discursive contexts of communication -- we draw up guidelines to support the design of both content and channels (applications) for interacting places in student communities.},

We report on the users' preferences with the presented techniques at different interaction phases (identification, navigation, and collecting results). We analyze how user preferences in the personalized display scenario are similar or different to other scenarios, such as interaction with physical objects or non-personalized public displays. The analysis is summarized in a form of design recommendations that should be considered when designing for interaction with personalized public displays.},

abstract = {Public terminals for service provision provide high convenience to users due to their constant availability. Yet, the interaction with them lacks security and privacy as it takes place in a public setting. Additionally, users have to wait in line until they can interact with the terminal. In comparison to that, personal mobile devices allow for private service execution. Since many services, like with-drawing money from an ATM, require physical presence at the terminal, hybrid approaches have been developed. These move parts of the interaction to a mobile device. In this work we present the results of a four week long real world user study, in which we investigated whether hybrid approaches would actually be used. The results show that users accept the hybrid service as they understood that they could use down downtimes (like bus rides) to prepare the interaction with the public terminal. Our findings give novel insights about security relevant aspects such as where and when users interact with the mobile service before accessing the public terminal. So the preparation of the transaction on the mobile phone was often conducted much further away from the terminal than expected (81.0% with a distance greater than 400m) and earlier than expected (82.1% at least 5 minutes in advance).},

Further, the increased functions of electronics also increase a number of buttons of remote controllers. These complexities make it difficult for users to control consumer electronics. To simplify interaction between remote controllers and the electronics, we propose a user buildable remote controller device, called Blockon. The Blockon enables a user to build his own controller easily by placing button blocks on the board as building LEGO blocks. The Blockon not only supports placing buttons freely but also makes it possible to define macro commands by stacking button blocks. In this paper, we also present a prototype of the Blockon for technical verification along with our future plan.},

Additionally it introduced a visual documentation procedure (structural ties) to capture relations to pre-given requirements. 25 young interaction designers participated in the study. Initial results of the study have shown that documenting structural ties during the creative process is possible to some extend and it has two major advantages: It has a potential to make stronger claims on the scientific value of creative techniques and such structures can help young designers to refine their creative ideas in alignment with pre-given requirements.},

abstract = {Interaction is repeatedly pointed out as a key enabling element towards more engaging and valuable public displays. Still, most digital public displays today do not support any interactive features. We believe that this is mainly due to the lack of efficient and clear abstractions that developers can use to incorporate interactivity into their applications. In this demo we present PuReWidgets, a toolkit that developers can use in their public display applications to support the interaction process across multiple display systems, without considering the specifics of what interaction modality will be used on each particular display. PuReWidgets provides high-level widgets to application programmers, and allows users to interact via various interaction mechanisms, such as graphical user interfaces for mobile devices, QR codes, SMS, etc.},

abstract = {As the Internet of Things finds its way into private households, more and more everyday objects communicate with services that are running inside the home and on the Internet. For individuals to trust their smart homes, they should be aware of possibly privacy-sensitive data flows and control commands. In this demo paper, we present a system that combines a real time network analysis tool with an augmented reality user interface to visualize data streams within the home network and to remote services. Our system requires no modifications to a typical home network infrastructure, as it operates by merely observing packets sent over the network.},

abstract = {Mobile devices can help to solve urban traffic problems by improving personal mobility and making transport, traveling, and commuting for individual users more flexible, sustainable, and rewarding. For that purpose, the tripzoom application combines mobility data and patterns from mobile sensing, a dynamic incentive system, and community feedback from social networks. This paper gives an overview of tripzoom, its features, and technical realization, and explains how users can take advantage of it to monitor, manage, and improve their mobility behavior.},

abstract = {This demonstration presents work done in the TimeMachine project with the goal to explore patterns in everyday life using a mobile application. This mobile application captures GPS data and uses this information to provide a subjective map of the user behavior using several visualizations. The project resorts to a rigorous data capture and processing approach with the goal of providing meaningful visualizations to the users. The visualizations depart from common map based representations as time is the main variable that is considered. Routines are represented through time based variables such as duration and frequency (for a given place or set of places) and a glimpse of the future is also provided considering what happened in the past. The demonstration presents the current version of the mobile application and desktop based tools used to extract information or prototype additional visualizations.},

abstract = {Recent mobile phones allow users to perform a multitude of different tasks. Complexity of tasks challenges the design of mobile applications in many ways. For instance, the limited screen space of mobile devices allows only a small number of items to be displayed. Therefore, users often have to change the view or have to resize the displayed content (e.g., images or maps) to view the required information. We present the system MobIES, which allows users to extend the mobile interfaces of their mobiles phones using external screens. Users connect their mobile phone with an external display by holding it on the border of the external display. When the connection is established, the user interface of the currently active mobile application is distributed on the phone and the external screen. This enables users to take advantage of using existing screens in their environments and temporarily benefit from an extended screen space. In this paper, we discuss the concept of MobIES and present a prototype implementation.},

abstract = {In this paper we introduce a system based on commercial off-the-shelf components for augmented reality support in general assisted living scenarios. Our system is comprised of (i) a smartphone with near field communication (NFC) capabilities and (ii) a wearable 3D see-through display. Both components utilize the Android operating system and are connected wirelessly. We demonstrate how such system can be used for aiding interaction of mobile users with their environment, e.g., as patients in assisted living or rehabilitation facilities. In our demonstrated state, the system allows users to gain language-independent contextual hints about their environment by touching tagged objects with their phone, which displays corresponding information on the head-mounted display.},

abstract = {Most mobile games are designed for users to only focus on their own screens thus lack of face-to-face interaction even users are sitting together. Prior work shows that the shared information space created by multiple mobile devices can encourage users to communicate to each other naturally. The aim of this work is to provide a fluent view-stitching technique for mobile phone users to establish their information-shared view. We present MagMobile: a new spatial interaction technique that allows users to stitch views by simply putting multiple mobile devices close to each other. We describe the design of spatial-aware sensor module which is low cost and easy to be obtained into phones. We also propose two collaborative games to engage social interactions in the co-located place.},
