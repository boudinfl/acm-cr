abstract = {The breakthrough of web 2.0 and sudden uprising of hundreds of different social networking sites have modified the way we communicate and share our experiences and lives with other people. Despite the undeniable networking advantages this digital world offers, it cannot be seen as purely positive development. Due to a prospering online "hang around" culture, we have lost genuine rich human social experiences to some degree. This paper proposes how to utilize the digital identities and content people have created within these services to improve and encourage natural communication and lower the social barrier of natural interaction in public settings. We propose a system that combines the content in the virtual world with the presence in real world settings. SocS (Social Surroundings) brings out digital information and media content of users to the current physical space, thus attempting to make individuals more approachable by other participants. The requirements, design principles and design of the proposed application are presented. We also discuss the usage and current state of social networking sites as a motivator for new genre of intelligent services.},

abstract = {As users get accustomed to an increasing diverse range of mobile devices, personal computers, intelligent home and office appliances, as well as shared public devices, collaborative multi-device systems are emerging to benefit from using together devices of different users and different capabilities. This paper presents a conceptual framework for the systematic design of such systems in symbiotic environments. It distinguishes between information and interaction spaces. Focusing on using devices together, we introduce relationships between interaction spaces and annotatable mappings between the information space and the interaction spaces. Customizable annotations and the corresponding transformation of information support the development of collaborative systems for different scenarios. To demonstrate the validity of our framework, we introduce an architecture for multi-device web-browsing systems, and an annotation vocabulary which particularly focuses on symbiotic environments. The evaluation of our implemented prototype confirms the usefulness of multi-browsing, and the need for supporting both developers and end users to individually annotate web pages.},

abstract = {With the current development towards completely interactive environments realized through ubiquitous computing technologies and new transmaterials, the interaction landscape is changing from consisting of separated computer environments and related human-computer interaction issues, to being more about interactive architecture and human- (digitally enhanced) environment interaction. Given this general shift it becomes important to examine the fundamental challenges, consequences, and implications for design facing interaction designers. In this paper we therefore set out to: 1) describe the general character of these future interactive environments, 2) discuss interaction design challenges related to fully interactive environments, and 3) point at some general implications for design given this new understanding. To exemplify this trend, we describe two ongoing research projects that illustrate some aspects of the changes of the physical environment and changes in the (traditional) relation between the physical environment and its habitants. Finally, we present some arguments for environment interaction theorizing as a fundamental approach to tackle this general and fundamental challenge for the field of human-computer interaction.},

In this paper we present an exploratory user study based on deployment of the weConnect service among individuals in close relationships. The study focuses on the user perception and experience with the 'always-on' channels, delivering personalized content. We started with images, text, and animations as familiar and easily accessible media. We observed a high level of reciprocity in creating and exchanging expressive content and a need for persistence, reuse, and notification of content delivery. The users voiced their enthusiasm for receiving personalized media across mobile and desktop devices. The always-on nature of the weConnect channels raised new requirements for the service design to assist content producers with creating streams of personalized media efficiently and to enable recipients to view the content flexibly.},

abstract = {When a user performs a web search, the first query entered will frequently not return the required information. Thus, one needs to review the initial set of links and then to modify the query or construct a new one. This incremental process is particularly frustrating and difficult to manage for a mobile user due to the device limitations (e.g. keyboard, display). We present a query formulation architecture that employs the notion of context in order to automatically construct queries, where context refers to the article currently being viewed by the user. The proposed system uses semantic metadata extracted from the web page being consumed to automatically generate candidate queries. Novel methods are proposed to create and validate candidate queries. Further two variants of query expansion and a post-expansion validation technique are described. Finally, insights into the effectiveness of our system are provided based on evaluation tests of its individual components.},

Standardized candidates include text-based Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) of Web Services (WS) and Instant Messaging Extensions of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). In addition, binary-based approaches such as Generic Communications Middleware (GCM) and compression of XML have been proposed. The contribution of this paper is a benchmark and evaluation of SOAP, SIP and GCM as messaging middleware for application and service interaction. In particular protocol overhead, Round-Trip-Time (RTT) and processing latency have been focused on in experiments performed in a Java-based test-bed. The results indicate the optimized performance of the binary approaches, when compared to text-based protocols. More importantly the detailed performance comparison indicates factors contributing to RTT and processing latency, which should be helpful when making technology selections between the protocol candidates. In addition applicability of the protocols is discussed.},

abstract = {Smart environments are characterized by dynamic ensembles of devices that offer individual services to the user in an unobtrusive manner. For more advanced services often the cooperation of devices is required which can be accomplished by composition of services. To keep the composition process as unobtrusive as possible it must be fast and ressource saving. AI planning is one possibility to realize service composition. Four different planners have been evaluated referring to execution time. The evaluation has been based on an abstract simulation model that reflects some key characteristics of services in smart environments, e.g. number of services and distribution of pre- and postconditions of these services. The evaluation results showed that planners like UCPOP, SGP, and particularly blackbox, are suitable for composing services in time in a typical smart environment. However, their run time behavior is irregular and additionally differ with respect to how fast they recognize that no plan exist. These cases require specific strategies to avoid unnecessary resource consumption.},

abstract = {Here, we present Touch &amp; Share, an application for sharing multimedia content in our everyday environment. Our main design criterion is ease of use. Visual icons placed in the environment act as data storage (file containers). Users can drop multimedia files into the containers and pick files from them by touching the icons with their mobile terminals. The icons are placed on, or near, the physical objects the files are related to. RFID tags are placed behind the icons and they store metadata information about the files available in the corresponding containers. When users bring their terminals near the icons, the terminals' RFID readers communicate with the tags, read the contents of a container from the tag and possibly write information about new files. The actual files are stored in a server, but the user experiences the files to be in the containers. The main contributions of this work are a general application for storing multimedia content in nearly any place or everyday object and a fully functional prototype built using only commercial off-the-self technology.},

A two-layer policy model is used to mapping users and operators' higher level goals into network level objectives. The autonomic reconfiguration procedures for policy creation, storage, evaluation are also presented in detail.

Services are grouped into virtual communities for secure access. Service cooperation through external orchestration can only be done within a virtual community. Services can be activated/deactivated by a device management service running on their host devices. Real-time resource utilization of services for virtual community applications is monitored.

abstract = {Modern cameras are powerful devices that can interoperate using international standards with other sensors that can capture the context of each picture taken. Future cameras are expected to integrate such sensors within them. The contextual parameters captured can be interpreted with the help of semantic maps which are maps that integrate semantic information on them. Semantic maps can be used for understanding and visualization of the picture contents as well as for the management of context and content in picture databases. In this paper, we present a model for the management of semantic image information and the contextual knowledge related to the image capture along with a system implementation that manages and exploits this knowledge. Digital picture contents in the database can be interrelated with, and understood based on, contextual semantic geospatial information that the system manages. We describe the integrated camera system, the calculation and visualization of the contextual parameters, and the management of the semantics of the spatial objects. Finally, we present the implementation of SPIM, a SPatial Image Management system that exploits semantic contextual knowledge, its retrieval functionality and the visual user interfaces.},

abstract = {Today's high-end mobile phones commonly include one or two digital cameras. These devices, also known as cameraphones, allow their owners to take photographs anywhere, at any time with practically no cost. As a result, many urban dwellers are photographed everyday without even being aware of it. Although in many countries, legislation recognises the right of people to veto the dissemination of their image, snapshots including recognisable passers-by often end up on photo-sharing websites. In this paper, we present a cooperative system for cameraphones which automatically anonymises faces of people photographed involuntarily. Our system, called BlurMe, uses Bluetooth awareness to inform a photographer's cameraphone when people around this photographer do not wish for their picture being taken. It then identifies subjects on the photograph and anonymises other people's faces. BlurMe was tested on 876 face regions detected on 150 real-life photographs collected from a photo-sharing website and manually labelled for subject faces. The system achieved very promising results on photographs with up to three subjects.},

We develop a simulation model that forecasts the probability of letter location recall by non-expert users and thereby models learning, as the user acquires expertise in recalling, with practice, session after session. We then plugin this probability within a model of visual strategy that combines the effect of different ways visual exploration: non-expert users search for a letter while expert users select a letter.

abstract = {Personal media content is increasingly accessed by mobile devices and services. Small handheld devices may give access to thousands of personal media items such as photos, music and messages, but managing the vast amount of content on a small device with a limited user interface (UI) is becoming tedious. Searching content with metadata -- that is, descriptive data about the content -- facilitates locating of particular piece of content. However, in addition to rapidly increasing amount of content, the amount and extent of types of metadata attached to each content object is also growing. Thus, metadata management itself is becoming a burdensome task. We present our study on how to improve metadata management and make it motivating on mobile devices. We conducted 26 interviews and two workshops with users to study users' needs and design requirements for metadata management. As a main result, we present UI design guidelines for personal content related metadata management on mobile devices.},

abstract = {Systems that are extended across multiple media, e.g., a mobile device and a desktop computer, are becoming increasingly popular. One reason for this is their ability to provide pervasive support for human activities across a range of contextual settings. Despite the value that these cross media systems offer, there are aspects that detract from their efficient utilization. This article reports the findings from an empirical case study exploring the adoption and use of a cross media fitness system. The system's general fit with the ways users carry out their activities is a central determinant of utilization. However, the adoption and use of a cross media system is also essentially influenced through the user experience process. This article describes distinct system characteristics that were found to influence coherent user experience. Based on these findings, we propose design responses that address a systemic out of box experience, crossmedial referencing and explication of a holistic system image. This study provides new insight into how users interact with and perceive cross media systems and identifies distinct focus areas for future research and design of heterogeneous and pervasive information technology.},

Our performance analysis is based on the Peer-to-Peer Protocol (P2PP), which is a peer protocol candidate for the Peer-to-Peer Session Initiation Protocol (P2PSIP). We use both, live-network measurements and simulations, to evaluate two performance metrics: resource lookup success rate and mobile battery duration. While lookup success rate measures P2PP performance in general, battery duration is crucial for mobile use of P2PP. Restricted battery life limits the feasibility of mobile peers. We reveal the tradeoff between lookup success rate and battery duration. Based on the findings it is possible to find more suitable protocol parameters for mobile peers. The battery duration measurements, made with UDP in UMTS and WLAN access networks, are also applicable in the wireless usage of other application-layer protocols.},

In this paper we empirically evaluate the use of fixed WiMAX to backhaul data from an environmental monitoring application. We find that aggregating sensor readings is crucial for taking full advantage of the WiMAX backhaul. We consider application-layer aggregation for scenarios where sensor communication is programmable or at least configurable. For scenarios where sensors cannot be modified, we consider network-layer aggregation using a performance enhancing proxy. Finally, we consider the case where application- and network-layer aggregation are combined. Our results show that without aggregation, goodput is only a small fraction of the maximum achieved in our testbed. Furthermore, we examine the effect of different modulation schemes on performance and quantify in practice the number of wireless sensor nodes that could be served with different modulation and data aggregation combinations.},

Bearing in mind that perceived voice quality is sensitive mostly to delay variation (also called jitter), we work on bounding that value for providing a better voice Quality of Service over Wireless LAN (WLAN). For mobility we use a hybrid SIP-MIP stack. The basic idea is to combine the strengths of MIP for doing fast handovers and the strengths of SIP for powerful session adaptation capabilities. Numerical calculation figures as well as real implementation results are provided. It can be observed that the session update cycle during mobility can be modified in such a way that session delay variation bounds achieved are quite low and there are almost no spikes. We use composite performance metrics that we defined in previous work to analyze the correlation between the data patterns for session signaling delay in the classical case and our proposed case to better highlight the achieved performance delta.},

Previous research on this topic has focused on transferring a particular stream or set of related streams at the sessions layer for live broadcasting or conferencing sessions. We argue that in the realm of service oriented architectures, such as telecom operator networks, this approach does not take full advantage of the particular case of media playback. Our mechanism presents an alternative to the traditional approach, which i) Lowers network control plane overhead, thus reducing chances of presentation consistency loss ii) Lowers network data overhead due to lesser need for transcoding iii) Delegates presentation consistency issues, such as inter-media synchronisation, to the media player iv) Dynamically adapts the presentation to the new target devices without transcoding. Finally, we present experimental results which show that our approach is implementable in acceptable time bounds.},

Indeed, organizations are increasingly dependent on assemblages of embedded, mobile, and stationary technologies that innovate business propositions and increase customer value. This talk will focus on the nature and role of architectural knowledge in implementation and use of ubiquitous computing environments. In particular, four dimensions of architectural knowledge will be identified:• Technology capability awareness refers to actors' perception of the service capability of a specific IT component.• Use context sensitivity refers to the understanding of work contexts in which a specific IT component is typically deployed.• Business model understanding refers to the appreciation of business opportunities afforded by applications of a specific IT component.• Boundary-spanning competence refers to practical skills and resources for engaging in collective efforts to develop architectural knowledge.Drawing on the four dimensions of architectural knowledge, the talk will outline theoretical and strategy implications for development of computing environments capable of serving the goals of heterogeneous actors and technologies. A first implication concerns why different types of architectural configurations promote and/or undermine individual actors' ability to control ubiquitous computing innovation. A second implication concerns how creation of trading zones may allow for actors to meet and negotiate alignment of technologies.},
