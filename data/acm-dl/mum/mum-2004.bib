abstract = {We present bYOB (Build Your Own Bag), a flexible, computationally enhanced modular textile system from which to construct smart fabric objects. bYOB was motivated by a desire to transform everyday surfaces into ambient displays for information and to make building with fabric as easy as playing with Lego blocks. In the realm of personal architecture, bYOB is an interactive material that encourages users to explore and experiment by creating new objects to seamlessly integrate into their lives. The physical configuration of the object mediates its computational behavior. Therefore, an object built out of the system of modular elements understands its geometry and responds appropriately without any end-user programming. Our current prototype is a bag built out of the system that understands it is a bag when the handle is attached to the mesh of modules, responds by illuminating its fabric and inner contents when the sun goes down (Fig 1), communicates the presence of objects placed in the bag, and interacts with the user via speech. We describe how bYOB contributes to and differs from existing work in modular based systems and fabric interfaces. We discuss our development process in respect to physical, electronic, and conceptual design. We also describe salient features and future applications enabled by this new construction kit.},

abstract = {Finding one's way around an unfamiliar city can be a major challenge. While maps can provide a very good abstract representation of our world, and a simple and efficient way to navigate within that world, they are of little use when, for example, the absence of road signs prevents us from locating where we are on the map. Mobile devices offer the potential for providing relevant 3D information to enable us to locate ourselves, rapidly navigate around an unfamiliar environment and explore it interactively. However, mobile devices are constrained by resources such as bandwidth, storage and small displays. In this paper we investigate which is the most important visual information for position location within an unfamiliar urban environment and show how we can use this knowledge to provide a perceptually high quality 3D virtual environment on existing mobile devices.},

abstract = {The combination of photo annotation tasks and with instant messaging fun offers great potentials to both end-users and researchers. In this paper, we first describe our prototype system that allows users to share and annotate digital photos over the Internet while they are chatting online. In addition to manual annotation, our system can extract information from conversations to generate extra annotations. The advantage of using our system is that the boring and tedious task of annotating photos is turned into an essential part of an attractive fun activity, viz. online chatting. Extracting meaningful information from instant messages is challenged by abbreviations, pronouns, jargon, ellipsis, grammatical errors, ambiguities and asynchrony, all of which frequently appear in message conversations. In the paper we provide a roadmap, i.e. a systematic analysis of linguistic aspects of automated interpretation of message conversations.},

Image browsers are among popular software applications on small devices. The limitations introduced by these devices such as screen resolution, processing power and storage impose a challenge for multimedia applications designed for larger displays to adapt to small screens. For an image browser, layout of images and navigation between them are critical factors of the users' experience.Motivated by these challenges, we developed Pocket PhotoMesa: an image browser for the pocket pc that employs quantum strip Treemaps for laying out images and Zoomable User Interfaces for navigation. In this paper, we discuss the development of Pocket PhotoMesa and we describe a usability study comparing the performance and users' experience using Pocket PhotoMesa and ACDSee image browser (a current commercial offering) for the Pocket PC.},

abstract = {Accelerometer based gesture control is proposed as a complementary interaction modality for handheld devices. Predetermined gesture commands or freely trainable by the user can be used for controlling functions also in other devices. To support versatility of gesture commands in various types of personal device applications gestures should be customisable, easy and quick to train. In this paper we experiment with a procedure for training/recognizing customised accelerometer based gestures with minimum amount of user effort in training. Discrete Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are applied. Recognition results are presented for an external device, a DVD player gesture commands. A procedure based on adding noise-distorted signal duplicates to training set is applied and it is shown to increase the recognition accuracy while decreasing user effort in training. For a set of eight gestures, each trained with two original gestures and with two Gaussian noise-distorted duplicates, the average recognition accuracy was 97%, and with two original gestures and with four noise-distorted duplicates, the average recognition accuracy was 98%, cross-validated from a total data set of 240 gestures. Use of procedure facilitates quick and effortless customisation in accelerometer based interaction.},

abstract = {The GapiDraw platform supports the creation of high-performance graphical applications across a variety of handheld hardware configurations, including Palm, Symbian and Windows Mobile devices. Handheld computers makes it possible to create applications and services not possible with stationary computers, thus there is a need for a high performance development platform for rapid prototyping on mobile devices. Unlike desktop computers there has not yet evolved a single standard for graphics on handheld devices. Typically, handheld computers only provide direct frame buffer access, and there are major differences in implementation details across different hardware configurations, making it difficult to use mobile devices for prototyping. Using GapiDraw, developers can re-use the same code across a variety of devices and do not have to focus on device-specific implementation details. GapiDraw is actively used as an enabler platform in numerous research labs, and has also been used in over one hundred commercial games. We give an overview of the platform, and highlight some new mobile application concepts made possible through the use of GapiDraw.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous computing embeds computer technology in our everyday environment, providing a human with information services and applications through any device over different kinds of networks. Ubiquitous computing can be seen as a prerequisite for pervasive computing that emphasizes mobile data access and the mechanisms needed for supporting a community of nomadic users. Ubiquitous software is the software required in ubiquitous computing environments. This paper surveys the challenges and state-of-the-art software technologies applicable to ubiquitous computing environments. Ubiquitous wireless world systems trigger a set of requirements, e.g. interoperability, adaptability and mobility, for ubiquitous system and software technologies. The main challenges of ubiquitous software are a uniform and adaptive middleware technology, iteroperability of services and networks, and the enabling technologies required in their development. Futhermore guaranteeing secure transactions between service providers, content providers and users is essential in worldwide pervasive computing environments. Although standards, reference architectures and generic software technologies provide the basis for future ubiquitous software development, new kinds of micro architectures and software technologies, and development methods are needed.},

This paper presents a context-aware policy mechanism and related end-to-end evaluation algorithm for adaptive connectivity management of multi-access wireless networks. A policy is used to express the criteria for adaptive selection of the best local and remote network interfaces. The best connection can then be used for the establishment of a channel as well as the maintenance of on-going data transmission. Rich context information is considered in the policy representation with respect to user profile and preference, application characteristics, device capability, and network QoS condition. The decision of the best access networks to be used is made on the basis of an end-to-end evaluation process. The decision can be made in both Master-Slave and Peer-to-Peer modes. The paper focuses on the methods for policy representation and connection evaluation algorithm. A case study is presented to show the usability of the proposed policy mechanism and decision-making algorithm in the adaptive management of heterogeneous networking resources.},

The results indicate that AIM is the most popular and used service, more than IM&amp;L, with lower use of Chat. The interviews showed that young adults are interested in immediate stimulations and therefore use AIM, which could lead them to face-to-face meetings. In addition, IM&amp;L is limited to one carrier and hence is less attractive. Lastly, young adults using this service are more interested in sharing their location than in their privacy.},

The proposed scheme consists of two processes, one is to correct geometric distortion of the captured image, and the other is to detect watermark information from the rectified image. We also propose a new watermarking algorithm which is robust against small geometric distortion and suitable for the proposed scheme. Moreover, we introduce a quantitative evaluation method for indicating detection reliability, which is indispensable for RSIS service.Finally, we show that the proposed scheme enables users to detect embedded information in approximately one second, even when implemented as a Java application on a cell phone with limited resources, and report experiments that confirm the proposed scheme's efficiency.},

A picture captured by a camera is the result of applying a projective transformation combining rotation, scaling, and tilting to the original picture, The picture must be subjected to an inverse projective transformation prior to reading the watermark in order to return it to the same geometric form as the original picture. This inverse transformation requires transformation parameters, and the corners of the picture outline can be used as feature points for determining these parameters. In this paper, we propose a Side Trace Algorithm (STA) that reduces the processing time required to find corners of the picture less than 1/100 that when using the Hough transform and the conventional pattern matching, and present results of its implementation.},

abstract = {This paper makes the case that much of the promise of ubiquitous multimedia depends on the availability of valued material. In business and academic environments the "presentation in a lecture room with laptop graphics" is a common way of communicating, but making a presentation readily available outside of the room is still a challenge because of the complexities of capturing and distributing the material. The AutoAuditorium™ System creates a multi-camera video program of a lecture in real time, without any human control beyond turning the system on and off. The system reduces the opportunity costs of making such a program to the point that it gets used for events previously not seen as candidates for video. Thus an event does not need nearly as many viewers to be considered worth capturing and many more events are seen by many more people.This paper presents a quick overview of the AutoAuditorium System technology and operational characteristics, a history of it's ancestry, development and use, and some usage experiences that demonstrate its current utility and future potential.The AutoAuditorium System is an example of an "intelligent and aware environment." In particular, it is:intelligent - about creating multi-camera television programs of lectures, in real time, with one or more people on a stage using projected visuals.aware - of the motion and gesturing of the people on stage.- of changes in the projected visuals.Originally created in the early- and mid-1990s as a research project [1] at Bellcore (Bell Communications Research, now Telcordia Technologies), it has been available as a commercial product from Foveal Systems since 1999.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel video coding profile for the multimedia applications oriented for mobile wireless communication. Because mobile devices generally have limited computational capability and constrained power consumption, we have considered jointly both video coding efficiency and implementation feasibility when developing the proposed video coding scheme. We achieve a good trade-off between coding efficiency and complexity by minimizing the video reconstruction distortion caused by adopting reduced complexity algorithms. A number of experiments have been conducted and the results have shown the efficiency of the proposed profile. A demo implemented on the Nokia 6600 cell phone demonstrates the feasibility of video coding scheme for mobile devices in wireless communication applications.},

In this paper, Context Studio is further developed for the end users of small-screen mobile devices. Navigating and information presentation are designed for small screens, especially for the Series 60 mobile phone user interface. Context ontology, with an enhanced vocabulary model, is utilized to offer scalable representation and easy navigation of context and action information in the UI. The ontology vocabulary hierarchy is transformed into a folder-file model representation in the graphical user interface. UI elements can be directly updated, according to the extensions and modifications to ontology vocabularies, automatically in an online system. A rule model is utilized to allow systematic management and presentation of context-action rules in the user interface. The chosen ontology-based UI model is evaluated with a usability study.},

abstract = {Personal experience computing is about computing support for recording, storing, retrieving, editing, analyzing, and sharing of personal experiences. In this paper, we present our design, implementation and evaluation of a mobile authoring tool called mProducer. mProducer enables a user to generate personal experience content using a mobile device anytime, anywhere. To address challenges in both limited system resources and user interface constraints on a mobile device, mProducer provides several innovative system techniques and UI designs. (1) The Storage Constrained Uploading (SCU) algorithm uploads large multimedia data to remote servers, in order to alleviate the problem of limited storage on a mobile device. (2) Sensor-Assisted Automated Editing utilizes a tilt sensor on the mobile device to automate the detection and removal of blurry frames resulting from excessive amount of camera shaking. This sensor-based solution requires small processing overhead, and it is considered a good alternative to computational-expensive image processing techniques for detecting shaking artifacts. (3) Map-based content management interface incorporates a GPS receiver on a mobile device to record location meta-data for each recording captured by a user, and enables easy, intuitive content navigation on a small screen. (4) Keyframe-based editing enables a user to edit content using only keyframes. We have conducted user studies to evaluate overall editing experience, user satisfaction in the editing quality, task performance time, ease-of-use, and learnability. The results of user studies have shown that keyframe-based editing works best with a storyboard interface. In general, users have found mProducer to be both fun and easy to use on a mobile device.},

However, these services impose high data rate requirements on the wireless link, which can not necessarily be satisfied with the current mobile phone networks.

This paper presents a case study demonstrating complementary distribution of static and dynamic multimedia content with Bluetooth equipped WPAN service points, a wireless local area network and mobile phone networks.

To detect location information in a loosely coupled network environment is the most challenging aspect using IP's flat address model. Our conceptual view of the system architecture shows how the service can be provided extending DHCP, XML with existing core technology.

Ubiquitous mobile communication devices such as media capable handsets and PDAs have made the problem even larger.Technical approaches to controlling illegal distribution--- commonly known as Digital Rights Management (DRM)---have been varied and inconsistent since the shift from analogue media to digital media; but in recent years, the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) has made huge contributions to the efforts to standardize the DRM effort, especially as it pertains to the sharing of media using mobile devices. The OMA has released DRM Enabler Release 1.0 and 2.0 DRM 1.0 was a first attempt to apply control to digital media and DRM 2.0 is a more sophisticated continuation of 1.0, allowing the owners of digital assets to control their use while attempting to provide the end user with the perceived rights and privileges acquired over the evolution of digital media. While challenges lay ahead for the developers of DRM, OMA DRM is a move toward better standardized control of digital media.},

abstract = {A Mobile Ad Hoc Network is typically characterized by two sets of nodes, one set being more stationary than the other. It is observed that identifying this set of relatively stationary nodes critically facilitates the dual purpose of reducing the routing overhead and providing larger data bandwidth. It is therefore both interesting and expedient to study the behavior of a typical Mobile Ad Hoc Network and identify the sub-graph which can impact these improvements where the application demands are high. It is particularly enlightening when scaled to a larger network, as one of the substantial factors affecting cost in an Ad Hoc network is the routing overhead. In this paper, a method is proposed to determine, dynamically, the most reliable path for routing in a Mobile Ad Hoc scenario and ensure that packets are routed along that path to guarantee enhanced data traffic routed per unit time owing to savings from route-discovery and to decrease normalized routing overhead. The Mobile Ad Hoc Network is modeled as a graph with the mobile units denoting the nodes of the graph and the set of reachable units as its neighbors and identifying the weakly connected sub-dominion of that graph, which is the most reliable path for routing. The proposed algorithm recognizes those set of weakly connected nodes which are relatively more stable when compared to the other nodes hence requiring less routing and thus resulting in more number of data packets and ensuring better bandwidth utilization. Our algorithm proposes and confirms the dual betterments namely improvement in the utilization of bandwidth and reduction in the normalized routing overhead in any given network scenario.},

abstract = {In context-aware pervasive networking (Capnet) environments the user interface of a service application has to be adapted to whatever type of a device the user is using, taking into account the situation at hand, i.e. the user's current context, as well as user's personal preferences. In addition, new and more natural interaction styles have to be provided for the user. When designing and implementing user interfaces, or generating them automatically at runtime, some a priori knowledge of the capabilities of user's device and her personal preferences are required. Furthermore, runtime adaptation calls for mechanisms for recognizing context and delivering it. This paper presents the support that could be provided in middleware level for implementing context-aware multimodal user interfaces and the Capnet middleware user interface architecture model for providing that support. Adaptation algorithms are not discussed. The Capnet middleware backbone provides support for context-awareness via context recognition and automatic delivery of context data through a notification mechanism. For multimodal input and output third party components are required. The proposed architecture model is partly implemented and tested with software prototypes.},

We further compress those clustered photos by a MPEG-like algorithm with variable IBP frames and adaptive search windows.

abstract = {Within the expanding paradigm of medical imaging and wireless communications there is increasing demand for transmitting diagnostic medical imagery over error-prone wireless communication channels such as those encountered in cellular phone technology. Medical images must be compressed with minimal file size to minimize transmission time and robustly coded to withstand these wireless environments. It has been reinforced through extensive research that the most crucial regions of medical images must not be degraded and compressed by a lossless or near lossless algorithm. This type of area is called the Region of Interest (ROI). Conversely, the Region of Backgrounds (ROB) may be compressed with some loss of information to achieve a higher compression level. This type of hybrid coding scheme is most useful for wireless communication where the 'bit-budget' is devoted to the ROI. This paper also develops a way for this system to operate externally to the Joint Picture Experts Group (JPEG) still image compression standard without the use of hybrid coding. A multiple watermarking technique is developed to verify the integrity of the ROI after transmission and in the situation where there may be incidental degradation that is hard to perceive or unexpected levels of compression that may degrade ROI content beyond an acceptable level. The most useful contribution in this work is assurance of ROI image content integrity after image files are subject to incidental degradation in these environments. This is made possible with extraction of DCT signature coefficients from the ROI and embedding multiply in the ROB. Strong focus is placed on the robustness to JPEG compression and the mobile channel as well as minimizing the image file size while maintaining its integrity with the use of semi-fragile, robust watermarking.},

abstract = {We present a conceptual mediation framework that features three layers of mediators: presence, integration, and homogenization layers that work together in a peer-to-peer (p2p) manner to facilitate the delivery of multimedia data. On arrival of each request for data from a client, a global-mediator is elected from a group of integration layer mediators to service that request. Using distributed hash table (DHT), the global-mediator dispatches the request to other integrator mediators to track down the data sources. Upon receipt of the results, from the source(s), the global-mediator presents the data to the client via a presence-mediator. The presence-mediator may need to reformat the data to suit the execution context of the client. This mediation process is context-aware, adaptive and dynamically structured. Quality of service (QoS) factors are taken into consideration in the retrieval and presentation of data.},

abstract = {The Task Computing framework is designed to operate in dynamic ubiquitous environments in which a mobile computing user dynamically discovers the current set of available semantically defined services. Task Computing allows the end-user to easily and seamlessly integrate and manipulate services found on their own computer, the nearby devices and relevant remote web services. The user can create, execute and monitor complex tasks resulting from compositions of these services. In this paper, how Task Computing addresses some issues in mobile and ubiquitous multimedia applications and some of the multimedia related semantic services currently implemented in this framework are described.},
