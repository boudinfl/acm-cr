abstract = {We present PhoneGuide -- an enhanced museum guidance system that uses camera-equipped mobile phones and on-device object recognition.Our main technical achievement is a simple and light-weight object recognition approach that is realized with single-layer perceptron neuronal networks. In contrast to related systems which perform computationally intensive image processing tasks on remote servers, our intention is to carry out all computations directly on the phone. This ensures little or even no network traffic and consequently decreases cost for online times. Our laboratory experiments and field surveys have shown that photographed museum exhibits can be recognized with a probability of over 90%.We have evaluated different feature sets to optimize the recognition rate and performance. Our experiments revealed that normalized color features are most effective for our method. Choosing such a feature set allows recognizing an object below one second on up-to-date phones. The amount of data that is required for differentiating 50 objects from multiple perspectives is less than 6KBytes.},

abstract = {In the future ubiquitous computing living environment, humans will interact with computers (knowingly or unknowingly) any where by various means other than through the traditional desktop interface (e.g. keyboard and mouse). Interacting with a "smart" table could very well be one such probable scenario. In this paper, we outline and classify various possible techniques for interacting with the smart table under reasonable assumptions about the operating environment. We considered the primitive tasks of object selection, object manipulation and menu control. The classification should serve as a basis for experimenting, designing, selecting, composing and implementing a specific interaction technique for a given task to achieve high usability.},

Simulation results show that it significantly outperforms the existing go-back-N ARQ scheme, particularly for links with high bit error rate. We also explore that without adapting window size at high bit error rate, the proposed scheme provides a significant improvement in the throughput over a range of bit error rates including high bit error rate. The proposed ARQ scheme is a good compromise between the go-back-N ARQ and the ideal selective repeat ARQ in throughput performance and receiver buffer size. Therefore, it would be applied on IrDA links for achieving high throughput at high error rate.},

SIMPLE enables a wireless enabled PDA or in the future a cellular phone with WLAN functionality to download a wireless database and map and determine their location based on received signal strength indicator (RSSI) information. A number of techniques have been combined within SIMPLE to enable the PDA to function as an autonomous device with minimal interaction to the service provider infrastructure.

abstract = {We present a non-photorealistic algorithm for retargeting large images to small size displays, particularly on mobile devices. This method adapts large images so that important objects in the image are still recognizable when displayed at a lower target resolution. Existing image manipulation techniques such as cropping works well for images containing a single important object, and down-sampling works well for images containing low frequency information. However, when these techniques are automatically applied to images with multiple objects, the image quality degrades and important information may be lost. Our algorithm addresses the case of multiple important objects in an image. The retargeting algorithm segments an image into regions, identifies important regions, removes them, fills the resulting gaps, resizes the remaining image, and re-inserts the important regions. Our approach lies in constructing a topologically constrained epitome of an image based on a visual attention model that is both comprehensible and size varying, making the method suitable for display-critical applications.},

The direction is used as the scroll direction in the application, and the magnitude is used to set the zoom level. The camera is treated as a pointing device and zoom level control in applications. Our approach generates mouse events, so any application that is mouse-driven can make use of this technique.

Game completion times together with the resultant user experience for each of the games was collected during the studies. Results indicate that the joystick control provided the fastest completion times for each game, but with the lowest levels of user engagement. The Tilt interface, although perceived as challenging by the participants, provided the greatest level of user involvement, independent of game complexity. The design of appropriate human interfaces which go beyond the standard phone keypad is suggested. The selection and design of these interfaces should also consider the intended user experience for the game.},

The algorithm must be lightweight so it can be efficiently embedded and run fast enough to produce smooth seamless translation. Our solution includes a multi-resolution scheme which searches the match from coarse to fine; and optimization of the search space. As a demonstration, we implemented the algorithm on the Symbian based Nokia 3650/6600 camera phone, and explored several interesting applications, including using camera motion for browsing documents and as a pointing device. A cross-platform implementation is also discussed.},

The creation of high-fidelity 3D maps on mobile devices to aid navigation in urban environments is computationally very expensive, precluding achieving this quality at interactive rates. In this paper we present a case study to show how the human visual system may be exploited, when viewers are undertaking a task, to reduce the overall quality of the displayed image, without the users being aware of this reduction in quality. The displayed images are selectively rendered with the key features used to identify location and orientation in a 3D urban environment produced in high quality and the remainder of the image in low quality.},

abstract = {The functionality of an information kiosk can be extended by allowing it to interact with a smartphone, as demonstrated by the Kimono system, and the user interface can be greatly simplified by "associations" between pieces of information. A kiosk provides information that is relevant to a particular location and can use valuable context information, such as the fact that a user is physically standing in front of the kiosk, to tailor the display. Its graphically rich screen is suitable for presenting information to the user and has a natural input modality requiring the user to simply touch the screen. However, a kiosk lacks mobility and cannot stay with the user as he or she moves about the environment. Also, information provided by the kiosk must be remembered by the user. Finally, it is difficult to add information to the kiosk, and so the kiosk remains an information display device.All this changes when a handset, such as a PDA or smart-phone, can interact with the kiosk. The handset acts like a personalized proxy of the kiosk. It accompanies the user serving as a memory device. It is also an excellent media creation device, capable of taking pictures and recording voice memos as well as short text messages. Associating newly created content with other currently selected content makes for a simpler user interface. Content and its associations can be uploaded to a kiosk allowing others to access to it.},

abstract = {Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (MBMS) is currently being standardized by the 3GPP. The MBMS services will enable new class of applications with efficient use of spectrum. MBMS also poses a new set of requirements on video coding and delivery. In this paper we present a short overview of MBMS and a video codec designed for MBMS. The proposed video codec addresses the two key issues in video delivery over MBMS: 1) error resilience and 2) resource adaptive playback. We show that the proposed codec is simple to implement on low-resource terminals such as mobile phones and outperforms MPEG-4 SP coding under lossy conditions.},

abstract = {In this paper, a middleware architecture allowing the transparent mobility among two different wireless networks is presented. The proposed scheme is basically based on adaptively maintaining the access to the communication channel for a mobile client enabled with GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) and Bluetooth interfaces. In particular, both the GPRS and the Bluetooth connections are automatically established by means of an RFID tag. To validate this architecture, a preliminary field trial have been set up pointing out the effectiveness of the proposed approach in supporting seamless handover procedures within a heterogeneous network.},
