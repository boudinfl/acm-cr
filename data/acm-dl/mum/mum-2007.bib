abstract = {In this paper, a proof-of-concept and a software architecture, M4 (MultiMedia Mobility Manager), is presented. In short, M4 is offering seamless mobility management to multimedia applications using a variety of wireless access networks. First, M4 is built on multihomed Mobile IP building on the principle of soft handovers. Second, network selection in M4 is based on a network layer metric combining round-trip times and jitter in round-trip times. Third, the end-user can enter its own preferences on network selection through a policy-based extension to the proposed network selection algorithm.The proposed architecture is evaluated in a live heterogeneous networking environment where handover performance is studied in detail. In addition, user-perceived quality of experience for Voice over IP using the M4 software architecture has been studied. Last, downloads of large amount of data using a combination of high and low capacity wireless networks in M4 were studied.Results indicate that the architecture as a whole and the proposed algorithms perform well. M4 can thus be seen as an implementation of the "Always Best Connected" vision.},

abstract = {Within the vision of ubiquitous multimedia, using multimedia sensor nodes, such as audio, image, and video sensor nodes, in wireless sensor networks can dramatically enhance the capability of sensor networks for event description. Different kinds of holes can easily appear in sensor networks. For example, tens of sensor nodes can consist of a hole in a small area because of overload. Efficiently and reliably transmit these multimedia streaming data back to the base station while bypassing these static or dynamic holes is one of the key challenge issues. In this paper, we propose a new Two Phase geographical Greedy Forwarding (TPGF) routing algorithm for exploring one or multiple optimized hole-bypassing transmission paths. We demonstrate the execution of TPGF routing algorithm by using our implemented simulator NetTopo. Comparison and simulation results show that our algorithm can effectively solve the identified problems and is better than the famous GPSR routing algorithm in both functionality and performance aspects.},

abstract = {The technology of multimedia content adaptation based upon the location of a target device can become the long expected killer application of ubiquitous computing. Easy to develop, lightweight, and robust location estimation is the core component of this technology. Until now, location estimation technology remains restricted to highly sophisticated hardware and networking infrastructure where semantics of the location information are defined and controlled by service providers. We aim to lower the technical and infrastructure barriers to allow general users to define and develop the semantically meaningful location systems. This paper presents a simple location estimation method to build radio beacon based location systems in the indoor environments. It employs an realtime learning approach which requires zero prior knowledge. The salient features of our method are low memory requirements and simple computations which make it desirable for location-aware multimedia systems functioning in distributed client-server settings as well as privacy sensitive applications residing on stand alone devices.},

abstract = {This paper studies Internet protocols and services which is currently server based and which show good potential to be distributed to client terminals. Server based services require installation, operation and maintenance. A finite upper limit on the number of servers leads to potential performance bottlenecks. There are environments and situations in which server infrastructure is not available. Client-only based services enable terminal manufacturers to deploy new services fast and flexibly to the customers without depending on the operator server infrastructure investments.As research material we use Internet trace statistics, Sourceforge application categories and popularity, available popularity rankings of Internet services and a literature study of distributed services. The methodology employed is to model the network as a single-hop adhoc WLAN network, which has only terminal clients of equal capabilities and which does not have any external connectivity to the public Internet or any other infrastructure network. The services which technically work in this adhoc WLAN environment can also be extended to the public Internet by taking the advantage of peer-to-peer or other overlay networks. The services are evaluated based on their use case, if there are alternative solutions providing the same service, and according to the technical feasibility in mobile devices.For each selected potential distributed service solution the requirements are defined and the related research problem is stated. If a known solution exists, it is described and evaluated. The common building blocks needed for the service distribution are described based on the service solutions of the selected services. Finally, the main gaps on the path towards fully distributed service provisioning are identified.},

abstract = {IP Telephony is a potential killer application among the various multimedia applications and services. It is therefore natural to expect support for these services over new network architectures like wireless ad-hoc networks. Despite the proliferation of IP Telephony services in the Internet, the traditional client/server models that have been used are found to be highly inefficient for wireless ad-hoc networks as compared to peer-to-peer (P2P) models. On the other hand, P2P strategies require some tuning to work well in wireless ad-hoc networks. In this paper, we discuss some undesirable situation that may happen if P2P systems are deployed over wireless ad-hoc networks without adaptation. We then define our strategies for positioning Super Nodes in the physical network underlay as well as P2P ID space according to the constraints of these network technologies. We evaluate the efficiency of our approche in reducing the session establishment time and request failure rate as two important criteria for the performance of IP telephony systems},

The evaluation was carried out with 15 volunteer test users. Each of them used the application for 6 to 8 days, doing some physical exercise during that period. During the exercise, the users would wear a sports computer and a heart rate meter that communicated with the application in the phone. After the testing period, the users answered a questionnaire about their experiences. The users appreciated the application's basic idea, although the instability of the application deteriorated the quality of the user experience. Moreover, persons who had used similar wireless devices or applications before found the application more usable than those who had little experience of such technology.},

The results indicate that the facet-based zooming approach scales well to various display sizes.},

A user activates multimedia content by touching an RFID tag. This action configures the mobile phone as a remote control for the multimedia content. The user sends commands such as play, pause and stop, using the phone's UI. The multimedia content is shown on a wall display. This approach has several benefits: a common and easy-to-use user interface, off-the-self components, and lightweight implementation. We have not created any new technology, but our system makes use of widely used ones.

This display called CityWall was set up in a city center with the goal of showing information of events happening in the city. We observed two user groups who used mobile phones with upload capability during two large-scale events happening in the city. Our findings are that this kind of combined use of personal mobile devices and a large public display as a publishing forum, used collaboratively with other users, creates a unique setting that extends the group's feeling of participation in the events. We substantiate this claim with examples from user data.},

abstract = {Mobile devices, also known as small-form-factor (SFF) devices such as mobile phones, PDAs and ultra mobile PCs have continued to grow in popularity. Improvements in SFF hardware has enabled a range of suitable applications such as gaming, interactive visualisation and mobile mapping. Although high-fidelity graphic systems typically have significant computational requirements, the time taken may be largely resolution dependent. The limited resolution of SFFs indicates such platforms are prime candidates for running high-fidelity graphics.Due to the limited hardware available on mobile devices, it is not currently possible to produce high-fidelity graphics in reasonable time. However, most SFFs have some degree of network capability. Using a remote server in conjunction with a mobile device to render high-fidelity graphics on demand allows us to substantially reduce the total rendering time. This paper introduces a client-server framework for minimising rendering times using a cost function to predict optimal distribution of rendering.},

abstract = {We describe a lightweight augmented reality approach enabling arbitrarily complex virtual models to be operated even on low end camera phones. For optimal performance we apply simple motion tracking with manual initialization, and sequences of 2D images to give illusion of three dimensions. Our approach enables also augmenting of real objects, not just virtual ones. A prototype implementation of the solution exists for Series 60/Symbian OS mobile phones. Augmented interior design is presented as the main application example.},

abstract = {User centric personalization plays an important role for the adoption of proactive applications. However, stipulating system support to facilitate personalization features in proactive applications generically is still an open issue. In this paper we have addressed this particular issue and presented Persona, a tool that enables adding personalization features in proactive applications in a generic manner. A key feature of Persona is portability that allows it to be injected in various pervasive middlewares as a plug-in. Consequently, existing proactive applications can easily be extended with Persona for personalization support. We have discussed the design and implementation rationale behind Persona and shown it's direct implications with two different middlewares and several proactive applications.},

abstract = {Which text presentation format is best to use on a mobile phone? We have evaluated Scrolling, Paging, Leading, and Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) in a balanced repeated-measurement study employing 16 subjects on a mobile phone. Besides monitoring reading speed, comprehension, and task load, we also tracked eye movements while reading. The results show that text presented in the Page format is read significantly faster than both the Scrolling and the RSVP format without any significant differences in comprehension. The Page format was moreover significantly less demanding to use compared to Leading and RSVP for most factors according to NASA-TLX. RSVP was found to significantly decrease eye movements whereas Leading was found to increase them. Leading yielded very irregular eye movements, but this did not affect reading speed. These results show that Paging offers best readability on a mobile phone, an interesting finding given that Scrolling is the format predominantly used today.},
