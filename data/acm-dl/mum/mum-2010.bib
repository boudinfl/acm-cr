abstract = {A Pervasive Learning Space (PLS) uses context-awareness to link a virtual world with real world objects. We define viability as the extent to which a given PLS can be adapted to different purposes, and portability to be the extent to which a given PLS can be transferred to a new physical context. Heroes of Koskenniska is a game-based PLS combining mobile technology and a wireless sensor network in a forest context to raise the environmental awareness in a Biosphere Reserve in Finland. The game was built upon a screen-based architecture, and our analysis shows that it has higher portability and viability than a selection of related PLSs. The screen-based architecture is highly viable and portable because it is based on the model-view-controller division. Our preliminary observations indicate that the game helps to increase visitor count of the area and to promote interaction between visitors and nature.},

To this end, a mobile serious game is realized where the user acquires knowledge about German emblematic gestures and tries them out in role-plays with virtual agents. Gesture performance is evaluated making use of build-in acceleration sensors of smart phones. After an account of the theoretical background covering diverse areas like virtual agents, situated learning and intercultural training, the paper presents the GAME approach along with details on the gesture recognition and content authoring. By its experience-based role-plays with virtual characters, GAME brings together ideas from situated learning and intercultural training in an integrated approach and paves the way for new m-learning concepts.},

abstract = {Cloud computing is a new paradigm for how applications and services are designed, implemented and accessed through Internet. In the cloud, the user can access services and his personal data real-time from any device. There are already services available in the market using cloud computing, such as email, enterprise planning software, and social media services. Still, research on cloud is in its early phase, especially when considering the user experience of mobile cloud services. In this paper, we introduce Image Exchange, a photo sharing Internet service that was designed from the cloud computing perspective. We evaluated Image Exchange through two user studies and the results presented in this paper describe important implications for cloud computing on mobile devices. Furthermore, we found special types of social interactions that emerged within the users of Image Exchange due to its cloud computing nature. The results show that the current design of Image Exchange provides a rather positive user experience, but it could be developed further to fully utilize the benefits of cloud computing.},

Solutions based on optical character recognition provide very limited performance in real-world situations and for complex scripts such as Chinese and Japanese. In this paper, we propose an alternative image translation solution based on crowdsourcing. A large number of human workers on mobile terminals are used to carry out the tasks of image recognition, translation and quality assurance. Compared to purely technical solutions, this human computation approach is also able to account for context and non-textual cues, and provide higher level information to the end-user. In this paper, we describe a preliminary user study to create a model of end-user requirements.},

We hypothesize that the difference in the dynamics between brainstorming and decision-making discussions is significant and measurable using speech activity based nonverbal cues. We employ a set of nonverbal cues to characterize the entire group by the aggregation (both temporal and person-wise) of their nonverbal behavior. Our results on a dataset collected using privacy-sensitive sociometric badges show that the floor-occupation patterns in a brain-storming interaction are different from a decision-making interaction and we can obtain a discrimination accuracy as high as 87.5%.},

Based on the selected combination of parts, the application generates a new playlist of music by seeding a content-based music recommender with examples from the selected genres. In a user study with 40 participants, the prototype was considered to be entertaining and easy to use. The concept inspired users to explore new music and provided faster access to cross-genre playlists than traditional music player applications. In the longer term use, the prototype was slightly too simple and it would have benefited from, e.g., text-based search functionality. Several other interesting ideas for the future development of the concept were also received.},

TWIN is an ad hoc social networking system which offers applications for social presence, mobile multimedia sharing and ad hoc community-based communication. In this paper we present the results of a large-scale user study of TWIN. In this field study, 250 study participants used TWIN for nine weeks. Our aim was to investigate the user experience of social proximity-based ad hoc communication. We found that the users felt TWIN to be more fun and entertaining than a useful tool for achieving pre-defined goals. Furthermore, users appreciated the possibility to find and chat with both familiar and unfamiliar persons nearby. Privacy concerns did not rise as a significant issue in user experience. We argue that a system like TWIN has the potential of becoming a new social enabler in people's everyday lives.},

abstract = {Context plays a critical role in the user experience (UX) of mobile products. In UX studies, context is often seen as a single entity such as mobile context or car context. More fine-grained categorization of contextual factors is needed when we want to understand how context affects user experience. The purpose of our study was to adapt existing context and experience categorizations, and try out in practice how well these are suited for analyzing the user experience of mobile products. We conducted a ten-day field study where 21 participants reported their experiences of personal mobile products by writing experience reports. The reports were analyzed by using eight context categories to identify the contextual factors. Among these factors we determined the triggering context, which has the major influence on the most meaningful user experience described in a report. Our results show that having a detailed categorization for analyzing contextual factors is valuable for understanding how context affects user experience. This becomes practical in identifying the most meaningful user experiences among the reported ones. We propose that triggering context analysis should become a part of user experience studies of mobile products.},

Mobile phones have been used as sensors to obtain location information from users' real lives. Two levels of clustering are used to obtain places of interest. First, user location points are grouped using a time-based clustering technique which discovers stay points while dealing with missing location data. The second level performs clustering on the stay points to obtain stay regions. A grid-based clustering algorithm has been used for this purpose.To obtain more user location points, a client-server system has been installed on the mobile phones, which is able to obtain location information by integrating GPS, Wifi, GSM and accelerometer sensors, among others. An extensive set of experiments have been performed to show the benefits of using the proposed framework, using data from the real life of 8 users over 5 continuous months of natural phone usage.},

Our research showed that although people were mostly well aware of the patterns of their social activity, still the majority of them found the applications interesting enough to view on a daily basis.

In particular, controlling music playback has been used to demonstrate and evaluate gesture recognition algorithms. Previous work, however, used gestures that have been defined based on intuition, the developers' preferences, and the respective algorithm's capabilities. In this paper we propose a refined process for deriving gestures from constant user feedback. Along this process a set of free-hand gestures for controlling music playback is developed. The situational context is analyzed to shape the usage scenario and derive an initial set of necessary functions. In a successive user study the set of functions is validated. Furthermore, proposals for gestures are collected from the participants for each function. Two gesture sets containing static and dynamic gestures are derived and analyzed in a comparative evaluation. The evaluation shows that we developed an appropriate set of free-hand gestures for music playback. Our results indicate that the proposed process, that includes validation of each design decision, improves the final results.},

Mobile Urban Drama is a general concept that has been adapted for out-of-school learning projects by introducing support for solving assignments and producing multimedia-based documentation for learning purposes. Media production is seamlessly supported through a context-aware media management system. The Mobile Urban Drama project, "HasleInteractive", is presented. It supports biology, geography and math lessons for 7th to 9th graders in schools. The story is an environmental thriller that takes place partly on the pupils' mobile phones and partly in the real world - in nature, which must be investigated through exercises. The level of pupil engagement is evaluated through interviews with teachers and pupils, as well as an analysis of pupil productivity and produced media materials during the interactive Mobile Urban Drama experience. It is argued how the out-of-school learning features are successfully supported by the system, and we conclude that the level of productivity and engagement is higher than in usual pupil group work.},

Contrary to earlier methods in visual content sharing between mobile devices and public displays, our concept uses optical capture, making software installations, pairing and data connectivity unnecessary. Furthermore, with our approach the interaction is immediate and intuitive.},

abstract = {Inputting query terms on a mobile terminal is frustrating because of device limitations though mobile web search is becoming popular. Query prediction is a promising approach for mobile search. In the literature, however, little attention has been paid to the first query term, though there are many reports on query expansion or second query recommendation. In this paper, we propose a first query prediction method that enables users to search related information for the current browsed webpage with an easier interface such as touch operation without any background search processes. The proposed method consists of body-text extraction, candidate query term extraction, and a scoring process. We also implemented a one-touch search application that works for Japanese webpages at a practical speed on a smartphone. According to our closed evaluation with 299 webpages and open evaluation with 14 users, our method achieved practical quality.},

abstract = {Rising global energy demand, increasing electricity prices, and the limitation of natural resources has led to increased thoughts on residential energy consumption. A necessary step towards energy conservation is to provide timely and fine-grained consumption information. This allows for users to identify energy saving opportunities and possibly adjust their behavior to conserve energy. In this paper, we present a device-level energy monitoring system that is based on off-the-shelf components and enables users to monitor, control, and compare the electricity consumption of their appliances. By providing a RESTful API, we seamlessly integrate the smart power outlets into the web and facilitate the development of extensions and novel features. We demonstrate this through the implementation of a web user interface and a mobile phone interface. We further confirm the suitability of our approach with the help of a 12 months pilot deployment. The results of a questionnaire provide insights into additional user features and the interviews conducted with developers who used our open sourced system illustrate the usefulness of the RESTful approach for the smart energy domain.},

abstract = {With advanced sensor technologies and tools for content creation, current mobile devices possess features for providing information services based on user's location. There are several services for geographically pinned user-generated content focusing on providing information to users in unfamiliar locations. However, information needs regarding location-based content services in the familiar everyday context have so far been quite little researched. Our research entailed a 12-day user study where nine participants kept a diary, in which they reported needs for annotations of locations they had come across in various day-to-day situations. Based on our results, we present design implications for annotation services, taking into account the user needs in various daily situations. The results show that the services should support flexible controls of the visibility of annotations, notifications about selected annotations within the vicinity, and easy remote annotations. In addition, the system should support collective and living annotations that can be contributed by several users.},

Results of this study indicate that using interactive public displays is inherently a social event, and that services supporting group use and sociality succeed in urban smart spaces.},

abstract = {Through globalization it has become increasingly important to understand how culture affects the user experience (UX) of mobile devices and services. Despite the importance of cultural factors in product design, not much research has been done to study them. Our aim was to discover cultural differences in the UX of a Smartphone with remote online sentence completion method. This paper presents the results of a remote online UX evaluation survey of a Smartphone with altogether 72 respondents from India, China, USA, UK and Denmark. The results indicate that there are cultural differences in how people experience the product and also in the way people respond to UX evaluation survey and share their experiences with the product. The results show that a remote online sentence completion survey is a relatively fast and easy way of gathering international user data, although the analysis can be challenging. The use of Hofstede's cultural dimensions in the analysis of the data gave us better understanding of the impact of specific culture on the results.},

abstract = {Virtual reality panoramic images are becoming increasingly popular on handheld devices, but navigating them remains a challenge due to small screen sizes. In this paper, we present a formal evaluation and usability studies comparing two interaction concepts. In the first one, the device is seen as a static peephole and the data is moved behind it via touch screen-based scrolling. In the second one, a mobile phone's sensors are used to create a dynamic peephole that can be moved over static content. In the results of our formal analysis sensor-based dynamic peephole navigation performed twice as good in an orientation task, 75% better in an object size discrimination task, and was preferred by 80% of the users. Despite these advantages, additional usability studies indicate that if they are sitting, a majority of users resort to touch screen-based static peephole navigation when interacting. Our results therefore demonstrate benefits of dynamic peephole navigation for virtual reality panoramas but also illustrate its limitations depending on the current context of the user.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a case study of a longitudinal in-situ observation that involves a new social application for mobile communication. Our study demonstrates the need for an adaptive approach to planning, design, and implementation that is responsive to emerging social and infrastructure conditions. This represents a shift from traditional longitudinal studies that observe prototype systems with fixed sets of affordances. In the case of mobile and social applications there is a complex interaction between the social dynamics, the new technology, and the mobile infrastructure. Exploratory research thus requires approaches that can deal with such complex conditions. That includes a high level of prototype plasticity to ensure adoption and sustained use that is needed for longitudinal in-situ research. The social aspects dictate specific forms of instrumentation to enable observation of social interactions and mechanisms to inject the new technology into an existing social and communication ecosystem. Our study demonstrates the evolving use of complementary techniques and in-situ modifications of the prototype to support longitudinal observations in a real setting.},

abstract = {Mobile phones are becoming more and more widely used nowadays, and people do not use the phone only for communication: there is a wide variety of phone applications allowing users to select those that fit their needs. Aggregated over time, application usage patterns exhibit not only what people are consistently interested in but also the way in which they use their phones, and can help improving phone design and personalized services. This work aims at mining automatically usage patterns from apps data recorded continuously with smartphones. A new probabilistic framework for mining usage patterns is proposed. Our methodology involves the design of a bag-of-apps model that robustly represents level of phone usage over specific times of the day, and the use of a probabilistic topic model that jointly discovers patterns of usage over multiple applications and describes users as mixtures of such patterns. Our framework is evaluated using 230 000+ hours of real-life app phone log data, demonstrates that relevant patterns of usage can be extracted, and is objectively validated on a user retrieval task with competitive performance.},
