abstract = {We have built Drift, an application that measures and provides feedback on how far from the ideal path an orienteer has deviated, to study how sports apps can draw on real-time data to enrich sports activities. Orienteering is an outdoor navigation sport requiring mental skills and fast running through the terrain. Participants appropriated deviation into their practice and found new ways it could integrate with common orienteering practice. Interaction around deviation provided possibilities for new forms of sporting practice and social interactions. Deviation as a measure allowed this because it was highly specific and well-grounded in a specific skill of the sport. We believe this use of data in real time has the possibility of supporting and renewing sports activity as well as offering new opportunities for design.},

abstract = {A longitudinal study in the real context of use of a wearable device, a sports watch, was conducted to understand how customization is used. For it, 103 users reported their device use in an online survey once a month for six months. Customization activity was found to be at its highest during the first months of usage. After six months of usage, 72% of the participants still used the customization options at least monthly, and of those, 23% customized weekly. Customization appears to be an important feature, as only 20% of the participants customized very little, and for some it was one of the reasons for their purchase decision. Overall, the majority (68%) were satisfied with the customization options on their sports watch.},

Previous work pointed the need for deploying networked public display applications in various settings in order to make the findings transferable and generalizable and recommends that findings should be connected with research from community psychology. In this paper we report a 15-week "in the wild" deployment of the Moment Machine 2.0 that allowed taking situated snapshots at a university. The application's evaluation involved in-depth interviews (n=20), survey (n=119), and log file analysis. We synthesize our findings with prior work and show how certain effects transfer across settings. We show how the application affected community interaction and sense of community as defined by McMillan and Chavis. We provide implications for design of similar experiences. Overall, our work contributes to the general knowledge of common effects produced by public displays.},

Stereoscopic (S3D) displays are quickly becoming popular beyond cinemas and home entertainments. S3D displays can today already be found in mobile phones, public displays, and car dashboards. A benefit of such UIs is that they can group and structure information in a way that makes them easily perceivable for the user. At the same time, prototyping these UIs is challenging, as with traditional techniques, UI elements cannot easily be rendered and positioned in 3D space. In contrast to professional 3D authoring tools, we present a tool targeted towards non-experts to quickly and easily sketch a S3D UI and instantly render it on a 3D display. We report on the design of the tool by means of a workshop and present an evaluation study with 26 participants assessing its usabilty.},

abstract = {Although recovering from errors is straightforward on most interfaces, public display systems pose very unique design challenges. Namely, public display users interact for very short amounts of times and are believed to abandon the display when interrupted or forced to deviate from the main task. To date, it is not well understood whether public display designers should enable users to correct errors (e.g. by asking users to confirm or giving them a chance correct their input), or aim for faster interaction and rely on other types of feedback to estimate errors. To close this gap, we conducted a field study where we investigated the users willingness to correct their input on public displays. We report on our findings from an in-the-wild deployment of a public gaze-based voting system where we intentionally evoked system errors to see if users correct them. We found that public display users are willing to correct system errors provided that the correction is fast and straightforward. We discuss how our findings influence the choice of interaction methods for public displays; interaction methods that are highly usable but suffer from low accuracy can still be effective if users can "undo" their interactions.},

In this paper a user study is presented that evaluates two different indoor navigation system designs that depict either one (N = 63) or four (N = 60) landmarks to guide the user. The time it took the participants to recognize where to go was captured as a dependent variable. Results show that the interface only depicting one landmark leads to faster self-localization. Therefore, it is argued that a pedestrian navigation system should mainly depict one highly salient landmark in a navigation instruction in order to keep navigation efficiency high.},

In contrast to prior (survey-based) research, we investigate the driver's needs for such activities by employing a combination of a web survey, in-situ observations, and an in-situ survey. Also, we have a look at the specific requirements of the European / German market in contrast to prior research conducted mostly for English-speaking countries.The findings indicate that besides traditional activities (talking to passengers, listening to music), daydreaming, writing text messages, eating and drinking, browsing the Internet, and calling are most wanted for highly automated driving. This shows the potential for mobile and ubiquitous multimedia applications in the car.},

abstract = {Mobile applications have become highly pervasive in recent years. The quality of mobile applications for business use, in particular, is relevant for all stakeholders since application failures can lead to serious consequences, such as damage of corporate reputation or financial loss. For other applications, a reasonable level of quality is also required to convince users to use them. The goal of this work is to identify approaches that address the issue of quality assurance for mobile applications. We present an overview of the identified approaches based on certain viewpoints, such as the focused test level and the addressed quality, and show current research challenges. In order to drive the systematic mapping study, we derived seven research questions based on the stated goal. Then two researchers identified 3,192 records from four digital libraries based on a search string related to terms regarding quality assurance for mobile applications and predefined selection criteria. Ultimately, 230 articles were selected. We created clustered views to answer our seven research questions. In addition, we used surveys found to complement our overview of current challenges. The results show an overall upward trend of publications since 2003. Important topics include automation of GUI tests and assurance of non-functional qualities. Aspects of future research could be the establishment of test environments and the focus on defects addressing stronger the specific characteristics of mobile applications.},

Our approach allows users to form a diverse set of interaction paradigms that involve different device combinations, input types and interaction-event mappings that supplement the limitations of HWD's interaction methods. Such adaptation flexibility allows users to form interaction patterns that correspond to various HWDs' usage contexts. Accordingly, we developed a prototype that comprised an adaptation-client that ran on a smartwatch, a smartphone and a tablet, then carried a user study to evaluate Input Forager within a scenario that resembled HWDs usage contexts. Results indicated that our approach enabled users to reflect both common and distinct input and interaction-mapping preferences. Moreover, qualitative analysis revealed an overall positive usability results, while shortcomings were mainly in the adaptationclients' user interfaces. Finally, we presented the future direction of our project.},

However, it is still a challenge to design an input for mood, such that the sharing easily integrates into the daily life and is engaging for a longer time. To design an input, which overcomes these challenges, we explore the use of four different methods for expressing mood on mobile devices, drawn from previous work in psychology. We aim to verify the usefulness of these methods and want to investigate this by conducting a comparative study of these four input methods, regarding the following factors: intuitiveness, inconvenience, speed of input, everyday use, expressiveness and overall suitability. Results show that use of photographs and emotion terms are suitable to describe the many facets of moods for most participants. Most of the participants prefer personalized input methods as well as combined methods. We discuss the outcomes with regard to the implications on future designs of messenger applications.},

Groups of skiers and snowboarders traditionally use paper maps or board-mounted larger-scale maps near ski lifts to aid decision making: which slope to take next, where to have lunch, or what hazards to avoid when going off-piste. To enrich those static maps with personal content (e.g., pictures, prior routes taken, or hazards encountered), we developed SkiAR - a wearable augmented reality system that allows groups of skiers and snowboarders to share such content on a printed panoramic resort map. The contribution of our work is twofold: (1) we developed a system that offers a novel way to review and share personal content in situ while on the slope using a resort map; (2) we report on the results from a qualitative analysis of two user studies to inform the design and validate the usability and perceived usefulness of our prototype.},

We show that the information kind determines the most appropriate cue in single cue systems, but that multicue approaches are more appreciated. These findings can inspire to design video players with multiple navigation cues, including time, place, persons, and events for easier and more efficient lifelog video retrieval.},

abstract = {People frequently post their photos on social network sites (e.g. Facebook, Instagram) as a way to share memorable moments, emotions, or locations visited. While sharing photos with the same subjects as past photos could lead to user reminiscence and potentially create valuable benefits, existing products still cannot support this adequately. Based on a survey on user habits in sharing and revisiting photos on social network sites, we propose NowAndThen, a photo recommendation concept and tool that assists reminiscence when sharing photos on social network sites. By combining visual features of the photos and associated tags, a prototype we developed can recommend old photos that have common subjects with the user's current photos of interest. Our study with the prototype shows that this approach can help users positively revive past memories and connections with their friends. In addition, our results include various design insights and implications for future reminiscence-support systems.},

This work aims to support lifelog video indexing through automated face priority rating. In a user study, we identified parameters that allow for rating the importance of persons in a video. We implemented these findings to automatically predict the person's importance in video. We show that our algorithm predicts similar person priority ratings like the participants had given. Hence, we contribute to video-based lifelogging through indicating, implementing, and testing face indexing rules that predict how important a person in a video is perceived. Our findings can help to build video players that support users navigating through their large video data and reviewing sequences that recall important moments of life.},

People train and prepare for disasters in advance, but training sessions cannot be held easily, and the learning pace of each individual is not considered. In this study, we propose a first aid training system for citizens using a human-shaped input device, QUMARION. This system provides first aid skills training through human-computer interaction. By using a human-shaped input device instead of human bodies, people can carry out the training of posture management individually and learn at their own pace. In addition, since our system provides advice and feedback depending on the knowledge level of the user, not only can they perform the learning, but they can also confirm whether they acquire knowledge and skills correctly. We conducted an experiment to see whether the trainee can learn accurately by using our system. The results showed that our system enables easy and effective learning about first aid.},

abstract = {Cued-recall graphical passwords have a lot of potential for secure user authentication, particularly if combined with saliency masks to prevent users from selecting weak passwords. Saliency masks were shown to significantly improve password security by excluding those areas of the image that are most likely to lead to hotspots. In this paper we investigate the impact of such saliency masks on the memorability of cued-recall graphical passwords. We first conduct two pre-studies (N=52) to obtain a set of images with three different image complexities as well as real passwords. A month-long user study (N=26) revealed that there is a strong learning effect for graphical passwords, in particular if defined on images with a saliency mask. While for complex images, the learning curve is steeper than for less complex ones, they best supported memorability in the long term, most likely because they provided users more alternatives to select memorable password points. These results complement prior work on the security of such passwords and underline the potential of saliency masks as both a secure and usable improvement to cued-recall gaze-based graphical passwords.},

Our metric is the first of its kind to reflect that users choose patterns based on human intuition and interest in geometric properties of the resulting shapes. Applying our metric to a dataset of 506 user-defined patterns reveals very similar shapes that only differ by simple geometric transformations such as rotation. This shrinks the effective password space by 66% and allows informed guessing attacks. Consequently, we present an approach to subtly nudge users to create more diverse patterns by showing background images and animations during pattern creation. Results from a user study (n = 496) show that applying such countermeasures can significantly increase pattern diversity. We conclude with implications for pattern choices and the design of enrollment processes.},

We present findings on how the game is integrated into everyday life and affects players' mobility patterns, and on how players experience the relation between real world and game world, the game 'bleeding' into the everyday (blurring boundaries at least partially) even though it is not explicitly experienced as hybrid. Furthermore we discuss how notions of play versus ordinary life still affect some players, and how some players are willing to take and create risks and treat the game as consequential in their everyday interactions with (enemy) players. This further blurs the boundaries of the magic circle, but also creates tensions between casual and serious styles of play. Our findings add to the empirical literature on pervasive games by focusing on player experience in a large-scale pervasive game.},

abstract = {Despite many and diverse efforts to re-encourage citizens to participate in public life and decision-making, the level of participation has yet remained low. Practitioners and scholars are now drawing on out-of-the-box solutions, with gamification being one approach. Assuming that incorporating game elements into digital public participation platforms does indeed have an effect on the level of participation, we explore whether only the quantity or also the quality are affected and in what ways. This paper lays a foundation for this by investigating the influence of different attitudes on these two aspects of participation. Our results suggest that attitudes can indeed influence both aspects. Affinity towards games can for instance encourage people to engage with gamified participation platforms, but this motivational boost usually does not last for long and might not always be beneficial in terms of input quality. Intrinsic interest in urban planning on the other hand positively influences both the quantity and quality of engagement. Thus gamified participation could be useful for onboarding, however other methods need to be found to maintain involvement over time.},

We varied force feedback behaviors designed for a motorized slider in a controlled experiment. The slider presented three behaviors, named as counteractive, assistive, and no behavior while participants were exposed to affective imagery varying in valence. The results showed that under different emotions (positive, negative, neutral), people experience small differences in dominance and valence between the force feedback behaviors. A counteractive force feedback seems to increase the feeling of control regarding unpleasant stimuli, while providing an assistive force feedback reduced the level of dominance in case of pleasant stimuli. Our study contributes new understanding of how adaptive feedback influence user's emotions to support design in this field.},

A qualitative systematic review was conducted of prior research dealing with applications featuring social comparison techniques. Through a systematic search strategy, eleven IT artifacts were selected for analysis. Then, patterns of use were analyzed so as to identify experiences on proper timing and context of use. The analysis shows that the technology placed in public spaces is suitable mainly for the first stages in the behavior change process. A private context of use is preferred in later stages.},

Recent state-of-the-art ubicomp, computer-vision, and CSCW studies have tried to recognize a user's activities and actions on a table using a ceiling-mounted device that overlooks the table. However, conventional unconstrained person identification methods such as face identification cannot be used for providing personalized services in such settings. In this study, we focus on a user's soft biometrics that can be captured from the ceiling such as the shoulder length, shape of the head, and posture of the back to achieve unconstrained person identification by using a ceiling-mounted depth camera. We achieve robust person identification by combining the soft biometrics within a framework of multiview learning. Multiview learning allows us to deal effectively with data consisting of features from multiple sources with different data distributions, i.e., multiple soft biometrics in our case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the feasibility of person identification for tabletop users by a ceiling-mounted depth camera.},

Such approaches could effectively support face-to-face interaction in many situations. However, work fails to consider the existing rich practices in how users manage their identity both face-to-face, and with existing social and digital media services. We present the results of 7 in-depth interviews on how users would wish to employ, manage and present social media in face-to-face encounters over a range of contexts and social relationships. We identified the importance of user control in selecting media, particularly when presenting to strangers, and how users would wish to present media to others. Our work provides guidance on how to more effectively employ existing media in face-to-face interaction.},

The game promotes individual accountability in role differentiations on a shared tablet, and these roles are compared to a condition without roles. Another condition tested if a shared tablet would reduce social loafing, compared to individual tablets for each group member. The game was tested on 41 students from 7th to 8th grade. Using a tablet each showed significantly more instances of social loafing compared to sharing one. The results show no significant difference for role assignment.},

abstract = {We present a gaze-based interaction approach that maps a single rotary control knob to multiple interfaces in the car using the user's gaze to determine the respective interaction context. By this, the complexity of physical interfaces (e.g. number of buttons) can be reduced and abstracted to a single remaining physical control interface located at the steering wheel to allow for interaction that doesn't require drivers to take their hands off the steering wheel. We implemented a prototype that uses multiple eye-trackers in a driving simulator to explore the concept of gaze mapping.},

abstract = {Although one advantage of collocated collaboration is to work and discuss directly, some aspects have to be treated anonymously. For example, voting for partial solutions sometimes needs to be performed anonymously to enable unbiased ratings. We provide device-based interactions for voting anonymously in collocated settings using mobile devices. Since looking at the mobile device's screen distracts users from their surrounding and whether they are unobserved or not, we propose simple interactions based on metaphors that can be performed blindly and use the device's sensors as well as the (multi-)touch display. By tapping on the fingerprint sensor or the display a given rating can be counted. Motion sensors are used to accept or reject a partial solution. To demonstrate our interactions, we implemented a prototypical application using the fingerprint sensor for rating. The proposed interactions facilitate anonymous voting and rating to ensure unbiased decisions.},

Nevertheless, this beneficial short time to market often involves poor quality of the developed application. Currently, the elicitation, analysis, and processing of user feedback are unfocused and take too much time and effort to mitigate the poor quality of the application. Hence, we outline an approach aimed at tailored quality assurance as part of MVP development, which enables and expands the benefits of MVP by providing a semi-automated feedback elicitation, analysis, and processing framework. This is intended to raise the effectiveness and efficiency of early user feedback consideration during further development in order to assure the quality and acceptance of a minimalistically developed mobile application.},

abstract = {Recently, as elderly people population grows, the burdens on caretakers are getting larger. In daycare center, caretakers make a daycare report aiming to improve the senior citizen's Quality of Life. However, in the aged society, it is difficult for caretakers to record the senior citizen's activity in detail, since each caretaker needs to take care of several senior citizens at the same time. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic day-care report generation system. Our proposed system estimates the present area and activity of the senior citizen by utilizing the accelerometer-implemented-BLE-beacon tags and generate the daycare report. Based on the generated report, the caretaker works effectively. Evaluation result in a daycare center showed that our system estimated the subject's present area with F-measure: 80.6% and activity with F-measure: 73.8% and automatically generated the daycare report.},

This paper reports on the evaluation of a gamified mobile participation platform, focusing on participants' attitudes towards game-like aspects as well as their interest in urban planning. Our results show that while younger as well as older individuals remain ambivalent towards gamified participation, youth is more inclined to be in favor of the approach. Contrary to common assumptions, younger individuals are not less interested in urban planning and participation},

During the first week of a 2-week field study participants (n=6) wore non-functional mock-ups of ring and bracelet wellness trackers, and provided feedback on their experiences. During the second week, participants used a commercial wellness tracking ring, which collected physical exercise and sleep data and visualized it in a mobile application. Our salient findings based on 196 user diary entries suggest, that the ring form factor is considered beautiful, aesthetic and contributing to the wearer's image. However, the bracelet form factor is more practical for active lifestyle, and preferred in situations where the hands are performing tasks requiring gripping objects, such as sport activities, cleaning the car, cooking and washing dishes. Users strongly identified the ring form factor as jewellery that is intended to be seen, whereas bracelets were considered hidden and inconspicuous elements of the user's ensemble.},

SFA enables audience members to watch a speech and give feedback to it. Shoutbox is an input tool that runs on personal devices and is used to author comments and share them with the speaker and other members of the audience. The Soapbox system was evaluated in both the lab and the field. The evaluation demonstrated that users are positive about trying the platform, and can quickly grasp how to use it. Further, participants thought that Soapbox is very appropriate for its purpose, and can effectively attract more citizens to participate in civic engagement.},

abstract = {This paper presents our research in developing a model for the dynamic generation of indoor maps with crowdsourcing. With approximation of the user traces, we generate a point cloud and develop the topology of the space from time based segmentation of the traces. Moreover, we add semantic information for navigation and localization enabled maps. We discuss motivation, research objectives, and detailed research methods in this paper.},
