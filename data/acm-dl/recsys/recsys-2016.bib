abstract = {Machine Learning research is progressing at an ever increasing pace. Fueled by technology advances commonly referred to as "Big Data", all data related fields are teaming with scientific and applied activity: our communities explore new application areas, develop new learning algorithms, and continuously scale and improve optimization and estimation methods. But from an industry perspective, many of the most impeding challenges are entirely elsewhere. This talk takes a fresh look at the practical state of affairs in the context of running a large-scale automated machine learning system that supports 50 Billion decision daily on behalf of hundreds of digital advertisers. Some of the key lessons are 1) robustness beats peak performance almost always, 2) support for the constant dynamic fluctuations in the data stream is essential, 3) models exploiting unknowingly any weakness of your metrics, and finally 4) the fact that despite big data, the data you really want never exists.},

abstract = {The purpose of recommenders is often summarized as "help the users find relevant items", and the predominant operationalization of this goal has been to focus on the ability to numerically estimate the users' preferences for unseen items or to provide users with item lists ranked in accordance to the estimated preferences. This dominant, albeit narrow, view of the recommendation problem has been tremendously helpful in advancing research in different ways, e.g., through the establishment of standardized evaluation procedures and metrics. In reality, recommender systems can serve a variety of purposes from the point of view of both consumers and providers. Most of the purposes, however, are significantly underexplored, even though many of them are arguably more aligned with the real-world expectations for recommenders than our current predominant paradigm. Therefore, it is important to revisit our conceptualizations of the potential goals of recommenders and their operationalization as research problems. In this paper, we discuss a framework of recommendation goals and purposes and highlight possible future directions and challenges related to the operationalization of such alternative problem formulations.},

In contrast to previous approaches, our method does not rely on an explicit trade-off between a relevance objective and a diversity objective, as the estimations of relevance and diversity are implicit in the coverage criterion. We show on several benchmark datasets that our approach compares favorably to the state-of-the-art diversification methods according to various relevance and diversity measures.},

The resulted model trains on millions of examples and billions of features within minutes on a single personal computer. It shows persistent performance in both offline and online evaluation.

abstract = {Query recommendation predominantly relies on search logs to use existing queries for recommendation, typically calculating query similarity metrics or transition probabilities from the log. While effective, such recommendations are limited to the queries, words, and phrases in the log. They hence do not recommend potentially useful, entirely novel queries. Recent query recommendation methods have proposed generating queries on a topical or thematic level, though current approaches are limited to generating single words. We propose a hybrid method for constructing multi-word queries in this generative sense. It uses Latent Dirichlet Allocation to generate a topic for exploration and skip-gram modeling to generate queries from the topic. According to additional evaluation metrics we present, our model improves diversity and has some room for improving relevance, yet offers an interesting avenue for query recommendation.},

abstract = {The intent-aware diversification framework was introduced initially in information retrieval and adopted to the context of recommender systems in the work of Vargas et al. The framework considers a set of aspects associated with items to be recommended. For instance, aspects may correspond to genres in movie recommendations. The framework depends on input aspect model consisting of item selection or relevance probabilities, given an aspect, and user intents, in the form of probabilities that the user is interested in each aspect. In this paper, we examine a number of input aspect models and evaluate the impact that different models have on the framework. In particular, we propose a constrained PLSA model that allows for interpretable output, in terms of known aspects, while achieving greater performance that the explicit co-occurrence counting method used in previous work. We evaluate the proposed models using a well-known MovieLens dataset for which item genres are available.},

Based on our experiences in winning two of them, in this paper we establish FFMs as an effective method for classifying large sparse data including those from CTR prediction. First, we propose efficient implementations for training FFMs. Then we comprehensively analyze FFMs and compare this approach with competing models. Experiments show that FFMs are very useful for certain classification problems. Finally, we have released a package of FFMs for public use.},

They mainly consider features that are organized in a flat structure, where features are independent and in a same level. However, auxiliary features are often organized in rich knowledge structures (e.g. hierarchy) to describe their relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization framework with recursive regularization -- ReMF, which jointly models and learns the influence of hierarchically-organized features on user-item interactions, thus to improve recommendation accuracy. It also provides characterization of how different features in the hierarchy co-influence the modeling of user-item interactions. Empirical results on real-world data sets demonstrate that ReMF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art feature-based recommendation methods.},

In this paper, we propose a co-factorization model, CoFactor, which jointly decomposes the user-item interaction matrix and the item-item co-occurrence matrix with shared item latent factors. For each pair of items, the co-occurrence matrix encodes the number of users that have consumed both items. CoFactor is inspired by the recent success of word embedding models (e.g., word2vec) which can be interpreted as factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix. We show that this model significantly improves the performance over MF models on several datasets with little additional computational overhead. We provide qualitative results that explain how CoFactor improves the quality of the inferred factors and characterize the circumstances where it provides the most significant improvements.},

This work is based on the intuition that not all users behave in the same way -- instead there exist subsets of like-minded users. By using different item-item models for these user subsets, we can capture differences in their preferences and this can lead to improved performance for top-N recommendations. In this work, we extend SLIM by combining global and local SLIM models. We present a method that computes the prediction scores as a user-specific combination of the predictions derived by a global and local item-item models. We present an approach in which the global model, the local models, their user-specific combination, and the assignment of users to the local models are jointly optimized to improve the top-N recommendation performance. Our experiments show that the proposed method improves upon the standard SLIM model and outperforms competing top-N recommendation approaches.},

The main idea of this approach is to distribute the user-rating matrix across different machines, each having access only to a part of the information, and to asynchronously propagate the updates of the stochastic gradient optimization across the network. Each time a machine receives a parameter vector, it averages its current parameter vector with the received one, and continues its iterations from this new point. Additionally, we introduce a similarity based regularization that constrains the user and item factors to be close to the average factors of their similar users and items found on subparts of the distributed user-rating matrix. We analyze the impact of the regularization terms on MovieLens (100K, 1M, 10M) and NetFlix datasets and show that it leads to a more efficient matrix factorization in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and that the asynchronous distributed approach significantly improves in convergence time as compared to an equivalent synchronous distributed approach.},

abstract = {A common scenario considered in recommender systems is to predict a user's preferences on unseen items based on his/her preferences on observed items. A major limitation of this scenario is that a user might be interested in different things each time when using the system, but there is no way to allow the user to actively alter or adjust the recommended results. To address this issue, we propose the idea of "query-based recommendation" that allows a user to specify his/her search intention while exploring new items, thereby incorporating the concept of information retrieval into recommendation systems. Moreover, the idea is more desirable when the user intention can be expressed in different ways. Take music recommendation as an example: the proposed system allows a user to explore new song tracks by specifying either a track, an album, or an artist. To enable such heterogeneous queries in a recommender system, we present a novel technique called "Heterogeneous Preference Embedding" to encode user preference and query intention into low-dimensional vector spaces. Then, with simple search methods or similarity calculations, we can use the encoded representation of queries to generate recommendations. This method is fairly flexible and it is easy to add other types of information when available. Evaluations on three music listening datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art matrix factorization and network embedding methods.},

Traditionally, we model user preferences using only actions from the target site and may suffer from cold-start problem. As nowadays people normally engage in multiple online sites for various needs, we consider leveraging the cross-site actions to improve the user modeling accuracy. Specifically, in this paper we aim at achieving a more comprehensive and accurate user modeling by modeling user's actions in multiple aligned heterogeneous sites simultaneously. To do so, we propose a modularized probabilistic graphical model framework JUMA. We further integrate topic model and matrix factorization into JUMA for joint user modeling over text-based and item-based sites. We assemble and publish large-scale dataset for comprehensive analyzing and evaluation. Experimental results show that our framework JUMA out performs traditional within-site user modeling techniques, especially for cold-start scenarios. For cold-start users, we achieve relative improvements of 9.3% and 12.8% comparing to existing within-site approaches for recommendation in item-based and text-based sites respectively. Thus we draw the conclusion that aligning heterogeneous sites and modeling users jointly do help to improve the quality of online recommender systems.},

This formulation, however, disregards an opposite -- avoiding recommendations with completely irrelevant items. Due to that bias, standard algorithms, as well as commonly used evaluation metrics, become insensitive to negative feedback. In order to resolve this problem we propose to treat user feedback as a categorical variable and model it with users and items in a ternary way. We employ a third-order tensor factorization technique and implement a higher order folding-in method to support online recommendations. The method is equally sensitive to entire spectrum of user ratings and is able to accurately predict relevant items even from a negative only feedback. Our method may partially eliminate the need for complicated rating elicitation process as it provides means for personalized recommendations from the very beginning of an interaction with a recommender system. We also propose a modification of standard metrics which helps to reveal unwanted biases and account for sensitivity to a negative feedback. Our model achieves state-of-the-art quality in standard recommendation tasks while significantly outperforming other methods in the cold-start "no-positive-feedback" scenarios.},

abstract = {Recommending items that have rarely/never been viewed by users is a bottleneck for collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation algorithms. To alleviate this problem, item content representation (mostly in textual form) has been used as auxiliary information for learning latent factor representations. In this work we present a novel method for learning latent factor representation for videos based on modelling the emotional connection between user and item. First of all we present a comparative analysis of state-of-the art emotion modelling approaches that brings out a surprising finding regarding the efficacy of latent factor representations in modelling emotion in video content. Based on this finding we present a method visual-CLiMF for learning latent factor representations for cold start videos based on implicit feedback. Visual-CLiMF is based on the popular collaborative less-is-more approach but demonstrates how emotional aspects of items could be used as auxiliary information to improve MRR performance. Experiments on a new data set and the Amazon products data set demonstrate the effectiveness of visual-CLiMF which outperforms existing CF methods with or without content information.},

abstract = {In a variety of application domains the content to be recommended to users is associated with text. This includes research papers, movies with associated plot summaries, news articles, blog posts, etc. Recommendation approaches based on latent factor models can be extended naturally to leverage text by employing an explicit mapping from text to factors. This enables recommendations for new, unseen content, and may generalize better, since the factors for all items are produced by a compactly-parametrized model. Previous work has used topic models or averages of word embeddings for this mapping. In this paper we present a method leveraging deep recurrent neural networks to encode the text sequence into a latent vector, specifically gated recurrent units (GRUs) trained end-to-end on the collaborative filtering task. For the task of scientific paper recommendation, this yields models with significantly higher accuracy. In cold-start scenarios, we beat the previous state-of-the-art, all of which ignore word order. Performance is further improved by multi-task learning, where the text encoder network is trained for a combination of content recommendation and item metadata prediction. This regularizes the collaborative filtering model, ameliorating the problem of sparsity of the observed rating matrix.},

abstract = {The cold start problem arises in various recommendation applications. In this paper, we propose a tensor factorization-based algorithm that exploits content features extracted from music audio to deal with the cold start problem for the emerging application next-song recommendation. Specifically, the new algorithm learns sequential behavior to predict the next song that a user would be interested in based on the last song the user just listened to. A unique characteristic of the algorithm is that it learns and updates the mapping between the audio feature space and the item latent space each time during the iterations of the factorization process. This way, the content features can be better exploited in forming the latent features for both users and items, leading to more effective solutions for cold-start recommendation. Evaluation on a large-scale music recommendation dataset shows that the recommendation result of the proposed algorithm exhibits not only higher accuracy but also better novelty and diversity, suggesting its applicability in helping a user explore new items in next-item recommendation.

In this paper we address such problem in a target domain by exploiting user preferences from a related auxiliary domain. Following a rigorous methodology for cold-start, we evaluate a number of recommendation methods on a dataset with positive-only feedback in the movie and music domains, both in single and cross-domain scenarios. Comparing the methods in terms of item ranking accuracy, diversity and catalog coverage, we show that cross-domain preference data is useful to provide more accurate suggestions when user feedback in the target domain is scarce or not available at all, and may lead to more diverse recommendations depending on the target domain. Moreover, evaluating the impact of the user profile size and diversity in the source domain, we show that, in general, the quality of target recommendations increases with the size of the profile, but may deteriorate with too diverse profiles.},

In this paper, we analyze all publications on recommender systems from the scopus database, and particularly also papers with such an HCI focus.

abstract = {We bring to the fore of the recommender system research community, an inconvenient truth about the current state of understanding how recommender system algorithms and humans influence one another, both computationally and cognitively. Unlike the great variety of supervised machine learning algorithms which traditionally rely on expert input labels and are typically used for decision making by an expert, recommender systems specifically rely on data input from non-expert or casual users and are meant to be used directly by these same non-expert users on an every day basis. Furthermore, the advances in online machine learning, data generation, and predictive model learning have become increasingly interdependent, such that each one feeds on the other in an iterative cycle. Research in psychology suggests that people's choices are (1) contextually dependent, and (2) dependent on interaction history. Thus, while standard methods of training and assessing performance of recommender systems rely on benchmark datasets, we suggest that a critical step in the evolution of recommender systems is the development of benchmark models of human behavior that capture contextual and dynamic aspects of human behavior. It is important to emphasize that even extensive real life user-tests may not be sufficient to make up for this gap in benchmarking validity because user tests are typically done with either a focus on user satisfaction or engagement (clicks, sales, likes, etc) with whatever the recommender algorithm suggests to the user, and thus ignore the human cognitive aspect. We conclude by highlighting the interdisciplinary implications of this endeavor.},

It seems obvious that these eye gaze patterns contain a rich signal concerning these users' preferences. However, because eye tracking data is not available to most recommender systems, these signals are not widely incorporated into personalization models. In this work, we show that it is possible to predict gaze by combining easily-collected user browsing data with eye tracking data from a small number of users in a grid-based recommender interface. Our technique is able to leverage a small amount of eye tracking data to infer gaze patterns for other users. We evaluate our prediction models in MovieLens -- an online movie recommender system. Our results show that incorporating eye tracking data from a small number of users significantly boosts accuracy as compared with only using browsing data, even though the eye-tracked users are different from the testing users (e.g. AUC=0.823 vs. 0.693 in predicting whether a user will fixate on an item). We also demonstrate that Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can be applied in this setting; they are better than linear models in predicting fixation probability and capturing the interface regularity through Bayesian inference (AUC=0.823 vs. 0.757).},

abstract = {Prior work relevant to incorporating personality into recommender systems falls into two categories: social science studies and algorithmic ones. Social science studies of preference have found only small relationships between personality and category preferences, whereas, algorithmic approaches found a little improvement when incorporating personality into recommendations. As a result, despite good reasons to believe personality assessments should be useful in recommenders, we are left with no substantial demonstrated impact. In this work, we start with user data from a live recommender system, but study category-by-category variations in preference (both rating levels and distribution) across different personality types. By doing this, we hope to isolate specific areas where personality is most likely to provide value in recommender systems, while also modeling an analytic process that can be used in other domains. After controlling for the family-wise error rate, we find that High Agreeableness users rate at least 0.5 stars higher on a 5-star scale compared to low Agreeableness users. We also find differences in consumption in four different personality types between people who manifested high and low levels of that personality.},

In our scenario, users provide pairwise preference scores for a set of item pairs, indicating how much one item in each pair is preferred to the other. We propose a matrix factorization (MF) and a nearest neighbor (NN) prediction techniques for pairwise preference scores. Our MF solution maps users and items pairs to a joint latent features vector space, while the proposed NN algorithm leverages specific user-to-user similarity functions well suited for comparing users preferences of that type. We compare our approaches to state of the art solutions and show that our solutions produce more accurate pairwise preferences and ranking predictions.},

Next, given this graph, we implemented some techniques to rank those properties and we used the most relevant ones to feed a module for generating explanations in natural language. In the experimental evaluation we performed a user study with 308 subjects aiming to investigate to what extent our explanation framework can lead to more transparent, trustful and engaging recommendations. The preliminary results provided us with encouraging findings, since our algorithm performed better than both a non-personalized explanation baseline and a popularity-based one.},

We propose using the exponential learning curve model to study how conversion rates change with the number of reviews. We call the difference in conversion rate between having no reviews and an infinite number the value of reviews. We find that, on average, the conversion rate of a product can increase by as much as 270% as it accumulates reviews, amongst the users that choose to display them. We also find diminishing marginal value as a product accumulates reviews, with the first five reviews driving the bulk of the aforementioned increase. To address the problem of simultaneity of increase of reviews and conversion rate, we use customer sessions in which reviews were not displayed as a control for trends that would have happened regardless of the increase in the review volume. Using our framework, we further find that high priced items have a higher value for reviews than lower priced items. High priced items can see their conversion rate increase by as much as 380% as they accumulate reviews compared to 190% for low priced items.We infer that the existence of reviews provides valuable signals to the customers, increasing their propensity to purchase. We also infer that users usually don't pay attention to the entire set of reviews, especially if there are a lot of them, but instead they focus on the first few available. Our approach can be extended and applied in a variety of settings to gain further insights.},

Previous approaches have focused almost exclusively on machine learning-related techniques to detect and penalize such behaviour. In this paper, we tackle the problem from a different perspective, using the approach of the field of mechanism design. We put forward a game model tailored for the setting at hand and aim to construct truthful mechanisms, i.e. mechanisms that do not provide incentives for dishonest reputation-augmenting actions, that guarantee good recommendations in the worst-case. For the setting with two agents, we propose a truthful mechanism that is optimal in terms of social efficiency. For the general case of m agents, we prove both lower and upper bound results on the effciency of truthful mechanisms and propose truthful mechanisms that yield significantly better results, when compared to an existing mechanism from a leading e-commerce site on real data.},

abstract = {This work is motivated by the need to provide reliable information recommendation to users in social sensing. Social sensing has become an emerging application paradigm that uses humans as sensors to observe and report events in the physical world. These human sensed observations are often viewed as binary claims (either true or false). A fundamental challenge in social sensing is how to ascertain the credibility of claims and the reliability of sources without knowing either of them a priori. We refer to this challenge as truth discovery. While prior works have made progress on addressing this challenge, an important limitation exists: they did not explore the mood sensitivity aspect of the problem. Therefore, the claims identified as correct by current solutions can be completely biased in regards to the mood of human sources and lead to useless or even misleading recommendations. In this paper, we present a new analytical model that explicitly considers the mood sensitivity feature in the solution of truth discovery problem. The new model solves a multi-dimensional estimation problem to jointly estimate the correctness and mood neutrality of claims as well as the reliability and mood sensitivity of sources. We compare our model with state-of-the-art truth discovery solutions using four real world datasets collected from Twitter during recent disastrous and emergent events: Brussels Bombing, Paris Attack, Oregon Shooting, Baltimore Riots, which occurred in 2015 and 2016. The results show that our model has significant improvements over the compared baselines by finding more correct and mood neutral claims.},

We believe that humans can overcome these limitations. Inspired by how people explain word-of-mouth recommendations, we designed a process, combining crowdsourcing and computation, that generates personalized natural language explanations. We modeled key topical aspects of movies, asked crowdworkers to write explanations based on quotes from online movie reviews, and personalized the explanations presented to users based on their rating history. We evaluated the explanations by surveying 220 MovieLens users, finding that compared to personalized tag-based explanations, natural language explanations: 1) contain a more appropriate amount of information, 2) earn more trust from users, and 3) make users more satisfied. This paper contributes to the research literature by describing a scalable process for generating high quality and personalized natural language explanations, improving on state-of-the-art content-based explanations, and showing the feasibility and advantages of approaches that combine human wisdom with algorithmic processes.},

abstract = {Automated course recommendation can help deliver personalized and effective college advising and degree planning. Nearest neighbor and matrix factorization based collaborative filtering approaches have been applied to student-course grade data to help students select suitable courses. However, the student-course enrollment patterns exhibit grouping structures that are tied to the student and course academic features, which lead to grade data that are not missing at random (NMAR). Existing approaches for dealing with NMAR data, such as Response-aware and context-aware matrix factorization, do not model NMAR data in terms of the user and item features and are not designed with the characteristics of grade data in mind. In this work we investigate how the student and course academic features influence the enrollment patterns and we use these features to define student and course groups at various levels of granularity. We show how these groups can be used to design grade prediction and top-n course ranking models for neighborhood-based user collaborative filtering, matrix factorization and popularity-based ranking approaches. These methods give lower grade prediction error and more accurate top-n course rankings than the other methods that do not take domain knowledge into account.},

We formally define the problem and we present a novel composite recommendation system, inspired from composite retrieval.

We then turn to the idea that life itself is the best recommender system, and that people themselves are the query. By looking at how life brings people in contact with options that suit their needs or match their preferences, we hope to shed further light on what current RecSys could be doing better. Finally, we look at the forms that RecSys could take in the future. By formulating our vision beyond the reach of usual considerations and current limitations, including business models, algorithms, data sets, and evaluation methodologies, we attempt to arrive at fresh conclusions that may inspire the next steps taken by the community of researchers working on RecSys.},

abstract = {Behaviorism is the currently-dominant paradigm for building and evaluating recommender systems. Both the operation and the evaluation of recommender system applications are most often driven by analyzing the behavior of users. In this paper, we argue that listening to what users say about the items and recommendations they like, the control they wish to exert on the output, and the ways in which they perceive the system and not just observing what they do will enable important developments in the future of recommender systems. We provide both philosophical and pragmatic motivations for this idea, describe the various points in the recommendation and evaluation processes where explicit user input may be considered, and discuss benefits that may result from considered incorporation of user preferences at each of these points. In particular, we envision recommender applications that aim to support users' better selves: helping them live the life that they desire to lead. For example, recommender-assisted behavior change requires algorithms to predict not what users choose or do now, inferable from behavioral data, but what they should choose or do in the future to become healthier, fitter, more sustainable, or culturally aware. We hope that our work will spur useful discussion and many new ideas for recommenders that empower their users.},

abstract = {Sparseness of user-to-item rating data is one of the major factors that deteriorate the quality of recommender system. To handle the sparsity problem, several recommendation techniques have been proposed that additionally consider auxiliary information to improve rating prediction accuracy. In particular, when rating data is sparse, document modeling-based approaches have improved the accuracy by additionally utilizing textual data such as reviews, abstracts, or synopses. However, due to the inherent limitation of the bag-of-words model, they have difficulties in effectively utilizing contextual information of the documents, which leads to shallow understanding of the documents. This paper proposes a novel context-aware recommendation model, convolutional matrix factorization (ConvMF) that integrates convolutional neural network (CNN) into probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF). Consequently, ConvMF captures contextual information of documents and further enhances the rating prediction accuracy. Our extensive evaluations on three real-world datasets show that ConvMF significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art recommendation models even when the rating data is extremely sparse. We also demonstrate that ConvMF successfully captures subtle contextual difference of a word in a document. Our implementation and datasets are available at http://dm.postech.ac.kr/ConvMF.},

abstract = {Real-life recommender systems often face the daunting task of providing recommendations based only on the clicks of a user session. Methods that rely on user profiles -- such as matrix factorization -- perform very poorly in this setting, thus item-to-item recommendations are used most of the time. However the items typically have rich feature representations such as pictures and text descriptions that can be used to model the sessions. Here we investigate how these features can be exploited in Recurrent Neural Network based session models using deep learning. We show that obvious approaches do not leverage these data sources. We thus introduce a number of parallel RNN (p-RNN) architectures to model sessions based on the clicks and the features (images and text) of the clicked items. We also propose alternative training strategies for p-RNNs that suit them better than standard training. We show that p-RNN architectures with proper training have significant performance improvements over feature-less session models while all session-based models outperform the item-to-item type baseline.},

Unlike an individual's personal interests, what a user is known for is reflected by the views of others, and is often not easily discerned for a long-tail of the vast majority of users. In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering what users are known for through a probabilistic model called Bayesian Contextual Poisson Factorization. Moving beyond just modeling user's content, it naturally models and integrates additional contextual factors, concretely, user's geo-spatial footprints and social influence, to overcome noisy online activities and social relations. Through GPS-tagged social media datasets, we find that the proposed method can improve known-for prediction performance by 17.5% in precision and 20.9% in recall on average, and that it can capture the implicit relationships between a user's known-for profile and her content, geo-spatial and social influence.},

Most of the common Recommender Systems assume that user identification must be explicit. In this paper a Session-Aware Recommender System approach is presented where no straightforward user information is required. The recommendation process is based only on user activity within a single session, defined as a sequence of events. This information is incorporated in the recommendation process by explicit context modeling with factorization methods and a novel approach with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Compared to the session modeling approach, RNN directly models the dependency of user observed sequential behavior throughout its recurrent structure. The evaluation discusses the results based on sessions from real-life system with ephemeral items (identified only by the set of their attributes) for the task of top-n best recommendations.},

However, in recommender systems, timing is often subsumed under contextual information and has received little attention yet. For this reason, we analyze the relation between the timing of a recommendation and its acceptance across different product categories. Our study is based on a real-world deployment of an in-store recommendation system in the brick-and-mortar grocery industry. We base our analysis on transaction data of more than 100,000 unique users and more than four million product recommendations. Our findings suggest that the success of a recommendation significantly depends on the inter-purchase time within the respective category. Different sensitivities across product categories further stress the importance of timing and its interplay with category characteristics within the context of recommender systems. The insights gained in this study enable retailers to improve scheduling recommendations and target promotions more efficiently.},

abstract = {The evolution of the World Wide Web (WWW) and the smart-phone technologies have played a key role in the revolution of our daily life. The location-based social networks (LBSN) have emerged and facilitated the users to share the check-in information and multimedia contents. The Point of Interest (POI) recommendation system uses the check-in information to predict the most potential check-in locations. The different aspects of the check-in information, for instance, the geographical distance, the category, and the temporal popularity of a POI; and the temporal check-in trends, and the social (friendship) information of a user play a crucial role in an efficient recommendation. In this paper, we propose a fused recommendation model termed MAPS (Multi Aspect Personalized POI Recommender System) which will be the first in our knowledge to fuse the categorical, the temporal, the social and the spatial aspects in a single model. The major contribution of this paper are: (i) it realizes the problem as a graph of location nodes with constraints on the category and the distance aspects (i.e. the edge between two locations is constrained by a threshold distance and the category of the locations), (ii) it proposes a multi-aspect fused POI recommendation model, and (iii) it extensively evaluates the model with two real-world data sets.},

abstract = {Group recommender systems help groups of users in finding appropriate items to be enjoyed together. Lots of activities, like watching TV or going to the restaurant, are intrinsically group-based, thus making the group recommendation problem very relevant. In this paper we study ephemeral groups, i.e., groups where the members might be together for the first time. Recent approaches have tackled this issue introducing complex models to be learned offline, making them unable to deal with new items; on the contrary, we propose a group recommender able to manage new items too. In more detail, our technique determines the preference of a group for an item by combining the individual preferences of the group members on the basis of their contextual influence, where the contextual influence represents the ability of an individual, in a given situation, to direct the group's decision. We conducted an extensive experimental evaluation on a TV dataset containing a log of viewings performed by real groups, showing how our approach outperforms the comparable techniques from the literature.},

abstract = {Online social networks have become predominant in recent years and have grown to encompass massive scales of data. In addition to data scale, these networks can be heterogeneous and contain complex structures between different users, between social entities and various interactions between users and social entities. This is especially true in enterprise social networks where hierarchies explicitly exist between employees as well.In such networks, producing the best recommendations for each user is a very challenging problem for two main reasons. First, the complex structures in the social network need to be properly mined and exploited by the algorithm. Second, these networks contain millions or even billions of edges making the problem very difficult computationally.In this paper we present Guided Walk, a supervised graph based algorithm that learns the significance of different network links for each user and then produces entity recommendations based on this learning phase. We compare the algorithm with a set of baseline algorithms using offline evaluation techniques as well as a user survey. The offline results show that the algorithm outperforms the next best algorithm by a factor of 3.6. The user survey further confirms that the recommendation are not only relevant but also rank high in terms of personal relevance for each user.To deal with large scale social networks, the Guided Walk algorithm is formulated as a Pregel program which allows us to utilize the power of distributed parallel computing. This would allow horizontally scaling the algorithm for larger social networks by simply adding more compute nodes to the cluster.},

abstract = {Social recommendation takes advantage of the influence of social relationships in decision making and the ready availability of social data through social networking systems. Trust relationships in particular can be exploited in such systems for rating prediction and recommendation, which has been shown to have the potential for improving the quality of the recommender and alleviating the issue of data sparsity, cold start, and adversarial attacks. An appropriate trust inference mechanism is necessary in extending the knowledge base of trust opinions and tackling the issue of limited trust information due to connection sparsity of social networks. In this work, we offer a new solution to trust inference in social networks to provide a better knowledge base for trust-aware recommender systems. We propose using a semiring framework as a nonlinear way to combine trust evidences for inferring trust, where trust relationship is model as 2-D vector containing both trust and certainty information. The trust propagation and aggregation rules, as the building blocks of our trust inference scheme, are based upon the properties of trust relationships. In our approach, both trust and distrust (i.e., positive and negative trust) are considered, and opinion conflict resolution is supported. We evaluate the proposed approach on real-world datasets, and show that our trust inference framework has high accuracy, and is capable of handling trust relationship in large networks. The inferred trust relationships can enlarge the knowledge base for trust information and improve the quality of trust-aware recommendation.},

abstract = {Understanding users' interactions with highly subjective content---like artistic images---is challenging due to the complex semantics that guide our preferences. On the one hand one has to overcome `standard' recommender systems challenges, such as dealing with large, sparse, and long-tailed datasets. On the other, several new challenges present themselves, such as the need to model content in terms of its visual appearance, or even social dynamics, such as a preference toward a particular artist that is independent of the art they create. In this paper we build large-scale recommender systems to model the dynamics of a vibrant digital art community, Behance, consisting of tens of millions of interactions (clicks and 'appreciates') of users toward digital art. Methodologically, our main contributions are to model (a) rich content, especially in terms of its visual appearance; (b) temporal dynamics, in terms of how users prefer 'visually consistent' content within and across sessions; and (c) social dynamics, in terms of how users exhibit preferences both towards certain art styles, as well as the artists themselves.},

One representation learning model that has been shown to be effective for large preference datasets is Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). While homophily, or the tendency of friends to share their preferences at some level, is an established notion in sociology, thus far it has not yet been clearly demonstrated on RBM-based preference models. The question lies in how to appropriately incorporate social network into the architecture of RBM-based models for learning representations of preferences. In this paper, we propose two potential architectures: one that models social network among users as additional observations, and another that incorporates social network into the sharing of hidden units among related users. We study the efficacies of these proposed architectures on publicly available, real-life preference datasets with social networks, yielding useful insights.},

abstract = {Improving the performance of recommender systems using knowledge graphs is an important task. There have been many hybrid systems proposed in the past that use a mix of content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to boost the performance. More recently, some work has focused on recommendations that use external knowledge graphs (KGs) to supplement content-based recommendation. In this paper, we investigate three methods for making KG based recommendations using a general-purpose probabilistic logic system called ProPPR. The simplest of the models, EntitySim, uses only the links of the graph. We then extend the model to TypeSim that also uses the types of the entities to boost its generalization capabilities. Next, we develop a graph based latent factor model, GraphLF, which combines the strengths of latent factorization with graphs. We compare our approaches to a recently proposed state-of-the-art graph recommendation method on two large datasets, Yelp and MovieLens-100K. The experiments illustrate that our approaches can give large performance improvements. Additionally, we demonstrate that knowledge graphs give maximum advantage when the dataset is sparse, and gradually become redundant as more training data becomes available, and hence are most useful in cold-start settings.},

Nonetheless, these approaches suffer from severe time and space requirements, which can be alleviated via random walk sampling, at the cost of reduced recommendation quality. In addition, these approaches ignore users' ratings, which further limits their expressiveness. In this paper, we introduce a computationally efficient graph-based approach for collaborative filtering based on short-path enumeration. Moreover, we propose three scoring functions based on the Bayesian paradigm that effectively exploit distributional aspects of the users' ratings. We experiment with seven publicly available datasets against state-of-the-art graph-based and matrix factorization approaches. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in most settings. Furthermore, analytical results demonstrate its efficiency compared to other graph-based approaches.},

abstract = {Implicit feedback is a key source of information for many recommendation and personalization approaches. However, using it typically requires multiple episodes of interaction and roundtrips to a recommendation engine. This adds latency and neglects the opportunity of immediate personalization for a user while the user is navigating recommendations.We propose a novel strategy to address the above problem in a principled manner. The key insight is that as we observe a user's interactions, it reveals much more information about her desires. We exploit this by inferring the within-session user intent on-the-fly based on navigation interactions, since they offer valuable clues into a user's current state of mind. Using navigation patterns and adapting recommendations in real-time creates an opportunity to provide more accurate recommendations. By prefetching a larger amount of content, this can be carried out entirely in the client (such as a browser) without added latency. We define a new Bayesian model with an efficient inference algorithm. We demonstrate significant improvements with this novel approach on a real-world, large-scale dataset from Netflix on the problem of adapting the recommendations on a user's homepage.},

abstract = {Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are an emerging model for encoding probabilities over subsets, such as shopping baskets, selected from a ground set, such as an item catalog. They have recently proved to be appealing models for a number of machine learning tasks, including product recommendation. DPPs are parametrized by a positive semi-definite kernel matrix. Prior work has shown that using a low-rank factorization of this kernel provides scalability improvements that open the door to training on large-scale datasets and computing online recommendations, both of which are infeasible with standard DPP models that use a full-rank kernel. A low-rank DPP model can be trained using an optimization-based method, such as stochastic gradient ascent, to find a point estimate of the kernel parameters, which can be performed efficiently on large-scale datasets. However, this approach requires careful tuning of regularization parameters to prevent overfitting and provide good predictive performance, which can be computationally expensive. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for learning a low-rank factorization of this kernel, which provides automatic control of regularization. We show that our Bayesian low-rank DPP model can be trained efficiently using stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC). Our Bayesian model generally provides better predictive performance on several real-world product recommendation datasets than optimization-based low-rank DPP models trained using stochastic gradient ascent, and better performance than several state-of-the art recommendation methods in many cases.},

We propose Multi-feedback Bayesian Personalized Ranking (MF-BPR), a pairwise method that exploits different types of feedback with an extended sampling method. The feedback types are drawn from different "channels", in which users interact with items (e.g., clicks, likes, listens, follows, and purchases). We build on the insight that different kinds of feedback, e.g., a click versus a like, reflect different levels of commitment or preference. Our approach differs from previous work in that it exploits multiple sources of feedback simultaneously during the training process. The novelty of MF-BPR is an extended sampling method that equates feedback sources with "levels" that reflect the expected contribution of the signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with a series of experiments carried out on three datasets containing multiple types of feedback. Our experimental results demonstrate that with a right sampling method, MF-BPR outperforms BPR in terms of accuracy. We find that the advantage of MF-BPR lies in its ability to leverage level information when sampling negative items.},

abstract = {In the past decade, news consumption through traditional channels such as print has been on the decline while online and digital news consumption has been steadily growing. Bloomberg, renowned for its products in the financial world, has a very strong presence in the news and media industry. Bloomberg Media, on an average, publishes 400-500 stories and videos per day and we have close to 30 million unique visitors on our websites and mobile applications every month consuming this content. At such a scale it is very important to recommend relevant information for a good user experience. Recommendations in the News and Media domain bring a unique set of challenges due to the dynamic nature of the data as well as unique consumption patterns. The biggest challenge with building recommendation systems in the News domain is the dynamic nature of the domain itself; new content is published every few minutes and majority of the content has a short shelf life, i.e., the news is not relevant to users after a certain time span and the time span is generally of the order of hours rather than days, making it important to deliver relevant content in a timely manner. Moreover, our users consume content differently based on time of day. For example, some users whose focus is market news and market data during the day consume more long form and generic articles and videos in the evening. User preferences, along with being cyclical in nature, tend to change over time, so algorithms need to adapt to the changing taste of the user. In addition, we need to ensure that the users do get their share of important/trending news and are not put into a filter bubble.In this talk, we will present some novel techniques we have applied to popular approaches in the field of Recommender Systems to be able to address the unique challenges which the news domain presents.},

Entire teams at Spotify focus on understanding both the creator and listener through collaborative filtering, machine learning, DSP and NLP approaches -- we crawl the web for artist information, scan each note in every one of our millions of songs for acoustic signals, and model users' taste through a cluster analysis and in a latent space based on their historical and real-time listening patterns. The data generated by these analyses have ensured our discovery products are precise and help our users enjoy music and media across our entire catalog. We'll dive deep into the workings of Discover Weekly, our marquee personalized playlist which updates weekly and reached 1 billion streams within the first 10 weeks from its release. The technology behind Discover Weekly is powered by a scalable factor analysis of Spotify's over two billion user-generated playlists matched to each user's current listening behavior. We'll discuss its innovative genesis and the challenges and opportunities the system faces a year after its launch. We'll also discuss Spotify's home page, seen by each of our users, currently undergoing vast efforts around personalization to ensure each listener gets a targeted list of playlists, shows and music to select throughout their day. We'll discuss the various similarity metrics, ranking approaches and user modeling we're working on to increase precision and optimize for our users' happiness.},

abstract = {The Netflix experience is driven by a number of recommendation algorithms: personalized ranking, page generation, similarity, ratings, search, etc. On the January 6th, 2016 we simultaneously launched Netflix in 130 new countries around the world, which brought the total to over 190 countries. Preparing for such a rapid expansion while ensuring each algorithm was ready to work seamlessly created new challenges for our recommendation and search teams. In this talk, we will highlight the four most interesting challenges we encountered in making our algorithms operate globally and how this improved our ability to connect members worldwide with stories they'll love. In particular, we will dive into the problems of uneven availability across catalogs, balancing personal and cultural tastes, handling language, and tracking quality of recommendations. Uneven catalog availability is a challenge because many recommendation algorithms assume that people could interact with any item and then use the absence of interaction implicitly or explicitly as negative information in the model. However, this assumption does not hold globally and across time where item availability differs. Running algorithms globally means needing a notion of location so that we can handle local variations in taste while also providing a good basis for personalization. Language is another challenge in recommending video content because people can typically only enjoy content that has assets (audio, subtitles) in languages they understand. The preferences for how people enjoy such content also vary between people and depend on their familiarity with a language. Also, while would like our recommendations to work well for every one of our members, tracking quality becomes difficult because with so many members in so many countries speaking so many languages, it can be hard to determine when an algorithm or system is performing sub-optimally for some subset of them. Thus, to support this global launch, we examined each and every algorithm that is part of our service and began to address these challenges.},

abstract = {Were The Rolling Stones right when they said, "You can't always get what you want; but if you try sometime you get what you need"? Recommendation systems are the crystal ball of the Internet: predicting user intentions, making sense of big data, and delivering what people are looking for before they even know they want it. Pandora radio is best known for the Music Genome Project; the most unique and richly labeled music catalog of 1.5 million+ tracks. While this content-based approach to music recommendation is extremely effective and still used today as the foundation to the leading online radio service, Pandora has also collected more than a decade of contextual listener feedback in the form of more than 65 billion thumbs from 79M+ monthly active users who have created more than 9 billion stations. This session will look at how the interdisciplinary team at Pandora goes about making sense of these massive data sets to successfully make large scale music recommendations to our listeners.As opposed to more traditional recommender systems which need only to recommend a single item or set of items, Pandora's recommenders must provide an evolving set of sequential items, which constantly keep the experience new and exciting. In this talk I will present a dynamic ensemble learning system that combines musicological data and machine learning models to provide a truly personalized experience. This approach allows us to switch from a lean back experience (exploitation) to a more exploration mode to discover new music tailored specifically to users individual tastes. To exemplify this, I will present a recently launched product led by the research team, Thumbprint Radio.Following this session the audience will have an in-depth understanding of how Pandora uses science to determine the perfect balance of familiarity, discovery, repetition and relevance for each individual listener, measures and evaluates user satisfaction, and how our online and offline architecture stack plays a critical role in our success.},

abstract = {Deployment of open source recommendation systems has been shown to be an effective way to increase sale conversions on a variety of e-commerce sites. However, there remains a large gap between deploying the core algorithm provided by these systems and delivering an application-quality recommendation system, specifically tailored to address complex and dynamically changing business needs. We will present a real-time recommendation engine built on our graph data platform that provides the following extensions to a basic recommendation model: True real-time recommendation algorithms: We provide a simple framework for customers to author and deploy real-time recommendation algorithms with no pre-computation required. Streaming updates of user behavior and product information: As quickly as data are generated, the recommendation engine applies the updates and can serve updated results. Support for offline recommendation algorithms: Users with existing investment in a quality recommendation program can import their pre-computed results into the graph database for efficient, unified service of results. Tools for Business-centric requirements: The engine offers a range of weighting, sorting, and filtering options to tailor recommendation algorithms to business needs. For example, the engine can eliminate products that are out of stock or favor products that are known to perform well in different real-time contexts. Multiple algorithm ensemble support: There is rarely a case where one algorithm is sufficient to identify the best items to recommend to a user. Integrating points 1 through 4, the engine provides intuitive methods for specifying and combining the results of multiple recommendation algorithms to achieve the highest-performing results. Recommendation feedback tools: Pre- and Post-analysis tools, built around a business' logic, are used to generate reports to assess the value of both potential and currently deployed algorithms.Of particular interest to RecSys attendees, we will discuss the technical aspects of a graph-based implementation of the recommendation engine and how it facilitates the rapid design and deployment of an efficient real-time recommendation system under a single service. We will briefly discuss the architecture of our graph database system to show how it can efficiently serve a large user base even from a single server shared-memory architecture. Attendees will also learn about graph-based data modeling and how viewing data from this perspective can lead to new types of business insights and applications that are not easily implemented using traditional relational and/or NoSQL platforms. We will conclude with a brief demonstration of a real deployed application UI to demonstrate the ease by which recommendation systems can be implemented and deployed using the engine.},

Many recommendation techniques have been proposed and they have achieved great successes in many applications. However, the explanation of recommendation results is an important but seldom addressed problem. In this paper, we organize the objects and relations in a recommender system with a heterogeneous information network, which integrates more informations and contains rich semantics. Then we employ a semantic meta path based personalized recommendation model and design a recommender system with explanation, called RecExp. The RecExp system has two unique features. (1) Semantic recommendation. RecExp provides different recommendation models to comply with users' requirements through setting of meta paths. (2) Interpretive recommendation. Under a hybrid recommendation model, RecExp provides the explanations for the recommendation results.},

abstract = {With the ubiquity of fast internet connections and the growing availability of Video-On-Demand (VOD) services powerful recommender systems are needed. Traditionally, movie recommender systems apply user-based collaborative filtering providing high quality recommendations if users maintain user profiles describing preferences and movie ratings. The shortcomings of Collaborative Filtering are that comprehensive user profiles are required and users tend to get recommendations very similar to the user profile "filter bubble". In addition, CF-based recommenders neither consider current trends nor the context. In order to overcome these weaknesses, we develop a system identifying interesting events in the stream of current news and deploying this information for computing recommendations. Our system gathers topics of interest from Twitter and RSS-Feeds, extracts relevant Named Entities, and uses semantic relations for recommending movies closely related to these topics. We explain the used algorithms and show that our system provides highly relevant recommendations.},

In this tutorial we will describe the advances in Recommender Systems in the last 10 years from an industry perspective based on the instructors' personal experience at companies like Quora, LinkedIn, Netflix, or Yahoo! We will do so in the form of different lessons learned through the years.Some of those lessons will describe the different components of modern recommender systems such as: personalized ranking, similarity, explanations, context-awareness, or multi-armed bandits. Others will also review the usage of novel algorithmic approaches such as Factorization Machines, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, SimRank, Deep Neural Networks, or Listwise Learning-to-rank. Others will dive into details of the importance of gathering the right data or using the correct optimization metric.But, most importantly, we will give many examples of prototypical industrial-scale recommender systems with special focus on those unsolved challenges that should define the future of the recommender systems area.},

Since we cannot expect that developers are willing to invest a significant effort to use our recommender system (RS), we are developing a context-aware multi-criteria RS based on implicit feedback. We already created and evaluated context and user models. We also acquired a data set with more than 100,000 command executions. Currently, we are developing RS algorithm for predicting the scores of performance and effort expectancy and developer's intention to use a specific command. We are also developing a user interface, that has to be persuasive, effective, and efficient. To date, a user interface for IDE command RS has not been developed.},

However, typically the same settings are used for Matrix factorization regardless of the density of the matrix. In our experiments, we found that for MF, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for recommendations increases (i.e. performance drops) for sparse matrices. We propose a Two Stage MF approach so MF is run twice over the whole matrix; the first stage uses MF to generate a small percentage of pseudotransactions that are added to the original matrix to increase its density, and the second stage re-runs MF over this denser matrix to predict the user-item transactions in the testing set. We show using data from Movielens that such methods can improve on the performance of MF for sparse martrices.},

Furthermore, there is a lack of user control over the recommendation process-which is mostly fully automated and does not allow the user to influence the sources and mechanisms by which recommendations are produced-as well as over the presentation of recommended items. Consequently, recommendations are often not transparent to the user, are considered to be less trustworthy, or do not meet the user's situational needs. This work will investigate the theoretical foundations for user-controllable, interactive methods of recommending, will develop techniques that exploit social media data in conjunction with other sources, and will validate the research empirically in the area of e-commerce product recommendations. The methods developed are intended to be applicable in a wide range of recommending and decision support scenarios.},

These reviews are helpful for consumers to optimize their purchasing decisions. However, while popular products receive many reviews, many other products do not have an adequate number of reviews leading to the cold item problem. In this proposal, we propose a solution outline for the cold item problem by automatically generating reviews and predicting ratings for the cold products from available reviews of similar products in e-commerce websites as well as users' opinion shared in the microblogging platforms such as Twitter. We propose a framework to build a formal semantic representation of products from unstructured product descriptions, user reviews as well as user ratings. Such presentations assist us to measure product similarity and relatedness in a accurate and cost-effective way. Besides, we propose a model to generate additional reviews for a cold product by mining users' posts shared on medium such as Twitter and transfer them to the e-commerce website. Preliminary experiments show promising results in finding products similar to the cold products.},

Traditional nutrition support systems lack of practical everyday knowledge, social support and motivation as well the consideration of the personal context. We address these impediments with a holistic decision support system that empowers people to change their lifestyle successfully. We aim at analyzing previous approaches from various disciplines and integrating them into one concept for nutrition support giving personalized context aware recommendations to each user while presenting and teaching practical information about healthy nutrition. Additionally, we consider the ease of usage of such an application by automating necessary burdens and motivating participants with social incentives. The decision support system is tested in a 6-month intervention study using regression analysis on usage patterns and matrix factorial designs for interacting features. The social and interactive components are observed in a 1-year field study, utilizing a realistic environment.},

abstract = {The main purpose of Recommender Systems is to minimize the effects of information/choice overload. Recommendations are usually prepared based on the estimation of what would be useful or interesting to users. Thus, it is important that they are relevant to users, whether to their information needs, current activity or emotional state. This requires deep understanding of users' context but also the knowledge of the history of previous users' interactions within the system (e.g. clicks, views, etc.). But even when the recommendations are highly relevant, their delivery to users can be very problematic. Many existing systems require active user participation (explicit interaction with the recommender system) and attention. Or, on other side of spectrum, there are RS that handle recommendation delivery without any consideration for users' preferences of when, where or how the recommendations are being delivered. Proactive Recommender Systems promise a more autonomous approach for recommendation delivery, by anticipating information needs in advance and acting on users' behalf with minimal efforts and without disturbance. This paper describes our work and interest in identifying and analyzing the factors that can influence acceptance and use of proactively delivered recommendations.},

abstract = {Over the recent years, a plethora of recommender systems (RS) have been proposed by academics. The degree of adoptability of these algorithms by industrial e-commerce platforms remains unclear. To get an insight into real-world recommendation engines, we survey more than 30 existing shopping cart solutions and compare the performance of popular recommendation algorithms on proprietary e-commerce datasets. Our results show that deployed systems rarely go beyond trivial "best seller" lists or very basic personalized recommendation algorithms, which nevertheless exhibit superior performance to more elaborate techniques both in our experiments and other related studies. We also perform chronological dataset splits to demonstrate the importance of preserving the sequence of events during evaluation, and the recency of events during training. The second part of our research is still ongoing and focuses on various ethical challenges that complicate the design of recommender systems. We believe that this direction of research remains mostly neglected despite its increasing impact on RS' quality and safety.},
