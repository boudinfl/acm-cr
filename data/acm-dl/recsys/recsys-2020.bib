abstract = { We explore the vicious cycle of bias on the Web related to search and recommender systems. The first bias is activity bias [1], called by Nielsen participation inequality in Internet [3]. This means that when sampling content, data will have many different types of bias such as gender, language, topic, etc. During the design and implementation of the system, biases might be added, and we call those the true algorithmic bias. In addition, when evaluating the system we may have been biased and hence that may also be reflected in algorithmic bias. The design of the interaction also matters, adding several other biases. All of them affect the data that is gathered for optimizing and personalizing the system [1]. Finally, our own cognitive biases also taint the interaction data, including confirmation bias and other behavioral biases. In all these cases we may need to debias the input data, to use techniques that can handle biased data (e.g., machine learning algorithms tailored for that), or debias the output (when we have already lost information). Most systems are optimized by using implicit user feedback, that is, clicks or other trackable user interactions. However, those interactions are biased to the choices that such systems offer to their users, as clicks can only be done on things that are shown to us. Hence, these feedback loops are tainted by presentation or exposure bias [1]. The most well-known problem related to this bias is called the filter bubble [4] or the echo chamber effect. Solutions to this problem include the explore and exploit paradigm (e.g., learning the world), diversity, novelty, and serendipity. Depending on the exploration technique, the bubble is smaller or bigger [2]. On the other hand, too much exploration also reduces short-term revenue and hence is usually bounded. However, we believe that recommender systems could improve their long-term revenue if significantly more exploration is performed, probably diminishing at the same time the tension between user experience and monetization. This is good for the recommender system but also creates more fair and healthy digital markets for everyone, users and publishers/sellers.},

abstract = {This paper shows a method for building and publishing datasets in commercial services. Datasets contribute to the development of research in machine learning and recommender systems. In particular, because recommender systems play a central role in many commercial services, publishing datasets from the services are in great demand from the recommender system community. However, the publication of datasets by commercial services may have some business risks to those companies. To publish a dataset, this must be approved by a business manager of the service. Because many business managers are not specialists in machine learning or recommender systems, the researchers are responsible for explaining to them the risks and benefits. We first summarize three challenges in building datasets from commercial services: (1) anonymize the business metrics, (2) maintain fairness, and (3) reduce the popularity bias. Then, we formulate the problem of building and publishing datasets as an optimization problem that seeks the sampling weight of users, where the challenges are encoded as appropriate loss functions. We applied our method to build datasets from the raw data of our real-world mobile news delivery service. The raw data has more than 1,000,000 users with 100,000,000 interactions. Each dataset was built in less than 10 minutes. We discussed the properties of our method by checking the statistics of the datasets and the performances of typical recommender system algorithms. },

abstract = { Critiquing is a method for conversational recommendation that incrementally adapts recommendations in response to user preference feedback. Specifically, a user is iteratively provided with item recommendations and attribute descriptions for those items; the user may then either accept the recommendation or choose to critique an attribute to generate a new recommendation. A recent direction known as latent linear critiquing (LLC) takes a modern embedding-based approach that seeks to optimize the combination of user preference embeddings with embeddings of critiques based on subjective item descriptions (i.e., keyphrases from user reviews); LLC does so by exploiting the linear structure of the embeddings to efficiently optimize their weights in a linear programming (LP) formulation. In this paper, we revisit LLC and note that it’s score-based optimization approach inherently encourages extreme weightings in order to maximize predicted score gaps between preferred and non-preferred items. Noting that the overall end task objective in critiquing is to re-rank rather than re-score, in this paper we take a ranking optimization approach that seeks to optimize embedding weights based on observed rank violations from earlier critiquing iterations. We evaluate the proposed framework on two recommendation datasets containing user reviews. Empirical results demonstrate that ranking-based LLC generally outperforms scoring-based LLC and other baselines across a variety of datasets, critiquing styles, and both satisfaction and session-length performance metrics.},

abstract = { With tremendous amount of recommendation algorithms proposed every year, one critical issue has attracted a considerable amount of attention: there are no effective benchmarks for evaluation, which leads to two major concerns, i.e., unreproducible evaluation and unfair comparison. This paper aims to conduct rigorous (i.e., reproducible and fair) evaluation for implicit-feedback based top-N recommendation algorithms. We first systematically review 85 recommendation papers published at eight top-tier conferences (e.g., RecSys, SIGIR) to summarize important evaluation factors, e.g., data splitting and parameter tuning strategies, etc. Through a holistic empirical study, the impacts of different factors on recommendation performance are then analyzed in-depth. Following that, we create benchmarks with standardized procedures and provide the performance of seven well-tuned state-of-the-arts across six metrics on six widely-used datasets as a reference for later study. Additionally, we release a user-friendly Python toolkit, which differs from existing ones in addressing the broad scope of rigorous evaluation for recommendation. Overall, our work sheds light on the issues in recommendation evaluation and lays the foundation for further investigation.

Relevance ranking aims at building a ranked list sorted in decreasing order of item relevance, while result diversification focuses on generating a ranked list of items that covers a broad range of topics. In this paper, we study an online learning setting that aims to recommend a ranked list with K items that maximizes the ranking utility, i.e., a list whose items are relevant and whose topics are diverse. We formulate it as the cascade hybrid bandits&nbsp;(CHB) problem. CHB assumes the cascading user behavior, where a user browses the displayed list from top to bottom, clicks the first attractive item, and stops browsing the rest. We propose a hybrid contextual bandit approach, called , for solving this problem. models item relevance and topical diversity using two independent functions and simultaneously learns those functions from user click feedback. We conduct experiments to evaluate on two real-world recommendation datasets: MovieLens and Yahoo music datasets. Our experimental results show that outperforms the baselines.

abstract = { Modern recommenders usually consider both collaborative features from user behavior data (e.g., clicks) and content information about the users and items (e.g., user ages or item images) for improved recommendations. While encouraging, the uncovered user preference representations derived from these collaborative and content-based perspectives can be entangled by intermixing the influence from each other, leading to sub-optimal performance and unstable recommendations. Hence, we propose to disentangle representations learned from user behavior data and content information. Specifically, we propose a novel two-level disentanglement generative recommendation model (DICER) that supports both content-collaborative disentanglement and feature disentanglement: for the content-collaborative disentanglement, DICER decomposes the features by their marginal distributions based on content and user-item interactions, to ensure the learned features from each type are statistically independent. For feature disentanglement, by decomposing the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we theoretically show that extracted features within each type are disentangled at a granular level. Furthermore, DICER utilizes a co-decoder that simultaneously decodes the content and user-item interactions to ensure the high-quality of learned features. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, results show that DICER significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by 13.5% in NDCG and 14.4% in hit ratio on average.},

abstract = {Recommender systems play an important role in providing an engaging experience on online music streaming services. However, the musical domain presents distinctive challenges to recommender systems: tracks are short, listened to multiple times, typically consumed in sessions with other tracks, and relevance is highly context-dependent. In this paper, we argue that modeling users’ preferences at the beginning of a session is a practical and effective way to address these challenges. Using a dataset from Spotify, a popular music streaming service, we observe that a) consumption from the recent past and b) session-level contextual variables (such as the time of the day or the type of device used) are indeed predictive of the tracks a user will stream—much more so than static, average preferences. Driven by these findings, we propose CoSeRNN, a neural network architecture that models users’ preferences as a sequence of embeddings, one for each session. CoSeRNN predicts, at the beginning of a session, a preference vector, based on past consumption history and current context. This preference vector can then be used in downstream tasks to generate contextually relevant just-in-time recommendations efficiently, by using approximate nearest-neighbour search algorithms. We evaluate CoSeRNN on session and track ranking tasks, and find that it outperforms the current state of the art by upwards of 10% on different ranking metrics. Dissecting the performance of our approach, we find that sequential and contextual information are both crucial. },

abstract = { Online recommendation services recommend multiple commodities to users. Nowadays, a considerable proportion of users visit e-commerce platforms by mobile devices. Due to the limited screen size of mobile devices, positions of items have a significant influence on clicks: 1) Higher positions lead to more clicks for one commodity. 2) The ‘pseudo-exposure’ issue: Only a few recommended items are shown at first glance and users need to slide the screen to browse other items. Therefore, some recommended items ranked behind are not viewed by users and it is not proper to treat this kind of items as negative samples. While many works model the online recommendation as contextual bandit problems, they rarely take the influence of positions into consideration and thus the estimation of the reward function may be biased. In this paper, we aim at addressing these two issues to improve the performance of online mobile recommendation. Our contributions are four-fold. First, since we concern the reward of a set of recommended items, we model the online recommendation as a contextual combinatorial bandit problem and define the reward of a recommended set. Second, we propose a novel contextual combinatorial bandit method called UBM-LinUCB to address two issues related to positions by adopting the User Browsing Model (UBM), a click model for web search. Third, we provide a formal regret analysis and prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret independent of the number of items. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on two real-world datasets by a novel unbiased estimator. An online experiment is also implemented in Taobao, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the world. Results on two CTR metrics show that our algorithm outperforms the other contextual bandit algorithms.},

abstract = { Post-click conversion, a pre-defined action on a web service after a click, is an essential form of feedback, as it directly contributes to the final revenue and accurately captures user preferences for items, compared with the ambiguous click. However, naively using post-click conversions can lead to severe bias when learning or evaluating recommenders because of the selection bias between clicked and unclicked data. In this study, we address the offline evaluation problem of algorithmic recommendations with biased post-click conversions. A possible solution to address this bias is to use the inverse propensity score estimator, as it can provide an unbiased evaluation even with the selection bias. However, this estimator is known to be subject to variance and instability problems, which can be severe in the recommendation setting, as feedback is often highly sparse. To address these limitations with the previous unbiased estimator, we propose a doubly robust estimator for the ground-truth ranking performance of a given recommender. The proposed estimator is unbiased against the ground-truth ranking metric and improves the variance and estimation error tail bound of the existing unbiased estimator. Finally, to evaluate the empirical efficacy of the proposed estimator, we conduct empirical evaluations using semi-synthetic and two public real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed metric reveals a better model evaluation performance compared with existing baseline metrics, particularly in a situation with severe selection bias.},

abstract = { For group recommendations, one objective is to recommend an ordered set of items, a top-N, to a group such that each individual recommendation is relevant for everyone. A common way to do this is to select items on which the group can agree, using so-called ‘aggregation strategies’. One weakness of these aggregation strategies is that they select items independently of each other. They therefore cannot guarantee properties such as fairness, that apply to the set of recommendations as a whole. In this paper, we give a definition of fairness that ‘balances’ the relevance of the recommended items across the group members in a rank-sensitive way. Informally, an ordered set of recommended items is considered fair to a group if the relevance of the items in the top-N is balanced across the group members for each prefix of the top-N. In other words, the first item in the top-N should, as far as possible, balance the interests of all group members; the first two items taken together must do the same; also the first three; and so on up to N. In this paper, we formalize this notion of rank-sensitive balance and provide a greedy algorithm (GFAR) for finding a top-N set of group recommendations that satisfies our definition. We compare the performance of GFAR to five approaches from the literature on two datasets, one from each of the movie and music domains. We evaluate performance for 42 different configurations (two datasets, seven different group sizes, three different group types) and for ten evaluation metrics. We find that GFAR performs significantly better than all other algorithms around 43% of the time; in only 10% of cases are there algorithms that are significantly better than GFAR. Furthermore, GFAR performs particularly well in the most difficult cases, where groups are large and interests within the group diverge. We attribute GFAR’s success both to its rank-sensitivity and its way of balancing relevance. Current methods do not define fairness in a rank-sensitive way (although some achieve a degree of rank-sensitivity through the use of greedy algorithms) and none define balance in the way that we do.},

Recent work extends stacking to use additional user performance predictors (e.g., the total number of ratings made by the user) to help determine how much each base recommender should contribute to the ensemble. Nonetheless, despite the cost of handcrafting discriminative predictors, which typically requires deep knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses of each recommender in the ensemble, only minor improvements have been observed. To overcome this limitation, instead of engineering complex features to predict the performance of different recommenders for a given user, we propose to directly estimate these performances by leveraging the user’s own historical ratings. Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple domains demonstrate that using performance estimates as additional features can significantly improve the accuracy of state-of-the-art ensemblers, achieving nDCG@20 improvements by an average of 23% over not using them.},

Cluster-of-bandit policy aims to maximize the cumulative feedback, e.g., clicks, from users. Nevertheless, in the way of their goal exist two kinds of uncertainties. First, cluster-of-bandit algorithms make recommendations according to their uncertain estimation of user interests. Second, cluster-of-bandit algorithms transfer relevant knowledge upon uncertain and noisy user clusters. Existing algorithms only consider the first one, while leaving the latter one untouched. To address the two challenges together, in this paper, we propose the ClexB policy for online RecSys. On the one hand, ClexB estimates user clustering more accurately and with less uncertainty via explorable-clustering. On the other hand, ClexB also exploits and explores user interests by sharing information within and among user clusters. In summary, ClexB explores knowledge transfer and further aids the inferences about user interests. Besides, we provide extensive empirical experiments on both the synthetic and real-world datasets and regret analysis, further consolidating the superiority of ClexB.},

abstract = { Sequential recommendation has been a hot research topic because of its practicability and high accuracy by capturing the sequential information. As deep learning (DL) based methods being widely adopted to model the local and dynamic preferences beneath users’ behavior sequences, the modeling of users’ global and static preferences tends to be underestimated that usually, only some simple and crude users’ latent representations are introduced. Moreover, most existing methods hold an assumption that users’ intention can be fully captured by considering the historical behaviors, while neglect the possible uncertainty of users’ intention in reality, which may be influenced by the appearance of the candidate items to be recommended. In this paper, we thus focus on these two issues, i.e., the imperfect modeling of users’ global preferences in most DL-based sequential recommendation methods and the uncertainty of users’ intention brought by the candidate items, and propose a novel solution named fusing item similarity models with self-attention networks (FISSA) for sequential recommendation. Specifically, we treat the state-of-the-art self-attentive sequential recommendation (SASRec) model as the local representation learning module to capture the dynamic preferences beneath users’ behavior sequences in our FISSA, and further propose a global representation learning module to improve the modeling of users’ global preferences and a gating module that balances the local and global representations by taking the information of the candidate items into account. The global representation learning module can be seen as a location-based attention layer, which is effective to fit in well with the parallelization training process of the self-attention framework. The gating module calculates the weight by modeling the relationship among the candidate item, the recently interacted item and the global preference of each user using an MLP layer. Extensive empirical studies on five commonly used datasets show that our FISSA significantly outperforms eight state-of-the-art baselines in terms of two commonly used metrics.},

abstract = {E-commerce applications rely heavily on session-based recommendation algorithms to improve the shopping experience of their customers. Recent progress in session-based recommendation algorithms shows great promise. However, translating that promise to real-world outcomes is a challenging task for several reasons, but mostly due to the large number and varying characteristics of the available models. In this paper, we discuss the approach and lessons learned from the process of identifying and deploying a successful session-based recommendation algorithm for a leading e-commerce application in the home-improvement domain. To this end, we initially evaluate fourteen session-based recommendation algorithms in an offline setting using eight different popular evaluation metrics on three datasets. The results indicate that offline evaluation does not provide enough insight to make an informed decision since there is no clear winning method on all metrics. Additionally, we observe that standard offline evaluation metrics fall short for this application. Specifically, they reward an algorithm only when it predicts the exact same item that the user clicked next or eventually purchased. In a practical scenario, however, there are near-identical products which, although they are assigned different identifiers, they should be considered as equally-good recommendations. To overcome these limitations, we perform an additional round of evaluation, where human experts provide both objective and subjective feedback for the recommendations of five algorithms that performed the best in the offline evaluation. We find that the experts’ opinion is oftentimes different from the offline evaluation results. Analysis of the feedback confirms that the performance of all models is significantly higher when we evaluate near-identical product recommendations as relevant. Finally, we run an A/B test with one of the models that performed the best in the human evaluation phase. The treatment model increased conversion rate by 15.6% and revenue per visit by 18.5% when compared with a leading third-party solution. },

abstract = { Collaborative bandit learning has become an emerging focus for personalized recommendation. It leverages user dependence for joint model estimation and recommendation. As such online learning solutions directly learn from users, e.g., result clicks, they bring in new challenges in privacy protection. Despite the existence of recent studies about privacy in contextual bandit algorithms, how to efficiently protect user privacy in a collaborative bandit learning environment remains unknown. In this paper, we develop a general solution framework to achieve differential privacy in collaborative bandit algorithms, under the notion of global differential privacy and local differential privacy. The key idea is to inject noise in a bandit model’s sufficient statistics (either on server side to achieve global differential privacy or client side to achieve local differential privacy) and calibrate the noise scale with respect to the structure of collaboration among users. We study two popularly used collaborative bandit algorithms to illustrate the application of our solution framework. Theoretical analysis proves our derived private algorithms reduce the added regret caused by privacy-preserving mechanism compared to its linear bandits counterparts, i.e., collaboration actually helps to achieve stronger privacy with the same amount of injected noise. We also empirically evaluate the algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the trade-off between privacy and utility. },

abstract = { Recent times have seen data analytics software applications become an integral part of the decision-making process of analysts. The users of these software applications generate a vast amount of unstructured log data. These logs contain clues to the user’s goals, which traditional recommender systems may find difficult to model implicitly from the log data. With this assumption, we would like to assist the analytics process of a user through command recommendations. We categorize the commands into software and data categories based on their purpose to fulfill the task at hand. On the premise that the sequence of commands leading up to a data command is a good predictor of the latter, we design, develop, and validate various sequence modeling techniques. In this paper, we propose a framework to provide goal-driven data command recommendations to the user by leveraging unstructured logs. We use the log data of a web-based analytics software to train our neural network models and quantify their performance, in comparison to relevant and competitive baselines. We propose a custom loss function to tailor the recommended data commands according to the goal information provided exogenously. We also propose an evaluation metric that captures the degree of goal orientation of the recommendations. We demonstrate the promise of our approach by evaluating the models with the proposed metric and showcasing the robustness of our models in the case of adversarial examples, where the user activity is misaligned with selected goal, through offline evaluation.},

They are commonly used in online dating, social networks and recruitment services. The main difference between these and conventional user-item recommenders that might be found on, for example, a shopping service, is that they must consider the interests of both parties. In this study, we present a novel method of making reciprocal recommendations based on image data. Given a user’s history of positive and negative preference expressions on other users images, we train a siamese network to identify images that fit a user’s personal preferences. We provide an algorithm to interpret those individual preference indicators into a single reciprocal preference relation. Our evaluation was performed on a large real-world dataset provided by a popular online dating service. Based on this, our service significantly improves on previous state-of-the-art content-based solutions, and also out-performs collaborative filtering solutions in cold-start situations. The success of this model provides empirical evidence for the high importance of images in online dating.},

The system supports users’ decision-making process by offering functions for comparing product features between items, both physical and online, and by providing recommendations based on selecting in-store products. The physical products may thus serve as anchors for forming the user’s preferences, also offering a richer and more engaging experience when exploring the products hands-on. Both objective product attributes as well as the visual appearance of a physical product are employed for generating recommendations from the online space. In this way, the advantages of online and in-store shopping can be combined, creating novel multi-channel opportunities for businesses. An empirical evaluation showed that the comparison and recommendation functions were appreciated by users, and hinted some possible benefits of a hybrid physical-online shopping support system. Despite the limitations of the study, there is sufficient evidence to consider this a viable approach worth to be further explored.},

abstract = { Reinforcement learning for recommendation (RL4Rec) methods are increasingly receiving attention as an effective way to improve long-term user engagement. However, applying RL4Rec online comes with risks: exploration may lead to periods of detrimental user experience. Moreover, few researchers have access to real-world recommender systems. Simulations have been put forward as a solution where user feedback is simulated based on logged historical user data, thus enabling optimization and evaluation without being run online. While simulators do not risk the user experience and are widely accessible, we identify an important limitation of existing simulation methods. They ignore the interaction biases present in logged user data, and consequently, these biases affect the resulting simulation. As a solution to this issue, we introduce a debiasing step in the simulation pipeline, which corrects for the biases present in the logged data before it is used to simulate user behavior. To evaluate the effects of bias on RL4Rec simulations, we propose a novel evaluation approach for simulators that considers the performance of policies optimized with the simulator. Our results reveal that the biases from logged data negatively impact the resulting policies, unless corrected for with our debiasing method. While our debiasing methods can be applied to any simulator, we make our complete pipeline publicly available as the Simulator for OFfline leArning and evaluation (SOFA): the first simulator that accounts for interaction biases prior to optimization and evaluation.},

abstract = { News articles usually contain knowledge entities such as celebrities or organizations. Important entities in articles carry key messages and help to understand the content in a more direct way. An industrial news recommender system contains various key applications, such as personalized recommendation, item-to-item recommendation, news category classification, news popularity prediction and local news detection. We find that incorporating knowledge entities for better document understanding benefits these applications consistently. However, existing document understanding models either represent news articles without considering knowledge entities (e.g., BERT) or rely on a specific type of text encoding model (e.g., DKN) so that the generalization ability and efficiency is compromised. In this paper, we propose KRED, which is a fast and effective model to enhance arbitrary document representation with a knowledge graph. KRED first enriches entities’ embeddings by attentively aggregating information from their neighborhood in the knowledge graph. Then a context embedding layer is applied to annotate the dynamic context of different entities such as frequency, category and position. Finally, an information distillation layer aggregates the entity embeddings under the guidance of the original document representation and transforms the document vector into a new one. We advocate to optimize the model with a multi-task framework, so that different news recommendation applications can be united and useful information can be shared across different tasks. Experiments on a real-world Microsoft News dataset demonstrate that KRED greatly benefits a variety of news recommendation applications.},

abstract = { With the rise of online e-commerce platforms, more and more customers prefer to shop online. To sell more products, online platforms introduce various modules to recommend items with different properties such as huge discounts. A web page often consists of different independent modules. The ranking policies of these modules are decided by different teams and optimized individually without cooperation, which might result in competition between modules. Thus, the global policy of the whole page could be sub-optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent cooperative reinforcement learning approach with the restriction that different modules cannot communicate. Our contributions are three-fold. Firstly, inspired by a solution concept in game theory named correlated equilibrium, we design a signal network to promote cooperation of all modules by generating signals (vectors) for different modules. Secondly, an entropy-regularized version of the signal network is proposed to coordinate agents’ exploration of the optimal global policy. Furthermore, experiments based on real-world e-commerce data demonstrate that our algorithm obtains superior performance over baselines.},

In this paper, we propose a novel formulation of interpretable deep neural networks for the attribution task. Differently to popular post-hoc methods, our approach is interpretable by design. Using masked weights, hidden features can be deeply attributed, split into several input-restricted sub-networks and trained as a boosted mixture of experts. Experimental results on synthetic data and real-world recommendation tasks demonstrate that our method enables to build models achieving close predictive performances to their non-interpretable counterparts, while providing informative attribution interpretations.},

abstract = {In auction-based systems such as in used car centers and online auction websites, users usually bid on items, and those items get sold to their highest bidders. In these settings, every item is unique and can be sold only once, which means users’ purchase histories will be unique, and no common items will exist across them. On the other hand, items will not have any historical sales at all. Such extreme settings pose a significant challenge to the current recommender systems models that rely on historical user-item interactions. While some of those models will not be applicable altogether, such as the matrix factorization models, neighborhood models, and even the naive most-popular model, the rest will need to rely only on items’ attributes. In this paper, we address the challenges of auction-based item recommendation by proposing a simple multi-relational recommender model (MultiRec) that can seamlessly leverage user and item attributes along with auxiliary relational information such as the user’s bidding history. Experiments on one proprietary dataset from Volkswagen Financial Services used-cars center, and on a real-world publicly available eBay dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms multiple state-of-art models in the task of auction-based unique item recommendation. },

abstract = { Embedding based models have been the state of the art in collaborative filtering for over a decade. Traditionally, the dot product or higher order equivalents have been used to combine two or more embeddings, e.g., most notably in matrix factorization. In recent years, it was suggested to replace the dot product with a learned similarity e.g. using a multilayer perceptron (MLP). This approach is often referred to as neural collaborative filtering (NCF). In this work, we revisit the experiments of the NCF paper that popularized learned similarities using MLPs. First, we show that with a proper hyperparameter selection, a simple dot product substantially outperforms the proposed learned similarities. Second, while a MLP can in theory approximate any function, we show that it is non-trivial to learn a dot product with an MLP. Finally, we discuss practical issues that arise when applying MLP based similarities and show that MLPs are too costly to use for item recommendation in production environments while dot products allow to apply very efficient retrieval algorithms. We conclude that MLPs should be used with care as embedding combiner and that dot products might be a better default choice.},

abstract = { Delivering treatment recommendations via pervasive electronic devices such as mobile phones has the potential to be a viable and scalable treatment medium for long-term health behavior management. But active experimentation of treatment options can be time-consuming, expensive and altogether unethical in some cases. There is a growing interest in methodological approaches that allow an experimenter to learn and evaluate the usefulness of a new treatment strategy before deployment. We present the first development of a treatment recommender system for emotion regulation using real-world historical mobile digital data from n = 114 high socially anxious participants to test the usefulness of new emotion regulation strategies. We explore a number of offline contextual bandits estimators for learning and propose a general framework for learning algorithms. Our experimentation shows that the proposed doubly robust offline learning algorithms performed significantly better than baseline approaches, suggesting that this type of recommender algorithm could improve emotion regulation. Given that emotion regulation is impaired across many mental illnesses and such a recommender algorithm could be scaled up easily, this approach holds potential to increase access to treatment for many people. We also share some insights that allow us to translate contextual bandit models to this complex real-world data, including which contextual features appear to be most important for predicting emotion regulation strategy effectiveness.},

We find that comparative evaluation using reduced target sets contradicts in many cases the corresponding outcome using large targets, and we provide a principled explanation for these disagreements. We further seek to determine which among the contradicting results may be more reliable. Through comparison to unbiased evaluation, we find that minimum target sets incur in substantial distortion in pairwise system comparisons, while maximum sets may not be ideal either, and better options may lie in between the extremes. We further find means for informing the target size setting in the common case where unbiased evaluation is not possible, by an assessment of the discriminative power of evaluation, that remarkably aligns with the agreement with unbiased evaluation.},

abstract = { Multi-task learning (MTL) has been successfully applied to many recommendation applications. However, MTL models often suffer from performance degeneration with negative transfer due to the complex and competing task correlation in real-world recommender systems. Moreover, through extensive experiments across SOTA MTL models, we have observed an interesting seesaw phenomenon that performance of one task is often improved by hurting the performance of some other tasks. To address these issues, we propose a Progressive Layered Extraction (PLE) model with a novel sharing structure design. PLE separates shared components and task-specific components explicitly and adopts a progressive routing mechanism to extract and separate deeper semantic knowledge gradually, improving efficiency of joint representation learning and information routing across tasks in a general setup. We apply PLE to both complicatedly correlated and normally correlated tasks, ranging from two-task cases to multi-task cases on a real-world Tencent video recommendation dataset with 1 billion samples, and results show that PLE outperforms state-of-the-art MTL models significantly under different task correlations and task-group size. Furthermore, online evaluation of PLE on a large-scale content recommendation platform at Tencent manifests 2.23% increase in view-count and 1.84% increase in watch time compared to SOTA MTL models, which is a significant improvement and demonstrates the effectiveness of PLE. Finally, extensive offline experiments on public benchmark datasets demonstrate that PLE can be applied to a variety of scenarios besides recommendations to eliminate the seesaw phenomenon. PLE now has been deployed to the online video recommender system in Tencent successfully.},

abstract = { Classical recommender system methods typically face the filter bubble problem when users only receive recommendations of their familiar items, making them bored and dissatisfied. To address the filter bubble problem, unexpected recommendations have been proposed to recommend items significantly deviating from user’s prior expectations and thus surprising them by presenting ”fresh” and previously unexplored items to the users. In this paper, we describe a novel Personalized Unexpected Recommender System (PURS) model that incorporates unexpectedness into the recommendation process by providing multi-cluster modeling of user interests in the latent space and personalized unexpectedness via the self-attention mechanism and via selection of an appropriate unexpected activation function. Extensive offline experiments on three real-world datasets illustrate that the proposed PURS model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline approaches in terms of both accuracy and unexpectedness measures. In addition, we conduct an online A/B test at a major video platform Alibaba-Youku, where our model achieves over 3% increase in the average video view per user metric. The proposed model is in the process of being deployed by the company.},

abstract = { We argue that most recommendation approaches can be abstracted as a graph exploration problem. In particular, we describe a graph-theoretic framework with two primary parts: (a) a recommendation graph, modeling all the elements of an (application) domain from a recommendation perspective, including the subjects and objects of recommendations as well as the relationships between them; (b) a set of path operations, inferring new edges, i.e., implicit or unknown relationships, by traversing and combining paths on the graph. The resulting path algebra model provides an abstraction and a common foundation that is beneficial to three aspects of recommendations: (a) expressive power - expression and subsequent use of several significantly different, existing but also novel recommendation approaches is reduced to parameterizing a unique model; (b) usability - by capturing part of the recommendation mechanisms in the underlying path algebra semantics, specification of recommendation approaches becomes easier and less tedious; (c) processing speed - implementing recommender systems on top of graph engines opens up the door for several optimizations that speed up execution. We demonstrate the above benefits by expressing several categories of recommendation approaches in the path algebra model and benchmarking some of them in a recommender system implemented on top of Neo4J, a widely used graph system.},

However, adequately exploiting the clues hidden in the sequences of actions of user sessions in order to reveal users’ short-term intentions moved only recently into the focus of research. Based on a real-world application scenario, in this paper, we propose a Markov Chain-based transition probability matrix to efficiently reveal the short-term preferences of individuals. We experimentally evaluated our proposed method by comparing it against state-of-the-art algorithms in an offline as well as a live evaluation setting. In both cases our method not only demonstrated its superiority over its competitors, but exposed a clearly stronger engagement of users on the platform. In the online setting, our method improved the click-through rate by up to 93.61%. This paper therefore contributes real-world evidence for improving the recommendation effectiveness, by considering sequence-awareness, since capturing the short-term preferences of users is crucial in the light of items with a short life span such as tv programs (news, tv shows, etc.).},

The framework is flexible and can accommodate complexity in real-world locational choice data such as variability in the number of tickets purchased and the number and locations from past purchases.

While increasing research is dedicated to improving the relevance and diversity of the recommendations, the potential risks of state-of-the-art recommendation models are under-explored, that is, these models could be subject to attacks from malicious third parties, through injecting fake user interactions to achieve their purposes. This paper revisits the adversarially-learned injection attack problem, where the injected fake user ‘behaviors’ are learned locally by the attackers with their own model – one that is potentially different from the model under attack, but shares similar properties to allow attack transfer. We found that most existing works in literature suffer from two major limitations: (1) they do not solve the optimization problem precisely, making the attack less harmful than it could be, (2) they assume perfect knowledge for the attack, causing the lack of understanding for realistic attack capabilities. We demonstrate that the exact solution for generating fake users as an optimization problem could lead to a much larger impact. Our experiments on a real-world dataset reveal important properties of the attack, including attack transferability and its limitations. These findings can inspire useful defensive methods against this possible existing attack.},

abstract = { Temporal information is crucial for recommendation problems because user preferences are naturally dynamic in the real world. Recent advances in deep learning, especially the discovery of various attention mechanisms and newer architectures in addition to widely used RNN and CNN in natural language processing, have allowed for better use of the temporal ordering of items that each user has engaged with. In particular, the SASRec model, inspired by the popular Transformer model in natural languages processing, has achieved state-of-the-art results. However, SASRec, just like the original Transformer model, is inherently an un-personalized model and does not include personalized user embeddings. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Personalized Transformer (SSE-PT) model, outperforming SASRec by almost 5% in terms of NDCG@10 on 5 real-world datasets. Furthermore, after examining some random users’ engagement history, we find our model not only more interpretable but also able to focus on recent engagement patterns for each user. Moreover, our SSE-PT model with a slight modification, which we call SSE-PT++, can handle extremely long sequences and outperform SASRec in ranking results with comparable training speed, striking a balance between performance and speed requirements. Our novel application of the Stochastic Shared Embeddings (SSE) regularization is essential to the success of personalization.

abstract = { Collaborative filtering with implicit feedback is a ubiquitous class of recommendation problems where only positive interactions such as purchases or clicks are observed. Autoencoder-based recommendation models have shown strong performance on many implicit feedback benchmarks. However, these models tend to suffer from popularity bias making recommendations less personalized. User-generated reviews contain a rich source of preference information, often with specific details that are important to each user, and can help mitigate the popularity bias. Since not all reviews are equally useful, existing work has been exploring various forms of attention to distill relevant information. In the majority of proposed approaches, representations from implicit feedback and review branches are simply concatenated at the end to generate predictions. This can prevent the model from learning deeper correlations between the two modalities and affect prediction accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a novel Two-headed Attention Fused Autoencoder (TAFA) model that jointly learns representations from user reviews and implicit feedback to make recommendations. We apply early and late modality fusion which allows the model to fully correlate and extract relevant information from both input sources. To further combat popularity bias, we leverage the Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective to “de-popularize” the fused user representation via a two-headed decoder architecture. Empirically, we show that TAFA outperforms leading baselines on multiple real-world benchmarks. Moreover, by tracing attention weights back to reviews we can provide explanations for the generated recommendations and gain further insights into user preferences.

Several studies have dealt with these biases by designing methods to mitigate their effect on the recommendations. However, most existing studies do not consider the iterative behavior of the system where the closed feedback loop plays a crucial role in incorporating different biases into several parts of the recommendation steps. We present a theoretical framework to model the asymptotic evolution of the different components of a recommender system operating within a feedback loop setting, and derive theoretical bounds and convergence properties on quantifiable measures of the user discovery and blind spots. We also validate our theoretical findings empirically using a real-life dataset and empirically test the efficiency of a basic exploration strategy within our theoretical framework. Our findings lay the theoretical basis for quantifying the effect of feedback loops and for designing Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms that explicitly incorporate the iterative nature of feedback loops in the machine learning and recommendation process.},

abstract = { The COVID-19 pandemic has made it paramount to maintain social distance to limit the viral transmission probability. At the same time, local businesses (e.g., restaurants, cafes, stores, malls) need to operate to ensure their economic sustainability. Considering the wide usage of local recommendation platforms like Google Local and Yelp by customers to choose local businesses, we propose to design local recommendation systems which can help in achieving both safety and sustainability goals. Our investigation of existing local recommendation systems shows that they can lead to overcrowding at some businesses compromising customer safety, and very low footfall at other places threatening their economic sustainability. On the other hand, naive ways of ensuring safety and sustainability can cause significant loss in recommendation utility for the customers. Thus, we formally express the problem as a multi-objective optimization problem and solve by innovatively mapping it to a bipartite matching problem with polynomial time solutions. Extensive experiments over multiple real-world datasets reveal the efficacy of our approach along with the three-way control over sustainability, safety, and utility goals.},

In many real-world applications, because an ad placed in various positions has different click probabilities, the position information should be considered in both training and prediction. For such position-aware systems, existing approaches learn CTR models from clicks/not-clicks on historically displayed events by leveraging the position information in different ways. In this work, we explain that these approaches may give a heavily biased model. We first point out that in position-aware systems, two different types of selection biases coexist in displayed events. Secondly, we explain that some approaches attempting to eliminate the position effect from clicks/not-clicks may possess an additional bias. Finally, to obtain an unbiased CTR model for position-aware systems, we propose a novel counterfactual learning framework. Experiments confirm both our analysis on selection biases and the effectiveness of our proposed counterfactual learning framework.},

abstract = { Increasing users’ positive interactions, such as purchases or clicks, is an important objective of recommender systems. Recommenders typically aim to select items that users will interact with. If the recommended items are purchased, an increase in sales is expected. However, the items could have been purchased even without recommendation. Thus, we want to recommend items that results in purchases caused by recommendation. This can be formulated as a ranking problem in terms of the causal effect. Despite its importance, this problem has not been well explored in the related research. It is challenging because the ground truth of causal effect is unobservable, and estimating the causal effect is prone to the bias arising from currently deployed recommenders. This paper proposes an unbiased learning framework for the causal effect of recommendation. Based on the inverse propensity scoring technique, the proposed framework first constructs unbiased estimators for ranking metrics. Then, it conducts empirical risk minimization on the estimators with propensity capping, which reduces variance under finite training samples. Based on the framework, we develop an unbiased learning method for the causal effect extension of a ranking metric. We theoretically analyze the unbiasedness of the proposed method and empirically demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other biased learning methods in various settings.},

abstract = { Heavily pre-trained transformer models such as BERT have recently shown to be remarkably powerful at language modelling, achieving impressive results on numerous downstream tasks. It has also been shown that they implicitly store factual knowledge in their parameters after pre-training. Understanding what the pre-training procedure of LMs actually learns is a crucial step for using and improving them for Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS). We first study how much off-the-shelf pre-trained BERT “knows” about recommendation items such as books, movies and music. In order to analyze the knowledge stored in BERT’s parameters, we use different probes (i.e., tasks to examine a trained model regarding certain properties) that require different types of knowledge to solve, namely content-based and collaborative-based. Content-based knowledge is knowledge that requires the model to match the titles of items with their content information, such as textual descriptions and genres. In contrast, collaborative-based knowledge requires the model to match items with similar ones, according to community interactions such as ratings. We resort to BERT’s Masked Language Modelling (MLM) head to probe its knowledge about the genre of items, with cloze style prompts. In addition, we employ BERT’s Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) head and representations’ similarity (SIM) to compare relevant and non-relevant search and recommendation query-document inputs to explore whether BERT can, without any fine-tuning, rank relevant items first. Finally, we study how BERT performs in a conversational recommendation downstream task. To this end, we fine-tune BERT to act as a retrieval-based CRS. Overall, our experiments show that: (i) BERT has knowledge stored in its parameters about the content of books, movies and music; (ii) it has more content-based knowledge than collaborative-based knowledge; and (iii) fails on conversational recommendation when faced with adversarial data.},

In this paper, we explore this trade-off, seeking new ways for people to express their preferences with the goal of improving communication channels between users and the recommender system. Through a need-finding study, we observe the patterns in how people express their preferences during curation task, propose a taxonomy for organizing them, and point out research opportunities. We present a case study that illustrates how using this taxonomy to design an onboarding experience can lead to more accurate machine-learned recommendations while maintaining user satisfaction under low effort. },

abstract = {Session-based recommendation has received growing attention recently due to the increasing privacy concern. Despite the recent success of neural session-based recommenders, they are typically developed in an offline manner using a static dataset. However, recommendation requires continual adaptation to take into account new and obsolete items and users, and requires “continual learning” in real-life applications. In this case, the recommender is updated continually and periodically with new data that arrives in each update cycle, and the updated model needs to provide recommendations for user activities before the next model update. A major challenge for continual learning with neural models is catastrophic forgetting, in which a continually trained model forgets user preference patterns it has learned before. To deal with this challenge, we propose a method called Adaptively Distilled Exemplar Replay (ADER) by periodically replaying previous training samples (i.e., exemplars) to the current model with an adaptive distillation loss. Experiments are conducted based on the state-of-the-art SASRec model using two widely used datasets to benchmark ADER with several well-known continual learning techniques. We empirically demonstrate that ADER consistently outperforms other baselines, and it even outperforms the method using all historical data at every update cycle. This result reveals that ADER is a promising solution to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting issue towards building more realistic and scalable session-based recommenders. },

It basically consists of a surrogate loss that models how to select and combine these two approaches adaptively, depending on the context (query or user, pair of items, etc.). In other words, given a training instance, which is typically a triplet (a query/user and two items with different preferences or relevance grades), the strategy adaptively determines whether it is better to focus on the “most preferred” item (pointwise - positive instance), on the “less preferred” one (pointwise - negative instance) or on the pair (pairwise), or on anything else in between these 3 extreme alternatives. We formulate this adaptive strategy as minimizing a particular loss function that generalizes simultaneously the traditional pointwise and pairwise loss functions (negative log-likelihood) through a mixture coefficient. This coefficient is formulated as a learnable function of the features associated to the triplet. Experimental results on several real-world news recommendation datasets show clear improvements over several pointwise, pairwise, and listwise approaches.},

abstract = { Media services providers, such as music streaming platforms, frequently leverage swipeable carousels to recommend personalized content to their users. However, selecting the most relevant items (albums, artists, playlists...) to display in these carousels is a challenging task, as items are numerous and as users have different preferences. In this paper, we model carousel personalization as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem with multiple plays, stochastic arm display and delayed batch feedback. We empirically show the effectiveness of our framework at capturing characteristics of real-world carousels by addressing a large-scale playlist recommendation task on a global music streaming mobile app. Along with this paper, we publicly release industrial data from our experiments, as well as an open-source environment to simulate comparable carousel personalization learning problems.},

However, its spirit is to answer a counterfactual question: “What would the rating be if we ‘forced’ the user to watch the movie?” This is a question about an intervention, that is a causal inference question. The key challenge of this causal inference is unobserved confounders, variables that affect both which items the users decide to interact with and how they rate them. To this end, we develop an algorithm that leverages classical recommendation models for causal recommendation. Across simulated and real datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more robust to unobserved confounders and improves recommendation.},

abstract = {Nowadays we commonly have multiple sources of data associated with items. Users may provide numerical ratings, or implicit interactions, but may also provide textual reviews. Although many algorithms have been proposed to jointly learn a model over both interactions and textual data, there is room to improve the many factorization models that are proven to work well on interactions data, but are not designed to exploit textual information. Our focus in this work is to propose a simple, yet easily applicable and effective, method to incorporate review data into such factorization models. In particular, we propose to build the user and item embeddings within the topic space of a topic model learned from the review data. This has several advantages: we observe that initializing the user and item embeddings in topic space leads to faster convergence of the factorization algorithm to a model that out-performs models initialized randomly, or with other state-of-the-art initialization strategies. Moreover, constraining user and item factors to topic space allows for the learning of an interpretable model that users can visualise. },

abstract = {Recommendation systems operate in a highly stochastic and non-stationary environment. As the amount of user-specific information varies, the users’ interests themselves also change. This combination creates a dynamic setting where a single solution will rarely be optimal unless it can keep up with these transformations. One system may perform better than others depending on the situation at hand, thus making the choice of which system to deploy, even more difficult. We address these problems by using the Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework. Our proposed meta-bandit acts as a policy over options, where each option maps to a pre-trained, independent recommender system. This meta-bandit learns online and selects a recommender accordingly to the context, adjusting to the situation. We conducted experiments on real data and found that our approach manages to address the dynamics within the user’s changing interests. We also show that it outperforms any of the recommenders separately, as well as an ensemble of them. },

abstract = { Improving user satisfaction is at the forefront of industrial recommender systems. While significant progress has been made by utilizing logged implicit data of user-item interactions (i.e., clicks, dwell/watch time, and other user engagement signals), there has been a recent surge of interest in measuring and modeling user satisfaction, as provided by orthogonal data sources. Such data sources typically originate from responses to user satisfaction surveys, which explicitly ask users to rate their experience with the system and/or specific items they have consumed in the recent past. This data can be valuable for measuring and modeling the degree to which a user has had a satisfactory experience on the recommendation platform, since what users do (engagement) does not always align with what users say they want (satisfaction as measured by surveys). We focus on a large-scale industrial system trained on user survey responses to predict user satisfaction. The predictions of the satisfaction model for each user-item pair, combined with the predictions of the other models (e.g., engagement-focused ones), are fed into the ranking component of a real-world recommender system in deciding items to present to the user. It is therefore imperative that the satisfaction model does an equally good job on imputing user satisfaction across slices of users and items, as it would directly impact which items a user is exposed to. However, the data used for training satisfaction models is biased in that users are more likely to respond to a survey when they will respond that they are more satisfied. When the satisfaction survey responses in slices of data with high response rate follow a different distribution than those with low response rate, response rate becomes a confounding factor for user satisfaction estimation. We find positive correlation between response rate and ratings in a large-scale survey dataset collected in our case study. To address this inherent response rate bias in the satisfaction data, we propose an inverse propensity weighting approach within a multi-task learning framework. We extend a simple feed-forward neural network architecture predicting user satisfaction to a shared-bottom multi-task learning architecture with two tasks: the user satisfaction estimation task, and the response rate estimation task. We concurrently train these two tasks, and use the inverse of the predictions of the response rate task as loss weights for the satisfaction task to address the response rate bias. We showcase that by doing this, (i) we can accurately model whether a user will respond to a survey, (ii) we improve the user satisfaction estimation error for the data slices with lower response rate while not hurting slices with higher response rate, and (iii) we demonstrate in live A/B experiments that applying the resulting satisfaction predictions to rank recommendations translates to higher user satisfaction. },

abstract = { Recommender systems trained in a continuous learning fashion are plagued by the feedback loop problem, also known as algorithmic bias. This causes a newly trained model to act greedily and favor items that have already been engaged by users. This behavior is particularly harmful in personalised ads recommendations, as it can also cause new campaigns to remain unexplored. Exploration aims to address this limitation by providing new information about the environment, which encompasses user preference, and can lead to higher long-term reward. In this work, we formulate a display advertising recommender as a contextual bandit and implement exploration techniques that require sampling from the posterior distribution of click-through-rates in a computationally tractable manner. Traditional large-scale deep learning models do not provide uncertainty estimates by default. We approximate these uncertainty measurements of the predictions by employing a bootstrapped model with multiple heads and dropout units. We benchmark a number of different models in an offline simulation environment using a publicly available dataset of user-ads engagements. We test our proposed deep Bayesian bandits algorithm in the offline simulation and online AB setting with large-scale production traffic, where we demonstrate a positive gain of our exploration model.},

abstract = { Two main challenges in recommender systems are modeling users with heterogeneous taste, and providing explainable recommendations. In this paper, we propose the neural Attentive Multi-Persona Collaborative Filtering (AMP-CF) model as a unified solution for both problems. AMP-CF breaks down the user to several latent ‘personas’ (profiles) that identify and discern the different tastes and inclinations of the user. Then, the revealed personas are used to generate and explain the final recommendation list for the user. AMP-CF models users as an attentive mixture of personas, enabling a dynamic user representation that changes based on the item under consideration. We demonstrate AMP-CF on five collaborative filtering datasets from the domains of movies, music, video games and social networks. As an additional contribution, we propose a novel evaluation scheme for comparing the different items in a recommendation list based on the distance from the underlying distribution of “tastes” in the user’s historical items. Experimental results show that AMP-CF is competitive with other state-of-the-art models. Finally, we provide qualitative results to showcase the ability of AMP-CF to explain its recommendations.},

abstract = { Session-based recommendation is a problem setting where the task of a recommender system is to make suitable item suggestions based only on a few observed user interactions in an ongoing session. The lack of long-term preference information about individual users in such settings usually results in a limited level of personalization, where a small set of popular items may be recommended to many users. This repeated exposure of such a subset of the items through the recommendations may in turn lead to a reinforcement effect over time, and to a system which is not able to help users discover new content anymore to the desirable extent. In this work, we investigate such potential longitudinal effects of session-based recommendations in a simulation-based approach. Specifically, we analyze to what extent algorithms of different types may lead to concentration effects over time. Our experiments in the music domain reveal that all investigated algorithms—both neural and heuristic ones—may lead to lower item coverage and to a higher concentration on a subset of the items. Additional simulation experiments however also indicate that relatively simple re-ranking strategies, e.g., by avoiding too many repeated recommendations in the music domain, may help to deal with this problem. },

abstract = {Promotions and discounts have become key components of modern e-commerce platforms. For online travel platforms (OTPs), popular promotions include room upgrades, free meals and transportation services. By offering these promotions, customers can get more value for their money, while both the OTP and its travel partners may grow their loyal customer base. However, the promotions usually incur a cost that, if uncontrolled, can become unsustainable. Consequently, for a promotion to be viable, its associated costs must be balanced by incremental revenue within set financial constraints. Personalized treatment assignment can be used to satisfy such constraints. This paper introduces a novel uplift modeling technique, relying on the Knapsack Problem formulation, that dynamically optimizes the incremental treatment’s outcome subject to the required Return on Investment (ROI) constraints. The technique leverages Retrospective Estimation, a modeling approach that relies solely on data from positive outcome examples. The method also addresses training data bias, long term effects, and seasonality challenges via online-dynamic calibration. This approach was tested via offline experiments and online randomized controlled trials at Booking.com - a leading OTP with millions of customers worldwide, resulting in a significant increase in the target outcome while staying within the required financial constraints and outperforming other approaches. },

abstract = { In the one-class recommendation problem, it’s required to make recommendations basing on users’ implicit feedback, which is inferred from their action and inaction. Existing works obtain representations of users and items by encoding positive and negative interactions observed from training data. However, these efforts assume that all positive signals from implicit feedback reflect a fixed preference intensity, which is not realistic. Consequently, representations learned with these methods usually fail to capture informative entity features that reflect various preference intensities. In this paper, we propose a multi-tasking framework taking various preference intensities of each signal from implicit feedback into consideration. Representations of entities are required to satisfy the objective of each subtask simultaneously, making them more robust and generalizable. Furthermore, we incorporate attentive graph convolutional layers to explore high-order relationships in the user-item bipartite graph and dynamically capture the latent tendencies of users toward the items they interact with. Experimental results show that our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on three large-scale real-world benchmark datasets.},

Other exciting applications within video games are those that help the player make decisions that would maximize their playing experience, which is a desirable feature in real-time strategy video games such as Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) like as DotA and LoL. Among these tasks, the recommendation of items is challenging, given both the contextual nature of the game and how it exposes the dependence on the formation of each team. Existing works on this topic do not take advantage of all the available contextual match data and dismiss potentially valuable information. To address this problem we develop TTIR, a contextual recommender model derived from the Transformer neural architecture that suggests a set of items to every team member, based on the contexts of teams and roles that describe the match. TTIR outperforms several approaches and provides interpretable recommendations through visualization of attention weights. Our evaluation indicates that both the Transformer architecture and the contextual information are essential to get the best results for this item recommendation task. Furthermore, a preliminary user survey indicates the usefulness of attention weights for explaining recommendations as well as ideas for future work.

abstract = { Session-based recommendation focuses on the prediction of user actions based on anonymous sessions and is a necessary method in the lack of user historical data. However, none of the existing session-based recommendation methods explicitly takes the long-tail recommendation into consideration, which plays an important role in improving the diversity of recommendation and producing the serendipity. As the distribution of items with long-tail is prevalent in session-based recommendation scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, music, and TV program recommendations), more attention should be put on the long-tail session-based recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel network architecture, namely TailNet, to improve long-tail recommendation performance, while maintaining competitive accuracy performance compared with other methods. We start by classifying items into short-head (popular) and long-tail (niche) items based on click frequency. Then a novel preference mechanism is proposed and applied in TailNet to determine user preference between two types of items, so as to softly adjust and personalize recommendations. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art works.},

abstract = {Recently, self-attention based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in sequential recommendation task. Following the custom from language processing, most of these models rely on a simple positional embedding to exploit the sequential nature of the user’s history. However, there are some limitations regarding the current approaches. First, sequential recommendation is different from language processing in that timestamp information is available. Previous models have not made good use of it to extract additional contextual information. Second, using a simple embedding scheme can lead to information bottleneck since the same embedding has to represent all possible contextual biases. Third, since previous models use the same positional embedding in each attention head, they can wastefully learn overlapping patterns. To address these limitations, we propose MEANTIME (MixturE of AtteNTIon mechanisms with Multi-temporal Embeddings) which employs multiple types of temporal embeddings designed to capture various patterns from the user’s behavior sequence, and an attention structure that fully leverages such diversity. Experiments on real-world data show that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art sequential recommendation methods, and we provide an extensive ablation study to analyze how the model gains from the diverse positional information. },

We investigate to which extent state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms yield different accuracy scores depending on the users’ personality traits. We focus on the music domain and create a dataset of Twitter users’ music consumption behavior and personality traits, measuring the latter in terms of the OCEAN model. Investigating recall@K and NDCG@K of the recommendation algorithms SLIM, embarrassingly shallow autoencoders for sparse data (EASE), and variational autoencoders for collaborative filtering (Mult-VAE) on this dataset, we find several significant differences in performance between user groups scoring high vs.&nbsp;groups scoring low on several personality traits.},

abstract = { Millions of people participate in marathon events every year, typically devoting at least 12-16 weeks to building their endurance and fitness so that they can safely complete these gruelling 42.2km races. Most runners follow a training plan that is tailored to their expected finish-time (e.g. sub-4 hours or 4-5 hours), and these plans will prescribe a complex mixture of training sessions to help them achieve these times. However, such plans cannot adapt to the individual needs (fitness levels, changing goals, personal preferences) of runners, providing only broad training guidance rather than more personalised support. The development of wearable sensors and mobile fitness applications facilitates the collection of a large amount of training data from runners. In this paper, we propose a recommender system that utilizes such training data to deliver more personalised training advice to runners, using ideas from case-based reasoning to reuse and adapt the training habits of similar runners. Explainability plays a significant role in this type of system, and we also describe how the predictions and recommendation advice can be presented to runners. An initial off-line evaluation is presented based on a large-scale, real-world dataset.},

abstract = { The energy consumption of households has steadily increased over the last couple of decades. Research suggests that user behavior is the most influential factor in the energy waste of a household. Thus, there’s a need for helping consumers change their behavior to make it more energy efficient and environment friendly. In this work we propose a real-time recommender system that assists consumers in improving their household’s energy usage. By monitoring the power demand of each appliance in the household, the system detects the device status (on/off) at any moment, and using pattern mining creates a household profile comprising energy consumption patterns for different periods of the day. An intuitive UI allows users to set energy consumption goals and preferences on the appliances they’d like to save energy from. Based on the household profile, the user’s preferences and the actual power demand the system generates personalized real-time recommendations on which appliances should be turned off at a moment. We employ the UK-DALE (UK Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity) dataset to model and evaluate the entire process, from data preprocessing and transformation of the appliance power demand input to various pattern mining algorithms used to generate appliance usage profiles and recommendations, showing that even small changes in appliance usage behavior can lead to energy savings between 2-17%.},

Our approach contrasts with recently developed methods at introducing diversity into recommendations which rely on across-item measurements of dissimilarity, while sharing several formal and algorithmic elements. We show that semantic distance based operationalizations of psychological constructs show substantial correlation with empirical data. We further show that incongruity predicts variability in satisfaction as measured by movie ratings in a large corpus. Empirical results from a two month-long user study demonstrate that incongruity-based recommendations attract considerably more interaction from users, and users expressed significantly greater satisfaction given these recommendations. Based on these observations, we propose that using incongruity to diversify recommendations may be useful in expanding recommendation repertoires along interesting psychological dimensions, complementing relevance-based search.},

abstract = {In the Netflix user interface (UI), when a row or UI element is named “Because you Watched...”, “More Like This”, or “Because you added to your list”, the overarching goal is to recommend a movie or TV show that a member might like based on the fact that they took a meaningful action on a source item. We have employed similar recommendations in many UI elements: on the homepage as a row of recommendations, after you click into a title, or as a piece of information about why a member should watch a title.&nbsp;From an algorithmic perspective, there are many ways to define a “successful” similar recommendation. We sought to broaden the definition of success. To this end, the Consumer Insights team recently completed a suite of research projects to explore the intricacies of member perceptions of similar recommendations. The Netflix Consumer Insights team employs qualitative (e.g., in-depth interviews) and quantitative (e.g., surveys) research methods, interfacing directly with Netflix members to uncover pain points that can inspire new product innovation. The research concluded that, while the typical member believes movies are broadly similar when they share a common genre or theme, similarity is more complex, nuanced, and personal than we might have imagined. The vernacular we use in the UI implies that there should be at least some kind of relationship between the source item and the recommendations that follow. Many of our similar recommendations felt “out of place”, mostly because the relationship between the source item and the recommendation was unclear or absent. When similar recommendations tell a completely misleading, incorrect, or confusing story, member trust can be broken.We will structure the presentation around three new insights that our research found to have an influence on the perception of similarity in the context of Netflix as well as the research methods used to uncover those insights. First, the reason a member loves a given movie will vary. For example, do you want to watch other baseball movies like Field of Dreams, or would you prefer other romances like Field of Dreams? Second, members are more or less flexible about how similar a recommendation actually needs to be depending on the properties of and their interactions with the canvas containing the recommendation. For example, a Because You Watched row on the homepage implies vaguer similarity while a More Like This gallery behind a click into the source item implies stricter similarity. Finally, even when we held the UI element constant, we found that similar recommendations are only valuable in some contexts. After finishing a movie, a member might prefer a similar recommendation one day and a change of pace the next. Research methods discussed will include single-arrangement Inverse Multi-Dimensional Scaling [1], survey experimentation, and ways to apply qualitative research to improve algorithmic recommendations.},

To enable a great experience for every individual, our home-furnishing experts strive to provide the best possible input and advice, catering to individual needs and helping customers realise their vision for life at home. As we move rapidly towards a multi touch point shopping vision with digital at heart, data and machine learning are crucial to 1) enable a consistent journey across, and 2) extend the domain expertise found in stores to our purely digital touch points, like the new IKEA App. A specific example of a digital product where we aim to inspire is our newly launched Inspirational Feed. In the Feed, customers browse their way through ”shoppable” images, in which our products are displayed in purposefully atmospheric settings for a wide range of room types. In this talk, we present our newest algorithmic approach to personalise the Feed based on contextual bandits [2, 3, 4], and highlight some of the technical challenges regarding implementation at scale. The past decade has led to an explosion in research on recommender systems, often with personalised content as a motivating factor [1]. To identify a suitable class of algorithmic strategies for the Feed, note that: To capture the described trade-off between relevance and discovery, as well as matching data for how customers on average shop with IKEA, contextual bandits with batch learning from logged bandit feedback inspired by [4] have shown especially promising results among numerous other exploitation-exploration strategies. This approach induces a fair amount of exploration and minimizes the risk of showing irrelevant images to the customer based on the principle of counterfactual risk minimisation. In our contextual bandit setup, a bandit session is defined as a user session of the Feed taking place in the App (the home of the Feed). An action is displaying an image, while a reward is generated whenever the user clicks on it. The bandit context consists of previous user behaviour collected from the App, combined with product metadata. Our model takes advantage of embeddings of the input features, similar to [1]. The implementation of the strategy requires us to handle several interesting edge cases, e.g. we are looking into various techniques for increasing exploration as new images are added to our dynamic content catalogue. },

abstract = { Most commercial industrial recommender systems have built their closed feedback loops. Though it is helpful in item recommendation and model training, the closed feedback loop may lead to the so-called bias problems, including the position bias, selection bias and popularity bias. The recommendation models trained with biased may hurt the user experiences by recommending homogenous items. How to control the biases in the closed feedback loop has become one of major challenges in modern recommender systems. This talk discusses the counterfactual learning technologies for tackling the bias problem in recommendation. The talk consists of four parts. The first part, briefly introduces the counterfactual learning with two cases from the academic perspective [4, 5]. The second part illustrates the position bias and selection bias based on two real examples. These examples inspire us to study “How to use counterfactual technology for recommender system?” from the industry perspective. In the third part, we firstly encourage the audiences to think an important question: “What kind of data can learn an unbiased model?” After that, we propose four counterfactual learning approaches and related studies, as shown in Figure1.  Approach 1: Learn from counterfactual data. We need to learn full-information model with partial observed information data. The full-information model is an unbiased model, which is trained by both observed data and unobserved data (including counterfactual data), but how to model unobserved data? One common approach is direct method [2]. In this talk, we introduce a novel counterfactual learning framework [8], first, an imputation model can by learned by a small amount of unbiased uniform data, then the imputation model can be used to predict labels of all counterfactual samples, finally, we train a counterfactual recommendation model with both observed and counterfactual samples. Approach 2: Correct biased observed data. Inverse propensity score (IPS) is a widely studied method and relatively easy to be deployed for real products. IPS is defined as the conditional probability of receiving the treatment given pre-treatment covariates by Rosenbaum and Rubin [7]. But IPS method should satisfy two assumptions: (1) overlap, and (2) unconfoundedness. Inspired by the sample reweighting work for robust deep learning [6], we proposed a novel influence function based method to reweight training samples directly. Approach 3: Doubly robust method. The doubly robust methods [7] have two parts: IPS method part and direct method part. John Langford etc. prove that either one part of them can debias, the doubly robust method can debias. But both of the propensity and imputation model are not easy to learn, so we present a novel propensity free doubly robust method [8] for click-through-rate (CTR) prediction task. In order to solve the efficiency of full samples (including both unobserved and observed sample) learning problem, we proposed block coordinate descend and conjugate gradient method, which can reduce the time complexity of optimization from O(m*n) to O(m+n). Approach 4: Joint learning unbiased data and biased data. In recommender system, unbiased data is collected through randomly recommendation approach. The unbiased data is less, and its collection process is expensive. Through online A/B testing, the performance of the model trained with biased data and unbiased data together is superior to the performance of the model trained with only biased data. Causal embedding [1] method is another method to learn both biased data and unbiased data for improving the accuracy of prediction model. We also propose a general knowledge distillation framework for counterfactual recommendation via uniform data [3], which propose a general framework about how to use unbiased data with four distillation methods: label distillation, sample distillation, feature distillation and model structure distillation. We also summarize the advantages and challenges of the above approaches. The last part emphasizes that counterfactual learning is a rich research area, and discuss several important research topics, such as optimization for counterfactual learning, counterfactual meta learning, stable learning, fairness, unbiased learning to rank, offline policy evaluation.},

Students visit Chegg to get help with homework using Chegg Study, learn from flashcards for their tests, practice examinations, learn relevant concepts, work with a tutor online to get one on one learning experience. This represents a large amount of content available to students. In order to organize the content we have developed a Knowledge Graph with nodes representing a hierarchical scheme of concepts&nbsp;&nbsp;taught at different educational institutions and the content at Chegg. In order to create edges between concept nodes and content we build text classifiers to tag content with concept nodes.Often students will interact with one or two products such as Chegg Study or Text Book rentals and browse other products such as flashcards, exam practice, etc. In order to suggest relevant content to them, we deduce the concepts they have been studying in products where they are more active and suggest content in products where they are less active.In this presentation I will talk about the general framework for developing personalized recommendations at Chegg and do a deep dive into (1) Text classifiers required for content tagging and (2) Building cross product recommendations. In text classification,&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go into details about working with noisy training data and model improvements using multi-task learning [1].

abstract = { Globoplay is Globo Group’s digital video streaming platform and offers a very diverse video content catalogue ranging from international to brazilian productions such as movies, series, soap operas, and TV programs produced by Globo Group. One of the challenges with such large and diverse content collection is its distribution to the user base in order to help our subscribers with finding relevant content that meets their expectations and to increase their engagement with the product. In this work, we show the result of a content-based recommendation approach based on multi-modal features such as visual characteristics and audio patterns found in the video content. Using techniques applied to short videos, we model it as a similarity problem based on the content of the video, where, given a video, we establish the top-n videos most similar to it in the collection. For the evaluation, we conducted a study through interviews with a group of users to understand their perception of recommendations based on audiovisual characteristics. For the future, we plan to: explore and define the best approach to combine text, audio and video features for video recommendations; explore audiovisual features with other recommendation approaches such as session based and collaborative filtering; perform AB testing in production; and evaluate the proposal impact in business metrics.},

abstract = { Finding the right job is a difficult task for anyone as it usually depends on many factors like salary, job description, or geographical location. Students with almost no prior experience, especially, have a hard time on the job market, which is very competitive in nature. Additionally, students often suffer a lack of orientation, as they do not know what kind of job is suitable for their education. At Talto1, we realized this and have built a platform to help Austrian university students with finding their career paths as well as providing them with content that is relevant to their career possibilities. This is mainly achieved by guiding the students toward different types of entities that are related to their career, i.e., job postings, company profiles, and career-related articles. In this talk, we share our experiences with solving the recommendation problem for university students. One trait of the student-focused job domain is that behaviour of the students differs depending on their study progression. At the beginning of their studies, they need study-specific career information and part-time jobs to earn additional money. Whereas, when they are nearing graduation, they require information about their potential future employers and entry-level full-time jobs. Moreover, we can observe seasonal patterns in user activity in addition to the need of handling both logged-in and anonymous session users at the same time. To cope with the requirements of the job domain, we built hybrid models based on a microservice architecture that utilizes popular algorithms from the literature such as Collaborative Filtering, Content-based Filtering as well as various neural embedding approaches (e.g., Doc2Vec, Autoencoders, etc.). We further adapted our architecture to calculate relevant recommendations in real-time (i.e., after a recommendation is requested) as individual user sessions in Talto are usually short-lived and context-dependent. Here we found that the online performance of the utilized approach also depends on the location context&nbsp;[1]. Hence, the current location of a user on the mobile or web application impacts the expected recommendations. One optimization criterion on the Talto career platform is to provide relevant cross-entity recommendations as well as explain why those were shown. Recently, we started to tackle this by learning embeddings of entities that lie in the same embedding space [2]. Specifically, we pre-train word embeddings and link different entities by shared concepts, which we use for training the network embeddings. This embeds both the concepts and the entities into a common vector space, where the common vector space is a result of considering the textual content, as well as the network information (i.e., links to concepts). This way, different entity types (e.g., job postings, company profiles, and articles) are directly comparable and are suited for a real-time recommendation setting. Interestingly enough, with such an approach we also end up with individual words sharing the same embedding space. This, in turn, can be leveraged to enhance the textual search functionality of a platform, which is most commonly based just on a TF-IDF model. Furthermore, we found that such embeddings allow us to tackle the problem of explainability in an algorithm-agnostic way. Since the Talto platform utilizes various recommendation algorithms as well as continuously conducts AB tests, an algorithm-agnostic explainability model would be best suited to provide the students with meaningful explanations. As such, we will also go into the details on how we can adapt our explanation model to not rely on the utilized recommendation algorithm.},

abstract = { Recommender Systems is one of the main machine learning applications for an e-commerce platforms such as Etsy, a two sided marketplace. A frequent usage of such system is for item-to-item recommendations that show similar items (also referred as listings) based on the listing a user is currently viewing. Item-to-item recommendations typically take into account information that are only associated with the target listing and other listings in the inventory. However, other contextual information such as user intents, queries and seasonality, are often not taken into account. In this talk, we will present two approaches we developed to utilize additional contextual information in the form of queries in generating item-to-item recommendations. Moreover, we will present our journey in migrating Etsy’s rankers from linear to non-linear models. Additionally, we propose new metrics to evaluate candidate sets that accesses diversity and price spread, while not compromising relevance. The proposed metrics can also be used beyond the current application. Our proposed candidate set generation approach outperforms the model in production as well as yielding significant lift in conversion rate and other engagement metrics as indicated by several A/B tests.},

In general, recommender systems are data-driven. The more data it uses, the better performance it obtains. The data silo issues is a severe limitation of the recommender’s performance. Federated learning is an emerging technology, which bridges the data silos and builds machine learning models without compromising user privacy and data security. We design a recommender system based on federated learning. It is known as the federated recommender system. The system implements plenty of popular algorithms to support various online recommendation services. The algorithm implementation is open-sourced. We also deploy the system on a real-world content recommendation application, achieving significant performance improvement. In this demonstration, we present the architecture of the federated recommender system and give an online demo to show its detailed working procedures and results in content recommendations.},

abstract = { The field of recommender systems has rapidly evolved over the last few years, with significant advances made due to the in-flux of deep learning techniques. However, as a result of this rapid progress, escalating barriers-to-entry for new researchers is emerging. In particular, state-of-the-art approaches have fragmented into a large number of code-bases, often requiring different input formats, pre-processing stages and evaluating with different metric packages. Hence, it is time-consuming for new researchers to reach the point of having both an effective baseline set and a sound comparative environment. As a step towards elevating this problem, we have developed BETA-Rec, an open source project for Building, Evaluating and Tuning Automated Recommender Systems. BETA-Rec aims to provide a practical data toolkit for building end-to-end recommendation systems in a standardized way. It provides means for dataset preparation and splitting using common strategies, a generalized model engine for implementing recommender models using Pytorch with 9 models available out-of-the-box, as well as a unified training, validation, tuning and testing pipeline. Furthermore, BETA-Rec is designed to be both modular and extensible, enabling new models to be quickly added to the framework. It is deployable in a wide range of environments via pre-built docker containers and supports distributed parameter tuning using Ray. In this demo, we will illustrate the deployment and use of BETA-Rec for researchers and practitioners on a number of standard recommendation datasets. The source code of the project is available at github: https://github.com/beta-team/beta-recsys. },

As recommendation technologies are applied to an ever-growing array of non-standard problems and scenarios, researchers and practitioners are also increasingly faced with challenges of dealing with greater variety and complexity in the inputs to those recommender systems. For example, there has been more reliance on fine-grained user signals as inputs rather than simple ratings or likes. Many applications also require more complex domain-specific constraints on inputs to the recommender systems. The outputs of recommender systems are also moving towards more complex composite items, such as package or sequence recommendations. This increasing complexity requires smarter recommender algorithms that can deal with this diversity in inputs and outputs. The ComplexRec workshop series offers an interactive venue for discussing approaches to recommendation in complex scenarios that have no simple one-size-fits-all solution.},

Since the emergence of recommender systems, a large majority of research focuses on objective accuracy criteria and less attention has been paid to how users interact with the system and the efficacy of interface designs from users’ perspectives. The field has reached a point where it is ready to look beyond algorithms, into users’ interactions, decision making processes, and overall experience. The series of workshops on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems focuses on the ”human side” of recommender systems. The goal of the research stream featured at the workshop is to improve users’ overall experience with recommender systems by integrating different theories of human decision making into the construction of recommender systems and exploring better interfaces for recommender systems. In this summary, we introduce 7th Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems at RecSys’20, review its history, and discuss most important topics considered at the workshop.},

abstract = { Modern online web-based systems continuously generate data at very fast rates. This continuous flow of data encompasses web content – e.g. posts, news, products, comments –, but also user feedback – e.g. ratings, views, reads, clicks, thumbs up –, as well as context information – device used, geographic info, social network, current user activity, weather. This is potentially overwhelming for systems and algorithms design to train in offline batches, given the continuous and potentially fast change of content, context and user preferences. Therefore it is important to investigate online methods to be able to transparently adapt to the inherent dynamics of online systems. Incremental models that learn from data streams are gaining attention in the recommender systems community, given their natural ability to deal with data generated in dynamic, complex environments. User modeling and personalization can particularly benefit from algorithms capable of maintaining models incrementally and online, as data is generated. The objective of this workshop is to foster contributions and bring together a growing community of researchers and practitioners interested in online, adaptive approaches to user modeling, recommendation and personalization, as well as other related tasks, such as evaluation, reproducibility, privacy and explainability.},

abstract = { The workshop features presentations of accepted contributions to the RecSys Challenge 2020, organized by Politecnico di Bari, Free University of Bozen-Bolzano, TU Wien, University of Colorado, Boulder, and Universidade Federal de Campina Grande, and sponsored by Twitter. The challenge focuses on a real-world task of Tweet engagement prediction in a dynamic environment. The goal is to predict the probability for different types of engagement (Like, Reply, Retweet, and Retweet with comment) of a target user for a set of Tweets, based on heterogeneous input data. To this end, Twitter has released a large public dataset of ~160M public Tweets, obtained by subsampling within ~2 weeks, that contains engagement features, user features, and Tweet features. A peculiarity of this challenge is related to the recent regulations on data protection and privacy. The challenge data set was compliant: if a user deleted a Tweet, or their data from Twitter, the dataset was promptly updated. Moreover, each change in the dataset implied new evaluations of all submissions and the update of the leaderboard metrics. The challenge was well received with 1,131 registered users. In the final phase, 20 teams were competing for the winning position. These teams had an average size of approximately 4 participants and developed an overall number of 127 different methods.},

This is particularly true for large scale platforms such as social media, where recommender systems assist users in facilitating access to massive user-generated content by finding relevant information and establishing new social relationships. Just as recommendation techniques are designed to become powerful tools, they could in turn spread online harm. Some of these issues stem from the core concepts and assumptions of recommender systems. Harnessing recommender systems with misinformation- and harm-awareness mechanisms becomes essential not only to mitigate the negative effects of the propagation of harmful content, but also to increase the quality and diversity of recommender systems. To further research in this direction, the Workshop on Online Misinformation- and Harm-Aware Recommender Systems (OHARS 2020) aimed at fostering research in recommender systems that can circumvent the negative effects of online harms by promoting the recommendation of safe content and users. },

abstract = {College students are required to select a major but are often provided with only a modest amount of support in making this important decision. A poor decision is detrimental to the student, since it may result in the student later switching to a different major with a delay in graduation—or even result in the student leaving the university. This also impacts the university since time to graduation and retention rate are used to evaluate the quality of a university. There is a general lack of research on recommender systems for college majors, with the most relevant systems focusing on course-level recommendations. This study describes and evaluates a recommender system for selecting an undergraduate major, utilizing nine years of historical student data from a large university. The system bases its recommendations on the courses that the student takes in the first few years of college, and how well they performed in these courses. The system is designed to recommend majors that the student is likely to be interested in and will perform well in. Recommendations are evaluated based on the likelihood that the student's actual major was in the top five recommended majors, and whether the student performed above average in that major. The recommendation system dramatically outperforms the baseline strategy of randomly selecting a major, and when the recommendation is followed the student is 12% more likely to perform above average in the major.},

abstract = { The ad-ranking module is the core of the advertising recommender system. Existing ad-ranking modules are mainly based on the deep neural network click-through rate prediction model. Recently an innovative ad-ranking paradigm called DNN-MAB has been introduced to address DNN-only paradigms’ weakness in perceiving highly dynamic user intent over time. We introduce the DNN-MAB paradigm into our ad-ranking system to alleviate the Matthew effect that harms the user experience. Due to data sparsity, however, the actual performance of DNN-MAB is lower than expected. In this paper, we propose an innovative ad-ranking paradigm called DNN-VMAB to solve these problems. Based on vectorization and clustering, it utilizes latent collaborative information in user behavior data to find a set of ads with higher relativity and diversity. As an integration of the essences of classical collaborative filtering, deep click-through rate prediction model, and contextual multi-armed bandit, it can improve platform revenue and user experience. Both offline and online experiments show the advantage of our new algorithm over DNN-MAB and some other existing algorithms.},

As these models are analytically computable and thus forgo the need for often expensive iterative optimisation procedures, they are an attractive choice for practitioners. We study the applicability of such closed-form models to implicit-feedback collaborative filtering when additional side-information or metadata about items is available. Two complementary extensions to the easer paradigm are proposed, based on collective and additive models. Through an extensive empirical analysis on several large-scale datasets, we show that our methods can effectively exploit side-information whilst retaining a closed-form solution, and improve upon the state-of-the-art without increasing the computational complexity of the original easer approach. Additionally, empirical results demonstrate that the use of side-information leads to more “long tail” items being recommended, benefiting the recommendations’ coverage of the item catalogue.},

However, due to the limited logged user interactions in practice, news recommendation at session-level becomes very challenging. Existing methods on session-based news recommendation mainly focus on extracting features from news articles and sequential user-item interactions, but they usually ignore the semantic-level structural information among news articles and do not explore external knowledge sources. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Aware Graph Embedding (CAGE) framework for session-based news recommendation, which builds an auxiliary knowledge graph to enrich the semantic meaning of entities involved in articles, and further refines the article embeddings by graph convolutional networks. Experimental results on a real-world news dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods on session-based news recommendation.},

To investigate how interpersonal relationships affect users’ evaluation of music recommendation, we conducted a survey-based study that compared two types of recommendation channels—interpersonal (i.e., from friends) and non-interpersonal (i.e., from systems). We found that relevance was evaluated higher in music recommended from non-interpersonal channels on average, while diversity, novelty, and serendipity were higher in interpersonal channels. Non-interpersonal channels surpassed interpersonal channels in terms of convenience, frequency, and adoption rate. These results illustrate that interpersonal and non-interpersonal channels have different strengths and that digital streaming platforms, which have mainly provided system recommendations thus far, need to better support interpersonal channels for richer user experience.},

In particular, we perform experiments comparing three common data splitting strategies, examining their impact over seven state-of-the-art recommendation models on two datasets. Our results demonstrate that the splitting strategy employed is an important confounding variable that can markedly alter the ranking of recommender systems, making much of the currently published literature non-comparable, even when the same datasets and metrics are used.},

abstract = { With over 20,000 tracks being released each day, recommendation systems that power music streaming services should not only be responsive to such large volumes of content, but also be adept at understanding the impact of such new releases on, both, users’ listening behavior and popularity of artists. Inferring the causal impact of new track releases is critical to fully characterizing the interplay between artists and listeners, as well as among the artists. In this study, we infer and quantify causality using a diffusion-regression state-space model that constructs counterfactual outcomes using a set of synthetic controls, which predict potential outcomes in absence of the intervention. Based on large scale experiments spanning over 21 million users and 1 billion streams on a real world streaming platform, our findings suggest that releasing a new track has a positive impact on the popularity of other tracks by the same artist. Interestingly, other related and competing artists also benefit from a new track release, which hints at the presence of a positive platform-effect wherein some artists gain significantly from activities of other artists. },

abstract = { Recommender systems offer great opportunity not only for users to discover new content, but also for the providers of that content to find new audience, followers, and fans. Users often come to a recommender system with certain expectations about what it will recommend to them, and a recommender system that is optimized for creating opportunities for content creators may provide recommendations that are very different from what a user is expecting. We hypothesize that some users’ expectations have a much wider range of acceptability than others, and users with more ”receptivity” to subversion of their expectations are likely to accept such divergence in the recommended content. Understanding users’ responses to such recommendations is vital to platforms that need to serve multiple stakeholders. In this work we investigate logged behavioral responses of users of an audio streaming platform to recommendations that deviate from their expectation, or “divergent” recommendations. We present three classes of listener response to divergent recommendations that can be identified in interaction logs with the aim of predicting which users can be targeted for future divergent recommendations. We derive a number of user characteristics based on user’s music consumption which we think are predictive of user’s receptivity, train models to predict receptivity of these users, and run a live A/B test to validate our approach by correlating with engagement.},

abstract = { Music streaming is inherently sequential in nature, with track sequence information playing a key role in user satisfaction with recommended music. In this work, we investigate the role audio characteristics of music content play in understanding music streaming sessions. Focusing on 18 audio attributes (e.g. dancability, acousticness, energy), we formulate audio transitioning in a session as a multiple changepoint detection problem, and extract latent states of different audio attributes within each session. Based on insights from large scale music streaming data from a popular music streaming platform, we investigate questions around the extent to which audio characteristics fluctuate within streaming sessions, the heterogeneity across different audio attributes and their impact on user satisfaction. Furthermore, we demonstrate the promise of such audio-based characterizing of sessions in better sequencing tracks in a session, and highlight the potential gains in user satisfaction on offer. We discuss implications on the design of track sequencing models, and identify important prediction tasks to further research on the topic.},

We present a novel way to learn these embeddings by making use of the (unknown) statistics of the underlying distribution generating the hierarchical data. Our representation learning algorithm can be viewed as a simple composition rule that can be applied recursively in a bottom-up fashion to represent arbitrarily complex hierarchical structures in terms of the representations of its constituent components. We demonstrate our ideas on two real world recommendation systems datasets including the one used for the RecSys 2019 challenge. For that dataset, we improve upon the performance achieved by the winning team’s model by incorporating embeddings as features generated by our approach in their solution.},

abstract = {Multi-language recipe personalisation and recommendation is an under-explored field of information retrieval in academic and production systems. The existing gaps in our current understanding are numerous, even on fundamental questions such as whether consistent and high-quality recipe recommendation can be delivered across languages. Motivated by this need, we consider the multi-language recipe recommendation setting and present grounding results that will help to establish the potential and absolute value of future work in this area. Our work draws on several billion events from millions of recipes, with published recipes and users incorporating several languages, including Arabic, English, Indonesian, Russian, and Spanish. We represent recipes using a combination of normalised ingredients, standardised skills and image embeddings obtained without human intervention. In modelling, we take a classical approach based on optimising an embedded bi-linear user-item metric space towards the interactions that most strongly elicit cooking intent. For users without interaction histories, a bespoke content-based cold-start model that predicts context and recipe affinity is introduced. We show that our approach to personalisation is stable and scales well to new languages. A robust cross-validation campaign is employed and consistently rejects baseline models and representations, strongly favouring those we propose. Our results are presented in a language-oriented (as opposed to model-oriented) fashion to emphasise the language-based goals of this work. We believe that this is the first large-scale work that evaluates the value and potential of multi-language recipe recommendation and personalisation. },

Disruptions or sudden changes in the environment affect customer preferences drastically and render historical data ineffective for modeling. With businesses relying heavily on Machine Learning(ML) based recommender systems for catering to customer preferences, the accuracy of timely recommendations gains prime significance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel concept, LDT (Labeled Data Threshold), a newly defined parameter to determine the sufficiency of available labeled training data. Our proposed scheme, using LDT leads to a significant reduction (&nbsp; 50X) in the training time for a model, thus enabling recommender systems to adapt quickly to disruptions. We illustrate the efficacy of our proposed scheme, by conducting extensive experimental analysis on six well known, structured data sets from various public domains.},

abstract = { Targeting system is an essential part of computational advertising. It allows advertisers to select and reach their targeted users. Due to various advertising goals and the demand for making budget plans, advertisers have a strong will to configure the final targeting results, or they can become very cautious in spending money on advertising campaigns. Meanwhile, to guarantee the advertising performance, the targeted users should also be relevant to the ads of the advertisers. Recent targeting methods are mainly based on tags produced by the Data Management Platform (DMP) which is easy for the advertisers to configure the targeting results. However, in such methods, the relevance between the targeted users and ads is not technically evaluated and cannot be guaranteed. The biggest challenge is that it is hard for a machine learning model to both model the relevance and take account of the advertiser’s configuration demands. In this paper, we propose a novel relevance-driven and configurable targeting framework called Smart Targeting to solve the problem. Specifically, different from Tag-wise Targeting, we first use a relevance model to retrieve the most relevant users for the ads. To further enable the advertisers to configure the final results, we develop a Delay Intervention Mechanism to leverage the power of DMP. As far as we know, this is the first attempt of combining relevance modeling and advertiser intervention into a unified targeting system. We implement and evaluate our framework on JD.com platform with over 300 million users and the results show that it can bring significant improvements to the core indicators such as CTR and eCPM. The long term monitoring also demonstrates that Smart Targeting gradually becomes the most popular targeting tool after its release.},

A recommender system could be considered unfair if the recommendations do not fairly represent the tastes of a certain group of users while other groups receive recommendations that are consistent with their preferences. In this paper, we use a metric called miscalibration for measuring how a recommendation algorithm is responsive to users’ true preferences and we consider how various algorithms may result in different degrees of miscalibration for different users. In particular, we conjecture that popularity bias which is a well-known phenomenon in recommendation is one important factor leading to miscalibration in recommendation. Our experimental results using two real-world datasets show that there is a connection between how different user groups are affected by algorithmic popularity bias and their level of interest in popular items. Moreover, we show that the more a group is affected by the algorithmic popularity bias, the more their recommendations are miscalibrated. },

abstract = { Word2vec is a powerful machine learning tool that emerged from Natural Language Processing (NLP) and is now applied in multiple domains, including recommender systems, forecasting, and network analysis. As Word2vec is often used off the shelf, we address the question of whether the default hyperparameters are suitable for recommender systems. The answer is emphatically no. In this paper, we first elucidate the importance of hyperparameter optimization and show that unconstrained optimization yields an average 221% improvement in hit rate over the default parameters. However, unconstrained optimization leads to hyperparameter settings that are very expensive and not feasible for large scale recommendation tasks. To this end, we demonstrate 138% average improvement in hit rate with a runtime budget-constrained hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, to make hyperparameter optimization applicable for large scale recommendation problems where the target dataset is too large to search over, we investigate generalizing hyperparameters settings from samples. We show that applying constrained hyperparameter optimization using only a 10% sample of the data still yields a 91% average improvement in hit rate over the default parameters when applied to the full datasets. Finally, we apply hyperparameters learned using our method of constrained optimization on a sample to the Who To Follow recommendation service at Twitter and are able to increase follow rates by 15%. },

The tutorial is divided into four parts. We start by introducing a summary on state-of-the-art recommender models, including deep learning ones, and we define the fundamentals of AML. Then, we present the Adversarial Recommendation Framework, to represent attack/defense strategies on RSs, and the GAN-based Recommendation Framework, which is at the basis of novel adversarial-based generative recommenders. The presentation of each framework is followed by a practical session. Finally, we conclude with open challenges and possible future works for both applications. },

abstract = { Search and recommender systems have unprecedented influence on how and what information people access. These gateways to information on the one hand create an easy and universal access to online information, and on the other hand create biases that have shown to cause knowledge disparity and ill-decisions for information seekers. Most of the algorithms for indexing, retrieval, ranking, and recommendation are heavily driven by the underlying data that itself is biased. In addition, ordering of the search and recommendation results create position bias and exposure bias due to their considerable focus on relevance and user satisfaction. These and other forms of biases that are implicitly and some times explicitly woven in search and recommender systems are becoming increasing threats to information seeking and sense-making processes. In this tutorial, we will introduce the issues of biases in search and recommendation and show how we could think about and create systems that are fairer, with increasing diversity and transparency. Specifically, the tutorial will present several fundamental concepts such as relevance, novelty, diversity, bias, and fairness using socio-technical terminologies taken from various communities, and dive deeper into metrics and frameworks that allow us to understand, extract, and materialize them. The tutorial will cover some of the most recent works in this area and show how this interdisciplinary research has opened up new challenges and opportunities for communities such as RecSys.},

Early work is in progress in developing confidence measures for individual rating predictions. While these efforts have not been focused on the streaming environment to date, they do form a basis for future work in which computational demands are higher. Extensions to the streaming domain are discussed.},

abstract = {Throughout the years, numerous recommendation algorithms have been developed to address the information filtering problem by leveraging users’ tastes through implicit or explicit feedback. In this paper, we present the work undertaken as part of a PhD thesis focused on exploring new evaluation dimensions centred around the efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs present in state-of-the-art recommendation systems. Firstly, we highlight the lack of efficiency-oriented studies and we formulate the research problem. Then, we propose a mapping of the design space and a classification of the recommendation algorithms/models with respect to salient attributes and characteristics. At the same time, we explain why and how assessing the recommendations on an accuracy versus training cost curve would advance the current knowledge in the area of evaluation, as well as open new research avenues for exploring parameter configurations within well-known algorithms. Finally, we make the case for a comprehensive methodology that incorporates predictive efficiency-effectiveness models, which illustrate the performance and behaviour of the recommendation systems under different recommendation tasks, while satisfying user-defined quality of service constraints and goals. },

abstract = { Tasks as physical training planning, computer hardware configuration or fully dietary advice, are problems that exhibit multiple choices, composed in turn of simpler items (specific exercises, components or recipes). An ideal recommender system would not only recommend simple items based on the user’s tastes, but would offer a set of items that suit the user’s needs and preferences so that they form a meaningful structure that can evolve in time. Taking this idea as our main cornerstone, this Ph.D. face two objectives: being able to generate an item with a complex structure from simpler items, and integrating the user’s limitations and preferences to develop an adaptive recommender system. This work proposes the incorporation of item generation systems as a preprocessing stage in the recommendation process through evolutionary algorithms. We found that genetic algorithms are still an interesting and powerful computational tool that have not been fully developed for this task. We a theoretical model that can deal with problems from different areas, incorporating the ability to recommend complex objects with flexible restrictions and specific structures that depend on the user an its evolution. Finally this approach will be tested in different scenarios, as Stance4Health European project, where a personalized nutrition service based on user microbiota is being developed based on this concept.},

abstract = { A common and recently widely accepted problem in the field of machine learning is the black box nature of many algorithms. In practice, many machine learning algorithms can only be viewed and evaluated in terms of their inputs and outputs, without taking their internal workings into account. Perhaps the most notorious examples in this context are artificial neural networks and deep learning techniques, but they are certainly not the only techniques that suffer from this problem. Matrix factorisation models for recommendation systems, for example, suffer from the same lack of interpretability. Our research focuses on applying and adapting pattern mining techniques to gain meaningful insights in recommendation algorithms by analysing them in terms of both their input and output, also allowing us to compare different algorithms and discover the hidden biases that lead to those differences.},

abstract = {Traveling for leisure has become an important part of our society. It has proven time and again its benefits for wellbeing and personal growth. There are many types of tourism and one of them is Accessible Tourism (AT), an ongoing endeavor to ensure that everyone, regardless of condition, has the right to benefit from tourism experiences. Recommender systems (RSs) represent a mature technique for generating clear and personalized suggestions. While being widely researched and used by the tourism academic community and the tourism industry in general, Recommender Systems (RSs) can still do much more for Accessible Tourism (AT). This thesis aims to build a recommender system dedicated to recommending accessible tourism destinations and easy the process of e2e trip planning for people with disabilities. With a modular design, use of ontologies, machine learning techniques and a “start small, define expansion, expand” approach, this recommender system, once built, aims to be validated by real users.},

Many times, the users also make items reviews, giving us additional information in the form of text and images that are generally, not fully exploited. In this research we propose different approaches in the context of restaurants recommendation, where we take advantage of this information, by extracting a semantic meaning, in order to improve the traditional RS in terms of personalization and explainability.},
