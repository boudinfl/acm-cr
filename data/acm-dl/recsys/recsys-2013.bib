abstract = {Online reviews play a vital role in the decision-making process for online users. Helpful reviews are usually buried in a large number of unhelpful reviews, and with the consistently increasing number of reviews, it becomes more and more difficult for online users to find helpful reviews. Therefore most online review websites allow online users to rate the helpfulness of a review and a global helpfulness score is computed for the review based on its available ratings. However, in reality, user-specified helpfulness ratings for reviews are very sparse - a few reviews attract large numbers of helpfulness ratings while most reviews obtain few or even no helpfulness ratings. The available helpfulness ratings are too sparse for online users to assess the helpfulness of reviews. Also the helpfulness of a review is not necessarily equally useful for all users and users with different background may treat the helpfulness of a review very differently. The user idiosyncracy of review helpfulness motivates us to study the problem of review helpfulness rating prediction in this paper. We first identify various types of context information, model them mathematically, and propose a context-aware review helpfulness rating prediction framework CAP. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the importance of context awareness in solving the review helpfulness rating prediction problem.},

abstract = {Context aware recommender systems go beyond the traditional personalized recommendation models by incorporating a form of situational awareness. They provide recommendations that not only correspond to a user's preference profile, but that are also tailored to a given situation or context. We consider the setting in which contextual information is represented as a subset of an item feature space describing short-term interests or needs of a user in a given situation. This contextual information can be provided by the user in the form of an explicit query, or derived implicitly.We propose a unified probabilistic model that integrates user profiles, item representations, and contextual information. The resulting recommendation framework computes the conditional probability of each item given the user profile and the additional context. These probabilities are used as recommendation scores for ranking items. Our model is an extension of the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model that provides the capability for joint modeling of users, items, and the meta-data associated with contexts. Each user profile is modeled as a mixture of the latent topics. The discovered latent topics enable our system to handle missing data in item features. We demonstrate the application of our framework for article and music recommendation. In the latter case, the set of popular tags from social tagging Web sites are used for context descriptions. Our evaluation results show that considering context can help improve the quality of recommendations.},

The suggested hybrid approach combines two techniques -- one based on representing both POIs and music with tags, and the other based on the knowledge of the semantic relations between the two types of items. We show that our approach can be scaled up using a novel music auto-tagging technique and we compare it in a live user study to: two non-hybrid solutions, either based on tags or on semantic relations; and to a context-free but personalized recommendation approach. In the considered scenario, i.e., a situation defined by a context (the POI), we show that personalization (via music preference) is not sufficient and it is important to implement effective adaptation techniques to the user's context. In fact, we show that the users are more satisfied with the recommendations generated by combining the tag-based and knowledge-based context adaptation techniques, which exploit orthogonal types of relations between places and music tracks.},

abstract = {Mobile networks enable users to post on social media services (e.g., Twitter) from anywhere. The activities of mobile users involve three major entities: user, post, and location. The interaction of these entities is the key to answer questions such as who will post a message where and on what topic? In this paper, we address the problem of profiling mobile users by modeling their activities, i.e., we explore topic modeling considering the spatial and textual aspects of user posts, and predict future user locations. We propose the first ST (Spatial Topic) model to capture the correlation between users' movements and between user interests and the function of locations. We employ the sparse coding technique which greatly speeds up the learning process. We perform experiments on two real life data sets from Twitter and Yelp. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model consistently improves the average precision@1,5,10,15,20 for location recommendation by at least 50% (Twitter) and 300% (Yelp) against existing state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms and geographical topic models.},

abstract = {One important challenge of current search engines is to satisfy the users' needs when they provide a poorly formulated query. When the pages matching the user's original keywords are judged to be unsatisfactory, query recommendation techniques are used to propose alternative queries and alter the result set. These techniques search for queries that are semantically similar to the user's original query, often searching for keywords that are similar to the keywords given by the user. However, when the original query is sufficiently ill-posed, the user's informational need is best met using entirely different keywords, and a substantially different query may be necessary.We propose a novel approach that is not based on the keywords of the original query. We intentionally seek out orthogonal queries, which are related queries that have (almost) no common terms with the user's query. This allows an orthogonal query to satisfy the user's informational need when small perturbations of the original keyword set are insufficient. By using this technique to generate query recommendations, we outperform several known approaches, being the best for long tail queries.},

These properties are used for making top-$N$ recommendations in a two-phase algorithm. In this work, we provide a new explanation for the significantly better performance of the asymmetric SVD approaches and a novel algorithm for better diversity in top-N recommendations.},

abstract = {This paper introduces retargeted matrix factorization (R-MF); a novel approach for learning the user-wise ranking of items in the context of collaborative filtering. R-MF learns to rank by "retargeting" the item ratings of each user, searching for a monotonic transformation of the ratings that results in a better fit while preserving the ranked order of each user's ratings. The retargeting is combined with an underlying matrix factorization regression model that couples the user-wise rankings to exploit shared low dimensional structure. We show that R-MF recovers a unique solution under mild conditions, and propose a simple and efficient optimization scheme that alternates between retargeting the ratings subject to ordering constraints, and matrix factorization regression. The retargeting step is independent for each user, and is trivially parallelized. The ranking performance of retargeted matrix factorization is evaluated on benchmark movie recommendation datasets and results in superior ranking performance compared to collaborative filtering algorithms specifically designed to optimize ranking metrics.},

abstract = {Improving recommendation accuracy is the mostly focused target of recommendation systems, while it has been increasingly recognized that accuracy is not enough as the only quality criterion. More concepts have been proposed recently to augment the evaluation dimensions, such as similarity, diversity, long-tail, etc. Simultaneously considering multiple criteria leads to a multi-task recommendation. In this paper, a graph-based recommendation approach is proposed to effectively and flexibly trade-off among them.Our approach is considered based a 1st order Markovian graph with transition probabilities between user-item pairs. A "cost flow" concept is proposed over the graph, so that items with lower costs are stronger recommended to a user. The cost flows are formulated in a recursive dynamic form, whose stability is proved to be guaranteed by appropriately lower-bounding the transition costs. Furthermore, a mixture of transition costs is designed by combining three ingredients related to long-tail, focusing degree and similarity. To evaluate the ingredients, we propose an orthogonal-sparse-orthogonal nonnegative matrix tri-factorization model and an efficient multiplicative algorithm. Empirical experiments on real-world data show promising results of our approach, which could be regarded as a general framework for other affects if transition costs are designed in various ways.},

abstract = {Classical matrix factorization approaches to collaborative filtering learn a latent vector for each user and each item, and recommendations are scored via the similarity between two such vectors, which are of the same dimension. In this work, we are motivated by the intuition that a user is a much more complicated entity than any single item, and cannot be well described by the same representation. Hence, the variety of a user's interests could be better captured by a more complex representation. We propose to model the user with a richer set of functions, specifically via a set of latent vectors, where each vector captures one of the user's latent interests or tastes. The overall recommendation model is then nonlinear where the matching score between a user and a given item is the maximum matching score over each of the user's latent interests with respect to the item's latent representation. We describe a simple, general and efficient algorithm for learning such a model, and apply it to large scale, real-world datasets from YouTube and Google Music, where our approach outperforms existing techniques.},

In this paper, we solve the personalized social update recommendation problem by proposing a framework which integrates the advantages of collaborative filtering and the characteristics of diffusion processes. The main contributions of this paper are three folds. First, we propose a plenty of diffusion features which capture the characteristics of diffusion processes. Second, we build a joint model which takes the advantages of both collaborative filtering and the characteristics of diffusion processes for recommendation.

To address these problems, we introduce BReK12, a book recommender that makes personalized suggestions tailored to each K-12 user U based on books available on a social book-marking site that (i) are similar in content to the ones that are known to be of interest to U, (ii) have been bookmarked by users with reading patterns similar to U's, and (iii) can be comprehended by U. BReK12 is an asset to its users, since it suggests books that are appealing to its users and at grade levels that they can cope with, which can increase their reading selection choices and motivate them to read. We have also developed ReLAT, the readability analysis tool employed by BReK12 to determine the grade level of books. ReLAT is novel, compared with existing readability formulas, since it can predict the grade level of a book even if an excerpt of the book is not available. We have conducted empirical studies which have verified the accuracy of ReLAT in predicting the grade level of a book and the effectiveness of BReK12 over existing baseline recommendation systems.},

abstract = {Traditional recommender systems minimize prediction error with respect to users' choices. Recent studies have shown that recommender systems have a positive effect on the provider's revenue.In this paper we show that by providing a set of recommendations different than the one perceived best according to user acceptance rate, the recommendation system can further increase the business' utility (e.g. revenue), without any significant drop in user satisfaction. Indeed, the recommendation system designer should have in mind both the user, whose taste we need to reveal, and the business, which wants to promote specific content.We performed a large body of experiments comparing a commercial state-of-the-art recommendation engine with a modified recommendation list, which takes into account the utility (or revenue) which the business obtains from each suggestion that is accepted by the user. We show that the modified recommendation list is more desirable for the business, as the end result gives the business a higher utility (or revenue). To study possible reduce in satisfaction by providing the user worse suggestions, we asked the users how they perceive the list of recommendation that they received. Differences in user satisfaction between the lists is negligible, and not statistically significant.We also uncover a phenomenon where movie consumers prefer watching and even paying for movies that they have already seen in the past than movies that are new to them.},

abstract = {We present a matrix factorization model inspired by challenges we encountered while working on the Xbox movies recommendation system. The item catalog in a recommender system is typically equipped with meta-data features in the form of labels. However, only part of these features are informative or useful with regard to collaborative filtering. By incorporating a novel sparsity prior on feature parameters, the model automatically discerns and utilizes informative features while simultaneously pruning non-informative features.The model is designed for binary feedback, which is common in many real-world systems where numeric rating data is scarce or non-existent. However, the overall framework is applicable to any likelihood function. Model parameters are estimated with a Variational Bayes inference algorithm, which is robust to over-fitting and does not require cross-validation and fine tuning of regularization coefficients. The efficacy of our method is illustrated on a sample from the Xbox movies dataset as well as on the publicly available MovieLens dataset. In both cases, the proposed solution provides superior predictive accuracy, especially for long-tail items. We then demonstrate the feature selection capabilities and compare against the common case of simple Gaussian priors. Finally, we show that even without features, our model performs better than a baseline model trained with the popular stochastic gradient descent approach.},

abstract = {Tag recommendation approaches have historically focused on maximizing the relevance of the recommended tags for a given object, such as a movie or a song. Nevertheless, different users may be interested in the same object for different reasons---for instance, the Star Wars movies may appeal to both adventure as well as to fantasy movie fans. In this situation, a sensible strategy is to provide a user with diverse recommendations of how to tag the object. In this paper, we address the problem of recommending relevant and diverse tags as a ranking problem. In particular, we propose a novel tag recommendation approach that explicitly takes into account the possible topics (e.g., categories) underlying an object in order to promote tags with high coverage and low redundancy with respect to these topics. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed approach using data collected from two popular Web 2.0 applications, namely, LastFM and MovieLens. Our experimental results attest the effectiveness of our approach at promoting more relevant and diverse tags in contrast to state-of-the-art relevance-based methods as well as a recently proposed method that takes both relevance and diversity into account.},

abstract = {In order to recommend products to users we must ultimately predict how a user will respond to a new product. To do so we must uncover the implicit tastes of each user as well as the properties of each product. For example, in order to predict whether a user will enjoy Harry Potter, it helps to identify that the book is about wizards, as well as the user's level of interest in wizardry. User feedback is required to discover these latent product and user dimensions. Such feedback often comes in the form of a numeric rating accompanied by review text. However, traditional methods often discard review text, which makes user and product latent dimensions difficult to interpret, since they ignore the very text that justifies a user's rating. In this paper, we aim to combine latent rating dimensions (such as those of latent-factor recommender systems) with latent review topics (such as those learned by topic models like LDA). Our approach has several advantages. Firstly, we obtain highly interpretable textual labels for latent rating dimensions, which helps us to `justify' ratings with text. Secondly, our approach more accurately predicts product ratings by harnessing the information present in review text; this is especially true for new products and users, who may have too few ratings to model their latent factors, yet may still provide substantial information from the text of even a single review. Thirdly, our discovered topics can be used to facilitate other tasks such as automated genre discovery, and to identify useful and representative reviews.},

Users tend to be overwhelmed by the massive amount of information available, especially with limited browsing options perceived in many event web services. To alleviate this information overload, a recommender system becomes a vital component for assisting users selecting relevant events. However, such system faces a number of challenges owed to the the inherent complex nature of an event. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach built on top of Semantic Web. On the one hand, we use a content-based system enriched with Linked Data to overcome the data sparsity, a problem induced by the transiency of events. On the other hand, we incorporate a collaborative filtering to involve the social aspect, an influential feature in decision making. This hybrid system is enhanced by the integration of a user diversity model designed to detect user propensity towards specific topics. We show how the hybridization of CB+CF systems and the integration of interest diversity features are important to improve predictions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using precision and recall measures.},

abstract = {Many online systems present a list of recommendations and infer user interests implicitly from clicks or other contextual actions. For modeling user feedback in such settings, a common approach is to consider items acted upon to be relevant to the user, and irrelevant otherwise. However, clicking some but not others conveys an implicit ordering of the presented items. Pairwise learning, which leverages such implicit ordering between a pair of items, has been successful in areas such as search ranking. In this work, we study whether pairwise learning can improve community recommendation. We first present two novel pairwise models adapted from logistic regression. Both offline and online experiments in a large real-world setting show that incorporating pairwise learning improves the recommendation performance. However, the improvement is only slight. We find that users' preferences regarding the kinds of communities they like can differ greatly, which adversely affect the effectiveness of features derived from pairwise comparisons. We therefore propose a probabilistic latent semantic indexing model for pairwise learning (Pairwise PLSI), which assumes a set of users' latent preferences between pairs of items. Our experiments show favorable results for the Pairwise PLSI model and point to the potential of using pairwise learning for community recommendation.},

abstract = {The application a smart phone user will launch next intuitively depends on the sequence of apps used recently. More generally, when users interact with systems such as shopping websites or online radio, they click on items that are of interest in the current context. We call the sequence of clicks made in the current session interactional context. It is desirable for a recommender system to use the context set by the user to update recommendations. Most current context-aware recommender systems focus on a relatively less dynamic representational context defined by attributes such as season, location and tastes. In this paper, we study the problem of collaborative filtering with interactional context, where the goal is to make personalized and dynamic recommendations to a user engaged in a session. To this end, we propose the methodname algorithm that works in two stages. First, users are clustered by their transition behavior (one-step Markov transition probabilities between items), and cluster-level Markov models are computed. Then personalized PageRank is computed for a given user on the corresponding cluster Markov graph, with a personalization vector derived from the current context. We give an interpretation of the second stage of the algorithm as adding an appropriate context bias, in addition to click bias (or rating bias), to a classical neighborhood-based collaborative filtering model, where the neighborhood is determined from a Markov graph. Experimental results on two real-life datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm, where we achieve at least 20% (up to 37%) improvement over competitive methods in the recall level at top-20.},

In addition, monitoring the amount of food that was eaten by each patient can provide insights into the optimal amount of each menu item that has to be served to each patient. Furthermore, monitoring food consumption allows to detect irregularities in the eating behavior of the patient, which can be a symptom of illness.},

In this paper, we examine both approaches in detail, and find that the dominating difference lies instead in the training and test data considered: rating prediction is concerned with only the observed ratings, while ranking typically accounts for all items in the collection, whether the user has rated them or not. Furthermore, we show that predicting observed ratings, while popular in the literature, only solves a (small) part of the rating prediction task for any item in the collection, which is a common real-world problem. The reasons are selection bias in the data, combined with data sparsity. We show that the latter rating-prediction task involves the prediction task 'Who rated What' as a sub-problem, which can be cast as a classification or ranking problem. This suggests that solving the ranking problem is not only valuable by itself, but also for predicting the rating value of any item.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian approach for personalized recommendations. In our approach, we model both user preferences and items under recommendation as multivariate Gaussian distributions; and make use of Normal-Inverse Wishart priors to model the recommendation agent beliefs about user types. We employ a lightweight agent-user interaction process, during which the user is presented with and asked to rate a small number of items. We then interpret these ratings in an innovative way, using them to guide a Bayesian updating process that helps us both capture a user's current mood, and maintain her overall user type. We produced several variants of our approach, and applied them in the movie recommendations domain, evaluating them on data from the MovieLens dataset. Our algorithms are shown to be competitive against a state-of-the-art method, which nevertheless requires a minimum set of ratings from various users to provide recommendations---unlike our entirely personalized approach.},

abstract = {Personalization techniques have been widely adopted in many recommender systems. However, experiments on real-world datasets show that for some users in certain contexts, personalized recommendations do not necessarily perform better than recommendations that rely purely on popularity. Broadly, this can be interpreted by the fact that the parameters of a personalization model are usually estimated from sparse data; the resulting personalized prediction, despite of its low bias, is often volatile. In this paper, we study the problem further by investigating into the ranking of recommendation lists. From a risk management and portfolio retrieval perspective, there is no difference between the popularity-based and the personalized ranking as both of the recommendation outputs can be represented as the trade-off between expected relevance (reward) and associated uncertainty (risk). Through our analysis, we discover common scenarios and provide a technique to predict whether personalization will fail. Besides the theoretical understanding, our experimental results show that the resulting switch algorithm, which decides whether or not to personalize, outperforms the mainstream recommendation algorithms.},

abstract = {Traditional batch model-based Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches typically assume a collection of users' rating data is given a priori for training the model. They suffer from a common yet critical drawback, i.e., the model has to be re-trained completely from scratch whenever new training data arrives, which is clearly non-scalable for large real recommender systems where users' rating data often arrives sequentially and frequently. In this paper, we investigate a novel efficient and scalable online collaborative filtering technique for on-the-fly recommender systems, which is able to effectively online update the recommendation model from a sequence of rating observations. Specifically, we propose a family of online multi-task collaborative filtering (OMTCF) algorithms, which tackle the online collaborative filtering task by exploiting the similar principle as online multitask learning. Encouraging empirical results on large-scale datasets showed that the proposed technique is significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {Making recommendations by learning to rank is becoming an increasingly studied area. Approaches that use stochastic gradient descent scale well to large collaborative filtering datasets, and it has been shown how to approximately optimize the mean rank, or more recently the top of the ranked list. In this work we present a family of loss functions, the k-order statistic loss, that includes these previous approaches as special cases, and also derives new ones that we show to be useful. In particular, we present (i) a new variant that more accurately optimizes precision at k, and (ii) a novel procedure of optimizing the mean maximum rank, which we hypothesize is useful to more accurately cover all of the user's tastes. The general approach works by sampling N positive items, ordering them by the score assigned by the model, and then weighting the example as a function of this ordered set. Our approach is studied in two real-world systems, Google Music and YouTube video recommendations, where we obtain improvements for computable metrics, and in the YouTube case, increased user click through and watch duration when deployed live on www.youtube.com.},

Currently, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is one of the most popular algorithms for matrix factorization. However, as a sequential approach, SGD is difficult to be parallelized for handling web-scale problems. In this paper, we develop a fast parallel SGD method, FPSGD, for shared memory systems. By dramatically reducing the cache-miss rate and carefully addressing the load balance of threads, FPSGD is more efficient than state-of-the-art parallel algorithms for matrix factorization.},

Simulating random walks on a graph which fits in memory is trivial, but massive graphs pose a problem: the latency of following walks across network in a cluster or loading nodes from disk on-demand renders basic random walk simulation unbearably inefficient. In this work we propose DrunkardMob, a new algorithm for simulating hundreds of millions, or even billions, of random walks on massive graphs, on just a single PC or laptop. Instead of simulating one walk a time it processes millions of them in parallel, in a batch. Based on DrunkardMob and GraphChi we further propose a framework for easily expressing scalable algorithms based on graph walks.},

We evaluate these approaches using a new large-scale dataset gathered by the Web-based catch-up portal deployed by the provider.

By extending the notion of an item profile, we propose the concept of a "virtual profile" that augments the content of the item with rich set of features inherited from members who have already shown explicit interest in it. Unlike item-based collaborative filtering, we focus on discovering the characteristic descriptors that underlie the item-user association. Such information is used as supplemental features in a content-based filtering system. The main objective of virtual profiles is to provide a means to tap into rich-content information from one type of entity and propagate features extracted from which to other affiliated entities that may suffer from relative data scarcity. We empirically evaluate the proposed method on a real-world community recommendation problem at LinkedIn. The result shows that the virtual profiles outperform a collaborative filtering based approach (user who likes this also likes that). In particular, the improvement is more significant for new users with only limited connections, demonstrating the capability of the method to address the cold-start problem in pure collaborative filtering systems.},

People-to-people recommender systems can be used in social networks to help users find better matches, which requires solving the problem of reciprocal recommendation. However, most existing reciprocal recommenders use either profile similarity or interaction similarity to recommend new matches, without considering temporal features. In this paper we introduce a method for temporal reciprocal recommender systems using Hidden Markov Models to generate recommendations. Instead of summarising the whole historical data in one past state, we propose a model that formalises historical data on interactions as a series of successive states changing over time and then tries to find the recommended next state. We have implemented this new approach and the results of testing on industrial-scale data from a real dating website show a noticeable improvement over the previous best-performing recommenders.},

These are cutting-edge factorized models that have played a key role in the Netflix prize winner's solution. We first employ collaborative information to categorize the users and items. We then discover the shared interests between these categories. Including this new information, we extend these cutting-edge models regarding two main goals: 1) to improve their recommendation accuracies; 2) to keep the extended models still scalable. Finally, we evaluate our proposed models on two recommendation datasets: MovieLens100k, and Netflix. Our experiment shows that adding the shared interests among categories into these models improves their accuracy while maintaining scalability.},

abstract = {The tremendous popularity of Online Social Networks (OSN) has led to situations, where users have their profiles spread across multiple networks. These partial profiles reflect different user characteristics, depending mainly on the nature of the network, e.g., Facebook's social vs. LinkedIn's professional focus. Combining data gathered by multiple networks may benefit individual users, and the community as a whole, as this could facilitate the provision of more accurate services and recommendations. This paper reports on an exploratory study of the process of making such recommendations using a unique multi-network dataset containing user interests across multiple domains, e.g., music, books, and movies. We represent the data using a graph model and generate recommendations using a set of features extracted from and populated by the model. We assess the contribution of various network- and domain-related features to the accuracy of the recommendations and motivate future work into automated feature selection.},

The name is inspired by other sorts of differential analysis, such as differential power analysis and differential cryptanalysis, where insight comes through analysis of slightly differing inputs. In differential data analysis we chunk the data and compare results in the presence or absence of each chunk. We apply differential data analysis to two datasets and three different attributes. The first attribute is called user hardship. This is a novel attribute, particularly relevant to location datasets, that indicates how burdensome a data point was to achieve. The second and third attributes are more standard: timestamp and user rating. For user rating, we confirm previous work concerning the increased importance to the recommender of high and low user ratings.},

Although the recent selections are usually assumed to have higher impact on the recommendation accuracy, empirical studies on this problem are limited. For old data, whether they can contribute to the recommendation accuracy is still to be determined. On one hand, changes in short-term user preference over time may limit their effectiveness in prediction, but on the other hand, one cannot rule out their potential in capturing long term user preferences. The result is important for the system owner to determine which data is useful to make the recommendation accurately. While there have been some related studies on the time dependency of data quality using neighbor-based CF methods (e.g., [4]), its effects remain unverified for other CF methods. In this paper, we study the effect of data generated over different time period on recommendation precision using several popular model-based CF algorithms (latent factor models). experiment results show that while more recent data expectedly have larger impacts, the usefulness of older data cannot be ignored as long as there are sufficient old samples. However, the addition of insufficient amount of old data seems to have negative impacts.},

abstract = {In the field of recommendation system research, a key challenge is how to effectively recommend items for new users, a problem generally known as cold-start recommendation. In order to alleviate cold-start problem, recently systems try to get the users' interests by progressively querying users' preference on predefined items. Constructing the query process via machine learning based techniques becomes an important direction to solve cold-start problem. In this paper, we propose a novel interview process learning algorithm. Different from previous approaches which focus on rate prediction, our model is able to handle wide ranges of loss functions and can be used in collaborative ranking task. Experimental results on three real world recommendation dataset demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several baseline methods.},

This kind of bubbles generally help users to easily identify objects they like. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult for users to escape their personalized world and change their perspectives especially in domains such as music. In this work we present a methodology and related system that allows users to initiate explorations of music genres by taking a gradual path towards the desired genre while viewing the preferences of other users. The proposed methodology is based on identifying 'latent genres' and using user preference graphs for detecting optimal paths towards a selected target latent genre. In this process we generate suggestions of artists a user should listen to, aiming towards serendipitous and novel encounters. We have implemented our approach in a music recommendation system and evaluated it with encouraging results.},

We consider online hotel booking as a case study, and investigates if and how "missing" items (hotels that eventually becomes unavailable for users' consumption) affect the quality of recommendations.

However, the (offline) evaluation of tag recommendation algorithms usually suffers from difficulties like the sparseness of the data or the cold start problem for new resources or users. Previous studies therefore often used so-called post-cores (specific subsets of the original datasets) for their experiments. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale experiment in which we analyze different tag recommendation algorithms on different cores of three real-world datasets. We show, that a recommender's performance depends on the particular core and explore correlations between performances on different cores.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that by using additional user or item relationship information when building hybrid recommender systems, the recommendation quality can be largely improved. However, most such studies only consider a single type of relationship, e.g., social network. Notice that in many applications, the recommendation problem exists in an attribute-rich heterogeneous information network environment. In this paper, we study the entity recommendation problem in heterogeneous information networks. We propose to combine various relationship information from the network with user feedback to provide high quality recommendation results.The major challenge of building recommender systems in heterogeneous information networks is to systematically define features to represent the different types of relationships between entities, and learn the importance of each relationship type. In the proposed framework, we first use meta-path-based latent features to represent the connectivity between users and items along different paths in the related information network. We then define a recommendation model with such latent features and use Bayesian ranking optimization techniques to estimate the model. Empirical studies show that our approach outperforms several widely employed implicit feedback entity recommendation techniques.},

In addition to classical recommendation features like "recommend a sequence" and "find similar items" the paper describes novel algorithms for construction of context aware recommendations, personalization of the service, handling of the cold-start problem, and more. All algorithms described in the paper are working on-line and are able to detect and address changes in the user's behavior and needs in the real time.The core component of the algorithms is a taste graph containing information about different entities (users, tracks, artists, etc.) and relations between them (for example, user A likes song B with certainty X, track B created by artist C, artist C is similar to artist D with certainty Y and so on). Using the graph it is possible to select tracks a user would most probably like, to arrange them in a way that they match each other well, to estimate which items from a fixed list are most relevant for the user, and more.In addition, the paper describes the approach used to estimate algorithms efficiency and analyze the impact of different recommendation related features on the users' behavior and overall activity at the service.},

Assuming certain features or attributes of users are known, one approach for handling new users is to initially model them based on their features.Motivated by an ad targeting application, this paper describes an extreme online recommendation setting where the cold start problem is perpetual. Every user is encountered by the system just once, receives a recommendation, and either consumes or ignores it, registering a binary reward.We introduce One-pass Factorization of Feature Sets, 'OFF-Set', a novel recommendation algorithm based on Latent Factor analysis, which models users by mapping their features to a latent space. OFF-Set is able to model non-linear interactions between pairs of features, and updates its model per each recommendation-reward observation in a pure online fashion. We evaluate OFF-Set against several state of the art baselines, and demonstrate its superiority on real ad-targeting data.},

We report on preliminary experiments with this modified objective, in which the minimisation is carried out using stochastic gradient descent. We show that rankings based on the output of the minimisation succeed in producing recommendation lists with greater diversity, with just a small loss in relevance of the recommendation, as measured by the error rate.},

Recommendation engines that automatically configure such objects given user preferences and constraints, may provide much value in such cases. These applications generate appropriate recommendations based on user preferences. It is likely, though, that the user will not be able to fully express her preferences and constraints, requiring a phase of manual tuning of the recommended configuration. We suggest that following this manual revision, additional constraints and preferences can be automatically collected, and the recommended configuration can be automatically improved. Specifically, we suggest a recommender component that takes as input an initial manual configuration of a complex object, deduces certain user preferences and constraints from this configuration, and constructs an alternative configuration. We show an appealing application for our method in complex trip planning, and demonstrate its usability in a user study.},

abstract = {Bayesian Inference with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) has been shown to provide high prediction quality in recommender systems. The advantage over learning methods such as coordinate descent/alternating least-squares (ALS) or (stochastic) gradient descent (SGD) is that MCMC takes uncertainty into account and moreover MCMC can easily integrate priors to learn regularization values. For factorization models, MCMC inference can be done with efficient Gibbs samplers.However, MCMC algorithms are not point estimators, but they generate a chain of models. The whole chain of models is used to calculate predictions. For large scale models like factorization methods with millions or billions of model parameters, saving the whole chain of models is very storage intensive and can even get infeasible in practice. In this paper, we address this problem and show how a small subset from the chain of models can approximate the predictive distribution well. We use the fact that models from the chain are correlated and propose online selection techniques to store only a small subset of the models. We perform an empirical analysis on the large scale Netflix dataset with several Bayesian factorization models, including matrix factorization and SVD++. We show that the proposed selection techniques approximate the predictions well with only a small subset of model samples.},

abstract = {We study the problem of scoring and selecting content-based features for a collaborative filtering (CF) recommender system. Content-based features play a central role in mitigating the ``cold start'' problem in commercial recommenders. They are also useful in other related tasks, such as recommendation explanation and visualization. However, traditional feature selection methods do not generalize well to recommender systems. As a result, commercial systems typically use manually crafted and selected features. This work presents a framework for automated selection of informative content-based features, that is independent of the type of recommender system or the type of features. We evaluate on recommenders from different domains: books, movies and smart-phone apps, and show effective results on each. In addition, we show how to use the proposed methods to generate meaningful features from text.},

By optimizing this model with a set-oriented pairwise ranking method, we directly achieve personalized top-N recommendation results which are both relevant and diversified. We also utilize category information explicitly for learning personalized diversity.

abstract = {Most recommenders research aims at personalized systems, which suggest items based on user profiles. However, in reality many systems deal with item-oriented recommendations. In such setups, given a single item of interest, the system needs to provide other related items, following patterns like "people who liked this also liked...".While item-oriented systems are central in their importance, they have been approached so far using very basic tools. We identify several hurdles faced by standard approaches to the item-oriented task. First, the sparseness of observed activities prevents establishing reliable similarity relations for many item pairs. Second, we address a scalability challenge at the retrieval stage present in many real-world systems: Given an item inventory, which may encompass millions of items, it is desired to identify the most related item pairs in a sub-quadratic time. This work addresses these two challenges, thereby improving both accuracy and scalability of item-oriented recommenders. Additionally, we propose an empirical evaluation scheme for comparing the quality of different solutions with encouraging results.},

We illustrate the usefulness of the method for a photo recommendation task using data obtained from two popular photo-sharing websites: Flickr and Panoramio.

RS operators encourage the existence of power user communities and leverage them to help fellow users make informed purchase decisions. Thus, RS research in this area has focused on power user identification and utilization to address challenges such as rating sparsity for new items or users. But, as ever, there remains the potential for corruption of power. Alongside accuracy and efficiency measures, RS robustness to manipulation or 'attack' has been studied using injection of false user profiles. Our research is investigating the impact on RS predictions and top-N recommendation lists when simulated power users provide biased ratings for new items. In this study, we introduce the notion of a 'Power User Attack' for RS robustness analysis, as well as a novel use of social networking degree centrality concepts for identifying RS power users. Initial results show that power users identified using in-degree centrality, compared to other techniques, can be more influential as reflected by accuracy and robustness impacts before and after power user attacks.},

The key contribution of the xCLiMF algorithm is that it builds a recommendation model by optimizing Expected Reciprocal Rank, an evaluation metric that generalizes reciprocal rank in order to incorporate user feedback with multiple levels of relevance.

abstract = {In a social network, users can sort members of their social graph into friend lists to both understand the social structures within the graph and control the flow of incoming and outgoing information. To reduce the user-effort required to create these lists, previous work has developed techniques for generating friend-lists in a static social graph. This paper considers the user effort required to create friend lists in an evolving graph. We have developed several new initial quantitative metrics to capture this effort, and identified an initial technique for modeling graph growth. We have used these metrics and model to compare two techniques for evolving friend lists when the social graph grows: manual evolution - the user evolves friend lists using no external tools -- and full recommendation -- an existing state of the art tool recommends a whole new set of friend lists. In these comparisons, we used the friend lists of 12 individuals, and simulated the growth of their social graphs and friend lists using our graph-growth model. Intuitively, when the graph evolves by a small (large) amount, the manual (automatic) approach should perform better. Our experiments show that full recommendation performs better than manual when the social graph changes by more than 1%, and yields an almost complete reduction in effort in the best cases.},

abstract = {Daily deals sites (DDSs), such as Groupon and LivingSocial, attract millions of customers in the hunt for products and services at significantly reduced prices. A typical approach to increase revenue is to send email messages featuring the deals of the day. Such daily messages, however, are usually not centered on the customers, instead, all registered users typically receive similar messages with almost the same deals. Traditional recommendation algorithms are innocuous in DDSs because: (i) most of the users are sporadic bargain hunters, and thus past preference data is extremely sparse, (ii) deals have a short living period, and thus data is extremely volatile, and (iii) user taste and interest may undergo temporal drifts. In order to address such particularly challenging scenario, we propose new algorithms for daily deals recommendation based on the explore-then-exploit strategy.Users are split into exploration and exploitation sets -- in the exploration set the users receive non-personalized messages and a co-purchase network is updated with user feedback for purchases of the day, while in the exploitation set the updated network is used for recommending personalized messages for the remaining users.A thorough evaluation of our algorithms using real data obtained from a large daily deals website in Brazil in contrast to state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms show gains in precision ranging from 18% to 34%.},

Since then, numerous algorithms and recommendation approaches have been proposed, which gives rise to a new type of problem: recommendation algorithm overload. Although hybrid recommendation techniques, which combine the strengths of individual recommenders, have become well-accepted, the procedure of building and tuning a hybrid recommender is still a tedious and time-consuming process. In our work, we focus on dynamically building personalized hybrid recommender systems on an individual user basis. By means of a dynamic online learning strategy we combine the most appropriate recommendation algorithms for a user based on realtime relevance feedback.

abstract = {Many small and mid-sized e-businesses use the services of recommender system (RS) provider companies to outsource the construction and maintenance of their RS. The fees that RS providers charge their clients must cover the computation costs for constructing and updating the recommendation model. By using anytime algorithms, a RS provider can control the computation costs and still offer a system capable of delivering reasonable recommendations. Thus, a RS provider should be able to stop the construction of a recommendation model once the cost for compu-ting it reaches the amount the customer has agreed to pay. In this research we suggest anytime algorithms as a possible solu-tion to a problem that RS providers face. We demonstrate how certain existing recommendation algorithms can be adjusted to the anytime framework. We focus on the case of item-item algorithms, showing how the anytime behavior can be improved using different ordering methods of computations.

abstract = {Heterogeneous graph-based recommendation frameworks have flexibility in that they can incorporate various recommendation algorithms and various kinds of information to produce better results. In this demonstration, we present a heterogeneous graph-based recommendation simulator which enables participants to experience the flexibility of a heterogeneous graph-based recommendation method. With our system, participants can simulate various recommendation semantics by expressing the semantics via meaningful paths like User → Movie → User → Movie. The simulator then returns the recommendation results on the fly based on the user-customized semantics using a fast Monte Carlo algorithm.},

abstract = {Experiment replication and reproduction are key requirements for empirical research methodology, and an important open issue in the field of Recommender Systems. When an experiment is repeated by a different researcher and exactly the same result is obtained, we can say the experiment has been replicated. When the results are not exactly the same but the conclusions are compatible with the prior ones, we have a reproduction of the experiment. Reproducibility and replication involve recommendation algorithm implementations, experimental protocols, and evaluation metrics. While the problem of reproducibility and replication has been recognized in the Recommender Systems community, the need for a clear solution remains largely unmet, which motivates the present workshop.},

These aspects will be discussed in the context of published original work developed by the authors and their collaborators and in many cases deployed in massive-scale real world applications on professional networks such as LinkedIn.},
