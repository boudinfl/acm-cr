abstract = {Most available information today, both from printed books and digital repositories, is in the form of free-format texts. The task of retrieving information from these ever-growing repositories has become a challenge for information retrieval (IR) researchers. In some fields, such as Botany and Taxonomy, textual descriptions observe a set of rules and use a relatively limited vocabulary. This makes botanical textual descriptions an interesting area to explore IR techniques for finding structure and facilitating semantic analysis.This paper presents X-tract, a solution to the problem of text analysis and structure extraction in a specific application domain, namely floristic morphologic descriptions. The solution demonstrates the potential of using a grammar in the determination of information structure in a botanical digital library. We have developed a prototype based on this approach in which given an HTML or plain text, X-tract analyzes it and presents results to the user so he or she can verify the proposed structure before updating the database. This transformation is useful also in the process of storing morphologic descriptions in a database with a pre-established format. The solution is implemented in the context of the Floristic Digital Library (FDL), a large digital library project comprising a wide variety of botanical documents, formats and services.},

address = {USA},
abstract = {A common model for computing the similarity of two strings X and Y of lengths m, and n respectively with m = n, is to transform X into Y through a sequence of three types of edit operations: insertion, deletion, and substitution. The model assumes a given cost function which assigns a non-negative real weight to each edit operation. The amortized weight for a given edit sequence is the ratio of its weight to its length, and the minimum of this ratio over all edit sequences is the normalized edit distance. Existing algorithms for normalized edit distance computation with proven complexity bounds require O(mn2) time in the worst-case. We give an O(mnlogn)-time algorithm for the problem when the cost function is uniform, i.e, the weight of each edit operation is constant within the same type, except substitutions can have different weights depending on whether they are matching or non-matching.},

After intro ducing the formal model we investigate its properties and prove in particular that the circular insertion/deletion systems are capable of universal computation. We also give the results of an experimental laboratory implementation of our model. This shows that rewriting systems of the circular insertion/deletion type are viable alternatives in DNA computation.},

Our algorithm makes it possible to use the suffix array for much larger texts and suggests new areas of application. Our experiments on several text data sets (including 514-MB Japanese newspapers) demonstrate that our algorithm is 4.5 to 6.9 times faster than Quicksort, and 2.5 to 3.6 times faster than Sadakane's algorithm, which is considered to be the fastest algorithm in previous works.},

abstract = {We present a new method for the calculation of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The input to our problem are n protein sequences. We assume that the sequences are related with each other and that there exists some unknown evolutionary tree that corresponds to the MSA. One advantage of our method is that the scoring can be done with reference to this phylogenetic tree, even though the tree structure itself may remain unknown. Instead of computing an evolutionary tree, we only need to compute a circular tour of the tree which is determined via a Traveling Sales-man Problem (TSP) algorithm. Our algorithm can calculate a near optimal MSA and has a performance guarantee of mathopt (where opt is the optimal score of the MSA). The algorithm runs in mathtime, where k is the length of the longest input sequence. From there we improve the alignment further. Experimental results are shown at the end.},

The number of distances computed to achieve this goal is the complexity measure.Our data structure, called sa-tree (``spatial approximation tree''), is based on approaching spatially the searched objects. We analyze our method and show that the number of distance evaluations to search among n objects is o(n). We show experimentally that the sa-tree is the best existing technique when the metric space is high-dimensional or the query has low selectivity.

abstract = {Relational databases and Datalog view each attribute as indivisible. This view, though useful in several applications, does not provide a suitable database paradigm for use in genetic, multi-media or scientific databases. Data in these applications are unstructured; querying on sub-strings of attribute-values is often necessary. Moreover, due to imprecision and incompleteness in the data, approximate reasoning is also indispensable. Our aim is to view strings as database objects that can be compared, divided, subsumed, interpreted and approximated. Allowing such operations on strings enriches the semantics and increases the expressive power of database languages.In this paper we develop an extension to the relational algebra augmenting it with the concept of a string expression with a rich structure of string variables, mapping functions, interpreted string operations and approximate evaluations. We study properties of such expressions and show that many of the well-known properties of relational algebra hold in the extension. We also discuss an extension to Datalog(String) and an implementation of a proto-type system called S-log. S-log integrates a pattern-matching routine in a Datalog framework.We contend that string-oriented database systems would be useful in applications that require efficient sub-structure analysis, such as aligning DNA strings using motifs, retrieving and synthesizing iconic images based on content.},

isbn = {0769502687},
publisher = {IEEE Computer Society},
address = {USA},
abstract = {An important feature of a document database system is that the documents can be retrieved by searching for words from their contents. In a full-text index, each word of the stored documents can be used as a search key. Inserting a new document into the database automatically triggers a transaction that inserts the words together with their occurrence information into the index. In this paper, we present solutions to problems that arise when full-text indexing is applied for constantly changing document data, such as WWW pages.We present and analyze an algorithm for full-text indexing with the following properties: Concurrent searches are possible and efficient, and the algorithm can be designed such that several indexing processes can be performed concurrently. Moreover, the algorithm allows efficient recovery of the index after failures that can occur while the index is modified. This is important for large indices, because when not prepared for failures, the index may need to be reconstructed from original documents.},

Previous experiments have shown that, where there is not sufficient memory to store a full word-based model, encoding rare words as sequences of characters can still allow good compression, while a pure character-based model is poor. We propose a further kind of model that reduces main memory costs: approximate models, in which rare words are represented by similarly-spelt common words and a sequence of edits. We investigate the compression available with different models, including characters, words, word pairs, and edits, and with combinations of these approaches. We show experimentally that carefully chosen combinations of models can improve the compression available in limited memory and greatly reduce overall memory requirements.},

abstract = {The development of alternative futures/scenarios, is an important part of strategy making. Indeed 'scenario planning' has recently become a popular activity in its own right. However, methods for involving directly the power brokers in the process are not well developed, and yet the ownership of the strategic thinking which follows from thinking about alternative futures is crucial for successful strategic change. This paper presents a method for involving the senior management team that succeeds because of its involvement of a Group Decision Support System (GDSS). The method described has been used in a wide variety of organizations - public and private, large and small. After describing the role of thinking about alternative futures in strategy making and its relationship to stakeholder analysis and management, the paper goes on to describe the method and use of the GDSS, and finally consider some of the reasons why the use of a GDSS is helpful.},

The Facilitation Tool was developed to address these two issues. The tool was built around a comprehensive decision-making model, contributing with generic knowledge to planning activities. The Facilitation Tool also provides a set of techniques allowing facilitators to steer and focus group participants, analyse and understand issues, and moderate conflicting or chaotic situations.},

Our approach unifies both the hybrid and the fully distributed architectures for document storage and access. Although the architectures seem antagonistic, they are integrated within our system to allow distributed and temporarily disconnected cooperative authoring of Web documents.

In practice, we found this was not the case. Different methodologies were appropriate for different phases of the project, and different shifts in the subject matter. The best fit to our work was Harper's guidelines for design-oriented ethnography. But even this missed two major facets of the work: a friend in the organization and the importance of prototyping. We conclude that there was no one methodology that could have been chosen at the outset, nor even with hindsight, (retro)fitted at the end to all the needs of the project.
