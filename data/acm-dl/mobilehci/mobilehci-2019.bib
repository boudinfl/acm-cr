abstract = {Rendering haptic feedback in virtual reality is a common approach to enhancing the immersion of virtual reality content. However, current editing tools allow developers to access the haptic feedback only through physical contact with the actuators, making it difficult to fast iterate haptic interaction designs. This paper introduces SeeingHaptics, an authoring tool which visualizes haptic properties in 3D scenes. The active area of certain feedback is simulated with mesh shapes, while the 2D icons allow for indicating the type of haptic sensation. Our evaluation showed that SeeingHaptics helps developers rapidly create haptic feedbacks after a short training session.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate mobile devices as interactive controllers to support the exploration of 3D data spaces in head-mounted Augmented Reality (AR). In future mobile contexts, applications such as immersive analysis or ubiquitous information retrieval will involve large 3D data sets, which must be visualized in limited physical space. This necessitates efficient interaction techniques for 3D panning and zooming. Smartphones as additional input devices are promising because they are familiar and widely available in mobile usage contexts. They also allow more casual and discreet interaction compared to free-hand gestures or voice input. We introduce smartphone-based pan &amp; zoom techniques for 3D data spaces and present a user study comparing five techniques. Our results show that spatial device gestures can outperform both touch-based techniques and hand gestures in terms of task completion times and user preference. We discuss our findings in detail and suggest suitable techniques for specific AR navigation tasks.},

abstract = {Emojis are commonly used as non-verbal cues in texting, yet may also lead to misunderstandings due to their often ambiguous meaning. User personality has been linked to understanding of emojis isolated from context, or via indirect personality assessment through text analysis. This paper presents the first study on the influence of personality (measured with BFI-2) on understanding of emojis, which are presented in concrete mobile messaging contexts: four recipients (parents, friend, colleague, partner) and four situations (information, arrangement, salutory, romantic). In particular, we presented short text chat scenarios in an online survey (N=646) and asked participants to add appropriate emojis. Our results show that personality factors influence the choice of emojis. In another open task participants compared emojis found as semantically similar by related work. Here, participants provided rich and varying emoji interpretations, even in defined contexts. We discuss implications for research and design of mobile texting interfaces.},

Instead, aspects like phone grip or occlusion of the screen have been shown to also have an influence on accuracy. Yet, these are all dependent on one underlying factor: the size and proportions of the user's hand. To better understand touch input, we investigate how 11 hand features influence accuracy. We find that thumb length in particular correlates significantly with touch accuracy and accounts for about 12% of touch error variance. Furthermore, we show that measures of some higher level interactions also correlate with hand size.},

Yet little is known about how users conceptualise perceptions of humanness and how people define their interaction with speech interfaces through this. To map these perceptions n=21 participants held dialogues with a human and two speech interface based intelligent personal assistants, and then reflected and compared their experiences using the repertory grid technique. Analysis of the constructs show that perceptions of humanness are multidimensional, focusing on eight key themes: partner knowledge set, interpersonal connection, linguistic content, partner performance and capabilities, conversational interaction, partner identity and role, vocal qualities and behavioral affordances. Through these themes, it is clear that users define the capabilities of speech interfaces differently to humans, seeing them as more formal, fact based, impersonal and less authentic. Based on the findings, we discuss how the themes help to scaffold, categorise and target research and design efforts, considering the appropriateness of emulating humanness.},

Nine women from a low-income community evaluated the app and provided suggestions to improve its design. After making suggested changes, we deployed MomLink and its corresponding provider app for a pre-pilot evaluation. The evaluation met an unexpected barrier resulting in low usage of the system by both women and providers.

abstract = {While mid-air gestures are an attractive modality with an extensive research history, one challenge with their usage is that the gestures are not self-revealing. Scaffolding techniques to teach these gestures are difficult to implement since the input device, e.g. a hand, wand or arm, cannot present the gestures to the user. In contrast, for touch gestures, feedforward mechanisms (such as Marking Menus or OctoPocus) have been shown to effectively support user awareness and learning. In this paper, we explore whether touch gesture input can be leveraged to teach users to perform mid-air gestures. We show that marking menu touch gestures transfer directly to knowledge of mid-air gestures, allowing performance of these gestures without intervention. We argue that cross-modal learning can be an effective mechanism for introducing users to mid-air gestural input.},

We report effects of age and finger usage on performance that correspond to previous studies. We also find evidence of relationships between performance and use of intelligent text entry techniques: auto-correct usage correlates positively with entry rates, whereas word prediction usage has a negative correlation. To aid further work on modeling, machine learning and design improvements in mobile text entry, we make the code and dataset openly available.},

The lack of such reassuring elements may cause anxiety to those trying to learn interaction paradigms that are new to them.

As a result, it provides users with a dynamic relationship between inputs and outputs, awareness of current tool selection and parameters, and increased expressive match (e.g., added ability to mimic physical tools, showing clipboard contents). We discuss and reflect upon a series of interaction techniques that demonstrate WatchPen within a drawing application. We highlight the expressive power of leveraging multiple sensing and output capabilities across both the watch-augmented stylus and the tablet surface.},

Strangers are not typically trained photographers, nor are they telepathically intuiting what composition the tourist wants. Existing smartphone camera interfaces do not communicate the desired framing to the stranger, and prior work in mobile photography guidance does not manage the 3D movement required when composing the tourist's ideal photo. We offer a new kind of mobile interaction for communicating the intended photo to a stranger without instructions. In our methodology, the tourist first composes a photo with the desired framing. The app, Cake Cam, then stores the camera position and orientation. Finally, 3D augmented reality markers guide the stranger to retake the photo with the tourist now standing in the frame. Our study resulted in more accurate camera placements and required fewer additional instructions than the traditional tourist photography method (n=40).},

Although the accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) has significantly improved, an interface for text modification is still essential. Considering the strict limitation of a narrow display area and practical demand of text modification, the proposed interface arranges the N-best results of ASR and a list of morphemes consisting of the 1-best result to enable quick access to any word to be modified. Specifically, multiple screens of the N-best results are switched by horizontal flicks, and another extended screen listing a morpheme sequence of the 1-best result is scrolled by vertical flicks. The proposed interface was compared with a software keyboard and a speech-input-enabled input method editor (IME), which was a simple combination of speech input and software keyboard. The proposed interface outperformed the other two interfaces in terms of time required to complete specified sentences, subjective score using system usability scale (SUS), and perceived workload quantified using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX).},

The participants' speculation about apps was both more common and more accurate than that about senders. They also were more likely to 1) perceive notifications as important, 2) attend to them, and 3) consider them beneficial if they speculated about them than if they did not or could not. Participants' speculations were based on the alert's inherent characteristics, context, and temporality. Inaccurate speculations were mainly caused by unclear signals, insufficient clues, and a multiplicity of possible sources. Ringer mode affected the accuracy of user speculation, but not its frequency or the frequency of attending to notifications.},

Autocorrect reduces the time it takes to manually fix typing errors, which results in typing speed increase. However, recent user studies uncovered an unexplored side-effect: participants' aversion to typing errors despite autocorrect. We present a computational model of typing on keyboards with autocorrect, which enables precise study of expert typists' aversion to typing errors on such keyboards. Unlike empirical typing studies that last days, our model evaluates this phenomenon for any autocorrect accuracy in seconds. We show that typists' aversion to typing errors imposes a limit on upper bound typing speeds, even for highly accurate autocorrect. Our findings motivate future keyboard designs that reduce typists' aversion to typing errors to increase typing speeds.},

The loop menu design uses a selection mechanism with loops to approximate directional selections in a menu system. We evaluate the merits of loop and marking menu selection in an experiment with two phases and report that 1) the loop-based selection mechanism provides smooth and effective interaction; 2) users prioritize accuracy and comfort over speed for mid-air gestures; 3) users can exploit the flexibility of a final hybrid marking/loop menu design; and, finally, 4) users tend to chunk gestures depending on the selection task and their level of familiarity with the menu layout.},

We designed two new visualizations of location uncertainty and compared them to existing ones in terms of efficiency and user acceptance. A field-based user study(N=18) showed that the two new visualizations significantly reduced the number of wrong turns. Users preferred the landmark-based visualization most and ranked it as the most helpful visualization for judging their true location in the environment when faced with GPS degradations. Despite participants being unfamiliar with the new visualizations, the task completion time, subjective task load and user experience for them were not significantly different from the more familiar state-of-the-art visualization.},

We conducted a user study by evaluating for both the reader and observer in terms of privacy, reading comfort, and reading speed for three reading modes; normal, underscored, and scrambled text. "Scrambled" performs best in terms of perceived effort and frustration for the shoulder surfer. Our contribution is threefold; we developed a system to preserve privacy by rendering only the text at gaze-point of the reader, we conducted a user study to evaluate user preferences and subjective task load, and we suggested several scenarios where Private Reader is useful in public spaces.},

abstract = {To better explore the incorporation of pointing and gesturing into ubiquitous computing, we introduce WRIST, an interaction and sensing technique that leverages the dexterity of human wrist motion. WRIST employs a sensor fusion approach which combines inertial measurement unit (IMU) data from a smartwatch and a smart ring. The relative orientation difference of the two devices is measured as the wrist rotation that is independent from arm rotation, which is also position and orientation invariant. Employing our test hardware, we demonstrate that WRIST affords and enables a number of novel yet simplistic interaction techniques, such as (i) macro-micro pointing without explicit mode switching and (ii) wrist gesture recognition when the hand is held in different orientations (e.g., raised or lowered). We report on two studies to evaluate the proposed techniques and we present a set of applications that demonstrate the benefits of WRIST. We conclude with a discussion of the limitations and highlight possible future pathways for research in pointing and gesturing with wearable devices.},

abstract = {When users operate smartphones and desktop interfaces with their fingers, there are differences between the motor and visual widths. For example, when a user selects an item from a vertical menu, the area that is physically touched by the user is often larger than the visual width (e.g., of the label for the item selected). Therefore, the user aims for the label assuming that the label width (the visual width) means the motor width. Consequently, the user performs operations more carefully than necessary. We conducted an experiment to investigate the effect of the motor and visual widths on finger pointing. After asking participants to explore the motor width, they performed an experimental task. Our experiment shows that the users' movement time depends on the motor width and can be predicted. We also analyze existing interfaces and discuss the implications.},

This paper provides: a description of HasAnswers; the results of iterative testing with 59 young people (36 male, 23 female) using paper and digital prototypes; and feedback from other services with a responsibility for supporting young people to achieve an independent adulthood, as a potential target market for the future scaling up of HasAnswers. While preliminary, the findings indicate the usefulness and acceptability of HasAnswers. The research contributes to HCI work on design for independent living and homelessness.

abstract = {A watch-back tactile display (WBTD) is an attractive output option due to its always-available nature. However, employing commonly-used vibration modality on a WBTD may result in a low efficiency since its stimulation area is relatively wide compared with the small contact area of a watch-back. We considered using a more localized tactile stimulus, a poke, to improve the efficiency of a WBTD. We built a WBTD consisting of overlapping 3\texttimes{}3 poke and vibrotactile tactor arrays so that it may be used either as a poke display or as a vibrotactile display. An experiment was conducted to optimize the parameters of poke stimuli, and its results revealed that four directional patterns were best recognized when poking depth was deepest (3 mm) and sensory saltation was exploited. In the next two experiments, we compared the information transfer capacities of the poke and vibrotactile displays. The information transfer capacity of the poke display (1.55 bits) was shown to be higher than that of the vibrotactile display (1.32 bits) in a simulated environment with the mental load of a primary task. This result confirmed our expectation that using a more localized tactile stimulus would improve the efficiency of a WBTD.},

Results collected during a twelve-day user study with fingerprint sensor users show that fingerprint sensor gesture reporting compares favorably to Slide-to-X approaches. The proposed gestural interface was subjectively perceived as being the fastest, least intrusive, and overall most preferred interface, in addition to offering the highest response compliance.

Generally, auto-complete options are ranked on the basis of previous context and word probabilities. However, this leads to missing out on the user intended word simply because there are more frequently used words with the same prefix, in the same context. In this paper, we propose a gesture-based solution to recognize and complete partially-written words, where the user indicates to the system the missing text length by a stroke gesture, thus ruling out a huge subset of possibilities. We also propose a length dependent hybrid score ranking system, to improve the prediction accuracy and speed. Our results show that using a gesture stroke length based searching method not only reduced the processing time by 27% but also showed an accuracy increase of 10%, when the top 3 candidates are considered.},

abstract = {The majority of mobile applications use built-in touchscreens and/or accelerometers to provide direct ways for user inputs. Yet, the need to manipulate the device itself (e.g. touch, tilt) poses usability issues such as occlusion and inaccuracy. To address these issues, research proposed using the built-in magnetometer and magnets to facilitate around-device interactions. However, there is little evaluation in how this technique impacts performance and user experience beyond simple docking tasks. To fill this gap, we explored the mobile gameplay context by implementing an interface that uses rotatory gestures from a magnetic ring as input, and compared two control mappings (angular and linear) with touch and tilt in a usability study using a mobile game. We found that rotatory gestures with the ring, when mapped to angular controls, were on par with touch and superior over tilt, and engendered greater gameplay experience and sense of mapping. Based on our findings, we discuss implications of using this technique for gameplay, as well as other applications.},

Crossing at non-designated crossing points on a straight road and at a junction, where vehicles turn towards the pedestrian, are explored.

Audio notifications of mobile devices with high saliency can increase users' receptivity, yet overly high saliency could cause annoyance. Accurately measuring auditory saliency of a notification is critical for evaluating its usability. Previous studies adopted behavioral methods. However, their results may not accurately reflect auditory saliency as humans' perception of auditory saliency often involves complicated cognitive processes. Thus, we propose an electroencephalography (EEG)-based approach that can complement behavioral studies to provide a more nuanced analysis of auditory saliency. We evaluated our method by conducting an EEG experiment that measured the mismatch negativity and P3a of the sounds in realistic scenarios. We also conducted a behavioral experiment to link the EEG-based method with the behavioral method. The results suggested that EEG can provide detailed information about how human perceive auditory saliency and complement the behavioral measures.},

In addition, results reveal that participants learn to perceive smaller and smaller autostereogram content faster with practice.

As an examplar of the usage of this framework, we demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of HOF with an Android application for improving single-user and group selfie-taking experience through providing appearance customization in real-time. In a within-subjects study comparing HOF against touch input for single-user interaction, we found that HOF input led to significant improvements in accuracy and perceived workload, and was preferred by the participants. Qualitative results of an observational study also demonstrated the potential of HOF input modality to improve the user experience in multi-user interactions. Based on the lessons learned from our studies, we propose a set of potential applications of HOF to support smartphone interaction. We envision that the affordances provided by the this modality can expand the mobile interaction vocabulary and facilitate scenarios where touch input is limited or even not possible.},

This paper explores what motivates people to tip and how it impacts interactions between viewers and streamers. Through a survey, we identified the main categories of viewers' tipping motivations. We found that viewers were motivated by the reciprocal acts of streamers, who would engage in various types of social interactions with tippers during the live streams. The styles of interactions and contents of live stream based on the tipping are differently influenced by the motivations of viewers and streamers. For example, viewers often tip large to attract attentions from the crowd or promote preferred live-streaming content. These findings provide more knowledge on the social interaction in live streaming platforms.},

While previous work showed the benefits of input beyond the touchscreen, unfavorably designed input controls force detrimental grip changes and increase the likelihood of unintended inputs. Researchers investigated all fingers' comfortable areas to avoid grip changes. However, there is no understanding of unintended BoD inputs which frustrate users and lead to embarrassing mistakes. In this paper, we study the BoD areas in which unintended inputs occur during interaction with the touchscreen. Participants performed common tasks on four smartphones which they held in the prevalent single-handed grip while sitting and walking. We recorded finger movements with a motion capture system and analyzed the unintended inputs. We identified comfortable areas on the back in which no unintended inputs occur and found that the least unintended inputs occurred on 5" devices. We derive three design implications for BoD input to help designers considering reachability and unintended input.},

abstract = {Moving a caret to the desired position in a text field is challenging and inefficient, especially when the user has only one hand available to hold and interact with a mobile phone. We propose a shortcut on keyboards that enables precise and efficient caret positioning in a text field on mobile devices. The proposed method uses a long press on a key to determine the desired position for the caret in the text field. A lab experiment was conducted to compare the shortcut with the traditional handle method and an existing method provided by the Google Keyboard. Even though participants were using the proposed shortcut for the first time, the technique achieved a higher task completion speed comparing to the Google method and was as quick as the traditional handle method. It also showed advantages in accuracy and user perceptions than the other two methods for one-handed interaction.},

abstract = {We present AudioTouch, a minimally invasive approach for sensing micro-gestures using active bio-acoustic sensing. It only requires attaching two piezo-electric elements, acting as a surface mounted speaker and microphone, on the back of the hand. It does not require any instrumentation on the palm or fingers; therefore, it does not encumber interactions with physical objects. The signal is rich enough to detect small differences in micro-gestures with standard machine-learning classifiers. This approach also allows for the discrimination of different levels of touch-force, further expanding the interaction vocabulary. We conducted four experiments to evaluate the performances of AudioTouch: a user study for measuring the gesture recognition accuracy, a follow-up study investigating the ability to discriminate different levels of touch-force, an experiment assessing the cross-session robustness, and, a systematic evaluation assessing the effect of sensor placement on the back of the hand.},

There are diverse issues affecting the quality of dormitory life and roommate relationships, which can influence one's psychosocial development. In this paper, we propose WithDorm, a mobile application to help communication with roommates and tighten their connections, and thereby assisting the users' emotional health and psychosocial development. We analyzed dormitory roommate issues from a human-centered perspective and narrowed down to three design implications after dormitory life modeling. Furthermore, we implemented the design implications in a prototype and performed a usability test to evaluate and improve the design. The final design, WithDorm, is aware of dormitory-specific concerns, collects and adapts to users' lifestyles, and initiates humanhuman interaction among roommates.},

Our models based on data from 33 IM user achieved an accuracy of up to 71% (AUROC). In particular, we show that 90-day IM-communication patterns, in general, outperformed their 14-day equivalent in our prediction models, indicating better coherence between long-term IM patterns with their general communication experience.},

Global and local localizations are then achieved based on this similarity and a particle filter. The x--, y-- coordinates and θ angle of a participant in a room can thus be estimated practically, as demonstrated experimentally.},

abstract = {As the touchscreen is the most successful input method of current mobile devices, the importance to transmit more information per touch is raising. A wide range of approaches has been presented to enhance the richness of a single touch. With Apple's 3D Touch, they successfully introduce pressure as a new input dimension into consumer devices. However, they are using a new sensing layer, which increases production cost and hardware complexity. Moreover, users have to upgrade their phones to use the new feature. In contrast, with this work, we introduce a strategy to acquire the pressure measurements from the mutual capacitive sensor, which is used in the majority of today's touch devices. We present a data collection study in which we collect capacitive images where participants apply different pressure levels. We then train a Deep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate the pressure allowing for force touch detection. As a result, we present a model which enables estimating the pressure with a mean error of 369.0g.},

abstract = {Information behaviour models have been used extensively to explain people's interactions with information, such as in information search and user behaviour in libraries. However, we do not yet know the connection between components of information models and the interface design of digital systems, particularly when these are designed to support marginalized users such as older adults (OAs). Yet, this connection may relate to users' perceptions and subsequent adoption of emerging technologies, such as the autonomous virtual agents (VAs) functioning as advice-dispensing chatbots (increasingly present on mobile devices). We explore here the feasibility of information models in informing our understanding of how OAs may use and perceive a VA. For this, we use the information search process (ISP) model to explain the results of a case study with health information VAs and speculate on the implications of the ISP on the design of mobile-based VAs, chatbots, and voice-based interfaces.},

abstract = {While lab-based approaches to evaluation of location-based services (LBSs) allow faster, cost-effective and less complicated evaluation of many aspects, they are limited in evaluating certain aspects, especially the ones related to usability and user experience (UX). Variations in the location information quality can negatively affect location-based UX. Lab-based evaluations are limited in factoring users' actual context, which includes location quality variations into the evaluation process. Therefore, to evaluate actual location-based UX, we need to evaluate LBSs in-the-wild with users under variations in the quality of location information. Currently, there is a lack of standard tools, methods, and frameworks for this purpose. Motivated by this factor, in this paper, we describe the Location Uncertainty Injection Framework (LUIF) for evaluating mobile LBSs in-the-wild with users under location quality variations. We also present the results of a study conducted to gain initial feedback on the potential use cases of the framework.},

Recently, museums started to experiment with enhancing exhibitions through mixed reality. It enables cultural exhibitors to provide each visitor with an individualized virtual guide that adapts to the visitor's interests. The effect of the presence and appearance of a virtual museum guide is, however, unclear. In this paper, we compare a real-world guide with a realistic, an abstract, and an audio-only representation of the virtual guide. Participants followed four multimodal presentations while we investigated the effect on comprehension and perceived co-presence. We found that a realistic representation of a virtual guide increases the perceived co-presence and does not adversely affect the comprehension of learning content in mixed reality exhibitions. Insights from our study inform the design of virtual guides for real-world exhibitions.},

Numerous improvements were made in the development of better GUIs however, little has been done to improve existing ones. This might be explained by the fact that most ICSs do not provide source code access. In most cases, this means that only persons with source code access can (easily) enhance the respective GUI.This paper presents a tool using computer vision (CV) algorithms to semi-automatically redefine existing GUIs without accessing their source code. The evaluation of a new GUI obtained from the redefinition of an existing GUI using the tool is described. Results show statistically significant improvements in usability (reduction of interaction mistakes), improved task completion success rate and improved user satisfaction.},

abstract = {In agile development, lean UX designers perform rapid prototyping and quick evaluation of prototypes to ensure fast releases. To understand designers' workflow during rapid prototyping, we interviewed 15 lean UX designers. We identified the following pain points in the workflow: 1) Compromise on quality of UI design due to time constraint 2) UI design knowledge being scattered among numerous sources such as websites and books 3) Inability of developers to reproduce the same quality of UI design due to lack of UI design knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a UI design pattern-driven approach for rapid prototyping. To realize this approach, we introduce Kiwi, a library for UI design patterns and guidelines that aims to consolidate UI design knowledge for mobile applications. Each UI design pattern consists of a problem statement, context, rationale, and a proposed solution. Additionally, Kiwi provides downloadable and customizable GUI examples, layout blueprints and front-end code for each pattern. Usability evaluation (SUS) of Kiwi with 21 lean UX designers depict good usability and high learnability.},

abstract = {We develop a system which generates summaries from seniors' indoor-activity videos captured by a social robot to help remote family members know their seniors' daily activities at home. Unlike the traditional video summarization datasets, indoor videos captured from a moving robot poses additional challenges, namely, (i) the video sequences are very long (ii) a significant number of videoframes contain no-subject or with subjects at ill-posed locations and scales (iii) most of the well-posed frames contain highly redundant information. To address this problem, we propose to exploit pose estimation for detecting people in frames. This guides the robot to follow the user and capture effective videos. We use person identification to distinguish a target senior from other people. We also make use of action recognition to analyze seniors' major activities at different moments, and develop a video summarization method to select diverse and representative keyframes as summaries.},

However, little study has been performed on how such annotation contributes to video editing and affects user behavior during recording. To elicit fundamental requirements for designing useful record-time annotation techniques, we conducted a study using a set of prototype wearable camera system and a video editing interface that enables users to annotate scenes during recording. We asked participants to perform video recording and editing tasks with two different interface settings. We observed that the participants edited videos more efficiently with detailed annotation techniques, whereas focussing on annotating scenes affected their record-time behavior. We conclude the paper with the design guidelines developed from the findings.},

However, there is currently little research that investigates the effect of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) metrics, such as word error rate, on human performance and usability of speech recognition correction interfaces for mobile devices.

abstract = {Seniors are increasingly using the Internet. However, their adoption of available services such as social media is often restricted by their limited experience with new technologies. At the same time, there is significant interest in designing communication applications, especially mobile, that improve seniors' social connectedness. These are mostly implemented as dedicated social networking tools for seniors and their families. A barrier to the full adoption of such tools is the requirement for younger family members to actively manage a platform parallel to the social media tools they already use (e.g., Facebook). We propose PhotoDigest -- a user-centred application that allows seniors to passively engage in their families' social media activities. PhotoDigest automatically harvests families' Facebook photo posts and delivers them to seniors as weekly digests. We conducted a preliminary deployment study and show that PhotoDigest is easily adopted by seniors, does not interfere with younger generations' life routines, and enhances the entire family's social connectedness.},

One known limitation, however, is its reliance on participants being receptive to ESM questionnaires at the sampled moments. At moments when participants cannot notice or respond to an ESM questionnaire, researchers cannot obtain a response. In this research, we explored the feasibility of inviting peers to provide information about participants in an ESM study. Results from a two-week experiment with a total of 27 participants and 82 peers showed that including peers' ESM responses increased ESM data quantity. Furthermore, the agreement between the peers' and the participants' responses could be maintained by asking peers' confidence. Even considering only data with high confidence could increase data quantity. Moreover, inviting peers had a positive impact on the participant's compliance to respond. These results suggest that using peer-ESM to obtain more in-situ data about participants is promising.},

Research effort has been devoted to advancing our understanding of users' interaction with conversational agents, including conversation breakdowns. However, most research attempts were limited to obversions from a relatively short duration of user interaction with chatbots, where users were aware of being studied. In this study, we conducted a conversation analysis on a three-month conversation log of users conversing with a chatbot of a banking institution. The log consisted of 1,837 users' conversations with this chatbot with 19,449 message exchanges. From this analysis, we show that users more often failed to make a progress in a conversation when they requested information than when they provided information. Furthermore, we uncovered five kinds of intention gaps unexpected to the chatbot, and five major behaviors users adopted to cope with non-progress.},

This study presents a framework for multimodal wayfinding communication via smartwatch. The framework consists of four modalities: audio, voice, tactile and visual. Audio and voice messages are transmitted using a bone conduction headphone, keeping the ears free to focus on the environment. With a smartwatch vibrations are directed to a sensitive part of the body (i.e., the wrist), making it easier to sense the vibrations.

abstract = {As Voice User Interfaces gain popularity and appear in many devices in the commercial market (such as Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Siri, etc), designers must address the new usability challenges that come with using voice as a primary form of interaction. There is currently a lack of tools and resources that guide both current and new usability experts in building usable VUIs. My research seeks to identify and fill the gaps in VUI design resources in HCI. To date, I have conducted a series of meta-analyses and studies with both VUI and non-VUI usability experts that explore the gaps in design knowledge for Voice User Interfaces. I describe this currently completed research and how it guides my primary research goal of developing tools and resources to aid usability experts and designers in filling these design knowledge gaps.},

abstract = {When it comes to how we define success metrics for our products, teams often leave out the user. Daily active users, conversion rates, % uptime, CSAT - these are all important metrics to keep track of from a product and business perspective, but none of these fully capture the user's perspective. They don't give insight into what users care about and what they're trying to achieve. With qualitative research, we gain a deep understanding of what matters to users, but these insights are often quickly forgotten by product teams. In this workshop, we'll introduce Critical User Journeys (CUJs: important tasks your user needs to be able to complete) and Experience Outcomes (XOs: your user's fundamental emotional needs) as tools that will enable product teams to prioritize based on what matters to users.},

abstract = {Demands of the fast paced tech industry can leave little time for rigorous UX research. Some teams may not even have dedicated UX researchers or access to users. This workshop will focus on teaching various research methods to apply in 24 hours or less, at any phase of the product life cycle. We will demonstrate how to apply four methods: heuristic evaluations, cafe studies, surveys and remote user testing. These methods have been successfully used to provide immediately actionable results for our teams.},

abstract = {Mobile applications have a great potential in making everyday environments more accessible from the cognitive point of view, allowing neurodiverse people, such as individuals with autism, dementia, or ADHD, to gain independency and find continuous support. This workshop will discuss the main technological, methodological, theoretical and design issues that researchers and practitioners are facing when designing mobile devices and services for neurodiversity, exploring novel strategies to address them. In doing so, we want to focus on the neurodiverse people's idiosyncratic needs, also exploring ways for directly involving them in the design process.},

Parents are concerned with technology addiction for their children but generally feel loss of control in the ubiquity of mobile devices. We believe mobile design community can contribute meaningful ideas in this space. The goal of this workshop is for participants to co-develop a shared vocabulary and framework for "designing bounded and nuanced technology" as a strategy to be deployed in conceiving and implementing mobile technologies for family use.},

abstract = {This paper is designed to guide user-centered design professionals in running negotiations of usability cost justification with product owners. The paper introduces hacks that can be used by usability professionals to convince entrepreneurs or other decision makers to invest in usability improvements. The traditional cost-justifying usability approach focuses on emphasizing the potential profits that can be expected. This "goal-setting" approach, commonly represents a strong influence on the investment decision of young, nascent entrepreneurs. The new approach, which we are suggesting, is about avoiding losses and costs stemming from not taking any action. This is a "fear-setting" approach, which tends to influence the investment decisions of older and more experienced entrepreneurs. Usability professionals can thus identify and classify their audience regarding to age and years of experience in order to choose the most efficient mode of presenting justification of usability cost.},
