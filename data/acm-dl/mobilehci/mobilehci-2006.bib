abstract = {As in many digital telecommunications systems, the received data streams over Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds (DVB-H) may contain bursty transmission errors. The bursty error characteristics affect the end users' perceived audiovisual quality. This study examined the perceived unacceptability of instantaneous but noticeable audio, visual and audiovisual errors. The erroneous streams were generated from four popular television contents by applying three simulated error patterns with different error rates (1.7%, 6.9%, 13.8%) and error burst durations. Instantaneous unacceptability of errors was evaluated by 30 participants with simplified continuous assessment while watching the program content. The results show that with the two lowest error rates the audio errors were more unacceptable than video errors and with the highest error rate the visual and audiovisual errors become the most unacceptable.},

abstract = {Expert evaluation is a widely used method for evaluating the usability of software products. When evaluating games, traditional usability heuristics lack comprehension and cannot be directly applied. In this paper, we introduce playability heuristics that are specifically designed for evaluating mobile games. Heuristics form a core model that can be used in any mobile game evaluation. The model consists of three modules: Game Usability, Mobility, and Gameplay. The mobile context has some unique characteristics, which require special attention during the evaluation. These characteristics are described in mobility heuristics. Mobile devices also set some of their own requirements for general usability and these issues are described along with game usability heuristics. These heuristics have been developed by using an iterative design process of a mobile game. In addition, we have validated the heuristics and evaluated five mobile games by using them with the expert evaluation method. The results indicate that playability problems, which violate game usability or mobility heuristics, are quite easy to identify. Gameplay problems are harder to find, but gameplay heuristics help in evaluation and focus on different aspects of the gameplay.},

abstract = {This study examines the impact of the display type (form) and content (game) to the PC-game adaptation. An ordinary tabletop display (cathode ray tube; CRT) and a near-eye display (NED) suitable for mobile gaming are compared in two different driving games. A measurement model based on a large dataset (n=2182) is applied to study psychological aspects of the game adaptation. This model integrates two constructs considered important for the game adaptation: involvement and presence. The results show that the content affected the subjective sense of presence. However, the form did not have an effect on the presence. These results indicate that NED's are capable of supporting similar adaptation to the game worlds as compared to CRT's. However, the results also weakly indicate that playing with a CRT increases the evaluations of interaction. The study shows the advantages of using multidimensional measures in studying a rich human-computer interaction.},

abstract = {Sports and fitness are increasingly attracting the interest of computer science researchers as well as companies. In particular, recent mobile devices with hardware graphics acceleration offer new, still unexplored possibilities. This paper investigates the use of mobile guides in fitness activities, proposing the Mobile Personal Trainer (MOPET) application. MOPET uses a GPS device to monitor user's position during her physical activity in an outdoor fitness trail. It provides navigation assistance by using a fitness trail map and giving speech directions. Moreover, MOPET provides motivation support and exercise demonstrations by using an embodied virtual trainer, called Evita. Evita shows how to correctly perform the exercises along the trail with 3D animations and incites the user. To the best of our knowledge, our project is the first to employ a mobile guide for fitness activities. The effects of MOPET on motivation, as well as its navigational and training support, have been experimentally evaluated with 12 users. Evaluation results encourage the use of mobile guides and embodied virtual trainers in outdoor fitness applications.},

abstract = {As wireless communications systems become more ubiquitous, enterprise workers are becoming more and more mobile. Addressing mobility in the enterprise has recently become a pressing concern for many corporations. In particular, there is a growing component of mobile workers whose job tasks require them to be mobile within their local workspace. These workers sometimes do not have a desk or phone and frequently use their hands in performing required tasks; they typically referred to as "corridor cruisers" or "campus roamers". One class of workers that fall under this category is healthcare professionals (e.g. nurses). Communication enabling these workers usually involves an expensive proposition: equipping them with a mobile/wireless phone, PDA or a paging device. Our goal was to see if we could address the communications needs of healthcare workers by using a small, inexpensive, wearable, hands-free audio device (a wireless headset) along with a speech interface to an intelligent agent. In this paper we present the results of an industrial user study in a real world healthcare environment of our Mobile Access to Converged Communications System (MACCS) which empowers mobile workers with a hands-free voice interface to manage their communications. In addition we also discuss the design, implementation and deployment of MACCS.},

abstract = {The paradigm of "access, anytime, anywhere" has been critiqued within the mobile HCI literature as a broad assumption that simplifies understandings of actual work practice, and as an example of rhetoric that allows researchers to ignore the temporal aspects of mobility. The key aspect of technology use that remains unclear, however, when discussing this paradigm is the complexity of the concept "anytime, anywhere" from the perspective of the user. This paper addresses this gap by discussing findings from an empirical study of freelance workers, across both work and social contexts, in which availability emerged as an important concern for participants. This paper explores the ways in which freelancers use their mobile devices to manage their availability to others. Finally, we also consider implications for the ways in which mobility is conceptualised within the mobile HCI literature.},

They found the location information as the most relevant mobile presence attribute, due to a fact that it gave good overview on the status of the other users. We focus on analyzing how the participants named locations and how they used location information in the context of mobile presence. The participants utilized shared meanings of locations in naming and storing them to the PePe system.

In order to make distributed display resources available to nomadic users, a key issue to address is how control can be dynamically shared between display users. It is important to study how control over a shared display can be acquired, released or shared by nomadic and residential users given their competing demands for display resources.In this paper, we present a system and a user study investigating these issues in the context of two applications both competing for display resources provided by a deployment of interactive office doorplates. The first application (Hermes II) provides situated note leaving and messaging services whereas the second one (GAUDI) supports user navigating a university department. Office occupants (i.,e. residential users) can control whether the navigation application may (temporarily) use their doorplate display (thus giving priority to the navigation needs of nomadic users to the department). We report on findings from a user study, and discuss interface design implications for specifying display control.},

abstract = {In spring of 2003, a mobile field trial of a concept prototype application titled Scent was conducted in a corporate environment, attracting more than 500 voluntary users. Scent was a social proximity application enabling scanning of one's immediate environment for other Scent users and initiating social exchanges with them. The design of Scent prototype application aimed at incorporating various facets of face-to-face social interaction. This gave trial users multiple options of using the application in any given social context during the unguided trial period. Both qualitative and quantitative data was collected and analyzed, which helped shaping up the foundation to further the research in understanding mediated social proximity interaction. The study revealed not only motivations of use, but also barriers of adoptions, which in turn had implications on evolutionary steps of the development and on the prospect of market entry. Identity expression was seen as the most rudimentary motivation in mediated social proximity interaction. The final section of the paper discusses how the research team utilized the field trial in the spearhead research project in an emerging arena of social interaction.},

Whilst there has been a lot of studies of text and map based guiding applications for mobile devices, in this paper we want to propose and give an initial exploratory study of a guiding system that utilises photographs. These photographs are not explicitly taken with the intention of using them subsequently for giving route directions; rather they are extracted from existing geo-tagged photo collections from mobile phones. A user of our system sees a route description as text and a map that refers to a series of photographs. The main contribution of this paper is in demonstrating this concept and testing it in an exploratory between-subjects experiment. The experiment shows that presenting the right photographs certainly can help with particular types of routing instruction for users not familiar with an area. For example, in unusual situation where the user has to walk through a specific gate or path, photographs provide information and reassurance about the navigation decision.},

The system propagates uncertainty appropriately via Monte Carlo sampling and predicts at a user-controllable time horizon. Control of the Monte Carlo exploration is entirely tilt-based. The system output is displayed both visually and in audio. Audio is rendered via granular synthesis to accurately display the probability of the user reaching targets in the space. We also demonstrate the use of uncertain prediction in a trajectory following task, where a section of music is modulated according to the changing predictions of user position with respect to the target trajectory. We show that appropriate display of the full distribution of potential future users positions with respect to sites-of-interest can improve the quality of interaction over a simplistic interpretation of the sensed data.},

abstract = {Portable handheld devices inherently involve difficulties with methods of input due to their compact size. Several approaches to attach extra sensors have been proposed, but these have not enabled size or exterior design to be minimized. We propose a novel and simple input technique for handheld devices that makes use of a stylus in a holder that is twisted and pushed/pulled like a knob. Both rotating and sliding the stylus inside the holder can simultaneously adjust two parameters. We implemented a prototype system with an inexpensive image sensor, and evaluated its input. An ANOVA test revealed that our method could scroll as fast as tap-and-drag operations on a screen.},

abstract = {The development and the evaluation of multimodal interactive systems on mobile phones remains a difficult task. In this paper we address this problem by describing a component-based approach, called ACICARE, for developing and evaluating multimodal interfaces on mobile phones. ACICARE is dedicated to the overall iterative design process of mobile multimodal interfaces, which consists of cycles of designing, prototyping and evaluation. ACICARE is based on two complementary tools that are combined: ICARE and ACIDU. ICARE is a component-based platform for rapidly developing multimodal interfaces. We adapted the ICARE components to run on mobile phones and we connected them to ACIDU, a probe that gathers customer's usage on mobile phones. By reusing and assembling components, ACICARE enables the rapid development of multimodal interfaces as well as the automatic capture of multimodal usage for in-field evaluations. We illustrate ACICARE using our contact manager system, a multimodal system running on the SPV c500 mobile phone.},

Our algorithm has two main functions; one is to extract feature vectors by analyzing sensor data in detail using wavelet packet decomposition. The other is to flexibly cluster personal gaits by combining a self-organizing algorithm with Bayesian theory. Not only does the three-axis accelerometer realize low cost personal devices, but we can track aging or situation changes through on-line learning. A prototype that implements the algorithm is constructed. Experiments on the prototype show that the algorithm can identify gaits such as walking, running, going up/down stairs, and walking fast with an accuracy of about 80%.},

In this paper an experiment is presented that investigates the usability of 4 different information hierarchies (46, 84, 163 and 642) on three mobile devices. It turns out that the narrow hierarchies (46 and 84) perform better than the broader hierarchies on the three devices. The experiment was repeated on two more occasions with the same participants to test expertise effects; the preference for narrow hierarchies did not change over the three occasions.},

abstract = {Mobile devices such as cellular phones are indispensable in our daily life. The success and penetration of the market of mobile services and applications does not only depend on good, innovative ideas, but also on their usability.Therefore several endeavors have been made to tackle these problems in order to provide suitable usability testing methods for user interfaces. But traditional testing methods cannot always be extended to mobile devices directly. In contrast to the widely standardized and static testing setup for Desktop PCs, the variety of physical device-specific characteristics as well as the highly dynamic context of use [5]. influences these methods.In this paper, we propose a novel approach for prototyping and testing mobile applications and services. It enables testing user interfaces and recording the interaction within context-of-use in early stages of the product development and therefore allows determining conceptional or design flaws before they can cause cost-intensive corrections or even refactoring of the product.Besides its direct applicability this approach allows us to elaborate if and how classical usability testing methods can be transferred to mobile devices and how they are influenced by the device-specific characteristics.},

abstract = {This paper describes a two-phase study conducted to determine optimal target sizes for one-handed thumb use of mobile handheld devices equipped with a touch-sensitive screen. Similar studies have provided recommendations for target sizes when using a mobile device with two hands plus a stylus, and interacting with a desktop-sized display with an index finger, but never for thumbs when holding a small device in a single hand. The first phase explored the required target size for single-target (discrete) pointing tasks, such as activating buttons, radio buttons or checkboxes. The second phase investigated optimal sizes for widgets used for tasks that involve a sequence of taps (serial), such as text entry. Since holding a device in one hand constrains thumb movement, we varied target positions to determine if performance depended on screen location. The results showed that while speed generally improved as targets grew, there were no significant differences in error rate between target sizes =9.6 mm in discrete tasks and targets =7.7 mm in serial tasks. Along with subjective ratings and the findings on hit response variability, we found that target size of 9.2 mm for discrete tasks and targets of 9.6 mm for serial tasks should be sufficiently large for one-handed thumb use on touchscreen-based handhelds without degrading performance and preference.},

abstract = {Mobile devices are generally used in public, where the user is surrounded by others not involved in the interaction. Audible notification cues are often a cause of unnecessary disruption and distraction both for co-located people and even for the user to whom they are directed. We present a wearable peripheral display embedded in eyeglasses that delivers subtle, discreet and unobtrusive cues. The display is personal and intimate; it delivers visual cues in the wearers' periphery without disrupting their immediate environment. A user study conducted to validate the design reveals that the display is effective and subtle in notifying users. Experimental results show, with significance, that the cues can be designed to meet specific levels of visibility and disruption for the wearer, so that some cues are less noticeable when the user is not under high workload, which is highly desirable in many practical circumstances. Hence, peripheral notification displays can provide an effective solution for designing socially acceptable notification displays, unobtrusive to the user and the immediate environment.},

Participants completed reading comprehension trials while walking a path and sitting. We examine overall performance and perceived workload for four conditions: audio-walking, audio-sitting, visual-walking, and visual-sitting. Results suggest audio is an acceptable modality for mobile comprehension of text. Participants' comprehension scores for the audio-walking condition were comparable to the scores for the visual-walking condition. More importantly, participants saw improvements in their ability to navigate the environment when using the audio display.},

In the first experiment the participants played the Need for Speed car racing game with an ordinary 17" display and in the second and third experiments they used a head-worn virtual display for the game playing. The difference between experiments 2 and 3 was in the use of stereoscopy, as in the third experiment the car racing game was seen in stereoscopic three-dimensions. Our results indicated that there were no significant differences in sickness symptoms when we compared the ordinary display and the virtual display in non-stereoscopic mode. In stereoscopic condition the eye strain and disorientation symptoms were significantly elevated compared to the ordinary display. We conclude that using a virtual display as an accessory in a mobile device is a viable alternative, because the non-stereoscopic virtual display did not produce significantly more sickness symptoms compared to ordinary game playing.},

abstract = {Tactons are structured vibrotactile messages which can be used for non-visual information presentation when visual displays are limited, unavailable or inappropriate, such as in mobile phones and other mobile devices. Little is yet known about how to design them effectively. Previous studies have investigated the perception of Tactons which encode two dimensions of information using two different vibrotactile parameters (rhythm and roughness) and found recognition rates of around 70. When more dimensions of information are required it may be necessary to extend the parameter-space of these Tactons. Therefore this study investigates recognition rates for Tactons which encode a third dimension of information using spatial location. The results show that identification rate for three-parameter Tactons is just 48, but that this can be increased to 81 by reducing the number of values of one of the parameters. These results will aid designers to select suitable Tactons for use when designing mobile displays.},

abstract = {Browsing large information spaces such as maps on the limited screen of mobile devices often requires people to perform panning and zooming operations that move relevant display content off-screen. This makes it difficult to perform spatial tasks such as finding the location of Points Of Interest (POIs) in a city. Visualizing the location of off-screen objects can mitigate this problem: in this paper, we present a user study comparing the Halo [2] approach with two other techniques based on arrows. Halo surrounds off-screen objects with circles that reach the display window, so that users can derive the location and distance of objects by observing the visible portion of the corresponding circles. In the two arrow-based techniques, arrows point at objects and their size and body length, respectively, inform about the distance of objects. Our study involved four tasks requiring users to identify and compare off-screen objects locations, and also investigated the effectiveness of the three techniques with respect to the number of off-screen objects. Arrows allowed users to order off-screen objects faster and more accurately according to their distance, while Halo allowed users to better identify the correct location of off-screen objects. Implications of these results for mobile map-based applications are also discussed.},

abstract = {Context-aware mobile applications and systems have been extensively explored in the last decade and in the last few years we already saw promising products on the market. Most of these applications assume that context data is highly accurate. But in practice this information is often unreliable, especially when gathered from sensors or external sources. Previous research has argued that the system usability can be improved by displaying the uncertainty to the user. The research presented in this paper shows that it is not always an advantage to show the confidence of the context-aware application to the user. We developed a system for automatic form filling on mobile devices which fills in any web form with user data stored on the mobile device. The used algorithm generates rules which indicate with which probability which input field of a form should be filled in with which value. Based on this we developed two versions of our system. One shows the uncertainty of the system and one not. We then conducted a user study which shows that the user needs slightly more time and produces slightly more errors when the confidence of the system is visualized.},

In these kinds of multimodal dialogue systems the possibility to disambiguate between several input and also output modalities can substantially increase intelligibility of dialogues and robustness of interaction. The combination of natural speech and tactile gestures as input mediums, especially in map-based systems, have shown promising results, although mature commercial applications are still to be developed. In this paper we present the MUMS Multimodal Route Navigation System, which allows users of a mobile device to present public transportation route queries with any preferred combination of speech and pen input, with the system providing navigational information via speech and graphical map representations. We also present the results of a user study, with focus on the users' subjective experience of the MUMS system and especially its multimodal qualities.},

The subjects rated the techniques on four scales: position knowledge support, direction knowledge support, identification of real-world objects based on map objects and an overall score. The results showed that conditions involving automatic rotation and/or zooming got systematically more positive ratings on all scales than the conditions without those features. The implementation of automatic zooming created for this experiment was rated as very close to optimal. These results suggest that both automatic rotation and automatic zooming can enhance navigation when implemented to a mobile roadmap.},

Finally, we argue that the proposed taxonomy can be used for the classification of different evaluation questions so as to constitute a comprehensive and adjustable guide for evaluation purposes of applications for different and heterogeneous museum environments.},

abstract = {The recent trend towards pervasive computing and information technology becoming omnipresent and entering all aspects of modern living, means that we are moving away from the traditional interaction paradigm between human and technology being that of the desktop computer. This shift towards ubiquitous computing is perhaps most evident in the increased sophistication and extended utility of mobile devices, such as mobile phones, PDAs, mobile communicators (telephone/PDA) and Tablet PCs. Advances in these mobile device technologies coupled with their much-improved functionality means that current mobile devices can be considered as multi-purpose information access tools capable of complex tasks. This Third Workshop on Mobile and Ubiquitous Information Access (MUIA 2006) aims to be a forum for the presentation of current research and exchange of experiences into technological and usability aspects of mobile information access.},
