abstract = {This research examines the use of formal computational models to design intelligent device interfaces able to predict the function or application a user will use and automatically invoke this function. Computational models considered are Markov Chains, Markov Decision Process, Hidden Markov Model, Fuzzy Logic, and Bayesian Networks. Descriptive statistics obtained examine patterns of use on a mobile device. Usage profiles are modeled using the various computational models and verified with historical nonlearning data. This computational model framework is then deployed in field/laboratory trials where predictions are made on what the next user operation will be. Probabilistic predictions made by Markov Chains and Markov Decision Process are compared with context classification predictions made by Hidden Markov Model, Fuzzy Logic and Bayesian Networks. During the field/laboratory trials, each instance of use is a learning trial and the probabilities are recalculated for the models. In the next experimental phase, model predictions result in the automated delivery of certain functions or user operations. The benefits of automation are assessed in terms of task performance data (ease, accuracy, and speed of task completion) and user perceived usability using a questionnaire. The costs off automation are also assessed in terms of the costs of choosing a different operation and reversing the automated operation. In the last experimental phase, the ability to "undo" an automated operation is given and delivery of the next most highly probably operation is given as well as the capacity to "undo" each time or to come out of the automated prompting altogether. The benefits of this type of automation are assessed in terms of user performance and perceived usability. Future directions for research discuss how formal models can be used to design intelligent, highly-automated device interfaces and how best to design the automation to work in the users best interests.},

abstract = {There has been a rapid growth in navigation aids recently. However, no meaningful personalization exists in these devices. Theories and pilot studies show the importance of individual differences in designing pedestrian navigation assistants. I take a Requirements Engineering (RE) perspective to approach the personalization problem. Different from viewing users as a general consumer group, I propose a "deep personalization" method that pays attention to knowledge of an individual user's skills and limitations. In some cases, these skills and limitations might not be self- aware, i.e., a user cannot accurately self- reflect on his or her skills and weaknesses. In this paper, I will demonstrate the notion of deep personalization in the domain of personal navigation systems. I find this an interesting domain for several reasons: (1) There is a domain theory of navigation skills that draws from both Cartography and Psychology. (2) There are individual differences in navigation skills. (3) An individual user may not be self- aware of his or her skills. (4) If a system is delivered that does not match the skills of the user, it may be less than effective, and at worst, abandoned.},

Using the SocioXensor research tool on people's own mobile phones, we conducted an experience sampling study to explore which context information predicts a person's availability for a phone call, and which context information people wanted to disclose to particular social relations. Like other studies, we found that a small set of context information can help initiators of phone calls to improve their ability to know when recipients are receptive to phone calls. We also found that if we restrict the information to information recipients actually want to disclose, which is only a small subset of all information, enough context information is still available for initiators of phone calls to improve their ability to know when recipients are receptive to phone calls.},

In order to assess the expedience and feasibility of such a display, a series of user tests have been conducted with respect to both, the ability for thermal change recognition and a concrete application scenario for such a display.},

abstract = {We developed a novel wearable tactile display system as an alternative to the visual and audio displays routinely used by anesthesiologists to monitor patients in the operating room (OR). Visual displays and auditory alarms can be distracting or insufficient in their alarm transmission whereas a tactile display, which utilizes the sense of touch, can act as an effective conduit for alert delivery. A sophisticated alarm scheme is essential to convey the complex array of physiological information available in current monitoring systems; therefore, to report all relevant alerts to the attending anesthesiologist, it is essential that an augmenting or replacement display system be at least as effective and efficacious as conventional systems. Using multidimensional Tactons, we designed a tactile alert scheme consisting of 36 unique stimuli and evaluated the accuracy and response time in stimuli recognition using a tactile prototype worn as a belt. We observed an overall accuracy of 81% and a response time of 4.8 seconds. 4.18 bits (18.07 tokens) of messages were successfully communicated without loss of information. These results demonstrate that the novel tactile display represents an effective and potentially work-load-reducing method to convey vital information non-visually and non-aurally.},

abstract = {This paper presents a photo browsing system on mobile devices to browse and search photos efficiently by tilting action. It employs tilt dynamics and a multi-scale photo screen layout for enhancing the browsing and the search capability respectively. The implementation uses continuous inputs from an accelerometer, and a multimodal (visual, audio and vibrotactile) display coupled with the states of this model. The model is based on a simple physical model, with its characteristics shaped to enhance controllability. The multi-scale layout holds both local and global view for users to both control photos and look at the surrounding context in a single framework. The experiment on Samsung MITs PDA used seven novice users browsing from 100 photos. We compare a tilt-based interaction method with a button-based browser and an iPod wheel by a quantitative usability criteria and subjective experience. The proposed tilt dynamics improves the usability over conventional dynamics. The iPod wheel has mixed performance comparing worse on some metrics than button pushing or tilt interaction, despite its commercial popularity.},

We investigate gait synchronization, measured by accelerometers while users converse via mobile phones. Hilbert transforms are used to infer gait phase angle, and techniques from synchronization theory are used to infer level of alignment. Experimental conditions include the use of vibrotactile feedback to make one conversation partner aware of the other's footsteps. Three modes of interaction are tested: reading a script, discussing a shared image and spontaneous conversation. The vibrotactile feedback loop on its own is sufficient to create synchronization, but there are complex interference effects when users converse spontaneously. Even without vibration crosstalk, synchronisation appeared for long periods in the spontaneous speech condition, indicating that users were aligning their walking behaviour from audible cues alone.},

More importantly, our study confirms that the integration of personal communication and Web based information services increases the perceived value of mobile applications. Besides the optimized user interface on the device itself, it is the seamless integration with the user's environment that increases the utility of mobile devices and services. We thus propose design recommendations for Web augmented mobile applications and promote a design optimization approach that encompasses flexible integration with Web-based services.},

However, the success of the services in fulfilling these goals depends on several factors from the usability of the service to its success in supporting the business processes of the companies. This paper reviews existing measures for the usability of services and measures for evaluating the effects of mobile business services on the productivity of the company. We discuss the usefulness of the existing measures in the mobile business context, where both mobility and work-context pose specific demands for the services. The review showed that existing measures rarely consider the great contextual variation caused by mobility of the services and the demands this poses on usability; which, in turn, affects productivity. To build a measurement tool that better meets the requirements of mobile business services, we completed case studies on two mobile business services, one used in passenger transport and the other in construction sites. Based on the understanding gained from the case studies, we propose a list of themes addressing both usability and productivity measures that work as the basis for a multidisciplinary measurement tool, MoBiS-Q.},

We present a model of social context, along with its implementation in a prototype based on Semantic Web ontologies. The empirical evaluation, based on experience sampling, with participants during a field trial shows that communicated content, relationship types, and mood have an impact on the usage of mobile devices.

We conducted three user studies in order to understand HBI and discover the problems in existing mobile phone designs. The studies include a large-scale international survey, a one-month field data collection including quantitative battery logging and qualitative inquiries from ten mobile phone users, and structured interviews with twenty additional mobile phone users. We evaluated various aspects of HBI, including charging behavior, battery indicators, user interfaces for power-saving settings, user knowledge, and user reaction. We find that mobile phone users can be categorized into two types regarding HBI and often have inadequate knowledge regarding phone power characteristics. We provide qualitative and quantitative evidence that problems in state-of-the-art user interfaces has led to under-utilized power-saving settings, under-utilized battery energy, and dissatisfied users. Our findings provide insights into improving mobile phone design for users to effectively deal with the limited battery lifetime. Our work is the first to systematically address HBI on mobile phones and is complementary to the extensive research on energy-efficient design for a longer battery lifetime.},

abstract = {A field study has been conducted to investigate the naturalistic use of cell phone applications in driving, home, work, and school and during daytime and nighttime. GPS coordinates are used to determine whether cell phone users are driving. The frequency and duration of use of various cell phone applications such as incoming or outgoing voice calls, music player, calendar, SMS, camera, and the Internet are analyzed separately for driving and non-driving. The present results provide fundamental data for adequately assessing the distraction potential of mobile devices and guiding the design of context-based assistance systems.},

abstract = {The paper reports a mobile application that allows users to share photos with other co-present users by synchronizing the display on multiple mobile devices. Various floor control policies (software locks that determine when someone can control the displays) were implemented. The behaviour of groups of users was studied to determine how people would use this application for sharing photos and how various floor control policies affect this behaviour. Explicit policies was shown to be the best strategy for structured presentations, but when all locks were removed, the users created a new form of social interaction which seemed to be a more compelling use of the technology than the original, intended, application.},

abstract = {We discuss the design of speech-based interaction systems from the perspective of affordance. It is our claim that many of the problems associated with speech interaction stems from a lack of a deeper understanding of the communicative nature of speech in combination with graphical interfaces. Today's graphical interfaces are almost universally based on the Direct Manipulation (DM) interaction paradigm, whereas speech interaction is in nature conversational. However, most multi modal systems accepting spoken input are designed with the DM paradigm as the underlying interaction model, often forcing the spoken input to correspond to simple commands, which are replicated in the GUI anyway. We will discuss how speech-based interfaces can be designed, taking into account that the DM paradigm is not supported by speech. We demonstrate this through the design of a concrete application for a portable device (PDA), and show how an underlying architecture can be built to support both spoken input and DM interfaces.},

abstract = {Episodic memory exercises such as reminiscing and storytelling have been shown to provide therapeutic benefits for older adults by prolonging their ability to lead an independent lifestyle. In this paper, we describe a mobile reminiscence tool called Memory Karaoke, which facilitates episodic memory exercise through contextualized storytelling of meaningful experiences by using contextual cues such as location, time, and photos. We present results from two studies we conducted with Memory Karaoke to explore which contextual cues contribute to best exercising a person's episodic memory. Our findings suggest that while viewing photos do exercise episodic memory to some extent, additional contextual cues (e.g. location and time) can solicit a greater amount of episodic memory exercise. This suggests that Memory Karaoke's selective capture process and its ability to contextualize memories while users retell stories are two effective features which help it to support episodic memory use. These results, together with positive qualitative feedback, provide promising evidence for Memory Karaoke as a viable mobile alternative for helping older adults to exercise their episodic memory and, in turn, assist them in successfully "aging in place".},

abstract = {In this paper, we explore the use of an interaction technique called sequential segmentation to support target selection for mobile devices. Sequential segmentation iteratively partitions an information space into selectable regions and subsequent sub-regions where each region/sub-region is labeled (1--9) and is mapped to the corresponding key on the mobile device's numeric keypad. We conducted a study comparing the sequential technique to the directional pad for target selection. The results show that the directional pad is significantly faster than sequential for selecting targets that require three or less interactions with the directional pad. However, sequential is significantly faster than the directional pad for targets that require five or more interactions with the directional pad. User feedback shows a preference for sequential and that it is perceived easier to use than the directional pad.},

abstract = {Tourism has been a key driver for mobile applications. This short paper presents the design and initial evaluation of a mobile phone based visualisation to support skiers. Paper piste maps often prove difficult for skiers and provide no natural way of assessing the mountain conditions while on the slope. They are physically large and difficult to manipulate in wind, they provide no information on which runs are currently open, no indication of which runs the user may find most enjoyable, and no information about the snow and weather conditions on each run. All this information is available at resorts, usually on notice boards or screens at central meeting points. The visualisation and personalisation approaches presented here combine this information and a map overview on a mobile phone screen. Initial trials showed significantly better performance for some tasks on the mobile condition (both in terms of accuracy and time), with no clear result for other tasks.},

Different preferences were found for each cultural group regarding function/theme-related menus. In addition, individual categorization styles were found to be correlated to individual preferences. Overall, the findings indicated that performance and preferences in a certain menu structure are associated with cognitive styles, which may eventually help design culturally adapted interfaces.

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a shared auditory landmark display which conveys spatial survey knowledge and navigational aid to multiple users. Our guide is situated in a zoo environment, so we use recordings of animal voices to indicate the location of the animal enclosures. Spatial audio manipulates the volume and stereo balance of the sound clips, so that the listener can identify their distance and direction. The system also proactively presents audio clips with detailed information about each animal. To avoid the typical effect of social isolation through audio guides, we use shared audio so that the same sounds will be presented to each user at the same time. We have conducted an initial user study of paired visitors in the zoo to evaluate the usability of the system with positive results. The participants reported that the system is easy to use and has a stimulating influence on the communication between the visitors. As a further result, the study indicates that 'lightweight' navigational aid can be sufficient for wayfinding tasks in certain environments, which provides only the linear distance and direction of the destination.},

Handheld devices can easily be moved in space and used as a movable window into a large virtual workspace. We investigate different information navigation methods for small-scale handheld displays using a range of sensor technologies for spatial tracking. We compare user performance in an map navigation task and discuss the tradeoffs of the different sensor and visualization techniques.},

This paper presents Mobile Findex; a mobile search user interface that uses automatically computed categories to present the user with an overview of the result set. In addition, it utilizes a focus+context result list presentation combined with an intuitive browsing method to aid the user in the evaluation of results. A user study with 16 participants was carried out to evaluate Mobile Findex. Subjective evaluations show that Mobile Findex was clearly preferred by the participants over the traditional ranked result list in terms of ease of finding relevant results, suitability to tasks and perceived efficiency. While the use of categories resulted in a lower rate of non-relevant result selections, an overall significant difference in search performance was not observed.},

On average, it takes a mobile user approximately 60 seconds to enter a query from a 9-key keypad [1]. In this paper, we explore the use of contextual signals to facilitate query entry on mobile phones. We present a query prediction system which offers automatically generated word completions as the user is typing her query. The query prediction system redefines the prediction dictionary after considering contextual signals such as the application being used (e.g. search vs. general text messaging), the inferred location of the user, the time of day and day of week. We demonstrate a 46.4% improvement in query entry, measured by number of key presses needed to enter queries. We found that the two contextual signals that make the largest impact are knowledge of the application being used and the location of the user.},

Image-based information retrieval goes beyond only matching images, as information in other modalities also can be extracted from data collections using image search. We have developed a new system that uses images to search for web-based information. This paper has a particular focus towards exploring user's experience of general mobile image-based Web searches to find what issues and phenomena it contains. This was achieved in a multi-part study by creating and letting respondents test prototypes of mobile image-based search systems and collecting data using interviews, observations, video-observations, and questionnaires. We observed that searching for information only based on visual similarity and without any assistance is sometimes difficult, especially on mobile devices with limited interaction bandwidth. Most of our subjects preferred a search tool that guides the users through the search result based on contextual information, compared to presenting the search result as a plain ranked list.},

abstract = {Recently, flash memory(in particular, NAND) is being rapidly deployed as data storage for mobile platforms such as PDAs, MP3 players, mobile phones and digital cameras, mainly because of its many advantages over its competitor, hard disk, including its low electronic power, non-volatile storage, high performance, physical stability, smaller size, light weight, and portability. Considering its rapid technical improvement both in capacity and speed, it will have a competitive advantage over its rivalry minidrive (i.e. a small size hard disk) under 100 Gbytes within a few years, As the applications in next generation mobile platforms become large, complex, and more data-oriented, they requires the database technology, because the file interface is too complex to manage their complicated data requirements. However, flash memory, compared to hard disk, has a few unique characteristics, and thus the traditional disk-based database technology does not seem to go well with flash memory. Therefore, we need to revisit almost every aspect of DBMS implementation techniques from the perspectives of flash memory. In this paper, we introduce the technical characteristics of flash memory, which we think might have huge impact on database performance to database community that are 1) no-overwrite (erase-before-write paradigm), 2) asymmetric read and write speed, and 3) no seek or rotation time. These small differences necessitate us to revisit all the major DBMS modules which have evolved over the several decades. Based on the characteristics, we identify several key issues in implementing major DBMS modules, and suggest alternative approaches to solve the issues. The topics covered in this article are neither comprehensive nor in-depth, but the main goal of this article is just to issue that a practical and urgent research topic is ahead and it poses us many challenges and opportunities.},

In this study, elements that need to be considered when using light in clothes in order to express the thoughts and various emotions of the wearer and surrounding people and to design contextual interaction rather than simply for visual effects, are examined. Clothes and light are central visual elements therefore, the relationship between perception of objects through sight and emotions are examined, elements of visual language of cloths and light are examined through documentary record, elements of visual language such as shape, color, and texture of light and clothes that influence each other are classified as well as unique elements of visual elements of light such as blink speed and blink pattern, and terms that are related to the psychological effects of these elements are extracted. Based on this, using the 8 most representative human emotions which includes happiness, excitement, anger, hatred, sadness, shock, fear, and shame as standards of design, interaction design elements using clothes and light for expression of each emotion are organized in a matrix. Then, scenarios and ideas are generated, and based on the Matrix, interaction concept design in which expression of emotions and information possible using light in apparel are produced.},

abstract = {Short message service (SMS) is extremely popular today. Currently it is being mainly used for peer-to-peer communication. Electronic displays can be seen everywhere and those are mainly used to convey information to the masses rather than provide artistic and social communication. BlogWall extends the SMS to a new level of self expression and public communication by combining art and poetry. Furthermore it will provide a means of expression in the language that young people understand, and the forms of social communication. The user stands in front of a projected screen and sends a SMS to a given number. The system can display users SMS in an animated manner. It also provides users to participate in polls. The most notable feature of the application is its ability to create poetry in multiple languages such as English, Korean, Chinese poems or Japanese "Haiku" all based on the SMS. This is a step into new forms of cultural computing.},

abstract = {Effective text entry on handheld devices remains a significant problem in the field of mobile computing. On a personal digital assistant (PDA), text entry methods traditionally support input through the motion of a stylus held in the user's dominant hand. In this paper, we present the design of a two-handed software keyboard for a PDA which specifically takes advantage of the thumb in the non-dominant hand. We compare our chorded keyboard design to other stylus-based text entry methods in an evaluation that studies user input in both stationary and mobile settings. Our study shows that users type fastest using the miniqwerty keyboard, and most accurately using our two-handed keyboard. We also discovered a difference in input performance with the mini-qwerty keyboard between stationary and mobile settings. As a user walks, text input speed decreases while error rates and mental workload increases; however, these metrics remain relatively stable in our two-handed technique despite user mobility.},

abstract = {Current Myanmar PC keyboards or key mappings are very difficult to learn for novice users, and there is no efficient key mapping for mobile device keypads. In this paper, we introduce a new idea of key mapping (Positional Mapping) for phonetic scripts such as Myanmar language. Positional Mapping is a key mapping idea, based on Myanmar language characters writing positions, for small computing devices such as mobile phones, PDAs and electronic dictionaries etc. Our approach has made key mapping for Myanmar language very simple and easier to memorize. The results of first evaluation show that first time users have no problem with this key mapping and they can type Myanmar text with appropriate typing speed. Positional Mapping can be extended to other phonetic scripts such as Khmer, Thai, Indic and Lao etc.},

abstract = {This paper presents how ad-hoc co-located collaborations can be supported with an arbitrary number of users that only have access to small-size mobile displays. Our approach is based on tracking of these personal displays that share the same information space. All displays involved in the collaboration act as autonomous windows on a set of data items (the information space) positioned on a shared virtual canvas. Data items are identified by their three-dimensional location in physical space and can be manipulated through the displays that serve as windows on the shared canvas. Each display is tracked in physical space and is aware of its own location. Since different mobile displays can access and manipulate the same information space, a distributed locking mechanism makes sure the data stays consistent during simultaneous access of data in this information space.},

Here we present a multi-device environment to support cooperation among museum visitors through games. In particular, we present a design and the associated implementation for using a combination of PDAs and public displays to enhance the learning experience in a museum setting by using game playing interactions. The basic assumption is to use the mobile devices for individual game play, and the situated displays for synchronized public views of shared game play; the individual game play contributes to the shared game.},
