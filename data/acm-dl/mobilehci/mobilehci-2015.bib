abstract = {In this paper we report findings from two user studies that explore the problem of establishing common viewpoint in the context of a wearable telepresence system. In our first study, we assessed the ability of a local person (the guide) to identify the view orientation of the remote person by looking at the physical pose of the telepresence device. In the follow-up study, we explored visual feedback methods for communicating the relative viewpoints of the remote user and the guide via a head-mounted display. Our results show that actively observing the pose of the device is useful for viewpoint estimation. However, in the case of telepresence devices without physical directional affordances, a live video feed may yield comparable results. Lastly, more abstract visualizations lead to significantly longer recognition times, but may be necessary in more complex environments.},

abstract = {Responsive web design is being widely adopted to maintain usability across a diversity of devices and screen sizes in contrast to earlier approaches which focus only on mobile or non-mobile (desktop) devices. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of responsive web design with a specific case study, the California Report Card, an online civic engagement tool. We compare Version 1.0, a mobile-optimized design, with Version 2.0, a responsive web design and consider three hypotheses: (H1) a mobile-optimized web application will receive most of its users from mobile devices, (H2) mobile-optimized design loses engagement from non-mobile users and (H3) responsive design mitigates these losses. Our results support H2 and H3 but not H1. These results support the adoption of responsive web design to maintain access for the significant population of non-mobile (desktop) users.},

The challenges include ensuring adequate involvement of a user group that is not only hard to recruit, but equally complex to engage with in order to ensure ecological validity of the different elements of the user-centred design process. Discussing the design and deployment of an anxiety management app, SAM - Selfhelp for Anxiety Management, we present approaches adopted to address the challenges involved and the impact these had on the final design.

Our prototype enables mobile devices to be components of a tangible interface where each device can serve as both, a touch sensing display and as a tangible item for interaction. The only necessary modification is the attachment of a conductive 2D touch pattern on each device. Compared to existing approaches, our Active Commodity Tangible User Interfaces (ACTUI) can display graphical output directly on their built-in display paving the way to a plethora of innovative applications where the diverse combination of local and global active display area can significantly enhance the exibility and effectiveness of the interaction. We explore two exemplary application scenarios where we demonstrate the potential of ACTUI.},

From another point of view, this system uses an "interaction through video" metaphor. Tani et al. devised a technique to remotely operate machines by manipulating a live video image on a computer screen. Boring et al. applied it to distant large displays and mobile devices.

To prove our technology, we have developed a phone account management application for the mobile and the web channel that is weaved into the MultiRep platform. During the interactivity session, the audience can experiment how our technology handles with different aspects on disrupted user interactions involving multiple devices, i. e., the reexion of user inputs on individual devices along active sessions, resuming the applications state even after a sign out and animating state transitions triggered by user inputs for visualization purposes.},

Additionally, the burden of frequently time-consuming and expensive usability tests for small software development teams are evident. This work proposes the use of a system to implement emotions logging in automated usability tests for mobile phones. We do this by efficiently, easily and cost-effectively assessing the users' affective state by evaluating their expressive reactions during a mobile software usability evaluation process. These reactions are collected using the front camera on mobile devices.},

abstract = {The development of mobile applications that consider accessibility can uniquely make use of software extensions to provide special interfaces to people with impairments. However, such extensions are limited so that the use of external devices is a natural alternative. The current market provides several accessibility devices that can be coupled to mobile devices, extending their interface abilities. However, there is not a work that compares such devices and assists the job of developers in finding an adequate device in accordance with their needs. Considering this scenario, this paper analyzed 60 scientific articles and over 250 relevant sites to identify devices that facilitate the use of applications running on mobile operating systems for impaired people. At the final of the process, 15 products were analyzed and compared against predefined features. Apart the number of existing devices for accessibility, it is possible to conclude that the market is still requiring a higher variety of options and further researches to provide a better level of accessibility for impaired users.},

These notifications may raise awareness, but also have the downside of being disruptive. In this paper we present a laboratory study investigating users' attitudes towards notifications and how they deal with notification settings on their smartphones. Permission requests for sending push notifications on iOS don't inform the user about the nature of notifications of this app, leaving the user to make a rather uninformed choice on whether to accept or deny. We show that requests including explanations are significantly more likely to be accepted. Our results further indicate that apart from being disruptive, notifications may create stress due to information overload. Notification settings, once assigned a preset, are rarely changed, although not necessarily matching the favored one.},

They have maintained their heritage working process since the inception of the service and therefore any kind of technology has not been incorporated in their work. They are currently facing numerous business sustainability challenges such as reaching out to new customers and also in maintaining their existing customer base. In 8--10 years, the number of customers a dabbawala serves a day has reduced from 50 to around 20 now. Through our research we have understood that they will lose their current customer base soon as similar food delivery businesses with faster and better services are emerging. To empower them we introduce Dabbawala --- a mobile application that enables partnership between dabbawalas and food services around the city and directly connects them to their combined customer base. This application enables the customers to order lunch from anywhere in the city. Customer registrations and any kind of money transactions are all handled through the application. The application is also used within the Dabbawala community to manage teams and responsibilities.},

abstract = {Smartphones offer new opportunities to improve the lives of elderly people. Although many elderly people are interested in smartphones, most of them face difficulties in self-instruction and need support. Text entry, which is essential for various applications, is one of the most difficult operations to master. Therefore, we propose a tutoring system for text entry that can perform the role of a human tutor by detecting errors and providing the instructions to resolve the errors. We constructed the tutoring system based on the collected data in a user study. An evaluation with novice elderly people (60+) showed that the tutoring system increased typing speed by 17.2% and reduced error incidence by 59.1% compared with users' initial rate. The improvement rates were almost same as that of human tutors.},

Magnet-based Around Device Interaction (ADI), in allowing 3D gestural signatures around the device, has been shown to be a secure method for user authentication. In this paper, we further verify the usability and security of this method against video-based shoulder surfing attacks, and test the hypothesis that 2-handed gestural signatures could provide an additional layer of security. Our results showed that while 1-handed signatures are to an extent secure and usable, 2-handed input provides a poor tradeoff between usability and security. We discuss the role of 2-handed gestural input for user authentication on mobile devices.},

Our prototype, onMelbourne, returns a changing collection of urban events within physical and temporal proximity based on the setting and adjustment of search sliders by the user. Laboratory tests with 5 participants show that users understand transitory search for urban events and do make serendipitous discoveries. In addition we found that users fear missing out on events not shown by the system, and that the choice of labels on sliders impacts their understanding of a slider set halfway. The contribution of the paper is a better understanding of how transitory search can facilitate explorative behaviour when browsing for urban events on mobiles.},

We investigated the impact of three types of recommender systems on consumers' trusting beliefs and purchase intention by varying the level of social presence in recommender systems. Additionally, we accounted for the importance of context-sensitive services in m-commerce by examining, whether different usage contexts yield preferences for a certain level of social presence in a recommender system. Our findings suggest that different types of recommender systems vary in their impact on trusting beliefs. Furthermore, the usage of recommender systems is more likely to translate into purchase intentions in high-risk situations. In high-risk situations, low levels of social presence in recommender systems are important whereas in low-risk situations, high levels of social presence are preferred. Limitations and future implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

We conducted two experiments to investigate how to reach to a distant point comfortably with one hand. First, we gave the participants four typical tasks while using mobile phones (tapping, texting, calling, and scrolling). In these situations, we measured the position of the index finger and the thumb with the natural hand posture. Consequently, the index finger was primarily positioned in the upper left side. Second, the main experiment was to determine how a touchable area could be extended using the index finger zone on the back side. 1) Randomly selected tiles were touched 84 times with a thumb and 42 times with an index finger. 2) Each tile's preference was evaluated with a 5-point Likert scale. As a result, we found that the "comfort zone" could be expanded by 15% by using index finger zone.},

Prior work in digital photography focused on the sharing of photographic content rather than on the image capturing process itself even though the latter is, by nature, a collocated collaborative task. However, it may be challenging for the collaborating parties to attain the necessary degree of synchronized coordination in the image capturing process since they would need to establish visual contact but may not even recognize each other. An exploratory study based on Yousies, a prototype of the cooperative photography technology, revealed behavioral patterns in the user experiences with respect to usage strategy, patience, and motivating factors that can be applied to the interface design of such collocated collaborative applications.},

abstract = {A rich museum experience is one that is engaging, educating and enjoyable to the visitors, such experiences can only be achieved by personalizing and enriching the museum experience according to the visitor's state. Neural signals from the brain can provide information about the affective and cognitive state of the person implicitly. With the rise of commercial Brain-Computer Interface devices, this technology can be utilized in extracting information to adapt various experiences to the state of the person. We propose a concept and preliminary study which uses brain signals from commercial grade Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) devices to implicitly detect museum visitors' engagement in the exhibited objects. Our concept and output of the study envision an experience where real time feedback based on visitors engagement is provided and the whole museum experience is tailored to each visitor's taste. In future work, we aim to gain external validity by testing our prototype in a museum setting.},

abstract = {With a growing interest in wrist-worn devices, research has typically focused on expanding the available interaction area for smartwatches. In this paper, we instead investigate how different display sizes influence task performance, while maintaining a consistent input area. We conducted an experiment in which users completed a scrolling task using a small display, a large display, and a cylindrical display wrapped around the wrist. We found that the large and cylindrical displays resulted in faster task performances than the small display. We also found that the cylindrical display removed constraints on the participants' body pose, suggesting that cylindrical displays have unique benefits for mobile interactions.},

This paper presents two user studies which investigate the effectiveness of using pressure as an alternative input modality to touch when using mobile phones while walking and encumbered. Force-sensing resistors (FSR) were placed around the edges of a mobile phone to provide multiple pressure points to execute onscreen spreading, pinching, rotating and dragging single handedly. Experimental results showed that it is possible that encumbrance had no significant effect on pressure-based targeting performance. Our preliminary findings show promise with using multi-digit pressure input to facilitate one-handed touchless interactions with handheld devices in multitasking encumbered contexts.},

abstract = {In recent years, Participatory Design (PD) has emerged as an important design methodology to engage end-users in various phases of design processes, for better understanding about users' perspectives in situated contexts. In this paper, we discuss how to design and structure a participatory design workshop with children, especially in the situation to elicit ideas, knowledge, and values for user experiences that children are not familiar with or have little prior experiences. Our approach to structure a PD workshop is to embed a pre-activity where children can have simulated experiences in a situated context. In a main-activity, children engaged in creating game scenarios with gamification strategies through the layered elaboration technique. In the discussion, we highlight two tensions observed in the PD process: (a) the tension in coupling pre-activity and main-activity from scaffolding perspectives, and (b) the tension in idea ownership and time factor.},

At the same time, older adults are using the Internet and mobile technologies in increasingly large numbers. As evidenced by the proceedings of many conferences such as the ACM MobileHCI or the ACM CHI, the usability of interactive technologies designed for older adults is of significant concern. Yet, the methodologies we employ for designing and evaluating such interfaces are largely the same as those used for any other user group. In this position paper, we argue that one methodological size does not fit all especially when it comes to usability evaluations with older adults. We do so by reflecting on our own experiences with designing and evaluating interactive technologies for older adults (particularly for those over 80 years -- the "oldest old"). We then propose for discussion senior-centred approaches and adaptations of established usability evaluation methodologies.},

The sensors have enriched the interaction possibilities, allowing, for example, gestural interaction. With the prevalence of wearable devices and peripherals, such as fitness bracelets and breast straps, the input and output possibilities can be further extended with both new sensors and actuators. Current applications could benefit from them, and entirely new applications could be designed. The design space for new applications needs to be identified, which will again drive advances in mobile and wearable computing. This workshop sets focus on wearable devices as means to enrich smartphones and their interaction capabilities. We will discuss the new design space and generate ideas of new applications. Furthermore, we will provide sensors and actuators allowing the participants to implement rapid prototypes of their novel application ideas.},

Our study indicates that social applications, such as WhatsApp, SMS or e-mail are used most by students. These applications tend to generate numerous notifications, which often result in brief bursts of smartphone use, which is called micro-usage. We propose three novel ways of handling notifications on a smartwatch, in order to reduce micro-usage. The first proposal receives input through on-screen buttons, the second by tapping the edges of the device and the third by drawing gestures on the screen. An evaluation of our design shows an increase of 5% of application micro-usage and a decrease of 5% of the general smartphone micro-usage.},

However, as life logging becomes increasingly mainstream, the volume of captured content also increases but our capacity for reviewing diminishes. In order to limit picture taking on such devices to only the most memorable moments, we propose a biophysical driven capture process that adapts the camera capture rate based on one's heart rate. In our prototype -- called PulseCam -- an Android smartphone worn on the body acts as the picture capture device, adjusting its capture rate based on one's heart rate as measured by an Android-based smart watch. The purpose of this work is twofold: a) we will examine the potential of PulseCam to capture pictures of significant moments and b) investigate the potential of such pictures to improve one's ability to remember. This paper introduces the general approach, describes our current prototype, and outlines the planned study design.},

abstract = {There is an urgent, real need to better understand how mobile ICT products and services can be designed to better meet the needs of persons with cognitive disabilities (including older users), and to develop and update standards to ensure that they recommend solutions that are beneficial to this group of users to exploit the true potential of mobile information and communication technologies (ICT).An ETSI (European Telecommunication Standards Institute) expert team is currently developing such guidelines, in collaboration with other standardization bodies (including ISO and W3C), during an 18-month period. The work started in March 2015.At the Mobile HCI 2015 Workshop#3 focused on Mobile Cognition, we intend to present, share and discuss our topic, approach, classification, insight and early draft design recommendations that extend over all five workshop topics. Additionally, we plan to raise issues and topics of common interest with expert colleagues working in the field and invite those interested to collaborate with us during the later phases of the work, to exploit the true potential of mobile ICT, to support people with cognitive disabilities.Last but not least, we would also like to invite leading researchers to guide and assist our work, possibly through direct participation in a reference group.},

abstract = {Sustainability is a major call of all research and applied services. Mobile technology can offer innovative ways to address sustainability issues. Self-reflection -in interviews or surveys- is a well-applied data collection method within HCI and provides affordances to observe and transform human behavior by bringing new awareness. While sustainability and self-reflection have been researched and addressed widely within the HCI field, the potential links between them (and how one can influence the other via technology) has yet to be explored within MobileHCI settings. This workshop brings together a cross-domain group of individuals to explore and discuss the role of self-reflection in sustainability. We want to generate new insights regarding mobileHCI technologies, design and methods that have direct sustainable impact in the world.},

abstract = {There is a growing realization that the notion of sustainability should encompass the aspect of human energy as well as environmental resources. Indeed, many HCI researchers have already concerned themselves with designing persuasive technologies leading towards human sustainability. Self-reflection plays at least two critical roles in these initiatives: (1) it is frequently used as a research method to understand behaviors and inform design; (2) technology-mediated reflection can be provided as a system feature that catalyzes learning and behavior change towards more effective management of human energetic resources. We argue that automatically-captured first-person-perspective images can add utility to both routes by augmenting participants/users' self-reflection process.},

It allows for both concurrent and retrospective reflections bringing awareness of processes, emotions and situations. Awareness can enhance experiential learning and knowledge acquisition. This is particularly important within the digital humanities field as self-reflection can reveal not only personal experiences while navigating within a cultural space but can also provide opportunities for acquiring new knowledge, built on the generated experiences, thus sustaining and developing socio-cultural knowledge. We call this process retroflection. This short paper discusses how self-reflection can facilitate sustainability of knowledge within a cultural setting and through a platform developed for sharing self-reflection experiences.},

The concept of information individualization was suggested to engage consumers by tailoring eco information that appeals to their preferences. In this paper we describe the design of a prototype based on the conceptual framework of eco information individualization. Using enabling technologies such as smartphone with NFC function, the proposed device will embed personal visual data (i.e. landscape photo retrieved from the user's Facebook page) into an individualized eco label. It is believed that the photo would provoke the user into reflecting on their experience and increase their attention to eco labels. We suggest a framework that evaluates the effectiveness of the device, and discuss some related issues of qualitative and quantitative research approaches.},

Despite the advantages of PRSs, especially in the mobile scenario where users could be provided with relevant items on-the-fly when needed, the area of PRSs is still unexplored with many challenges. In particular, it is crucial to identify the relevant items for the target users as well as to determine the right context for pushing these items, since otherwise the user acceptance, and therefore system success, will be negatively impacted. In this paper, we propose a new model that scores each item on two dimensions, preference fit and context fit, to proactively push relevant items to the target user in the right context. Furthermore, we present the preliminary design of a prototype of a mobile Point of Interest (POI) recommender which will be implemented in order to evaluate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed model.},

Despite these advantages, excessive mobile phone usage -- especially during face-to-face social interactions -- has been reported to cause significant negative social impact. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for a study investigating the motivations and patterns of phone usage in social situations, and developing intervention mechanism to direct users' attention away from their phones and towards their physical social space. We have conducted a small user study as a proof of concept and, although we cannot draw any inferences about the general population at this early stage, our findings do provide some indication of key reasons behind the phone usage and different usage patterns across the study participants. The concept of proactively interrupting users to discourage mobile phone use during social situations has been favourably received by our participants, and warrants further development into a more sophisticated form before conducting a larger scale study.},

Modalities such as a user's location, her physical activity, time of day, can be used in machine learning models to infer if a user is going to welcome an incoming notification or not. However, the success of context-aware interruptibility systems questions the existing theory of interruptibility, that is based on the internal state of the user, not her surroundings. In this work we examine the role of a user's internal context, defined by her engagement in the current task, on the sentiment towards an interrupting mobile notification. We collect and analyse real-world data on interruptibility of twenty subjects over two weeks, and show that the internal state indeed impacts user interruptibility.},

However, when people are bored, by definition, they seek stimuli and hence often turn to their mobile phones. We cite evidence from our most recent work that boredom can be inferred from patterns of mobile phone usage and that during inferred phases of boredom, people are more likely to engage with suggested content. Thus, using boredom as content-independent trigger might help to make proactive recommendations a more pleasant experience and, in consequence, more successful.},

With PCs, smartphones, smartwatches, smart glasses, and smart TVs the number of devices that display notifications currently increases. Users receive notifications on multiple devices at the same time which further aggravate the disruptive nature of notifications. In particular, displaying notifications is a main use case for smartwatches. While a body of work studied notifications on other devices, this paper investigates notifications on smartwatches. We conducted an online survey to assess users' expectations for notifications on different devices. We contrast the results with an in-situ study where we ask participants to rate individual notifications shown on a smartwatch. The results reveal that the importance of notifications depends not only on the type of app that creates them but also on the type of smart device that shows them.

abstract = {Notifications are a core function of current smart devices. They inform users about a variety of events, such as new messages, comments on social networks posts or application updates. As such, notifications are the main mechanisms to proactively communicate with the user. Focusing on individual device types such as PCs and smartphones, previous work showed that notifications can be distractive and disruptive. The ongoing wave of smart devices makes it possible to reach the user through multiple devices at once -- amplifying the effects of notifications. What is missing is an understanding of notifications in a multi-device environment to enable the smart management of notifications across devices. In this paper we present a system that is able to share notifications across smartphones, tablets, PCs, and smart TVs. It can further reach users through connected devices such as smart watches and smart glasses. The system currently distributes 5.3 million notifications by almost 30,000 users every day. It is not only intended to provide a holistic notification mechanism but also serves us to conduct large scale user studies to gain a deeper understanding of notifications in a multi-device environment.},

abstract = {The average smartphone user handles multiple app notifications a day. Apart from the potential valuable information these notifications carry, they can often be disrupting and annoying. To an extreme end, this can lead to information overload and result in technostress. On Apple's iOS, apps need to request permission to send notifications. However, this request is rather nondescript, i.e. it doesn't tell the user about the nature or frequency of notifications. In this paper we present a concept for empowering users to make informed choices on whether to accept or deny push notification requests.},

The technology may be ready for a radical change in mobile interaction towards personal projected displays that are (in contrast to the milestone work of Pinhanez [7]) not limited to static setups, but the applications and interactions for such novel and exciting technologies are not designed yet. In the proposed workshop, we raise the question to what extend mobile projections will change mobile interactions. In a hands-on workshop the participants will sketch interactions with mobile projectors. The ideated interaction concepts will be structured, analyzed, and discussed regarding their potential to extend the current limitations of mobile interaction, i.e. displaying content only on the embedded screen.},

Mediums, such as concrete, glass, water, or fog could be employed to present information. Many displays are created to suit a specific application context while a single projection enabled device could adapt to multiple environments. For example, moving from an interactive projected desktop surface to an automobile head-up-display. We suggest that the design of projected interfaces should harness key advantages of this technology and create a smooth transition between the different mediums and application contexts.},

Personal and intimate display devices such as head-mounted displays, smartwatches, smartphones and tablets are rarely part of such a multi-display ecosystem. This presents an opportunity to realise "body proximate" display environments, employing on and around the body displays. These can be formed by combining multiple handheld, head-mounted, wrist-worn or other personal or appropriated displays. However, such an ecosystem encapsulating evermore interaction points, is not yet well understood. For example, does this trap the user in an "interaction bubble" even more than interaction with individual displays such as smartphones? Within this paper, we investigate the perceptual and social challenges that could inhibit the adoption and acceptance of interactive proximate display ecosystems. We conclude with a series of research questions raised in the consideration of such environments.},

Gluey can minimize device switching costs, opening new possibilities and scenarios for multi-device interaction. In this paper, we propose Desktop-Gluey, a system to augment situated desktop environments, allowing users to extend the physical displays in their environment, organize information in spatial layouts, and 'carry' desktop content with them. We extend this metaphor beyond the desktop to provide 'anywhere and anytime' support for mobile and collaborative interactions.},

abstract = {Soft wearables include clothing and textile-based accessories that incorporate smart textiles and soft electronic interfaces to enable responsive and interactive experiences. When designed well, they leverage the cultural, sociological and material qualities of textiles, fashion and dress; diverse capabilities and meanings of the body; as well as the qualities and capabilities afforded by smart and programmable elements. Textiles behave in particular ways. They are part of culture. No matter a person's views on fashion or dress, they will have an intimate relationship with textiles, as they are one of the few products worn much of the time, close to the body. When designing wearables a designer must consider a range of requirements that do not typically demand focus when designing products that are not worn, including: a particular sensitivity for material details; an eye for fit and comfort on bodies with perhaps diverse and idiosyncratic movement capabilities; openness to a diversity of meanings that may be generated; and consideration of wearers' intimate relations with technology. In this paper we discuss the opportunities and challenges of designing and using soft wearables, applying notions of situatedness and personal meaning-making to understand and posit values in relation to outcomes. We present three design cases focusing respectively on body, material, and context; and reflect on how the different design approaches might impact use. Finally, we reflect on how embodied and collocated interactions might extend understanding of how to frame wearables research.},

Although some farmers avoided dispensing prescriptive advice in person due to fear of liability, they had no reservations about sharing their farming activities via a mobile phone application. Richer farmers were more inclined to trust the information entered by other farmers than the marginal farmers, who found it useful but preferred first-hand verification of outcomes. Only proactive farmers, however, were motivated enough to enter data.},

Depending on the social and cultural context, there could be barriers preventing students from using e-Learning platforms. Technology can alleviate the problems of using MOOCs in several contexts. For example, the use of mobile devices together with the Internet might be very useful. However, the introduction of mobile technology in these environments is challenging, mainly because there are many differences between mobile devices and desktop environments. Keeping these differences in mind, the main goal of this work is to find and analyse strategies and changes in a user's behaviour in offline contexts using mobile devices. Through a case study, the main strategies are studied. Then, using an offline support tool for web environments, the most suitable strategy is used to test a web application's feasibility in offline scenarios.},

The second concept is to foster collaboration and teamwork through hands-on sessions by conducting Game Jams using Pocket Code, so called Pocket Game Jams.

abstract = {The evaluation of location-based mobile learning (LBML) concepts and technologies is typically performed using methods known from classical usability engineering, such as questionnaires or interviews. In this paper, we argue that many problems that may occur during LBML become apparent in the learner's spatio-temporal behavior (i.e., her trajectory). We systematically explore how location tracking and spatial analyses can be used for the evaluation of LBML. Examples with trajectories recorded during a real learning session are presented.},

abstract = {Social norm has it that people are expected to respond to mobile phone messages quickly. We investigate how attentive people really are and how timely they actually check and triage new messages throughout the day. By collecting more than 55,000 messages from 42 mobile phone users over the course of two weeks, we were able to predict people's attentiveness through their mobile phone usage with close to 80% accuracy. We found that people were attentive to messages 12.1 hours a day, i.e. 84.8 hours per week, and provide statistical evidence how very short people's inattentiveness lasts: in 75% of the cases mobile phone users return to their attentive state within 5 minutes. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of attentiveness throughout each hour of the day and show that intelligent notification delivery services, such as bounded deferral, can assume that inattentiveness will be rare and subside quickly.},

We present a mixed methods study investigating how mobile users use ringer modes for managing interruption by and awareness of incoming communication, and how these practices and locales affect their attentiveness and responsiveness. We show that mobile users have diverse ringer mode usage, but they switch ringer modes mainly for three purposes: avoiding interruption, preventing the phone from disrupting the environment, and noticing important notifications. In addition, without signals of notifications, users are less likely to immediately attend to notifications, but they are not less responsive to those they have attended. Finally, ringer mode switches, attentiveness, and responsiveness are all correlated with certain locales. We discuss implications from these findings, and suggest how future CMC tools and notification services take different purposes for using ringer modes and locales into consideration.},

abstract = {Providing the initiator of a conversation with awareness information about their target's availability can improve interruption timing. Providing this information, however, can be particularly challenging with mobile devices, which are carried by users in a range contexts and have limited audible and visual display possibilities due to possible background noise and small screen size. Haptic or tactile displays present a potentially useful alternative, as interaction with mobile devices is often by touch. This paper reports on a dual-task comparison of awareness information usage on a mobile variable-friction tactile display vs. a visual display under conditions that varied in task type and task workload. Participants using the tactile display performed marginally better on the primary task, but were less accurate and slower on the awareness task. However, there is evidence that some of the awareness task differences dissipated over time. Self-report data also suggests that people's experience with the tactile display was generally positive and improved over time.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous mobile usage provides more opportunities to interact with more people than ever, but with the constraint that people's capacity for attention to others is limited. People manage demands on their attention by limiting their availability to others, and this may cause failure in attempts to reach others. In today's always-connected world, we know very little about how people manage their own availability, maintain awareness of others, and adapt their strategies for reaching others in the face of failure. This paper draws on results from a qualitative field study to present an integrative, joint action approach to attention management. Results suggest that mobile devices play a large part in assessing ambient awareness of others and signaling availability, but are rarely used in isolation. Attention is a continuum that spans multiple devices and channels involving actions and choices learned over time.},

abstract = {Motivated by a rise in the variety and number of mobile devices that users carry, we investigate scenarios when operating these devices in a spatially interlinked manner can lead to interfaces that generate new advantages. Our exploration is focused on the design of SAMMI, a spatially-aware multi-device interface to assist with analytic map navigation tasks, where, in addition to browsing the workspace, the user has to make a decision based on the content embedded in the map. We focus primarily on the design space for spatially interlinking a smartphone with a smartwatch. As both smart devices are spatially tracked, the user can browse information by moving either device in the workspace. We identify several design factors for SAMMI and through a first study we explore how best to combine these for efficient map navigation. In a second study we compare SAMMI to the common Flick-&amp;-Pinch gestures for an analytic map navigation task. Our results reveal that SAMMI is an efficient spatial navigation interface, and by means of an additional spatially tracked display, can facilitate quick information retrieval and comparisons. We finally demonstrate other potential use cases for SAMMI that extend beyond map navigation to facilitate interaction with spatial workspaces.},

In this paper, we introduce StripeMaps, a system that adapts the mobile web design technique of linearization for displaying maps on the small screens of smartwatches. Just as web designers simplify multiple column desktop websites into a single column for easier navigation on mobile devices, StripeMaps transforms any two-dimensional route map into a one-dimensional "stripe". Through a user study, we show that this simplification allows StripeMaps to outperform both traditional mobile map interfaces and turn-by-turn directions for pedestrian navigation using smartwatches. In addition to introducing StripeMaps, this paper also has a secondary contribution. It contains the first empirical comparison of different approaches for pedestrian smartwatch navigation and illuminates their pros and cons.},

In particular, imprecise search exists in the no-man's land between specific fact-finding and general browsing, and can be especially challenging on mobile devices, when user input is difficult and environmental distractions make remembering related information difficult. We examined the prevalence of these mobile search use cases in a two-week diary study, finding that imprecise and general search accounted for the large majority of difficulty with search. Hypothesizing that the ability to view a link neighborhood around the search result could be quite helpful in these cases, we designed GraphTiles, a visual interface for mobile search that exploits the structured entity relationships present in a significant portion of online datasets (e.g. IMDb [5] and LinkedIn [6]). In an experimental evaluation, users performed imprecise searches more quickly with GraphTiles than with a standard mobile site.},

Such devices may enable new input and output modalities compared to current mobile devices, and seamlessly offer information on the go. This paper presents a functional prototype for the purpose of understanding these modalities in more detail, including suitable applications and device placement. We first collected results from an online survey identified map navigation as one of the most desirable applications and suggested placement preferences. Based on these rankings, we built a wearable mid-air display mockup consisting of mobile phone, pico projector, and a holder frame, mountable in two alternative ways: wrist and chest. We then designed an experiment, asking participants to navigate different urban routes using map navigation displayed in mid-air. For map navigation, participants ranked wrist-mount safer than chest-mount. The experiment results validate the use of a wearable mid-air display for map navigation. Based on our online survey and experiment, we offer insights and recommendations for the design of wearable mid-air displays.},

Always keeping a safe distance prevents the user from CVS. In this paper, we present a mobile application that utilizes the front camera to estimate the distance between the phone and the user. Once this distance is too short, the system alerts the user. We explore four different types of warnings: Blur, Flashing Border, Spot, and Push Notification. We conducted user studies to measure satisfaction, effectiveness, and distraction of these warning methods. Our results show that our system is effective in reminding users to keep a safe distance.},

Smoking cigarettes is a serious health risk and people who wish to quit often struggle to do so. It is well known that the most effective method of assisting smoking cessation is personal face-to-face counseling. However, this approach is only used by very few people wishing to quit for reasons such as inconvenience and personal shyness. In response to this we have created an app that provides personal counseling to users on their smartphone. The counseling content is authored by smoking cessation experts and is based on the user's personal data and recent actual smoking behaviors collected through the smartphone. We deployed the QuittyLink app with people in their everyday lives to study how personal counseling on mobile phones would influence their smoking behaviors. We found that both the personal counseling and the ability to visualize and reflect on their own self-tracked smoking behaviors helped them form strategies to improve their ability to quit.},

The system enables supporters to send three types of signals to runners during a race and runners can send signals back to supporters. Input from supporters is sent through a webpage and received by runners through a device designed to lower distraction. An in situ study was conducted to evaluate the prototype during an organized race. Results show that two-way communication between runners and supporters was achieved.

Qualitative aspects, like personal expressiveness, have received less attention. This paper makes individual typing behaviour visible to the users to render mobile typing more personal and expressive in varying contexts: We introduce a dynamic font personalisation framework, TapScript, which adapts a finger-drawn font according to user behaviour and context, such as finger placement, device orientation and movements - resulting in a handwritten-looking font. We implemented TapScript for evaluation with an online survey (N=91) and a field study with a chat app (N=11).

abstract = {Physical keyboards provide feedback and tactile landmarks that are not present on on-screen keyboards (OSKs). Similarly, physical keyboards provide faster typing speed than OSKs. The present study was designed to address the lack of research into the direct application of different types of feedback and tactile landmarks to on-screen typing with the intent of improving tablet OSK performance. Fourteen participants performed typing tasks using 6 tablet OSK variants: no feedback (the benchmark), audio feedback, visual feedback, haptic feedback, key-shaped tactile landmarks, and inverse tactile landmarks with ridges over the key gaps. Typing performance was not statistically different across the conditions, except for the key-shaped landmarks, which performed worse. This was largely due to the overlay affecting the sensitivity of the keys. The conclusion is that, without additional changes, feedback and tactile landmarks alone do not offer the opportunity to improve the performance of OSKs.},

abstract = {Gesture typing is a popular stroke-based text input method for mobile devices. Instead of tapping, the user enters a word with a single continuous stroke by gesturing through all the letters. In this paper, we introduce a quantitative motor control model to predict the human performance of gesture typing in terms of production times. Based on a model of cursive handwriting, it can be applied to predict the influence of the keyboard layout on gesture typing performance. In contrast to previous approaches, the "chunking" of multiple movements into a single action, which is observed for expert users, is a natural characteristic of the proposed model that avoids over-estimation of the production times. Data collected from gesture keyboard users is evaluated to assess the performance of the model in comparison to previous models.},

abstract = {Text entry for smart eyewear is generally limited to speech-based input due to constraints of the input channels. However, many smart eyewear devices are now including a side touchpad making gesture-based text entry feasible. The Swipeboard technique, recently proposed for ultra-small touch screens such as smart watches, may be particularly suitable for smart eyewear: unlike other recent text-entry techniques for small devices, it supports eyes-free input. We investigate the limitations and feasibility of implementing Swipeboard on smart eyewear, using the side touch pad for input. Our first study reveals usability and recognition problems of using the side touch pad to perform the required gestures. To address these problems, we propose SwipeZone, which replaces diagonal gestures with zone-specific swipes. In a text entry study, we show that our redesign achieved a WPM rate of 8.73, 15.2% higher than Swipeboard, with a statistically significant improvement in the last half of the study blocks.},

PalmType leverages users' innate ability to pinpoint specific areas of their palms and fingers without visual attention (i.e. proprioception), and provides visual feedback via the wearable displays. With wrist-worn sensors and wearable displays, PalmType enables typing without requiring users to hold any devices and does not require visual attention to their hands. We conducted design sessions with 6 participants to see how users map QWERTY layout to their hands based on their proprioception. To evaluate typing performance and preference, we conducted a 12-person user study using Google Glass and Vicon motion tracking system, which showed that PalmType with optimized QWERTY layout is 39% faster than current touchpad-based keyboards. In addition, PalmType is preferred by 92% of the participants. We demonstrate the feasibility of wearable PalmType by building a prototype that uses a wrist-worn array of 15 infrared sensors to detect users' finger position and taps, and provides visual feedback via Google Glass.},

Upcoming consumer-ready head-worn displays (HWDs) can play a central role in unifying the interaction experience in such ecosystems. In this paper, we report on the design and development of Gluey, a user interface that acts as a 'glue' to facilitate seamless input transitions and data movement across displays. Based on requirements we refine for such an interface, Gluey leverages inherent headworn display attributes such as field-of-view tracking and an always-available canvas to redirect input and migrate content across multiple displays, while minimizing device switching costs. We implemented a functional prototype integrating Gluey's numerous interaction possibilities. From our experience in this integration and from user evaluation results, we identify the open challenges in using HWDs to unify the interaction experience in DDEs.},

A frequent problem in such situations is how to move virtual visual objects (such as content items or application windows) between device displays. We present a comparative evaluation of three methods for moving objects between personal mobile devices: Tray, Transfer Mode, and Device Touch. The participants' preferences of the methods in different real-life scenarios were found to strongly depend on the task and the context of use, making the design of a single optimal cross-display object movement method a challenging task. We identify several clusters of contextual factors that influenced the users' preferences. We also report more detailed differences in efficiency, novelty, learnability, physical device handling, and task completion strategies between the three methods included in the evaluation.},

However, these codes are normally used only for retrieving a small amount of information, such as a product identifier or a web link. Much previous work has investigated the value of associating digital content with physical objects in everyday scenarios, but has so far relied primarily on adding new markers to existing items, or studied only short-term usage. In this paper, we explore the benefits of "commandeering" existing object labels to support this interaction. We add a social layer to existing digital codes, allowing users to "tag" any marker in their environment with their own messages, which can then be viewed by any other user. The core contribution of this work is the findings and insights that were collected in user studies. We explored the use of our design via two deployments that demonstrate the potential of such a system beyond its playful starting point. We conclude the work by drawing out a number of key design elements for future appropriation designs.},

However, the complexity, diversity, and increasing number of digital appliances in ubiquitous computing ecologies make it increasingly difficult to: (1) discover which appliances are controllable; (2) select a particular appliance from the large number available; (3) view information about its status; and (4) control the appliance in a pertinent manner. To mitigate these problems we contribute proxemic-aware controls, which exploit the spatial relationships between a person's handheld device and all surrounding appliances to create a dynamic appliance control interface. Specifically, a person can discover and select an appliance by the way one orients a mobile device around the room, and then progressively view the appliance's status and control its features in increasing detail by simply moving towards it. We illustrate proxemic-aware controls of assorted appliances through various scenarios. We then provide a generalized conceptual framework that informs future designs of proxemic-aware controls.},

Initial poses, however, are either revealed by space-consuming cheat sheets or time-consuming demonstration videos. Mime is a novel interaction concept that (1) reveals how to form complex hand poses and (2) teaches pose-command mappings: Mime reduces hand poses to space-efficient line figures that users mime with their hands; these abstract lines are embedded into command icons or names to create a mnemonic. We present several applications of the Mime concept, and implemented a prototype based on mid-air back-of-device interaction on off-the-shelf mobile phones. We compared both mnemonics, iconic and textual, to a baseline without embedding to test learnability and memorability of a 12-item vocabulary. Users in the iconic condition required significantly less training than both other conditions and recalled significantly more items after one week compared to the no-cue baseline.},

This has made it harder for the surrounding people to become aware of the activities a person is performing with the device. As a result, the possibilities for serendipitous social interactions between the user and the collocated people have diminished. We introduce social displays, additional displays on mobile devices providing social cues about the activities of device user's activities for surrounding people. We conducted five focus groups with in total 23 participants, each discussing four scenarios and co-designing the presentation of cues on the display. The results suggest that the display has potential to break the private bubble of mobile device activities, as well as to provide tickets-to-talk to enhance social interaction, especially between acquaintances. We discuss social opportunities and challenges as well as possible design directions for social displays.},

We set out to learn how people currently share and discuss mobile media by performing a detailed content analysis of 109 photos and links that were shared in 2,779 messages using a mobile messaging application deployed in the United State and Taiwan. Through our analysis of these conversations, we show how mobile media is used to experience the moment together, to fill in the visual details, to provide background context, and to exchange information. We then discuss our results and provide two designs inspired by our findings.},

In a lab study (n=24),we evaluated variations of ColorSnakes in terms of usability and security. In comparison to direct input, indirect input significantly reduced the risk of shoulder surfing (10.5%) without increasing the input time. In a follow up real-world study (n=12), we compared ColorSnakes with PIN entry and Android's Pattern Unlock over the course of three weeks. Although authentication time for ColorSnakes was higher than for the other two mechanisms, participants valued the security benefit over its slightly higher error rate and increased authentication time. We argue that ColorSnakes could be used as an additional authentication mechanism alongside current mechanisms, thus providing the user with the choice of changing to ColorSnakes for certain applications or when there is an observer.},

abstract = {One of the main reasons why smartphone users do not adopt screen locking mechanisms is due to the inefficiency of entering a PIN/pattern each time they use their phone. To address this problem we designed a context-sensitive screen locking application which asked participants to enter a PIN/pattern only when necessary, and evaluated its impact on efficiency and satisfaction. Both groups of participants, who prior to the study either locked or did not lock their phone, adopted our application and felt that unlocking their phone only when necessary was more efficient, did not annoy them and offered a reasonable level of security. Participants responded positively to the option of choosing when a PIN/pattern is required in different contexts. Therefore, we recommend that designers of smartphone locking mechanisms should consider ceding a reasonable level of control over security settings to users to increase adoption and convenience, while keeping smartphones reasonably secure.},

Overall, study participants were satisfied with current fallback schemes, but at the same time, fallback authentication was aggravated when special circumstances applied and thus, leave room for improvements. Based on this, we propose an alternative concept for fallback authentication that quizzes users about installed and not installed apps on their device. Authentication succeeds, when users identify a certain number of apps correctly. Our evaluation showed that the concept yields an overall accuracy of 95%.},

We propose a novel graphical password scheme, PassApp, which utilizes users' everyday memory about installed apps on mobile devices as shared secrets. As the registration stage is no longer needed, PassApp exempts users from additional memory burden and greatly enhances user experience. Additionally, PassApp owns a large password set and only a small part of passwords may be exposed during a login. Therefore, PassApp has a natural advance on effectively resisting guessing attacks and shoulder surfing attacks. Our user studies demonstrate that PassApp performs well with a reasonable login time (7.27s) and a high success rate (95.48%). Our security analysis shows PassApp can effectively withstand one-time shoulder surfing attacks and on average 30 times of shoulder surfing are necessary to expose all passwords.},

We present the first study to investigate how image-based passwords are used over long periods of time in the real world. Our analyses are based on data from 2318 unique devices collected over more than one year using a custom application released in the Android Play store. We present an in-depth analysis of what kind of images users select, how they define their passwords, and how secure these passwords are. Our findings provide valuable insights into real-world use of image-based passwords and inform the design of future graphical authentication schemes.},

Most current pedestrian navigation systems communicate using map-based turn-by-turn instructions. This interaction mode suffers from ambiguity, its user's ability to match the instruction with the environment, and it requires a redirection of visual attention from the environment to the screen. In this paper we present GazeNav, a novel gaze-based approach for pedestrian navigation. GazeNav communicates the route to take based on the user's gaze at a decision point. We evaluate GazeNav against the map-based turn-by-turn instructions. Based on an experiment conducted in a virtual environment with 32 participants we found a significantly improved user experience of GazeNav, compared to map-based instructions, and showed the effectiveness of GazeNav as well as evidence for better local spatial learning. We provide a complete comparison of navigation efficiency and effectiveness between the two approaches.},

In this paper, we propose an enhance method that combines crowd-sourcing technology and location-based services, in order to help blind pedestrians find entrances independently in unknown regions. Besides collecting environmental accessibility information collaboratively, within this method a reference point has to be created for each entrance. Users are guided to a reference point by current GPS-based navigation systems, and rely on the environmental accessibility information walking from the reference point to the target entrance finally. A pilot study with 10 subjects (5 blind and 5 blindfolded) indicated that, the proposed method would help blind people find entrances in unfamiliar areas, and we found the blind and blindfolded individuals performed differently due to their different levels of orientation and mobility skills. Overall, it is promising to integrate the proposed approach into existing navigation systems for blind and visually impaired people.},

Runners do not wish to be explicitly directed, or refer to navigation aids that cause them to stop running, such as maps. Such undirected navigation is also common in other 'on-foot' scenarios, but how to support it is under-investigated. We contribute a novel method that uses crowd-sourced venue databases to rate a geographical area on its suitability to run in using linear regression. Our regression model is able to accurately predict the suitability of an area to run in (Pearson r=0.74) with a low mean error (RMSE=1.0). We outline how our method can support runners, and can be applied to other undirected navigation scenarios.},

Moreover, they illustrate what happens when everyday routines are disrupted and when planning or infrastructure fails, causing flat batteries and the need to apply mechanisms for coping. We build on these insights to propose shifting the research focus from user and device centric approaches towards more contextualized understandings of situated practices.

Nevertheless, especially for Mobile Proximity Payment (MPP), neither users nor merchants have largely adopted this innovation so far. This study aims to identify the adoption factors of MPP by developing a user model, tested through an in-lab experimentation involving 50 users in Italy. We then compared our results with those obtained through a remote survey that involved 1001 subjects who have never used a MPP system before. Compatibility with users' needs, habits and lifestyle has been found to be the dominating factor for adoption. Surprisingly, we found that a previous use of e-payment systems does not influence the user's perception of compatibility. While perceived security is a concern for prospective users who have never used MPP, it does not affect the intention to adopt for users who tried the system at least once. Cost considerations do not influence MPP adoption intention. Based on these findings we expect that MPP systems have a high chance to be widely adopted if optimized for compatibility.},

We observed a unique opportunity to develop a mobile crowdsourcing system, which allows university community members to report safety related incidents to the campus police department and to share their reports with other users of the system. To better inform the design of such a system, we applied drift-diffusion models in cognitive psychology to model the effect of various factors on users' sharing tendency. We conducted a laboratory experiment with 30 participants. We also ran an MTurk study with 230 participants to explore the feature of anonymous sharing in the application design. In this paper we report various results, including the findings that the time of day, location, and type of crime each affects the likelihood and timeliness of sharing safety reports in several different ways. We also discuss the implications for design of mobile crowdsourcing systems for public safety in general.},

abstract = {We explore the high potential of elastic controllers for casual interaction in mobile and ubiquitous computing scenarios. While several remote interaction techniques with handheld or body-worn devices have been proposed, the usage of string-based, elastic interaction is still underexplored. Therefore, we first introduce a systematic design space along the axes reference system, interaction dimensions, sensing methods and haptic feedback. Our main contribution is Elasticcon, a versatile, wearable device with a retractable string and a set of exchangeable traction knobs. This elastic controller provides several degrees of freedom and allows rich interaction techniques. As a result of an iterative design process, we also contribute two working prototypes for belt-worn and handheld use. To demonstrate their versatility, we implemented several promising application scenarios. We tested Elasticcon in three smaller user studies investigating qualitative usability aspects and found initial evidence for elastic controllers as being comfortable, casual and yet accurate interaction devices.},

abstract = {Multiple researchers recently proposed the use of the digital compass embedded in mobile devices for touchless interaction in the 3D space around them. These methods overcome several limits imposed by other interaction techniques and were evaluated for a variety of uses. However, they do not support collaborative settings and are prone to dynamic noise caused by external conditions, as with most other sensor-based interaction techniques. In this paper, we propose the use of frequency-modulated electromagnets as an input medium for magnetic interaction to overcome its various constraints and further enable multi-user and two-handed input. Furthermore, we demonstrated the hardware design specifications of a novel input device, referred to as electromagnetic stylus, which is prototyped to conduct a user-study on the proposed method. Experimental results indicate that gestures performed simultaneously by four electromagnetic styli can accurately be recognized using a single magnetic field sensor, and dynamic noises can be substantially reduced.},

abstract = {Nairobi is one of the fastest growing metropolitan cities and a major business and technology powerhouse in Africa. However, Nairobi currently lacks monitoring technologies to obtain reliable data on traffic and road infrastructure conditions. In this paper, we investigate the use of mobile crowdsourcing as means to gather and document Nairobi's road quality information. We first present the key findings of a city-wide road quality survey about the perception of existing road quality conditions in Nairobi. Based on the survey's findings, we then developed a mobile crowdsourcing application, called CommuniSense, to collect road quality data. The application serves as a tool for users to locate, describe, and photograph road hazards. We tested our application through a two-week field study amongst 30 participants to document various forms of road hazards from different areas in Nairobi. To verify the authenticity of user-contributed reports from our field study, we proposed to use online crowdsourcing using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to verify whether submitted reports indeed depict road hazards. We found 92% of user-submitted reports to match the MTurkers judgements. While our prototype was designed and tested on a specific city, our methodology is applicable to other developing cities},

We report a series of three studies addressing key issues in the development of adaptive news app interfaces. We first surveyed users' news reading preferences and behaviours; analysis revealed three primary types of reader. We then implemented and deployed an Android news app that logs users' interactions with the app. We used the logs to train a classifier and showed that it is able to reliably recognise a user according to their reader type. Finally we evaluated alternative, adaptive user interfaces for each reader type. The evaluation demonstrates the differential benefit of the adaptation for different users of the news app and the feasibility of adaptive interfaces for news apps.},

Ruzo was designed based on five guidelines, derived from interviews with domain experts: guide students through all stages of research; reduce anxiousness; encourage active learning; connect to students' everyday lives; and adapt the system to the needs of the instructor. A user study showed that Ruzo was easy to use, and students expressed interest in research, thereby demonstrating the potential of mobile technology to scaffold scientific inquiry.},

However, due to the multiple imaging processes that product photos undergo, end-users often experience a color mismatch between the color of the photo online and the product received. Therefore, we use a crowdsourcing approach to generate what we term CrowdColor, which is the collective color reported by individuals using a mobile color picker. CrowdColor serves as a color review application from the customers' perspectives in the form of a color palette that represents the product color. We perform controlled experiments to evaluate the accuracy of CrowdColor and to understand how the effects of the device and lighting conditions may influence the crowd's color perception and input tasks. The quantitative results reveal that CrowdColor achieves high accuracy and is positively rated overall. Based on experimental analyses, we present design guidelines for crowdsourcing color perception tasks.},

The large music collections available to users today can be overwhelming in mobile settings, they offer 'too-much-choice' to users, who often resort to shuffle-based playback. Work in music psychology has introduced the concept of music engagement -- listeners vary in their desired control over their music listening, and engagement varies with listening context. We develop a series of metrics to capture music listening behaviour from users' interaction logs. In a survey of 94 music listeners, we show significant correlations between music engagement from questionnaires and the presented quantitative metrics. We show how music retrieval can adapt to this engagement, developing a tablet-based demonstrator system, with an exploratory evaluation.},

In vivo combines five data collection techniques -- screen recording, ambient audio recording, wearable cameras, data logging and distributed remote uploads. This data provides a range of insights and we discuss examples from previous work which reveal interaction design issues where interface confusions or task mismatches occur. We see how apps are integrated into ongoing activity and environment (such as how maps are used in situ), and how recorded conversations around and about apps may be used for evaluation purposes. We conclude by arguing that this combinative method helps us to move from considering app use in isolation, to studying app use in interaction.},

Our goal was to add to our broader understanding of smartphone usage by investigating if differences in mobile device usage occurred not only across our three datasets, but also in relation to prior work. We found differences in the top-10 apps in each dataset, in the durations and types of interactions as well as in micro-usage patterns. However, it proved very challenging to attribute such differences to a specific factor or set of factors: was it the time frame in which the studies were executed? The recruitment procedure? The experimental method? Using our somewhat troubled analysis, we discuss the challenges and issues of conducting mobile research of this nature and reflect on caveats related to the replicability and generalizability of such work.},

These one- and two- finger on-screen gesture inputs have become common but previous research has only examined tapping performance in everyday walking and encumbered situations. Therefore, a series of Fitts' Law style targeting tasks was designed to measure the performance of each gesture with users walking only and walking while carrying bags. The results showed that encumbrance and walking had a negative impact on each gesture in terms of accuracy except for rotational actions, which were performed well. Tapping and dragging both performed poorly which shows the input difficulties of single finger interactions when encumbered and on the move. Our findings will help designers choose the appropriate input techniques for future mobile user interfaces and apps in physically demanding contexts.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the results of a study investigating the control of simultaneous non-dominant hand (NDH) pressure input and dominant hand (DH) pinch, swipe and rotate gesture input on a touchscreen tablet device. We investigate the effect of NDH pressure input on DH gesture accuracy, and vice versa, to support the design of bimanual interaction techniques for tablet devices. Our results suggest that pressure negatively affects DH touchscreen gesture performance; however, pressure targeting accuracy for each gesture was still high (86% overall). Our results show that participants were able to achieve high levels of accuracy using DH swipe gestures (the simplest gesture in the study) suggesting that the ability to perform a simultaneous combination of pressure and touchscreen gesture input depends on the complexity of the dominant hand action involved.},

abstract = {This paper explores the Boundless Scroll interface that extends the motor space for finger drag motions into the off-screen space using a tracking system around the screen. Seamlessly extended motor spaces enable continuous scroll actions across the on- and off-screens, reducing the chance of clutching and preserving content visibility during long-distance and smooth scrolling actions. We empirically evaluate our new technique, the Boundless Scroll and compare it to ordinary scroll interfaces (Drag and Flick) in two dominant screen devices. The first screen condition uses a large flat touch screen where users manipulate a non-full-screen window while using the surrounding space as an extended motor space. The second condition is a mobile device to examine mid-air finger scroll motions in the off-screen space using a 3D motion sensor. An empirically controlled study demonstrates our Boundless Scroll's many benefits, such as fewer clutching actions, occlusion-less content observations, and efficient and effortless off-screen acquisitions and also provided further design factors, implementations of the Boundless Scroll, and around-device interfaces.},
