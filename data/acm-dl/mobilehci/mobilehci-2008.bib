abstract = {In this paper we describe a sighting blurring algorithm for use by a trusted middleware infrastructure, which is part of an architecture that supports the operation of Location Based Services (LBSs) over the Internet. This infrastructure can only obtain sightings for the users who are directly involved in a current invocation of an LBS. Therefore, our sighting blurring algorithm is designed to be dependent on only the sightings of these users. Our sighting blurring algorithm offers these users increased privacy by performing spatial blurring on the location components of their sightings. It does not perform temporal blurring, because we believe that this reduces an LBS's ability to offer a useful service. Instead, our sighting blurring algorithm introduces a new parameter that specifies the frequency with which sightings are released by the infrastructure for a particular user. This frequency parameter is a function of the size of the location component.},

abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that mobile search is becoming an increasingly important way for mobile users to gain access to online information, especially as off-portal content continues to grow rapidly. In this paper we study the characteristics of mobile search by analysing approximately 6 million individual search requests generated by over 260,000 individual mobile searchers over a 7-day period during 2006. We analyse the patterns of queries used by mobile searchers and focus on key characteristics such as the clickthru rates of mobile searches in order to understand, for the first time, just how well mobile search engines are responding to user queries. Moreover, we compare our results to a number of recent mobile studies and highlight some of the key differences between mobile search and traditional Web search behaviours.},

abstract = {We conducted a study to the topic of this active idle screen (AIS) with regards to the services users prefer. To this end, we employed card-sorting techniques for predefined services and applications with personalization and customization aspects, followed by specific brainstorming to generate additional ideas. To evaluate in which specific contexts participants would prefer to use selected services, we employed a semi-closed card-sorting technique ('context-card-sort'), where we defined five basic contexts as group headings but allowed for changes or updates of the groups where the user would need or miss specific elements.In a second step, the users created their own 'active idle screen' and three navigation concepts for the AIS were presented to the users. In a short task-based study, users explored the four concepts using paper prototypes and reflected on them as to which would appeal most to them. Participants felt mainly attached to their own heavily personalized design where exactly those services were included that they missed, and otherwise chose concepts that they knew as opposed to alternative ones that provided more playful experience.},

Using four real applications as analytical examples, we point out multiple ways in which design can affect the user's processing of awareness information and thereby yield different outcomes in the use of technology. We conclude by pointing out novel design opportunities that lie in the integration of cues with functionality and content on the mobile phone.},

abstract = {Subjective quality evaluation is used to optimize the produced audiovisual quality from fundamental signal processing algorithms to consumer services. These studies typically follow the basic principles of controlled psychoperceptual experiments. However, when compromising compression and transmission parameters for consumer services, the ecological validity of conventional quality evaluation methods can be questioned. To tackle this, we firstly present a novel user-oriented quality evaluation method for mobile television in its usage contexts. Secondly, we present the results of an experiment conducted with 30 participants comparing acceptability and satisfaction of quality as well as goals of viewing in three mobile contexts and under four different residual transmission error rates, when the participants also performed simultaneous assessment tasks. Finally, we compare the results with a previous laboratory experiment. The studied error rates impacted negatively on all measured tasks with some contextual differences. Moreover, the evaluations were more favorable and less discriminate in the mobile contexts compared to the laboratory.},

People have different preferences for map orientations (heading-up or north-up), but map orientations also have different advantages and disadvantages. In general north-up maps are good for building up situation awareness and heading-up maps are better for navigational tasks. Because of heavily loaded visual modalities, we expect that tactile waypoint information can enhance navigation speed and situation awareness. In this paper we describe an experiment conducted in a synthetic task environment, in which we examined the effect of heading-up and north-up displays on search and rescue performance of first responders, and if adding the tactile display improves performance.},

abstract = {Wearable computing and smart clothing have attracted a lot of attention in the last years. For a variety of applications, it can be seen as potential future direction of mobile user interfaces. In this paper, we concentrate on usability and applicability issues concerned with capacitive touch input on clothing. To be able to perform user studies, we built a generic platform for attaching, e.g., capacitive sensors of different types. On top of that, several prototypes of wearable accessories and clothing and implemented various application scenarios. We report on two studies we undertook with these implementations with a user group randomly sampled at a shopping mall. We provide a significant set of guidelines and lessons learned that emerged from our experiences and those studies. Thus, developers of similar projects have to put major efforts into minimizing the delay between button activation and feedback and to make location and identification of controls and their function as simple and quick as possible. Issues that have to be treated in all designs include the requirement of one-handed interaction and that, even for minimal functionality, to find a general solution with regard to layout and button-to-function mapping is hardly possible. Additionally, in order to generate a satisfactory user experience good usability must be combined with aesthetical factors.},

To assess the accuracy, efficiency, effectiveness and user experience of this service, a longitudinal field evaluation was conducted with thirty police officers over four months. The results show that using the LBNS, police officers were better informed of relevant information in their environment and this led to positive operational results. Users considered the interface clear and easy to use. However, users indicated that the system presented too many or non-relevant notifications and that the system is overly complex. Recommendations for further development of the LBNS are to mitigate unwanted interruption by intelligent filtering of notifications and integration of system components.},

In a pilot study with 6 users, we evaluated the effects of different button sizes on performance when walking while using a portable music player. Results showed significant interactions between size and movement. In the second study, 29 users evaluated the performance of a WUI that dynamically changed button sizes as the user moved. Results show that our dynamic user interface performs at the level of its component static interfaces without any additional penalty due to adaptation. This work adds to our design knowledge about walking user interfaces and provides lessons learned in evaluating mobile devices while walking in public spaces.},

The user-interface of this system provided a range of additional features including landmarks, compass bearings and previously driven routes within the visual and auditory guidance instructions.It was found that the users of the learning-oriented system displayed better memory for driven routes, when compared with those using a basic guidance system. It is also suggested that they had developed a better cognitive map of the area. Glance analysis demonstrated that the learning-oriented system was no more visually demanding than the basic system.},

(2) Having selected and implemented the most prototypic ideas their potential was evaluated in the second step using the matching and the naming method. (3) In the third step an icon-based menu was constructed, programmed and implemented. (4) Finally, the utility of this prototype vis-a-vis a text-based menu was investigated on an experimental basis in a menu search task. The icon- based menu is shown to produce a significantly higher learnability thus outweighing initial differences. In general, results demonstrate that icon-based menus are basically viable and successfully applicable, if a users-centered procedure is pursued and if icons represent prototypical semantic knowledge.},

The study takes into consideration search tasks on three types of information space, namely maps, diagrams, and web pages, that widely differ in structural complexity. Results suggest that overviews bring enough benefit to justify the used space if (i) they highlight relevant semantic information that users can exploit during search and (ii) the structure of the considered information space does not provide appropriate orientation cues.},

abstract = {This paper shows how basic human values are related to behavior patterns of the usage and production of mobile multimedia content. For these purposes we applied an interview technique called "Laddering", a technique referring to the means-end theory. These in-depth interviews establish relations between product characteristics (attributes), user behaviors (consequences) and basic values and user goals. We carried out interviews with 24 respondents. We found that the entertainment of other people, the exchange of content, the desire to save time and strategies to influence one's mood are the main driving forces for multimedia usage. Those are strongly related to basic values like social recognition, pleasure and happiness as well as to ambition. It is shown that usability aspects, like an intuitive UI, are strongly related to the users' desire for being effective and ambitious. Summarizing, we report the method's applicability in the realm of (mobile) HCI.},

This paper explores the use of the mobile phone as a tool for personalized health care assistance for individuals diagnosed with diabetes. By monitoring user location and activity on the mobile phone, recognizing past behavior and augmenting the logging of blood glucose levels with context data, our prototype application assists with taking well-informed decisions on daily drug dosage to achieve and maintain stable blood glucose levels. Evaluation of the prototype application indicate that a brief training of the application suffices to capture patterns in the user's relevant context that simplify glucose level trends analysis. We describe some of the details of the user study and the prototype application, and conclude with plans to investigate context-driven activity prediction to further improve the decision support for the user.},

We illustrate a novel, mobile, low interaction cost approach to supporting the creation of a rich record of journeys made and places encountered. By pointing and tilting a mobile, users indicate their interests in a location. No content is provided to the user in situ but, later, web materials including images, entries from other people's blogs and web pages are automatically placed on an interactive map for viewing on a larger screen device. We built two mobile prototypes to explore the approach -- one combines gestures and visual map feedback; the other is more lightweight, allowing the user to simply point-and-tilt. We describe and motivate the approaches and present user studies that raise issues relevant to their design and to the wider class of device and service concerned with mobile spatial information access.},

Applications that require interaction with large amounts of information will benefit from the large projection and its high resolution. This paper analyses the advantages and disadvantages of an integrated projector when interacting with maps, and discusses findings useful for the development of mobile applications for projector phones. We report in particular the implementation of an application that uses either the screen of the mobile phone, the projection or a combination of both. These three options were compared in a user study in which the participants had to perform three different tasks with each option. The results provide clear evidence for the positive aspects of using a built-in projector, but also show some negative aspects related to text input.},

The traditional, alphabetical organization is not good enough for low-literate users who either do not know or have forgotten the alphabetical order of any script. We propose Rangoli, a phonebook that explores several ideas. It organizes contacts in nine colour 'pages'. On each page nine icons are displayed in that colour. A contact is associated with a colour and an icon. Any contact can be accessed by pressing only two buttons on the number-pad. The spatial location of each contact does not change even as the phonebook fills up. The limitation of 81 contacts is not a major problem for these users for now. Rangoli was first conceived during a class project and was improved through iterations of user study, design and evaluation.},

We designed two new solutions for Chinese pinyin text entry with a rotator as input device. They were evaluated in an empirical study with 12 novice users and compared to a straightforward implementation of the date stamp method. Although there was no significant difference between the three designs on user performance, the perceived efficiency by users was higher for one of the new designs, and it was their technique of choice for their own phone. Because the evaluation setup favored the date stamp method (it was the only one supporting predictive input, and also the most familiar to users), the results are encouraging. We close by discussing how to further develop the new techniques.},

Moreover, there is potential to realize new interaction techniques between the phone and display. For example, select &amp; pick and select &amp; drop are interactions whereby entities can be picked up onto the phone or dropped onto the display. We report the implementation of Touch &amp; Interact, its usage for a tourist guide application and experimental comparison. The latter shows that the performance of Touch &amp; Interact is comparable to approaches based on a touch screen; it also shows the advantages of our system regarding ease of use, intuitiveness and enjoyment.},

Then, we present the results of a runner study with 10 runners. The study compared the runners efficacy and enjoyment in achieving predefined workout goals when running with MPTrain and TripleBeat. The conclusions from the study include: (1) significantly higher efficacy and enjoyment with TripleBeat, and (2) a unanimous preference for TripleBeat over MPTrain. The glanceable interface and the virtual competition are the two main reasons for the improvements in the running experience. We believe that systems like TripleBeat will play an important role in enhancing the exercise experience and in assisting users towards more active lifestyles.},

abstract = {Digital media content can contain items that are very personal and valuable for their owner. Such items can form life memories, such as media collages from happy events or recordings of the first steps of one's children. Memories can be evoked and created "anytime, anyplace", and thus mobility is a key factor in managing them. Even though related systems for sharing photographs exist, users' needs for managing personal content have not been investigated specifically from the viewpoint of life memories. This paper describes our empirical research on users' needs for sharing the digital representations of their life memories. As the main contribution, we present design guidelines for services for sharing digital life memories. Furthermore, we present a mobile service prototype which was designed based on the guidelines. Our research shows that the creation, sharing, managing and viewing of digital life memories is highly based on meaningful real-life events.},

The blogs were generated by the teenagers using a specially created application running on a mobile phone linked to a Bluetooth GPS unit and consist of spatially and temporally-referenced texts and images together with a record of their route using GPS coordinates stored at one second intervals. Whilst the blogs generated considerable amounts of quantitative information, particularly when coupled with the pollution profiles of the routes the teenagers travelled, it is the depth of qualitative information revealed in the interviews with the teenagers after each study period, using the routes and blogs as a trigger, that demonstrates the benefits of the multi-methods approach. In particular, we highlight some of the depth of contextual information revealed not only in regard to the use of the phone application and GPS unit but also the complex social factors which contribute to formation of the school journey.},

The conducted experiment uses a novel apparatus called "Hot Wire" that allows retaining the properties of wearable computing even in laboratory environments. Visual feedback was found to impair user performance and caused users to be caught in an attention demanding closed feedback loop once presented in a head-mounted display. Even though continuous feedback was not necessary for gesture interaction, users were unable to ignore it and remain focused on the primary task. The design of an alternative gesture recognition method using a body-centric frame of reference instead of a conventional static one to improve usability, is shown to have an opposed impact both on the performance and subjective perception of users. The presence of novel devices in gesture interaction, such as data gloves, is found to be a major source of erroneous gesture recognition due to unpredictable user behavior. Our detailed result discussion provides guidelines for designing better gesture interaction.},

abstract = {In this paper a framework for a novel kind of applications called Augmented-Mobile-Tagging (AMT) applications is presented. AMT applications augment classic Mobile Tagging applications with information from existing Location Based Services (LBS) in a seamless way. This leads to very powerful mobile applications without loosing the efficiency, intuitiveness and robustness of the visual tagging application. We have implemented two AMT applications based on this concept and are currently running two field trials, one a campus information system on the university campus and another, called LocalTagging, running in the town and surroundings of Winterthur.},

abstract = {Widgets are embeddable objects that provide easy and ubiquitous access to dynamic information sources, e.g., weather, news or TV program information. Interactions with widgets take place through a so-called widget engine, which is a specialized client-side runtime component that also provides functionalities for managing widgets. As the number of supported widgets increases, managing widgets becomes increasingly complex. For example, finding relevant or interesting widgets becomes difficult and the user interface easily gets cluttered with irrelevant widgets. In addition, interacting with information sources can be cumbersome, especially on mobile platforms. In order to facilitate widget management and interactions, we have developed Capricorn, an intelligent user interface that integrates adaptive navigation techniques into a widget engine. This paper describes the main functionalities of Capricorn and presents the results of a usability evaluation that measured user satisfaction and compared how user satisfaction varies between desktop and mobile platforms.},

Although women are primarily responsible for making most purchasing decisions in the US, we found very few studies to assess the adoption of retail related mobile services by women. Based on surveys, semi-structured interviews, and focus groups, we have identified a number of design factors that should be considered when designing mobile services for women consumers. The results of our study indicate that while usefulness is an important factor, other design aspects such as mobile vs. kiosk, installed vs. existing software, technical comfort vs. social comfort, social vs. individual, privacy and trust should also be accounted for.},

abstract = {Proper feedback is one of the challenges in gesture interaction. Providing continuous feedback during the execution of the gesture increases the feeling of control and it can help user to perform the task more efficiently. In this paper we introduce an experimental handheld sensor-actuator device that responds dynamically to user's motion. With the device we explored the potential of continuous audiotactile feedback in closed-loop gesture interaction, designed simple synthesis methods for feedback, and tested the user perception. We designed four simple textures that respond to overall angular velocity of the device, all with different velocity responses. The system enabled us to examine how well subjects can distinguish the textures on the fly. Our preliminary findings show that audio modality dominates the perception. Tactile feedback worked quite well alone but the modalities together didn't lead to any better performance than audio alone.},

So far no research exists regarding how mobile applications should be designed when using a projection and which applications will profit from such a large high-resolution display. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of picture browsing using projector phones. In a study we compared three different interaction techniques: phone display only, projection only and a combination of both. The results show that users prefer the projection-based interaction techniques and the large high-resolution projection leads to a reduced number of enlarge interactions. However, the task completion time results illustrate how familiar users are in using conventional phones with small screen size. The paper presents a comprehensive discussion of findings from our study and defines important guidelines which we consider as critical for the success of applications for projector phones in the future.},

Our navigation methods ensure that any part of the collection can quickly be reached, even for a large set of items. Moreover, we show that the map representation is a natural approach to provide efficient and distributed operation.},

The presented functional component -- the Attentive Machine Interface (AMI) -- enables contextual processing of multi-sensor information in a probabilistic framework, for example to exploit contextual information from geo-services with the purpose to cut down the visual search space into a subset of relevant object hypotheses. We demonstrate results about geo-indexed object recognition from experimental tracks and image captures in an urban scenario, extracting object hypotheses in the local context from both (i) mobile image based appearance and (ii) GPS based positioning, and verify performance in recognition accuracy (&gt; 14%) using Bayesian decision fusion, verifying the advantage of multi-sensor attentive processing in multimodal interfaces.},

Additional metadata is also stored with the photos, such as location, user identification, date and time of capture and image-based features. Users can search for photos in their personal repository by means of speech. MAMI does not need connectivity to a server. Hence, instead of full-fledged speech recognition, we propose using a Dynamic Time Warping-based metric to determine the distance between the speech input and all other existing speech annotations. We present our preliminary results with the MAMI prototype and outline our future directions of research, including the integration of additional metadata in the search.},

These can occur because users look through the LCD to frame the image and can often miss the icons displayed around the edge that present important information about exposure, battery life, number of shots remaining, etc. This may lead to shots being missed or poorly exposed. We created a sonified luminance histogram to present exposure information, a sound cue to indicate memory card space remaining and a tactile cue for battery charge status. A user study showed that participants were able to use the sonified histogram to identify exposure successfully and could recognise the status of the battery and memory card well, suggesting that alternative forms of output could free-up the screen for framing the image.},

Given the complexity of designing games for mobile phones, game developers must understand how mobile phone users' gaming experiences are like when using different types of phones. This paper examines users' gaming experiences in playing three types of games on three different types of phones. It is found that users have different preferences when playing different games on certain phones. Some games are more suitable to be played on mobile phone than others. Easy control and fewer levels of difficulties are the two main issues for consideration in designing mobile phone games. It is recommended that game designers design specific types of games for different mobile phone interfaces. Mobile phone manufacturers need to consider gamers' requirements for the type of games they intend to include in the mobile phone.},

abstract = {Natural and man-made disasters present the need to efficiently and effectively evacuate the people occupying the affected buildings. Providing appropriate evacuation instructions to the occupants of the building is a crucial aspect for the success of the evacuation. This paper presents an approach for giving evacuation instructions on mobile devices based on interactive location-aware 3D models of the building. User's position into the building is determined by using active short-range RFID technology. A preliminary user evaluation of the system has been carried out in the building of our Department.},

abstract = {Recent ethnomethodological work in context and location awareness has indicated that location cues hold many socially meaningful cues for interaction. Location-aware technologies are therefore expected to bring about a shift in social life. Yet little is known about underlying psychological effects and the role of specific design decisions. The present research aims to experimentally test some of these effects. In a laboratory experiment participants' location in a virtual game world was shared. The effects of location Cueing frequency and Cueing mode (explicit or inferred closeness) on affinity, social presence, awareness, and game experience were explored. Higher cue frequencies resulted in higher perceived challenge and flow experienced in the game. The data also showed trends of heightened awareness and more behavioural engagement. A trend towards more psychological involvement was found when cues explicitly communicated that players shared a location in the game.},

abstract = {While listening to music is mainly an individual experience, it also holds social significance by acting as a ground for interaction and a means for self-expression. In this paper we report the design and field testing of a service for collaborative music listening among friends in a mobile context. The prototype, Social Playlist, is a shared music channel where music is selected by its members according to their current activities and states of mind. Our findings suggest that Social Playlist enables self-expression, discovery about friends and touch points in the shared listening context. To support ongoing use, we suggest a smooth integration between mobile collaborative services and personal music associations and adopting features for resolving tensions arising from different music preferences in a collaborative playlist.},

Because of our increased mobility, we are also more inclined to lose these objects.

They lack dynamic information, introduce too many intermediates and induce high costs. We support the growth of a community of users able to solve the problem on their own using their mobile phones. We describe our concept and implementation of the idea based on prototypes of mobile phones enhanced with a novel type of RFID (Radio Frequency IDentifiaction) reader, the use of the EPC (Electronic Product Code) standards and the creation of both mobile and server-side software. We finally discuss how it can help making the current system more dynamic and efficient.},

Mobile usage scenarios afford many completely different interactions, so should be designed accordingly. This paper presents a new type of widget, the T-Bar, designed specifically for finger-based touchscreen interfaces using tactile feedback. Using the tactile feedback for orientation, the user's fingertip is guided along the T-Bar until an item is successfully selected. This paper offers observations on our finger-based touchscreen widget and two applications of the T-Bar widget. Both, File-o-Feel and Touch 'n' Twist are multi-touch information browsing applications that deviate from traditional desktop GUI paradigms and are tailored for fingertip input where all interaction takes place through the use of T-Bars; eliminating the need for any other widgets.},

The NWS program employs a mobile device to enable moment-to-moment monitoring and progress feedback. In order to assess the relationship between goal difficulty and physical performance, we analyzed the data of a recently completed NWS program test. We found a significant positive linear relationship between goal difficulty and performance for individuals with an inactive lifestyle. No significant relationship was found for individuals with an active lifestyle. This may be explained by the active participants' low level of commitment to the assigned goals. We conclude that sufficiently difficult goals combined with timely progress feedback are effective in increasing activity levels of inactive people. Future studies should address the effect of additional mobile persuasion techniques to further improve physical activity patterns of inactive individuals and to enhance goal commitment of active individuals.},

Few studies, however, have been conducted on the touch interface design for a mobile phone. This study investigated the effects of touch key sizes and locations on the one-handed thumb input that is popular in mobile phone interactions. Three different touch key sizes (i.e. square shape with 4mm, 7mm, and 10mm wide) and twenty five locations were examined in an experiment. The results provided two groups of touch key locations (an appropriate and an inappropriate region) with respect to three usability measures including success rate, number of errors, and pressing convenience. In addition, a hits distributions based algorithm was applied to target selection tasks, which statistically improved the performance. The results of this study could be used to design touch keys so as to enhance the usability of mobile phones with a touch screen.},

The two spatial interface conditions are a device list ordered by distance and an iconic map of devices as seen from the user's perspective and the non-spatial condition is an alphabetical list. Our results show an overall user preference for the iconic map over the spatial and alphabetical list. However, there was no clear preference for the spatial interfaces over the non-spatial condition with respect to user satisfaction and mental load.},

Key goals of the resulting tool and process were to be as lightweight as possible, to cater for the different information needs of the various Stakeholders, and to be easy to create and update. The resulting tool was PowerPoint based and divided documentation into high and low level descriptions to meet the needs of both product management stakeholders and the development stakeholders. Overall, the improved documentation creation process and the clearer documentation which results have the ability to significantly accelerate the development process.},

Using experiments and recorded data in driving simulators, three distinct issues are discussed: 1) the student, 2) the virtual driving instructor (VDI), and 3) the student-profile. We found that: first, students seek task-relevant information themselves; not providing them with feedback can be beneficial. Second, an intelligent VDI that emulates a human driving instructor is not favored. To the contrary, regressive instruction -- a relatively simple principle -- was effective in letting students drive away autonomously. Third, constructing a student-profile based on individual characteristics, such as a strength-weakness report, is viable for providing student-adaptive feedback.},

abstract = {Word completion is a basic technology for reducing the effort involved in text entry on mobile devices and in augmentative communication devices, where efficiency and ease of use are needed, but where a low memory footprint is also required. Standard solutions compress a lexicon into a suffix tree with a small memory footprint and high retrieval speed. Keystroke savings, a measurable correlate of text entry effort gain, typically improve when the algorithm would also take into account the previous word; however, this comes at the cost of a large footprint. We develop two word completion algorithms that encode the previous word in the input. The first algorithm utilizes a character buffer that includes a fixed number of recent keystrokes, including those belonging to previous words. The second algorithm includes the complete previous word as an extra input feature. In simulation studies, the first algorithm yields marked improvements in keystroke savings, but has a large memory footprint. The second algorithm can be tuned by frequency thresholding to have a small footprint, and be less than one order of magnitude slower than the baseline system, while its keystroke savings improve over the baseline.},

The interaction needs neither special hardware for communication, nor additional software for existing mobile devices. In the interaction, users of mobile devices can easily interact with nearby devices by three procedures: 1) selecting an image, 2) displaying an image in full-screen mode, or 3) holding the display over a camera connected to the device. The key technology of the interaction is FPcode (Fine Picture code) which is a kind of steganography and can be invisibly embedded in printed images. To enable FPcode to be applied to images on mobile displays, we have developed a camera control method for reducing the influence of moire stripes on the display and variations in display brightness. In the demonstration, we show an application using FPcode on a mobile display.},

In Mobile HCI 2008 Movial is presenting its new Movial IXS application suite for Mobile Internet Devices and aims to demonstrate how internet is not just something that you access, but a natural part of the user experience.Unlike in any other Mobile Internet Device, Movial IXS' user interface is built entirely with standard XHTML/CSS/JavaScript techniques and it uses Mozilla browser engine as its renderer and backbone. Using native web technologies for creating the user interface positions Movial IXS out of its seemingly natural mobile internet device genre and places it firmly to the close proximity of online internet and web applications. The aim of the Mobile HCI 2008 demonstration is to showcase how this close proximity of internet can be used to provide richer user experiences and flexible user interface development, and to provoke conversation about the role of the internet in the mobile devices that we use on daily basis.},

Their main characteristic is that they are not carried out in short bouts, but are being played continuously and are interwoven in the daily routine of the players. Data from wearable accelerometers are logged wirelessly to a cell phone and control the animation of the player in a virtual race game (avatar) with other players over the cellular network. Players can use their excess of activity points earned from the race game to get hints in mental games of the suite, like Sudoku. Initial studies indicate that NEAT-o-Games may bring a positive physical, psychological, and social impact on players.},

Such a bookmark can then be stored on the mobile phone, exchanged with friends and in particular be used to access related videos, web pages, and other services. This helps the user to bridge the gap between the virtual and the real world in order to use related services. Combining content and context analysis objects are recognized without any visual markers or electronic tags.

Through this, we demonstrate that it is currently possible to design, develop and evaluate applications for projector phones. The system supports three different modalities in order to compare when which display (phone display, projection) should be used. This prototype system was used for the implementation of two applications in order to test the advantages and disadvantages of projector phones for two common scenarios, picture browsing and map interaction. This demonstration paper describes the hardware used for the simulation of projector phones and the two developed prototypes.

The motivation for the project is to overcome the intrinsic output limitations of mobile phones. Touch &amp; Interact extends the phone output to a public display allowing both screens to share the display space. This concept is especially useful for separating public and private data -- only showing private data on the phone display. During interaction, the phone is used as a stylus for the public display and can touch the display at any location. The phone also lends additional capabilities to interactions by providing storage capabilities, additional feedback (e.g. audio and haptic) and input modalities (e.g. keypad and joystick). The underlying technology supporting Touch &amp; Interact is Near Field Communication (NFC); the dynamic display includes a mesh of NFC tags which can be interacted with using an NFC phone. A tourist map application was used to explore and test Touch &amp; Interact in an environment with rich functionality.},

abstract = {Audio interfaces for mobile and wearable computing are in an early state of development. User studies concentrate on the usability of audio interfaces as means of interacting with a device but leave out the question of how an audio interface can aid at performing a main task. Studying the impact of audio interfaces in computer aided tasks for wearable and mobile computing will provide guidelines for hands-free interface design and information presentation. To be able to measure the performance a simulated main task is used where varying mental loads can be setup. Providing an index of difficulty for the simulated task, users studies will reveal how effective an audio interface can be used to convey information to aid at a task.},

abstract = {To fully exploit the strengths and potential of the today's mobile devices, context-awareness needs to be incorporated into the very essence of mobile computing. But today's mobile computing approaches either fail to do so, or do it in a very limited way. At the same time, current research efforts in context-awareness fail to consider context as a dynamic construct, and is unable to offer a holistic treatment of context-awareness that includes an active role for the user. Our hypothesis is that to make context-awareness more intuitive and productive to the mobile user, the notion of context needs to be user-centric. In this research, we explore a novel, general form of context-aware mobile computing that is activity-driven, and where context dynamically arises from the user's activity.},

Given the importance of speech in developing regions, SiMPE 2008 will include "SiMPE for developing regions" as a topic of interest. As a result of discussions in SiMPE 2007, we plan to invite and encourage Speech UI designers to participate in SiMPE 2008. We will also review the progress made over the last two years, in the areas and key problems identified in SiMPE 2006 [3].},
