abstract = {Context-aware applications can better meet users' needs when sensing agents installed in the environment automatically provide input relevant to the application. However, this non-intrusive context usage may cause privacy concerns since sensitive user data could be leaked to unauthorized parties. Therefore, data privacy protection becomes one of the major issues for context-aware applications. In this paper, in order to provide services based on various levels of privacy concerns, we extend the Platform for Privacy Preferences of W3C and define a specification for representing user privacy preferences for context-aware applications. We also propose a privacy infrastructure, which could be installed as a plug-in service for middleware supporting context-aware applications. This infrastructure enables the middleware to automatically generate a privacy policy and the user preference file according to the current context. The middleware simply matches these two files to decide whether to proceed with the application. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through a prototype implementation.},

abstract = {As small digital cameras become more popular, opportunities to take photos are rapidly increasing. Photo sharing is a great way to maintain and revitalize relationships between families and friends, and is a major motivator for content sharing. While photo sharing has been well studied, little work exists on sharing multiple photo sets contained in spontaneously connected handheld devices.This paper provides an algorithm to extract photos, based on common memories collected in an ad hoc group. It automatically searches for and presents photos that could become the starting point of a conversation. We found that our mechanism has more uses than simply organizing photos in chronological order.This paper describes our prototype system realized using the above algorithm. We also implemented a synchronized shutters mechanism, that provides a new photo sharing experience. Through subjective tests, we found that our method promotes conversation, even though the users did not know each other beforehand.},

abstract = {Camera phones have been viewed simplistically as digital cameras with poor picture quality while neglecting the utility of the two key functionalities of mobile phones: network connection and access to personal information. This is the first HCI paper to examine mobile photos from a systemic perspective: how assignment of phases of mobile photo lifecycle to different platforms affects social discourse around shared photos. We conducted a 6-week user trial of MobShare, a tripartite system with dedicated functions and task couplings for a mobile phone, a server, and a PC browser. We analyze how MobShare's couplings and distribution of functionalities affected the observed types of social discourse that formed around mobile photos: in-group post-event discourse, self-documents and reports, greetings and thanks. Several central design issues arising from the systemic view are discussed: heterogeneity of environments, integration and distribution of functionalities, couplings and decouplings of interaction tasks, notification mechanisms, and provision of necessary UI resources for different tasks.},

abstract = {At work and at play, people need access to the right information, and they frequently need to share that information with others. While current tools such as electronic mail and USB flash drives provide powerful mechanisms for managing and sharing information, they too often require that users anticipate what information they might share (e.g. so they have it on their flash drive) and when they might share it (e.g. so they bring the flash drive with them). These tools thus provide excellent support for planned sharing but inadequate support for serendipitously sharing digital information with others. In this paper we discuss eight design goals that a successful system for serendipitous sharing should meet, and we present SEREFE, a new architecture for SEREndipitous File Exchange that we designed to meet those goals. SEREFE extends an instant messaging architecture to allow users to use any of their devices, including a cell phone, to share information stored on any of their devices with other users or to copy it to another of their devices. We describe the SEREFE user experience, implementation, and initial evaluation results.},

This paper describe the findings of an exploratory study involving our Hermes Photo Display which has been extended to enable users with a suitable phone to both send and receive pictures over Bluetooth. We present both the technical challenges of working with Bluetooth and, through our user study, we present initial insights into general user acceptability issues and the potential for such a display to facilitate notions of community.},

Participants were asked to select a sound using a physical pointing gesture, with the help of a loudness cue, a timbre cue and an orientation update cue as well as with combinations of these cues. Display content was varied systematically to investigate the effect of increasing display population. Speed, accuracy and throughput ratings are provided as well as effective target widths that allow for minimal error rates. The results showed direct pointing to be the most efficient interaction technique; however large effective target widths reduce the applicability of this technique. Movement-coupled cues were found to significantly reduce display element size, but resulted in slower interaction and were affected by display content due to the requirement of continuous target attainment. The results show that, with appropriate design, it is possible to overcome interaction uncertainty and provide solutions that are effective in mobile human computer interaction.},

One of them provided a system where the user was required to use specific menu pages for navigation and where there were no cross-navigation enabling links on content pages. The other application had cross-navigation enabling links on content pages. The comparison was done by conducting a usability test with 30 test users. The users' performance and subjective feedback were measured in the test. The application with links hierarchically beneath each other on menu pages and having no cross-navigating links on content pages was considered better by the test users than the application with cross-navigation enabling links on content pages. In addition to their academic contribution, the study results can guide the development of current mobile banking services for the participating bank and the development of mobile application guidelines for the participating handset manufacturer. We also believe that the study results can be generalized over other mobile internet applications.},

It is no trivial issue to understand how such evaluation techniques could be modified or differently applied so as to better take into account context, without loosing the advantages inherent in those techniques. This paper explores a possible way of addressing the trade-off between application of cognitive walkthrough and low cost improvements of its contextual validity. In particular, we propose and investigate the benefits of supporting cognitive walkthrough with video data about user interaction with an eLearning course on mobile device. Initial results from this study indicated that video data provided evaluators with a more detailed understanding of user characteristics and interaction contexts, leading to an improvement of their assessments in terms of the total number of system's flaws detected. Video data was regarded by experts as both relevant and useful, especially for tuning the evaluation focus on types of difficulties they would normally not have experienced because of differences in terms of abilities, knowledge and background with those of the target user group.},

The methodology incorporates KSPC (KeyStrokes Per Character), checking for error recoverability and correctness. We also propose an error recovery measure - the mean error recovery distance (MERD). The methodology can be expanded to include additional evaluation measures and it is feasible to implement design-tool support.

abstract = {The effect of key size on text entry on a handheld device while walking and standing was examined in order to answer the following questions: 1) Will the additional workload of walking amplify the effect of input difficulty? and 2) Can walking speed be used as a secondary task measure of mental workload during mobile text entry? 13 participants (7 males and 6 females) input well known sayings (sentences) in English into a handheld device in each of four size conditions, with the text input box ranging in width between 2 and 5 millimetres (mm). Text input speed increased with larger size of text box up to a size of 3mm, and text input speed was faster when standing (vs. walking). The effect of size did not depend on whether participants were walking or standing. Errors were significantly higher for the 2mm size condition but did not vary for the wider sizes, while subjective ease of input increased with increasing input box width, only crossing the midpoint of the rating scale (i.e., more easy than difficult) at an input box width of 3mm. Based on these results it is recommended that a minimum text input box width of 3mm be used for handheld text input. Walking speed during text entry in this study was relatively low (with a mean of 1.77 km/h) but width of text input box had no additional effect on walking speed over and above the general slowing caused by text entry. Thus the answers to both of the main questions posed in this study were in the negative, although the fact that people had to enter text slowed walking speed by a fixed amount (independent of level of input difficulty) that varied between individuals. Implications for measuring workload in mobile text entry tasks are discussed.},

abstract = {The amount of data stored in personal digital devices increases rapidly as their memory capacities increase. These devices are usually equipped with relatively small displays, which makes presenting the information a challenge. We set out to explore the spatial design space for small screen user interfaces by incorporating additional dimensions into the visual representation, and investigate techniques that may be used to display more information at once. We focus on interactive visualization, with a document manager as a target application. We present the design factors and a simulated application running on a desktop computer. We also report a formative usability study with promising results.},

abstract = {In this article we present an application to navigate through a photo collection, using context. This application proposes two navigation schemes: physical and virtual navigation. Physical navigation permits the user to seamlessly access to photos that were taken near him. Virtual navigation permits the user to virtually explore the surroundings by jumping from one photo to another.This application relies on a definition of context which is based on a notion of proximity. Proximity can be determined according to one or several dimensions. For example, with this definition the user's context can be represented by the photos that were taken near him during a precise period like the Second World War. Such a context permits the user to physically navigate the photo collection nowadays and to get photos of the surroundings that were taken during another time period. Our application offers other services, such as temporal navigation to get different views of a place, route planing or virtually entering into closed buildings.},

Museums are a representative example in which the context influences interaction. During a museum visit, the visitors interact with the exhibits through mobile devices. We argue that, effective interaction design needs to take into consideration multiple dimensions of the context. Since context is often misinterpreted, superficially used or poorly defined, we attempt to analyze a number of existing mobile applications used in museum environments, through this perspective. The point of analysis is to evaluate those applications against various context dimensions. We argue that these results can be useful in other kinds of applications, in which the impact of context is not taken for granted.},

A study of current mobile phone use by teens (16-18) showed that, while they prefer communicating by Short Message Service (SMS), they miss expressiveness in this application. An enhanced SMS application, SenseMS, is designed to support affective communication. An evaluation of a SenseMS prototype has shown that enhancing text messages with contextual information and human embodiment can result in a more pleasant experience for both the sender and receiver. Especially for negative emotions, contextual and emotional information are essential for interpreting the message. The study also showed different usage scenarios, in that SenseMS is preferred for emotion-rich messages, whereas SMS is more appropriate for fast and emotion-poor messages.},

We are interested in re-designing a Smartphone's contact book to provide cues of the current situations of others. ContextContacts presents several meaningful, automatically communicated situation cues of trusted others. Its interaction design follows social psychological findings on how people make social attributions based on impoverished cues, on how self-disclosure of cues is progressively and interactionally managed, and on how mobility affects interaction through cues. We argue how our design choices support mobile communication decisions and group coordinations by promoting awareness. As a result, the design is very minimal and integrated, in an "unremarkable" manner, to previously learned usage patterns with the phone. First laboratory and field evaluations indicate important boundary conditions for and promising avenues toward more useful and enjoyable mobile awareness applications.},

abstract = {This paper describes a prototype application which enables the real-time monitoring and visualization of large Wide Area Networks (WANs) using smartphone devices. The techniques employed allow field engineers to rapidly gain access to a large information repository through the use of a camera equipped mobile phone. More specifically, the use of visual codes [11] attached to networking hardware and infrastructure cabling enables the real-time visualization of network traffic and statistics to be triggered by the capturing of images from a personal device. Moreover, the location and orientation of the phone are used as contextual parameters in order to control the specific information to be retrieved. The prototype described in this paper is currently under evaluation by Information Systems Services (ISS) which is responsible for network support across Lancaster University, the student residences network and also a large regional WAN spanning the whole of the North West of England. Our aim was to establish whether or not this user interaction technique could be harnessed for a real world application that would benefit field engineers who are responsible for maintaining a live production network interconnecting tens of thousands of hosts.},

Results show that while there was no significant difference in performance between tap-and-drag and touch-n-go, both techniques significantly outperformed scrollbars for simple, multi-directional navigation tasks. In addition, the users preferred the touch-n-go technique over the other two methods. The results also revealed that users' interactions and preferences differed between the levels of mobility.},

This paper reports on a field study in which we investigated user reaction to the use of digital image capture and recognition to support such functionality. Our results provide an insight into usage patterns and likely user reaction to mobile tour guides that use digital photography for real-time object recognition. These results include the counter-intuitive observation that a significant class of users appear happy to use image recognition even when this is a more complex, lengthy and error-prone process than traditional solutions. Careful analysis of user behavior during the field trails also provides evidence that it may be possible to classify tourists according to the methods by which they prefer to acquire information about tourist attractions in their vicinity. If shown to be generally true these results have important implications for designers of future mobile tour guide systems.},

However, the limitations of handheld terminals and the cognitive interference from the environment pose great challenges for user interaction. Naturalness and intelligence in communication between users and mobile guide applications are therefore crucial for the usability requirement. This article presents our efforts on the interaction design and evaluation of a hypermedia mobile tour guide system TGH. Users' cognitive behavior in mobile environment is characterized in a coherent psychology framework from the perspective of cognitive skill and attention interference. Correspondingly a context-sensitive multimodal interaction framework is proposed to describe the major components and data flow on the level of technology. Such interaction style is implemented in TGH and deployed into the context of authentic use to be tested. We discuss our techniques, interface facilities, and the result of user evaluations. The improvement of interaction efficiency and reduction of user efforts are measured.},

The Dialogue Process, an adaptive online survey, was used to elicit users' opinions of the factors affecting their choices in the current market of communication tools. Fourteen factors were identified; five have universal appeal, nine others depend on a user's circumstances. To analyze these factors, a heuristic evaluation of each tool was used to build "suitability maps" and to examine how user needs are met by today's tools individually, in pairs, and in aggregate. This work represents a first step toward future "bridge building.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for the pervasive sharing of data using wireless networks. 'FarCry' uses the mobility of users to carry files between separated networks. Through a mix of ad-hoc and infrastructure-based wireless networking, files are transferred between users without their direct involvement. As users move to different locations, files are then transmitted on to other users, spreading and sharing information. We examine three applications of this framework. Each of these exploits the physically proximate nature of social gatherings. As people group together in, for example, business meetings and caf\'{e}s, this can be taken as an indication of similar interests, e.g. in the same presentation or in a type of music. MediaNet affords sharing of media files between strangers or friends, MeetingNet shares business documents in meetings, and NewsNet shares RSS feeds between mobile users. NewsNet also develops the use of pre-emptive caching: collecting information from others not for oneself, but for the predicted later sharing with others. We offer observations on developing this system for a mobile, multi-user, multi-device environment.},

We propose a new mobile telecommunication style, called mobile `Tsunagari-Kan', where users exchange situational cues constantly and casually so they can imagine the situation of the other party. To make this possible, we must decrease users' mental workload caused by frequent communications. We considered that the mental workload could be decreased by exchanging situational cues casually to achieve true `always-on' communications. To link the `flip action' of a cell phone with a communicational behavior, we have developed a test system called the Flip Communicator System based on the Tsunagari-kan concept. This prototype system enables users to exchange situational cues on their cell phones. We carried out a communication field test between seven sets of Japanese mothers and their children. The results indicate that our method can strengthen the ties between a mother and a child.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel idea for a system known as Telelogs. Utilizing the ubiquity of mobile devices, Telelogs functions as a service by which individuals in an urban environment can establish a better sense of community awareness. In addition, this system could serve as a medium through which these individuals can communicate their thoughts and ideas with others within their environment. This would result in a better sense of community solidarity. Telelogs is targeted towards those persons in society that come across one another on a consistent basis but rather than establishing a direct line of communication, they maintain a relationship that could be characterized as one of courteous detachment. In other words, these individuals are known as familiar strangers. There is strong potential for this relationship to be augmented with a mediated communication space. Telelogs would act as a space through which individuals learn more about themselves while reciprocally gaining a better understanding of those persons present in their environment. Telelogs transfers the essence of the blog into an audio form as an extension for mobile devices. A first prototype of Telelogs is presented and accompanied by feedback after a demonstration. In addition, details of a first cell phone implementation follow.},

abstract = {We present a Wizard of Oz evaluation of dual--purpose speech, a technique designed to provide support during a face--to--face conversation by leveraging a user's conversational speech for input. With a dual--purpose speech interaction, the user's speech is meaningful in the context of a human--to--human conversation while providing useful input to a computer. For our experiment, we evaluate the ability to schedule appointments with our calendaring application, the Calendar Navigator Agent. We examine the relative difference between using speech for input compared to traditional pen input on a PDA. We found that speech is more direct and our participants can use their conversational speech for computer input. In doing so, we reduce the manual input needed to operate a PDA while engaged in a calendaring conversation.},

To meet this challenge, we present the system and hardware design for a Bluetooth-based personal-area network (PAN) of low-power wireless interfacing devices. The network consists of a wrist-watch, single-hand single-tap multi-finger keypad, smart speech portal, and GPS receiver. These devices serve a handheld in a synergistic fashion, collectively providing the user with immediate and more natural access to computing power and enabling more and better services.},

abstract = {Handwriting recognition (HWR) input method has been considered to be one of the most usable text entry methods for handheld devices, especially for languages with large and complicated character sets such as Chinese. The paper studies stroke break times within handwritten characters and presents a new method for setting HWR timeout by examining the break time distributions. For multi-stroke character HWR input, a timeout is widely used as a segmentation technique to initiate the recognition process. In this paper, we examine the largest stroke break time in each character and explore the relationship between break time distribution and optimal HWR timeout. The study used Chinese as test material and the test independent variables were writing condition (input box, full screen) and user's posture while they were writing (hold device in hand, keep device on table). The main findings are: (1) the stroke break times are similar in full screen and input box conditions, though the users tend to write larger characters in full screen condition. (2) The stroke break times fit into a tight distribution. It is feasible to estimate optimal HWR timeout by studying stoke break time distribution. A nonparametric histogram method was used to model the stroke break distributions and it showed that typical Chinese HWR default timeouts are around 99% percentile in the distribution. (3) Differences in HWR stroke break distributions are very significant between individual users. The stroke break time analysis can also be applied to design HWR timeout customization scale.},

abstract = {The context in which a device is used has a major impact on mobile device design. Despite this, there are few system design methods that assist user interface designers to represent use context in a useful and systematic manner throughout the whole design process. Current scenario-based design approaches are able to represent context, but still present a challenge to support a shared understanding of the rich context in which activities take place and in encoding dynamic use context due to time issues such as sequential and parallel actions. This paper reports on a method called Picture Scenarios. The method was used by four design teams whilst designing mobile information devices for use in a public square. Results show that picture scenarios provide an effective way of communicating and debating use context with design partners. The suggested format of the picture scenarios facilitates to represent use context during design activities in a systematic way. These scenarios are easy to create, easy to use, and capture important contextual details about activity that is difficult to represent otherwise.},

This is the first example of a completely handheld location- aware music player. We discuss scenarios for use of such systems.},

In addition, the user can view the building at different times in its past and literally see it morphing into its current state. Another interesting aspect of our prototype is that as the user moves the device the view they see on their mobile interface moves with them, thus allowing the user to experience the real and the virtual world at the same time.},

This paper presents five methods to select landmarks that are visually and semantically distinguishable and which are suited to lead the user to his/her goal.

abstract = {Recent development and proliferation of mobile devices, wireless communication, and sensor technologies have prompted a new vision of social interactions in the world in which we inhabit. For example, the number of mobile phones that are capable of capturing users' spontaneous life experiences not only in pictures but also in audio and video clips is on the increase. In addition, captured experiences can be sent and shared with others over wireless networks such as WiFi, GSM, GPRS, EDGE, or recently commenced third-generation (3G) protocols. Other technology trends such as weblog and peer-to-peer communication provide a ubiquitous platform and a model of motivating users to share life experiences with other people. The hypothesis is that everyone can be an owner of a weblog which records their experience about place, people, and things that interest them. Initial form of peer-to-peer communication, centralized directory service, can help authors of weblogs attain widespread of popularity and increase the level of participation in this type of interaction. The convergence of these technologies provides new design opportunities for computer-mediated communications. The aim of this paper is to share our experiences in designing and implementing a novel physical prototype which incorporates peer-to-peer communication, weblog, RFID, wireless networking, and mobile phone technologies to enhance social quality of shared life experience.},

Inertial sensors, however, have two fundamental limitations; the frame of reference is not the user but the earth, and drifting errors are difficult to overcome. A possibly better solution, free from such limitations, is machine vision. Machine vision was a luxury for small computers but is becoming a practical solution because a camera is now a common component of small computers and the required vision algorithm is already running in optical mice. The vision algorithm of our prototype, which we called ISeeU, tracks simple features in the user's face and calculates lateral displacements and changes in distance, which in turn are used to control scrolling and zooming. An informal test with scrolling tasks indicates that its performance is comparable with a user interface using arrow keys.},

The accelerometer is one of the most widely used sensors for capturing context because it is small, inexpensive, lightweight, and self-operable. In efforts to obtain behavioral patterns, many studies have reported the use of multiple accelerometers attached to the human body. However, this is difficult to implement in real-life situations and may not fully address the context of user interaction. In contrast, the present study employed a single tri-axial accelerometer attached to a handheld computing device instead of to a user. The objective was to determine what contextual information could be obtained from this more feasible, albeit limited, source of acceleration data. Data analyses confirmed that changes in both mobility and lighting conditions induced statistically significant differences in the output of the accelerometer.},

This tells that the user interface in mobile phones inevitably confronts cultural difference as much as other products and consequently the user interface suited to each cultural trait is required. To clarify the relation between cultural traits and mobile phone interface, UI elements which would be influenced by cultural traits in interaction between user and mobile phone were extracted and hypotheses related to the UI elements were proposed. For a pilot study, 20 subjects (10 subjects each from America and Korea) participated in the icon recognition test. The test parameters were task completion time, recognition rate, preference. The results show that Korean subjects performed significantly better in the set of concrete icons while American counterparts showed quite the opposite tendencies. No significant differences in preference according to icon style were found. The results suggest a possibility of cultural impact on icon recognition according to the level of abstraction.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the experience of designing a collaborative learning activity for a traditional historical/cultural museum. The activity, based on a "Mystery in the Museum" story, involves collaboration of small groups of students through mobile handheld devices. An application has been built that permits authoring of such activities, while a usability evaluation study was performed that revealed some of the limitations of the design. The reported findings can be of use to those interested in following similar approaches in cultural and educational settings, and draw conclusions of general interest relating to interaction and collaboration through mobile technology.},

Results indicate that the joystick control provided the fastest completion times for each game, but with the lowest levels of user engagement. The Tilt interface, although perceived as challenging by the participants, provided the greatest level of user involvement, independent of game complexity. The design of appropriate human interfaces which go beyond the standard phone keypad is suggested.},

The key factor in this system is the construction of a relationship between the user and the agent, and to carry on this relationship between the user and the object that the agent has migrated to. Psychological experiments were carried out to verify this succession of the relationship between media. The results of the experiments showed that the subjects' attachment to the media as well as the relationship was succeeded through the media by the agent migration.},

The proposed method uses a reversible display system and reverse operations for content browsing. The reversible display system is constructed with two displays. One is on the front surface and the other is on the back. Both displays show digital content. The user can view either display by simply reversing the screen. Our method uses the reverse directions, turn forward, turn backward, turn left or turn right, to change the displayed area. For example, when users read a map showing their current location on one display, the area to the north of the current location can be viewed by turning the display forward. When reading digital books, users can see the next page by turning the display to the right, and the previous page by turning it to the left. Our method is suitable for use in the mobile computing environment because people can browse contents with it while walking, looking around, and doing other activities.},

abstract = {This fourth workshop in the series of workshops on 'HCI in Mobile Guides' once again aims to bring together both researchers and practitioners who develop and evaluate mobile guides, i.e. systems designed to guide a user who is moving in a physical environment by giving directions and supplying relevant information and access to services via some form of mobile device. Application examples of mobile guides include: mobile tourism services, museum/exhibition guides, support for building communities and context-aware directory services. The particular focus of this workshop is on establishing guidelines for fostering the development of usable mobile guide systems based on practical experience and evaluations. Following review by the program committee, accepted papers will be presented and discussed at the workshop.},

The emphasis is on developing both intuitive and formal knowledge that can serve as background knowledge which will be useful in interpreting design guidelines and in making educated design judgments when design guidelines fail, conflict, or are nonexistent. The demonstrations used emphasize basic general phenomena with which any theory of memory must deal. In addition, the tutorial suggests some of the implications of these phenomena for designing interactive computing systems.},

abstract = {Diverse social applications rely on remote location of personal devices: house arrest tracker systems, remote monitoring of alcoholic persons, child locator devices and remote protection of victims of domestic abuse are some examples. However, existing personal location devices either depend on a fixed station (a domestic gateway) -thus limiting user mobility-, or include a full cell phone -thus increasing weight, cost and power consumption-. In this demonstration, we present a new system we have developed for the Galician regional government (Spain) to track domestic abusers and their victims. It consists of two units, namely a personal low-cost light microdevice (bracelet in the sequel) and a commercial cell phone. The latter acts as a mobile gateway, which the bracelet accesses via a PAN. By doing so, we benefit from the advantages of the two previous approaches: the small size of bracelets for fixed gateways and the full mobility of those including a full cell phone. Wide-area location capability may reside either in the bracelet (as a GPS modem) or in the mobile gateway (either as a GPS modem or via core network-assisted location). If the bracelet leaves mobile gateway PAN range, the latter alerts the user and/or sends an alarm to a remote monitoring station.},

The system offers technology of outdoors vision based object recognition that will extend state-of-the-art location and context aware services towards object based awareness in urban environments. In the proposed application scenario, tourist pedestrians are equipped with a GPRS or UMTS capable camera-phone. They are interested whether their field of view contains tourist sights that would point to more detailed information. Multimedia type data about related history might be explored by a mobile user who is intending to learn within the urban environment. Ambient learning is in this way achieved by pointing the device towards an urban sight, capturing an image, and consequently getting information about the object on site and within the focus of attention, i.e., the user's current field of view. The described mobile system offers multiple opportunities for application in both mobile business and commerce, and is currently developed as an industrial prototype.},

abstract = {The latest development in the concept of Mobile Presence within the mobile industry and HCI/UI community has promised yet another drastic change in the way we communicate with one other and lead our every-day lives. When Presence was limited to the Instant Messaging (IM) space, users could only know the status of others while they were at the computer (e.g. busy, away, etc). In contrast, mobile devices can be carried around at any time with their owner, so this discreet method of communicating is taking an interesting turn. Mobile Presence is much more ambitious: it could let others know your preferred method of communication based on your device's offerings (e.g. SMS, voice call, IM, video telephony, or even Push-to-Talk), alert you to where your friends are located at this moment, sense what mood others are in (thus whether it's appropriate to contact them at all), or even allow you to view a video clip broadcasting someone's profile before you attempt to contact them. In a perfect world, Presence will guarantee the most timely, convenient and appropriate communication at anytime, anywhere, to anyone in your "buddy list." But what's behind all these promises? Do you feel creepy being watched by others even if they are your friends and family? What if the government or any kind of "Big Brother" can easily sneak a look at presence information? Where do we see the fine line between the benefits of presence and invasion of privacy? How can we in the Mobile HCI community help shaping the future of Mobile Presence? In this panel, we discuss the factors to be considered for the design of mobile presence.},
