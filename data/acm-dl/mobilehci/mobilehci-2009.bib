abstract = {Speech and typed text are two common input modalities for mobile phones. However, little research has compared them in their ability to support annotation and retrieval of digital pictures on mobile devices. In this paper, we report the results of a month-long field study in which participants took pictures with their camera phones and had the choice of adding annotations using speech, typed text, or both. Subsequently, the same subjects participated in a controlled experiment where they were asked to retrieve images based on annotations as well as retrieve annotations based on images in order to study the ability of each modality to effectively support users' recall of the previously captured pictures. Results demonstrate that each modality has advantages and shortcomings for the production of tags and retrieval of pictures. Several guidelines are suggested when designing tagging applications for portable devices.},

abstract = {SenseCam is an automatic wearable camera, often seen as a tool for the creation of digital memories. In this paper, we report findings from a field trial in which SenseCams were worn by household members over the course of a week. In interviews with these users, it became apparent that the way in which SenseCam images were played back, the manner of which might be described as a stilted movie, affected the values that were realised within them. The time-lapse nature of the image stream led participants to romanticise the mundane and find sentimentality in unexpected places, and was particularly effective at portraying personality and play. In so doing, SenseCam images enlivened the visual recording of everyday scenes. These values influenced what the participants sought to capture and view, and have implications for technologies that might support lifelogging or the development of user-generated content.},

This enables rich 3D input, comprising coarse movement-based gestures, as well as static position-based gestures. ADI can help to solve occlusion problems and scales down to very small devices. We present a novel around-device interaction interface that allows mobile devices to track coarse hand gestures performed above the device's screen. Our prototype uses infrared proximity sensors to track hand and finger positions in the device's proximity. We present an algorithm for detecting hand gestures and provide a rough overview of the design space of ADI-based interfaces.},

abstract = {Interaction patterns with handheld mobile devices are constantly evolving. Researchers observed that users prefer to interact with mobile device using one hand. However, only few interaction techniques support this mode of operation. We show that one-handed operations can be enhanced with coordinated interaction using for input the front and back of a mobile device, which we term as Dual-Surface interaction. We present some of the design rationale for introducing coordinated Dual-Surface interactions. We demonstrate that several tasks, including target selection, benefit from Dual-Surface input which allows users to rapidly select small targets in locations that are less accessible when interacting using the thumb with one-handed input. Furthermore, we demonstrate the benefits of virtual enhancements that are possible with behind-the-display relative input to perform complex tasks, such as steering. Our results show that Dual-Surface interactions offer numerous benefits that are not available with input on the front or the back alone.},

We explore d position and velocity control cursor mechanisms in both static and mobile situations to see which provided the best level of performance. Results show that participants could successfully acquire targets using head tilting. Position control was shown to be si gnificantly faster and more accurate in a static context, but exhi bited significantly poorer accuracy and longer target acquisition times when the user was on the move. We further demonstrate how analysis of user's gait shows consistent targeting biases at different stages in the gait cycle.},

In selecting a suggestion, users can potentially reduce keystrokes, which can be very beneficial on mobile devices with deficient input means. Unfortunately, RTQE interfaces typically provide little assistance when only parts of an intended query appear among the suggestion choices. In this paper, we introduce Phrase Builder, an RTQE interface that reduces keystrokes by facilitating the selection of individual query words and by leveraging back-off query techniques to offer completions for out-of-index queries. We describe how we implemented a small memory footprint index and retrieval algorithm, and discuss lessons learned from three versions of the user interface, which was iteratively designed through user studies. Compared to standard auto-completion and typing, the last version of Phrase Builder reduced more keystrokes-per-character, was perceived to be faster, and was overall preferred by users.},

Results showed that Quick Release was the fastest for input of mixed case text with Dwell being the most accurate, even when users were mobile. The results demonstrate that pressure input can outperform a standard shift-key keyboard design for mobile text entry.},

The design arranges a plurality of labels on the interface, each of which has an identity. The user forms a coupling by linking two graphical items together, and thus performs an action dependent on the identities of the coupled items. During the course of operation, any item on the screen is ready for linking and coupling. To reduce mal-operations, two principles for linking are proposed, with their effectiveness proved in the usability tests. Compared with traditional systems with hierarchical menu structure and point-and-click interaction, the proposed design prominently improves the efficiency and accuracy of pen-based systems with enhanced usability.},

For example, Apple iPhone proposed "Pinch" operation, which use two fingers to zoom-in and zoom-out objects. However, in a today's hand-held situation, manipulation methods using two fingers are not always good solution because they require two hands in order to hold the device itself in most cases. We propose a single-handed UI scheme "GraspZoom": multi-state input model using pressure sensing. Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) attached on backside of a mobile phone was employed in order to evaluate effectiveness of pressure based control model. We also describe example applications which enable intuitive and continuous zooming and scrolling. By using tiny thumb gesture input along with this pressure sensing method, bi-directional operations (e.g., zoom-in and -out) are also achieved.},

Natural environments differ significantly from built environments in a number of ways including, for example, the degree of structure and regularity, the types and density of landmarks, and the way in which people navigate in those environments. In this paper, we investigate how people currently navigate 'in the wild', and whether landmark-based navigation support through mobile devices is a feasible option in such settings. We present results from two studies: a questionnaire-based study focussing on current practice and the use of landmarks, and a qualitative lab-based study using immersive panoramic photographs and photographs of (natural) landmarks investigating the feasibility of landmark-based navigation support in natural environments. The results indicate that a small number of means are currently used for navigation in the wild, and that certain types of landmarks might be feasible for navigation support on mobile devices. We also found initial evidence that immersive panoramic photographs may constitute a promising way to evaluate mobile applications.},

abstract = {In many mid- to large-sized cities public maps are ubiquitous. One can also find a great number of maps in parks or near hiking trails. Public maps help to facilitate orientation and provide special information to not only tourists but also to locals who just want to look up an unfamiliar place while on the go. These maps offer many advantages compared to mobile maps from services like Google Maps Mobile or Nokia Maps. They often show local landmarks and sights that are not shown on standard digital maps. Often these 'You are here' (YAH) maps are adapted to a special use case, e.g. a zoo map or a hiking map of a certain area. Being designed for a fashioned purpose these maps are often aesthetically well designed and their usage is therefore more pleasant. In this paper we present a novel technique and application called PhotoMap that uses images of 'You are here' maps taken with a GPS-enhanced mobile camera phone as background maps for on-the-fly navigation tasks. We discuss different implementations of the main challenge, namely helping the user to properly georeference the taken image with sufficient accuracy to support pedestrian navigation tasks. We present a study that discusses the suitability of various public maps for this task and we evaluate if these georeferenced photos can be used for navigation on GPS-enabled devices.},

We base our investigation on uWave, a state-of-the-art recognition system for user-created free-space manipulation, or gestures. Our user studies address two types of user authentication: non-critical authentication (or identification) for a user to retrieve privacy-insensitive data; and critical authentication for protecting privacy-sensitive data. For non-critical authentication, our evaluation shows that uWave achieves high recognition accuracy (98%) and its usability is comparable with text ID-based authentication. Our results also highlight the importance of constraints for users to select their gestures. For critical authentication, the evaluation shows uWave achieves state-of-the-art resilience to attacks with 3% false positives and 3% false negatives, or 3% equal error rate. We also show that the equal error rate increases to 10% if the attackers see the users performing their gestures. This shows the limitation of gesture-based authentication and highlights the need for visual concealment.},

However, it is not easy to design useful integrated mobile services without a systematic understanding of users, and this is especially true for children. Therefore, we propose a new theoretical perspective for generating design concepts in the early stage of the design process. Our ecological model is based on Ecological Systems Theory which approaches development in terms of the child's relationships and environmental context. It leverages the fact that mobile technologies are deeply involved with users' circumstances. We argue that the ecological model can provide a heuristic to help researchers understand users' needs in context and generate concepts logically and creatively. Here we explore pediatric asthma management as a case study for this model. Finally, five promising mobile technology concepts are provided as examples for further development of mobile technologies related to pediatric asthma management.},

Furthermore, we see the integration of web browsing and email functionalities in these devices, which are then often controlled via a wireless mouse and keyboard. The latter were rather designed for the usage on a desk, rather then by a person sitting on their sofa in a living room. Therefore, this paper investigates the usage of a PDA, as a replacement which can be used for controlling a remote cursor and for text input. The results of the experimental comparison of these input devices show, as expected, the superiority of mouse and keyboard (as the study participants were very experienced with them). Surprising results were the task completion time and usability satisfaction when using the mobile device. These results show the applicability of using a mobile device for controlling an application on a remote screen. Using a mobile device provides the advantages that every person can e.g. use their own mobile phone or that these devices can be used in multi-user scenarios.},

abstract = {Mobile interaction design introduces added challenges when compared with the usual design process for fixed technologies. In particular, it benefits greatly from the ability to take the design process out of the lab, creating, designing and evaluating applications within their natural usage context. However, this process requires new and deeply refined approaches to traditional techniques which are demanding and still avoided by designers. This paper presents a tool that overcomes some of these issues by offering means to support in-situ design. The tool supports prototyping of mobile applications and user interfaces on real scenarios, also providing evaluation features that allow the logging and analysis of usage information. We describe the tool's concept, goals and design implications, focusing, in particular, its out-on-the-field, in-situ design and prototyping features.},

To understand the cyclists' experiences questionnaires, interviews and observations are drawn on to derive eight lessons for designing cycle-based interaction including: cycling proficiency, physicality, impact of the environment, media and hardware design, collaboration, and safety. The conclusion is that design has to respect the distinctive nature of cycling as a mode of transport and needs to carefully interweave moments of interaction with it.},

To ensure road safety, the drivers' visual attention needs to be focused almost entirely to the road. In order to integrate touch screens successfully into cars, new concepts are needed to reduce visual demand. The adaptation of pie menus serving as a visualisation of gestures reduces the user's cognitive load, and we were able to achieve an almost blind interaction with the IVIS. We compared our design to a generic touch system using a dual task evaluation method (Lane Change Task [18][20]), and the results regarding total task completion time, lane deviation and subjective preferences confirm a higher usability and efficiency, as well as an added hedonic quality of pieTouch.},

A well-known issue is interpreting the map's geocentric content, which is known to become prone to errors when the map is not aligned to the environment. In this paper we report our investigation of providing a cue about the destination's location from an egocentric perspective in order to improve the interpretation of the map. We used a vibrotactile belt to continuously indicate a destination's direction relative to the user's orientation. In an outdoor field study we compared the performance of map-based navigation with and without the added tactile cue. We found evidence that people take shorter routes, consult the map less often, and were less often disoriented with the tactile cue. Furthermore, females found the tactile cue more useful and used it more often.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the design and ethnographic study of a phone developed so as to allow people to glance at each other, rather than simply message or voice call. Glancephones work through having a form factor that allows them to be placed upright when a user wants to be available for glancing, and support a web-based application that allows glances, bitmap images, to be taken and sent to a remote viewer on request, via GPRS connections. Glancephones were originally invented to allow callers to see if it is appropriate to call or interrupt and thus act like normal glances in face-to-face situations. Ethnographic studies of the use indicate that people prefer using the devices not to support greeting sequences, however, but to enable others to glance at them. It was found that Glacephones were used to draw attention to oneself, not to encourage better control of interruption and greeting sequences. The paper uses this data to remark on the concepts of human expression that underscore much of the research reported in Mobile HCI, and it proposes Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and relatedly, distinction, as explanatory tools for this and other evidence about expression enabled by mobile and other technologies of communication.},

If the pervasive game does not support the children with an adequate multi-user setting, unintended situations can emerge, such as a single user can dominate the game while the other users are bored and disinterested. In our research we approach that problem by investigating various multi-user settings that are characterized by a different distribution of interaction devices. We describe three multi-user settings, a pervasive game which we used as a test bed, and a user study with 18 children to find out how the multiuser settings influence the children's social behaviour as expressed by the level of activity for all group members, the off-task behaviour and the level of task-related conversations.},

Especially in mobile communication, the haptic modality could provide a means for richer multimodal and emotional communication between users over distance. Haptic user interface prototypes have been developed but their user experience has not been studied extensively. We conducted seven focus group sessions to study users' expectations for user experience of haptic interaction, specifically focusing on mobile communication. The paper presents the user experience factors that were regarded by potential users as salient in haptic interaction: subjective quality of the haptic stimuli, privacy, intimacy and spontaneity. Also the possibilities, restrictions and suitability of the haptic mobile communication are discussed. Most appropriate use cases for haptic communication were found to be conveying emotions and binary information. As the main conclusion, we present design guidelines for haptic mobile communication that were drawn up based on the findings.},

We show that by using these melodies information about the current emotional state of the sender can be expressed and recognized synchronously by the receiver in a simple, quick, and unobtrusive way. Further, we reveal that self-composed melodies have a stronger impact than pre-composed or downloaded messages, similar to crafted pieces of art offered to a beloved person. We then present findings from a user study that assesses the implementation of a functional prototype and the adequacy of the system for emotional communication.},

We focus on allowing users to manage their music for easier mobile access. We present a novel bimanual interaction method for mapping items from a music library into different orientations of the mobile device. An experiment was conducted to test our prototype, focusing on efficiency and impact on users' ability to recall locations of items in the mapping. The interaction method was found to be significantly faster than using a touch screen without the mobile device. Subjectively users valued the bimanual method in ease of use, efficiency, and pleasantness.},

Mobile TV found a role in the everyday lives of the users as an extension to ordinary TV. The users appreciated easy and continuous access to TV contents. The results highlight that short usage situations typical to mobile TV use are hindering the adoption of new add-on services. The adoption can be supported by using content, appearance or functionality familiar from other media. The main problems with add-on services were related to knowing about the mere existence of these services and their contents as well as understanding the concept of services available only during a certain TV show.},

We show how a characteristic feature of mobile video telephony, which makes it differ from any other kind of mediated interaction, is that: a) the participants may orient the camera at will to shoot almost any feature within their environment; and b) what they actually show at a given moment may be (and usually is) inspected by the recipient for its relevance to the ongoing interaction, and is produced with an orientation towards such scrutiny. A specific concern of mobile video call users at any time is therefore what they should or should not show. We demonstrate how a partial solution to that problem is the reliance on a particular (full) portrait-like 'talking heads' format as an expected default mode for interaction in mobile video calls. Finally, we discuss the implications, for design, of such an empirically grounded understanding of the specific practical concerns of mobile video telephony users.},

Using touch &amp; connect, the user can physically touch a computer in order to pair a Bluetooth connection and initiate a file transfer between these two devices. Touch &amp; select extends this concept in that users can select a specific object or location on the computer screen by simply touching it with the mobile phone. We report the implementation of these interaction techniques based on Near Field Communication (NFC) tags and present a formal, comparative study focusing on transferring images. The results provide clear evidence of the advantages of touch &amp; connect and touch &amp; select when compared with current Bluetooth-based implementations. Considering task completion time for uploading and downloading pictures, touch &amp; select was 43% and touch &amp; connect 31% faster than the conventional Bluetooth-based approach.},

abstract = {NFC and RFID technologies have found their way into current mobile phones and research has presented a variety of applications using NFC/RFID tags for interaction between physical objects and mobile devices. Since this type of interaction is widely novel for most users, there is a considerable initial inhibition threshold for them. In order to get novice users started with this physical interaction and its applications, we have designed different ways to increase the learnability and guidance of such applications. Their effectiveness was evaluated in a qualitative and quantitative user study with 40 participants, who interacted with NFC-equipped posters in different ways. We report on the types of usage errors observed and show that future designs of NFC/RFID-based mobile applications should consider using a dedicated start-tag for interaction.},

abstract = {We conducted a user study to investigate the effect of visual context in handheld augmented reality interfaces. A dynamic peephole interface (without visual context beyond the device display) was compared to a magic lens interface (with video see-through augmentation of external visual context). The task was to explore objects on a map and look for a specific attribute shown on the display. We tested different sizes of visual context as well as different numbers of items per area, i.e. different item densities. We found that visual context is most effective for sparse item distributions and the performance benefit decreases with increasing density. User performance in the magic lens case approaches the performance of the dynamic peephole case the more densely spaced the items are. In all conditions, subjective feedback indicates that participants generally prefer visual context over the lack thereof. The insights gained from this study are relevant for designers of mobile AR and dynamic peephole interfaces by suggesting when external visual context is most beneficial.},

This paper presents the prototypes (and respective implementation details) of the touch &amp; connect and touch &amp; select interaction techniques. Both techniques allow the quick and easy exchange of pictures by touching the computer with the mobile device. The first interaction technique: touch &amp; connect, allows the user to touch a computer with their mobile phone in order to establish a Bluetooth connection and initiate a file transfer between the two devices. The second interaction technique: touch &amp; select, extends this concept and allows the selection of a specific picture or location on the computer screen by touching it with the mobile phone.

abstract = {Cycling is a common leisure time sports in touristic regions. For us it was the question how tourists actually find their paths in the area and what kind of navigation aids might be helpful to them. In a requirements study on a touristic island we learned that tourists rather explore the environment spontaneously than efficiently navigating from on place to another such as the beach or the light house, and just cycle on without much map or navigation aid. While exploring the area, the cyclists however, sometimes lose their orientation which they compensate for by accepting detours. We designed and developed an orientation aid, Tacticycle that does not influence the cycling experience but improve the orientation and awareness of the overall direction. In order to ensure the cyclists' safety two vibrotactile actuators are used to indicate directions and announce the presence of interesting places. In two field studies we showed that despite the accuracy of the indicated direction being rather coarse, the tactile user interface allows cyclists to reach a presented destination easily. The visitor of the demo can experience a virtual cycling tour supported by the Tacticycle demonstrator.},

Similarly, sharing a single image with a single person is cumbersome and requires several steps to complete. This demonstration paper presents an approach in which a mobile phone is coupled with a personal projector to overcome the output limitations of mobile phones. The large mobile projected display allows several users to simultaneously view media. We also present a group based sharing approach allowing users to intuitively and easily share media between mobile devices. We reverse the typical role of sharing and introduce a technique whereby the receiver of the media is responsible for performing the sharing interaction. This allows sharing with a single member or multiple members of the group. Sharing with every member of the group is also easily possible.},

We conduct a home-use test for one week to evaluate the efficiency of customization and the usability of menu customization. The results show that the average rank of used functions on the last day of the test is half of that of first day and almost 70 % of the users are satisfied with the ranking provided by menu customization and the usability of menus. In addition, interviews show that automatic mobile menu customization is more appropriate for mobile phone beginner rather than the master users.},

abstract = {Although marginalised young people have been proved to have less access to Information and Communication Technologies such as the Internet, their access to mobile phones does not differ from non-marginalised young people. Since mobile phones seem to play an important role in youth's life, delivering learning programmes via this piece of technology seems a promising idea. Thereby, to analyse the requirement of the future users of learning programmes to be designed is fundamental since little about their characteristics and needs is known. A triangulation of data, consisting of academic literature review, expert interview data and focus group data, led to valuable conclusions.},

We compared immediate user performance of four touch Chinese text entry solutions on mobile devices including two Chinese handwriting recognition (HWR: full screen and 3-box) and two pinyin virtual keyboard (VKB: consonant plus vowel and QWERTY) solutions with novice users. It was found that users make more errors with Chinese HWR solutions than VKB solutions although there are no significant differences between the two solutions in each category. Users are significantly slower with the consonant plus vowel pinyin keyboard than the other three solutions although the consonant plus vowel keyboard is better on the measure of key stroke per character (KSPC).},

In contrast to the conventional keypad which enables limited operability to four discrete directions, the proposed controller brings not only an unconstrained continuous input to arbitrary directions but also continuous input for depth and for a rotation angle. In order to evaluate operability, we conducted a user experiment of time trial for path tracing, and the results showed that the subjects completed the task with the proposed controller in 27.9% less than with the conventional keypad input.},

These decisions are based on the social and public settings where these devices are used on a daily basis. Our ideas about which gestures are socially acceptable or not are an important factor in whether or not these gestures will be adopted. The ways in which users evaluate social acceptability is not only highly variable, but with drastically different results amongst different users. These differences are not dependant on factors such as age, gender, occupation, geographic location, or previous technology usage. Future work into the social acceptability perceptions of users will focus on personality traits as a new way of understanding how social acceptability is determined.},

One important class of networked, mobile applications are location based games, making extensive use of device sensors to adapt their application logic and user interface to the numerous, spontaneous and fast changing contexts. To simplify the developers' task of designing adaptable user interfaces, we propose the use of semantic user interface description. By going beyond formbased applications, we argue that the approach comes especially at hand when used in the context of modular reconfigurable mobile games: The interfaces fusion can simplify the generation of complex adaptable game UIs and form an integral aspect of a mobile game development kit.},

abstract = {Browsing the Web on mobile phones has finally hit the mass. The visualization of websites on latest mobile phone models comes close to what we are used from desktop computers. Tailoring websites for mobile phones seems to be not mandatory anymore. But still the small display size limits the user experience when browsing the web on these devices. As a result although access to the full web is reasonably well working a tendency to providing additional versions of mobile optimized versions of websites can be observed. This paper presents a multidimensional study where usage scenarios as well as the usability of mobile tailored compared to full websites were investigated. The results show clearly that users prefer and effectively do benefit from mobile optimized versions. However content providers sometimes do not understand the mobile scenarios in which their sites are used and consequently begin optimizing the functionality at the wrong end.},

We introduce entertaining and inspiring community notes that convey emotional messages from other sportsmen who exercise on the same track. The design and evaluation of Mobota provides an insight into the specifics of visual and auditory design of running assistants.},

abstract = {Evaluating the user experience of mobile and ubiquitous applications is a challenging task. They are becoming increasingly complex and tightly interwoven into the fabric of everyday life and thus cannot easily be taken out of context and evaluated in controlled experimental environments. Methods for studying the user experience of such applications in the field tend to be cumbersome and expensive with regard to time and manpower, and they generally do not scale well with number of users and duration of studies. RECON addresses these challenges and provides an addition to the methodological and practical toolbox from which researchers and practitioners can draw when conducting field experiments. It facilitates automated capture of general usage and application specific interaction augmented with information about the context in which it occurs. RECON enables researchers and practitioners to conduct large scale remote studies of mobile and ubiquitous applications in real contexts.},

abstract = {Older adults often struggle with everyday technology which is not designed to accommodate their special needs and adapted to their specific cognitive, sensory and motor abilities. Recently, a new generation of mobile devices has been equipped with multitouch and acceleration sensors that allow for novel ways of interacting with these devices. Interaction occurs through gestures, such as finger movements on the device surface or movement patterns of the device itself, which trigger the device functions. It remains unclear, however, whether this gesture-based interaction indeed facilitates technology interaction, especially with regard to elderly users, or whether it further decreases accessibility and usability of such devices for this user group. In the present study we compare younger and older users on a set of 42 simple gestures with varying complexity and available gesture space regarding accuracy and velocity scales. Results indicate that older users are slower, but not necessarily less accurate, and that further factors such as familiarity can influence gesture performance differentially for older and younger users.},

It is an extension of a lo-fi version of the well-established Wizard of Oz technique, but it adds an "on demand" component to force users to explicitly request the information they need. The technique has been tested in an investigation involving 15 users (sighted, visually impaired, and elderly). Our preliminary results show it to generate valuable information concerning the ways people ask about directions and distances, as well as the services they would like to have in future mobile applications.},

abstract = {The goal of this research is the establishment of a usable and accessible mobile learning system for the inclusion of both blind and vision-impaired students within mainstream education through independent, collaborative and ubiquitous mobile learning environments. An essential component of this work is the enhancement of the field to enable all students to work successfully together despite vision disabilities for the achievement of a learning outcome.Given the advancements in mobile technologies, and the personal nature of mobile devices, there is a lot to be gained, especially for the vision-impaired, by harnessing new technologies for education. Some technological advances can increase the divide between such students and their fully sighted peers. However the incorporation of technologies such as the accelerometer, now standard within many modern mobile phones, provides an opportunity to develop new inclusive mobile learning applications.The accelerometer could enable us to present a visionimpaired student with the capability to successfully play and interact directly with their fully sighted peers within a collaborative game to achieve a single outcome. This could be achieved without the heavy reliance on visual interfaces that were a necessary part of earlier mLearning models. The student would interact with the game through specific movements of their mobile handheld device. The device, for example, would be moved in one direction to give a specific command, while tilting and shaking the device would be used to command separate specific functions of the game. The student's interaction through the accelerometer could be enhanced through the provision of both haptic and audio feedback as they twist and tilt the handheld mobile device to interact with a learning game, removing altogether the need for the incorporation of a visual interface. The incorporation of wireless technologies such as Bluetooth, would allow for the provision of a collaborative environment for mobile learning, allowing all students to communicate via their handheld device, regardless of the disabilities faced by individual learners.Providing the ability to create an engaging, level playing field for such students could reduce the digital divide currently in existence for the future success of mobile learning environments.},

The biggest potential of future mobile development will not be in the already saturated 1st economy market but in the market of about one billion potential mobile users in emerging economies. In contrast to the impressive rise of mobile phone usage, the mobile services and applications provided for this new market are far behind expectations. Due to infrastructural (low, erratic and expensive bandwidth, low end devices) and social (illiteracy, novice ICT users) impediments a copy&amp;paste approach of well known application and architecture concepts from the 1st economy will not work. My research goal is the development of a Mobile Application Framework (MAF) containing guidelines, concepts, and best practices to provide novice IT users in rural areas of emerging economies with the most appropriate access to ICT according to the infrastructural and cultural impediments.},

abstract = {In this workshop we are interested in usability, context and user practices related to uses of social mobile media for sharing human experiences. There is a growing trend pointing to life publishing and life logging using mobile devices. Users are sharing their experiences and their life with friends in real-time by posting blog notes, images and video clips from their phones to social media services. In addition, people are tagging content either by manually or using sensory data with their phones. An interesting question to be asked is; How users are experiencing these applications and what issues make them to be successfully adopted? This workshop will offer an interdisciplinary discussion forum for both practitioners and academics interested in conceptualizing, designing and evaluating emerging social mobile media concepts and applications. The workshop, through a series of interactive presentations, will facilitate discussions aiming at identify and summarize main theoretical and interaction design concerns related to the increasing use of social mobile media in a variety of settings. The main goal of the workshop is to find out ideas that suggest promising directions for future research on social mobile media.},

One of our major goals for SiMPE 2009 is to increase the participation of speech/multimodal HCI designers, and increase their interactions with speech processing experts.Multimodality got more attention in SiMPE 2008 than it has received in the previous years. In SiMPE 2007 [3], the focus was on developing regions. Given the importance of speech in developing regions, SiMPE 2008 had "SiMPE for developing regions" as a topic of interest. We think of this as a key emerging area for mobile speech applications, and will continue this in 2009 as well.},
