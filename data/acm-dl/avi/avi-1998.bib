abstract = {A revolution in computer interface design is changing the way we think about computers. Rather than typing on a keyboard and watching a television monitor, Augmented Reality lets people use familiar, everyday objects in ordinary ways. The difference is that these objects also provide a link into a computer network. Doctors can examine patients while viewing superimposed medical images; children can program their own LEGO constructions; construction engineers can use ordinary paper engineering drawings to communicate with distant colleagues. Rather than immersing people in an artificially-created virtual world, the goal is to augment objects in the physical world by enhancing them with a wealth of digital information and communication capabilities.},

abstract = {Although existing lab-based formative evaluation is frequently and effectively applied to improving usability of software user interfaces, it has limitations that have led to the concept of remote usability evaluation. Perhaps the most significant impetus for remote usability evaluation methods is the need for a project team to continue formative evaluation downstream, after deployment.The usual kinds of alpha and beta testing do not qualify as formative usability evaluation because they do not yield detailed data observed during usage and associated closely with specific task performance. Critical incident identification is arguably the single most important source of this kind of data. Consequently, we developed and evaluated a cost-effective remote usability evaluation method, based on real users self-reporting critical incidents encountered in real tasks performed in their normal working environments. Results show that users with only brief training can identify, report, and rate the severity level of their own critical incidents.},

abstract = {In the area of human computer interaction, over the last twenty years, we have witnessed considerable progress in an ever-increasing bandwidth from the computer to the user. Application screens evolved from static text only screens to interactive GUI screens. These screens contain numerous graphical element or "widgets", supporting multiple data types, such as text, voice, image, and video. The widgets can range from simple ones like a combo box or slider to more complicated OCX's such as interactive graphs or maps.On the other hand, the tools to program this application are still in the domain of programmers. Although there has been much progress in various RAD tools, visual language and 4GL to improve ease of use, they still mostly target programmers. We believe that in order to allow end-users to develop their own advanced UI applications, it is necessary to create higher-level application abstractions or 'algebra' for stating the application in a declarative manner. This can be compared to the relational algebra operators in the data base area. They were created as abstractions for data base queries, enabling end users to express their own queries in a declarative manner. In doing so, bugs are minimized and program modifications and maintenance becomes trivial. In this paper, we will motivate the reader to see the need for these abstractions and classify them into categories, emphasizing areas ripe for further research.},

abstract = {The title of the panel implies a walk through on different interfaces based on human-dependent assumptions that may condition their implementation, their application and their usability. The nature of the problems encountered when designing a system that should be used by different classes of users - and therfore must satisfy and facilitate access to information to people having varied skills - is manifold. Nevertheless, by designing user-centered interfaces we are trying to improve the quality of work, reduce memory load, enable the detection and extraction of the required information for making evaluations, taking decisions and smoothly progress along a well-defined path until the project termination.The people in the panel have a wide range of experiences in the broad area of multimedia communication and, more particularly, have worked in different communication domains where the spatial view, the environment and the application determine the features of the interface, in some cases considering management and inventory problems, artistic work, data search and navigation activities, in others restoration (and relative documentation) projects with the possibility of monitoring such projects. In particular, the importance of a small scale prototype to verify some of the basic assumptions, which were established at the beginning of the interface design project, must be strongly considered. The purpose of the panel will be to review and discuss the nature of communication for a given set of environments and cultural patterns, debating the nature of some established guidelines and suggesting new ones while also focusing on the specific applications stemming from Cultural Heritage, where the nature of information is complex and multifold: numerical, textual and pictorial. Likewise, the motivation for the users of the proposed systems may differ from one time period to another, so changing goals, methods and actions to be undertaken by such users according to the present status of the activity. Restoration, classification, documentation and presentation are some of the different functions that are typical of the application we are considering and which will be analyzed by the panelists.},

Our goal is not to define yet another visualization technique but to provide insights for the design of such techniques. Our design approach is based on ergonomic criteria that arose from a study of how the user perceives and manipulates a large information space. We then provide design rules that should help the designer in devising an interaction technique that verifies the ergonomic criteria. After the design of the interaction technique, the next step is software design. We establish links between our design rules/ergonomic criteria and the software architecture model. By applying our PAC-Amodeus model, we show how the software architecture model helps to either verify or assess the ergonomic criteria. We therefore adopt a predictive evaluation approach to the design of interaction techniques for large information spaces. We illustrate our design approach and results through our VITESSE system.},

Instead of just aiming at the technical advantages of such a reduction (i.e. saving computer memory and computational load), this work focuses on clarifying the intention of graphics or animation with the means of abstraction. The goal is to direct the viewer's attention to relevant parts of the graphics, without using metaobjects or - colours (e.g. arrows, blinking objects etc.) and to reduce the probability of distracting the viewer's attention by unimportant details.The paper describes the major problems of this task and provides a knowledge-based solution to yield an intelligent control of the level of detail, improving the expressivity of the graphics or animation and saving computational resources at the same time. To emphasize the plausibility of these ideas the graphical abstraction system ARP is presented and its results are discussed.},

Users specify graphically the point at which these changes occur.Our experience with DataSplash indicates that users find it difficult to construct visualizations that display an appropriate amount of detail. In this paper, we introduce an extension to DataSplash based on the Principle of Constant Information Density. This extension gives users feedback about the density of visualizations as they create them. We also introduce an extension that suggests improvements to existing visualizations.We have performed an informal study of user navigation in applications with and without constant information density. We suggest that designers take density into account when designing applications to avoid biasing user navigation in unexpected ways.},

abstract = {To analyze spatially referenced data, i.e. data referring to geographical objects or locations, one should present them on a map. IRIS is a software system that supports exploration of such data by providing two main services: 1) automated generation of maps and 2) interactive facilities to dynamically manipulate the maps. Automated mapping is enabled by incorporation of generic knowledge on map design. This prevents errors in map design resulting in useless or even misleading presentations. It also helps save users' time and efforts as compared to data visualization with the existing mapping software.Unlike paper maps, a map on the computer screen can dynamically change in response to various interactive manipulations. It is possible to design such interactive operations that will significantly promote data exploration. Within IRIS project we develop for each data presentation method a specific interactive tool that exploits the peculiarities of this method and facilitates fulfilling the analysis tasks the method is best suitable for.Currently researches in automated data visualization design and in dynamic manipulation are developed separately whereas these are two complementary instruments to support data exploration. In this paper we show how we integrate these two instruments in IRIS.},

We discuss two prototypes for navigation tools in Web information spaces in which images are used as the primary means for presenting meta-information about "upcoming" Web pages. The presentation is modeled as a flow of information streaming to the user, and orientation is visualized through positions in ordered sequences.},

We show how adding interactivity can help resolve many of the trade-offs inherent in static visualisations by allowing multiple options to be available and most importantly for them to be interactively related. Many years of creativity and effort have been invested in traditional generic and bespoke visualisations. Adding interactivity leverages this accumulated experience, but also adds an extra dimension.},

The usage of abstract tasks makes application inspection more effective, since it guides the work of evaluators and supports standardization across different evaluators. Our approach is model-based since we use a hypermedia design model (HDM) to identify the constituents of an application that represent the "focus of interest" for the evaluation, to decompose general usability principles into hypermedia-specific attributes, and finally to formulate abstract tasks in a precise way. To show the effectiveness of our method, we discuss the most significant usability problems discovered in eight commercially available hypermedia CD-ROM's.},

abstract = {Dialoging with a synthetic agent is a vast research topic to enhance user-interface friendliness. We present in this paper an on-going project on the simulation of a dialog situation between two synthetic agents. More particularly we focus our interest on finding the appropriate facial expressions of a speaker addressing to different types of listeners (tourist, employee, child, and so on) using various linguistic forms such as request, question, information. Communication between speaker and listener involves multimodal behaviors such as the choice of words, intonation and paralinguistic parameters for the vocal ones; facial expressions, gaze, gesture and body movements for the non-verbal ones. The choice of each individual behavior, their mutual interaction and synchronization produce the richness and subtility of human communication.In order to develop a system that computes automatically the appropriate facial and gaze behaviors corresponding to a communicative act for a given speaker and listener, our first step is to categorize facial expressions and gaze based on their communicative functions rather than on their appearance. The next step is to find inference rules that describe the "mental" process ongoing in the speaker while communicating with the listener. The rules take into account the power relation between speaker and listener and the beliefs the speaker has about the listener to constrain the choice of performative acts.},

abstract = {Interaction designers don't often discuss the aesthetics of movement in digital media. There is no vocabulary nor method---as there is for color and typography---to use in the generation or evaluation of digital compositions. Dewey offers us a philosophical aesthetic towards the communicative experience of art. His abstract theory provides the inspiration to create a practical method for designers of interactive media in a realistic design context. To build the bridge from abstraction to application I have turned to literature that analyzes the aesthetics of movement in visual arts, particularly for vocabularies of both formal and expressive movement qualities. Both vocabularies explore how we map our 3-D kinetic experience to make sense of 2-D qualities in artifacts. Isolated sets of kinetic qualities, as single mappings between experience and formal and expressive movement qualities, are identified. Communication design is comprised of large clusters of these mappings. This method of movement analysis provides the designer with a set of tools to control movement through the manipulation of its properties, both formal and expressive, thereby acting as a conduit that generates the link between designer, artifact, and viewer experience. Building blocks needed to create a communicative system and provide a method for practitioners to analyze and apply movement appropriately in digital compositions are presented. I conclude by briefly sketching how integration might be plausibly gauged by applying the vocabularies to examples of both static and kinetic compositions.},

abstract = {Because of unique temporal and spatial properties of video data, different techniques for summarizing videos have been proposed. Key frames extracted directly from video inform users about content without requiring them to view the entire video. As part of ongoing work to develop video browsing interfaces, several interface displays based on key frames were investigated. Variations on dynamic key frame "slide shows" were examined and compared to a static key frame "filmstrip" display. The slide show mechanism displays key frames in rapid succession and is designed to facilitate visual browsing by exploiting human perceptual capabilities. User studies were conducted in a series of three experiments. Key frame display rate, number of simultaneous displays, and user perception were investigated as a function of user performance in object recognition and gist determination tasks. No significant performance degradation was detected at display rates up to 8 key frames per second, but performance degraded significantly at higher rates. Performance on gist determination tasks degraded less severely than performance on object recognition tasks as display rates increased. Furthermore, gist determination performance dropped significantly between three and four simultaneous slide shows in a single display. Users generally preferred key frame filmstrips to dynamic displays, although objective measures of performance were mixed. Implications for visual interface design and further questions for future research are provided.},

abstract = {Our MultiMedia Visual Information Seeking (MMVIS) environment provides an exploratory visual paradigm for temporal trend analysis. In this paper, we present the results of a user interface study evaluating the utility of MMVIS. We compare MMVIS to a timeline-based approach for analyzing temporal trends in real video data. We evaluate the quantity, complexity and accuracy of temporal trend observations made within each interface, compare the number of positive versus negative trends found, and collect feedback on user satisfaction. Our results show that subjects made interesting and complex observations of temporal trends using either interface. The results also indicate some advantages and biases of each interface, such as 1) timeline subjects make more errors during analysis and 2) timeline subjects are biased against identifying negative trends such as exceptions. At the same time, however, subjects appreciate the familiarity of timelines. Because we designed the MMVIS architecture to provide users with a library of visualizations, we thus include a discussion on enhancing the utility of MMVIS through incorporating a timeline into it in the future.},

We address three fundamental aspects of these kind of systems: information sharing, coordination and multiuser-interface. The proposed approach defines four types of objects. Contents store application data. Containers are dedicated to organise and structure application data. Connections manage group coordination. And, finally, Monitors are concerned with users awareness of cooperative activities. One important characteristic of the approach is that it identifies and maps into the above objects two basic properties of group interaction support: visibility (public/private information) and durability (durable/transient information). The system eases the design of complex group interaction processes because it defines simple actions that allow programmers and users to define and combine object properties. An example of system usage is given for an application that supports brainstorming activities.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the direct manipulation of concept maps. These maps are visually supported by graph-based diagrams. Constraints on nodes, visual attributes and arcs, reflect the syntax and semantic of the underlying conceptual model. Tools allowing the manipulation of concept maps convey these constraints by offering simple feedback hints to user actions. Particular application domains require the use of spatial regions (contexts) to convey equivalence on concept properties or types. In these cases, further restrictions are imposed. Therefore, richer feedback must be supported for effective direct manipulation.The paper proposes an approach to handle spatial contexts in concept maps. The approach provides means to define enhanced feedback on direct manipulation of concepts and relations within and over context boundaries. The technique is based on the separtion of the feedback representations for device and action. It controls their relative distance, mobility and visual attributes. Manipulation of contexts and simultaneous views over contexts are also discussed. Specific behaviors are proposed and a technique to offer coherent views on multiple contexts is presented. The architecture of the system that supports these features is described.},

The system solves the general problem of the remote visualization of dynamic result sets on the Internet using standard and low cost processing architectures. It provides the user with an innovative visual metaphor for the analysis and investigation of the objects presented. Moreover, the system has been designed to provide capabilities which go beyond visualization (e.g. manipulation), and further extensions are possible.

abstract = {A thin client, by definition, have minimal software requirements necessary to function as a user interface front-end for a Web enabled application and raises the issue of client vs. server data visualization rendering. Real-time visual data manipulation doesn't translate well into a "thin" client. While the VRML file format allows distribution of visualization scenes to the Web, the user has no access to the actual underlying data source. The "mapping" of numerical data into geometry format (VRML) takes place at the server side.Local data manipulation, information drill-down technique, context sensitive menus, object picking and other interactive user interface functions that traditionally have been available on the client are now controlled by the visualization server. In the "thin" client model, nearly all functionality is delivered from the server side of the visualization engine while the client perform very simple display and querying functions.Web components and Plug-ins are now being used to overcome some of these limitations. Java allows the creation of "applets" and "JavaBeans" and we have Windows/COM components. These components together with data reduction methods can significantly increase the data interaction between the client application and user, and allow tasks to be executed on the client. Highly interactive user interface tasks are delivered that provide point-and-click navigation through multidimensional data structures. Visual data interfaces such as information drilling, moving a cutting plane through a volume data set etc can be supported.The implication of using a static VRML environment with reduced geometry is compared to sending compressed data to the client and perform interactive client data visualization on a desktop.},

This drawing is interpreted in real time by the system in order to produce the corresponding widget view (i.e. the actual visible GUI) and a graph of abstract objects that represents the GUI structure. This graph can then be easily modified by mixing visual and textual programming in a fully iterative and incremental way. This system is also based on the use of generic objects which are dynamically instantiated into actual widgets according to their structural and functional context. This scheme makes it possible to define very generic GUIs that can then be deeply refined in an efficient way at any stage of the conception process.},
